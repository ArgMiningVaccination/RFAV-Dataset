Reference ID: 4144309 FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION WARNING: RISK OF THYROID C -CELL TUMORS Liraglutide causes dose- dependent and treatment -duration- dependent thyroid C -cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice. It is unknown whether VICTOZA causes thyroid C -cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide -induce d rodent thyroid C -cell tumors has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . VICTOZA is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of VICTOZA and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with VICTOZA [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE VICTOZA is indicated : as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus , to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non- fatal myocardial infarction, or non- fatal stroke) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Limitations of Use : VICTOZA is not a substitute for insulin . VICTOZA should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. The concurrent use of VICTOZA and prandial insulin has not been studied. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Inspect visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles. Inject VICTOZA subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. No dose adjustment is needed if changing t he injection site and /or timing. When using VICTOZA with insulin, administer as separate injections. Never mix. It is acceptable to inject VICTOZA and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other. 2.2 General Dosing and Administration Inject VICTOZA subcutaneously once-daily at any time of day, independently of meals. Initiate VICTOZA with a dose of 0.6 mg per day for one week. The 0.6 mg dose is a starting dose intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms during initial titration, and is not effective for glycemic control. A fter one week at 0.6 mg per day, the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg. If the 1.2 mg dose does not result in acceptable glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg. If a dose is Reference ID: 4144309 missed, resume the once-daily regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Do not administer an extra dose or increase in dose to make up for the missed dose. If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last VICTOZA dose, reinitiate VICTOZA at 0.6 mg to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment. Upon reinitiation, VICTOZA should be titrated at the discretion of the prescriber. 2.3 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin When initiating VICTOZA, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 2.4 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is re commended for patients with renal impairment. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Inject ion: 6 mg/mL solution in a pre- filled, multi-dose pen that delivers doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, or 1.8 mg. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma VICTOZA is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Hypersensitivity VICTOZA is contraindicated in patients with a prior se rious hypersensitivity reaction to VICTOZA or to any of the product components. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with VICTOZA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-c ell Tumors Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and tre atment -duration-dependent thyroid C- cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. Malignant thyroid C- cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether VICTOZA will cause thyroid C -cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C- cell tumors has not be en determined . Cases of MTC in patients treated with VICTOZA have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and VICTOZA use in humans. VICTOZA is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history o f MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of VICTOZA and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness ). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with VICTOZA . Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures , due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated . 5.2 Pancreatitis Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, fatal and non- fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis , has been observed in patients treated with VICTOZA . After initiation of VICTOZA , observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, VICTOZA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, VICTOZA should not be restarted. In glycemic control trials of VICTOZA , there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among VICTOZA -treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with VICTOZA were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a VICTOZA -treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse. VICTOZA has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on VICTOZA. 5.3 Never Share a VICTOZA Pen Between Patients VICTOZA pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen- sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.4 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia Patients receiving VICTOZA in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Renal Impairment VICTOZA has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in animal studies or clinical trials. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsen ing of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in VICTOZA -treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienc ed nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including VICTOZA . Use caution when initia ting or escalating doses of VICTOZA in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphyla ctic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with VICTOZA . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Reference ID: 4144309 VICTOZA ; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Do not use in patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to VICTOZA [see Contraindications (4)]. Anaphylaxis been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with VICTOZA. 5.7 Acute Gallbladder Disease In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] , 3.1% of Victoza-treated patients versus 1.9% of placebo- treated patients reported an acute event of gall bladder disease, such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis . The majority of events required hospitalization or cholecystectomy. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow -up are indicated. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: Risk of Thyroid C- cell Tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common Adverse Reactions The data in Table 1 are derived from 5 glycemic control, placebo -controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. These data reflect exposure of 1673 patients to VICTOZA and a mean duration of exposure to VICTOZA of 37.3 weeks. The mean age of patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54 % were male. The population was 79% White, 6% Black or African American, 13% Asian; 4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 9.1 years and a mean HbA 1c of 8.4%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88.1% and moderately impair ed in 11.9% of the pooled population. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of VICTOZA. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on VICTOZA than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with VICTOZA . Table 1 Adverse reactions reported in 5% of VICTOZA- treated patients Placebo N=661 Liraglutide 1.2 mg N= 645 Liraglutide 1.8 mg N= 1024 Adverse Reaction (%) (%) (%) Nausea 5 18 20 Diarrhea 4 10 12 Headache 7 11 10 Nasopharyngitis 8 9 10 Vomiting 2 6 9 Decreased appetite 1 10 9 Reference ID: 4144309 Dyspepsia 1 4 7 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 6 7 6 Constipation 1 5 5 Back Pain 3 4 5 Cumulative proportion s were calculated combining studies using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel weights In an analysis of placebo- and active -controlled trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of 5 glycemic control, placebo -controlled clinical trials, withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse react ions, occurred in 4.3% of VICTOZA -treated patients and 0.5% of placebo -treated patients. Withdrawal due to gastrointestinal adverse events mainly occurred during the first 2 -3 months of the trials . Injection site reactions Injection site reaction s (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in approximately 2% of VICTOZA -treated patients in the five double-blind, glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of VICTOZA -treated patients discontinued due to injection site re actions . Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person in placebo- controlled trials In 5 glycemic control, placebo -controlled clinical trials of at least 26 weeks duration, hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person for treatment occurred in 8 VICTOZA -treated patients (7.5 events per 1000 patient- years ). Of these 8 VICTOZA- treated patients, 7 patient s were concomitantly using a sulfonylurea.

Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were <1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In glycemic control trials of VICTOZA , the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both VICTOZA- treated and placebo -treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both VICTOZA -treated and placebo -treated patients . In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] , the incidence of cholelithiasis was 1.5% (3.9 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in VICTOZA -treated and 1.1% (2.8 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in placebo- treated patients , both on a background of standard of care . The incidence of acute cholec ystitis was 1.1% (2.9 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) n VICTOZA -treated and 0.7% (1.9 cases per 1000 patient years of observation) in placebo -treated patients. Laboratory Tests Bilirubin In the five glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of VICTOZA -treated patients, 2.1% 3.5% of acti ve-comparator -treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown. Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the en d of the glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in VICTOZA -treated patients compared to placebo -treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among pretreatment calcitonin treated patients, and 0.5% of active- comparator -treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Lipase and Amylase In one glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients , a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for VICTOZA- treated patients while placebo -treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%. Reference ID: 4144309 In the LEADER trial, lipase amylase were routinely measured. Among VICTOZA -treated patients, 7.9% had a lipase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal compared with 4.5% of placebo-treated patients, and 1% of VICTOZA-treated patients had an amylase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal versus 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with VICTOZA is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Vital s igns VICTOZA did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed with VICTOZA compared to placebo. 6.2 Immunogenicity Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, patients treated with VICTOZA may develop anti- liraglutide antibodies. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, the incidence of antibodies to liraglutide cannot be directly compared with the incidence of antibodies of other products. Approximately 50- 70% of VICTOZA -treated patients in five double- blind clinical trials o f 26 weeks duration or longer were tested for the presence of anti- liraglutide antibodies at the end of treatment. Low titers (concentrations not requiring dilution of serum) of anti-liraglutide antibodies were detected in 8.6% of these VICTOZA -treated patients. Cross -reacting -1) patients in the double-blind 52- week monotherapy trial and in 4.8% of the VICTOZA-treated patients in the double-blind 26- week add -on combination therapy trials. These cross -reacting antibodies were not tested for neutralizing effect against native GLP -1, and thus the potential for clinically significant neutralization of native GLP -1 was not assessed. Antibodies that had a neutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay occurred in 2.3% of the VICTOZA -treated patients in the double-blind trial and in 1.0% of the VICTOZA patients in the double -blind 26- week add -on combination therapy trials. Antibody formation was not associated with reduced efficacy of VICTOZA when comparing mean HbA 1c of all antibody-positive and all antibody- negative patients. However, the 3 patients with the highest titers of anti-liraglutide antibodies had no reduction in HbA 1c with VICTOZA treatment. In five double-blind glycemic control trials of VICTOZA , events from a composite of adverse events potentially related to immunogenicity (e.g. urticaria, angioedema) occurred among 0.8% of VICTOZA- treated patients an d among 0.4% of comparator- treated patients. Urticaria accounted for approximately one-half of the events in this composite for VICTOZA -treated patients. Patients who developed anti\u00ad liraglutide antibodies were not more likely to develop events from the immunogenicity events composite than were patients who did not develop anti- liraglutide antibodies. In the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] , anti -liraglutide antibodies were detected in 11 out of the 1247 (0.9%) VICTOZA- treated patients with antibody measurements. Reference ID: 4144309 Of the 11 VICTOZA-treated patients who developed anti -liraglutide antibodies, none were observed to develop neutralizing antibodies to liraglutide , and 5 patients (0.4%) developed cross- reacting antibodies against native GLP -1. 6.3 Post -Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of VICTOZA . Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medullary thyroid carcinoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Dehydration resulting from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 ) and Pati ent Counseling Information (17 )] Increased serum creatinine, acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requir ing hemodialysis. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Pat Counseling Information (17)] Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions. [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Patient Counseling Information (17 )] Allergic reactions : rash and pruritus Acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hepatobiliary disorders: elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, hepatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Oral Medications VICTOZA causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, VICTOZA did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medic ations to any clinically relevant degree. Nonetheless, c aution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with VICTOZA . 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to VICTOZA during pregnancy. VICTOZA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies identified increased adverse developmental outcomes from exposure during pregnancy. Liraglutide exposure was associated with early embryonic deaths and an imbalance in some fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats administered liraglutide during organogenesis at doses that Reference ID: 4144309 approximate clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day. In pregnant rabbits administered liraglutide during organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of major fetal abnormalities were seen at exposures below the human exposures at the MRHD [see Animal Data] . The estima ted background risk of major birth defects for women with uncontrolled pre- gestational diabetes (Hemoglobin A 1C >7) is 6 to 10%. The major birth defect rate has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a Hemoglobin A 1C >10. In the U.S. gener al population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2- 4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease -associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabe tes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre \u00ad eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth and delivery complications due to fetal macrosomia (e.g., perineal injury and lacerations, need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, oral clefts, still birth, macrosomia morbidity (e.g., brachial plexus injury, hypoxia), and neonatal hyperglyce mia. Animal Data Female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide beginning 2 weeks before mating through gestation day 17 had estimated systemic exposures 0.8-, 3-, and 11- times the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. The number of early embryonic deaths in the 1 mg/kg/day group increased slightly. Fetal abnormalities and variations in kidneys and blood vessels, irregular ossification of the skull, and a more complete state of ossi fication occurred at all doses. Mottled liver and minimally kinked rib s occurred at the highest dose. The incidence of fetal malformations in liraglutide -treated groups exceed ing concurrent and historical controls were misshapen oropharynx and/or narrow ed opening into larynx at 0.1 mg/kg/day and umbilical hernia at 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg/day. Pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through day 18 inclusive, had estimated systemic exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day at all doses, based on plasma AUC. Liraglutide decreased fetal weight and dose- dependently increased the incidence of total major fetal abnormalities at all doses. The incidence of malformations exceeded concurrent and historical controls at 0.01 mg/kg/day (kidneys, scapula), 0.01 mg/kg/day (eyes, forelimb), 0.025 mg/kg/day (brain, tail and sacral vertebrae, major blood vessels and heart, umbilicus), 0.025 mg/kg/day (sternum) and at 0.05 mg/kg/day (parietal bones, major blood vessels). Irregular ossification and/or skeletal abnormalities occurred in the skull and jaw, vertebrae and ribs, sternum, pelvis, tail, and scapula; and dose-dependent minor skeletal variations were observed. Visceral abnormalities occurred in blood vessels, lung, liver, and esophagus. Bilobed or bifurcated gallbladder was seen in all treatment groups , but not in the control group. In preg nant female rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide from gestation day 6 through weaning or termination of nursing on lactation day 24, estimated systemic exposures were 0.8-, 3-, and 11-times human exposure at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day, based on plasma AUC. A slight delay in parturition was observed in the majority of treated rats. Group mean body weight of neonatal rats from liraglutide -treated dams was lower than neonatal rats from control group dams . Reference ID: 4144309 Bloody scabs and agitated behavior occurred in male rats descended from dams treated with 1 mg/kg/day liraglutide. Group mean body weight from birth to postpartum day 14 trended lower in F 2 generation rats descended from liraglutide- treated rats compared to F2 generation rats descended from controls, but differences did not reach statistical significance for any group. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of VICTOZA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Liraglutide was present in milk of lactating rats [see Data] . Developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VICTOZA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed in fant from VICTOZA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data In lactating rats , liraglutide was present unchanged in milk at concentrations approximately 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of VICTOZA have not been established in pediatric patients. VICTOZA is not recommended for use in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the VICTOZA treatment arms of the glycemic control trials , a total of 832 (19.3%) of the patients were 65 to 74 years of age and 145 (3.4%) were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In the VICTOZA treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] , a total of 1738 (37.2%) patients were 65 to 74 years of age, 401 (8.6%) were 75 to 84 years of age, and 17 (0.4%) were 85 years of age or older at baseline. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of VICTOZA is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The safety and efficacy of VICTOZA was evaluated in a 26- week clinical study that included patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m 2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1 )]. In the VICTOZA treatment arm of the LEADER trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] , 1932 (41.4%) patients had mild renal impairment, 999 (2 1.4%) patients had moderate renal impairment and 117 (2. 5%) patients had severe renal impairment at baseline. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were seen in these patients compared to patients with normal renal function. There is limited experience with VICTOZA in patients with end stage renal disease. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Use caution in patients who experience dehydratio n. Reference ID: 4144309 8.7 Hepatic Impairmen t There is limited experience in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, VICTOZA should be used with caution in this patient population. No dose adjustment of VICTOZA is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical (12.3)] . 8.8 Gastroparesis VICTOZA slows gastric emptying. VICTOZA has not been studied in patients with pre- existing gastroparesis. 10 OVERDOSAGE Overdoses have been rep orted in clinical trials and post-marketing use of VICTOZA . Effects have included severe nausea and severe vomiting. In the event of overdosage, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms. 11 DESCRIPTION VICTOZA contains liraglutide, an analog of human GLP -1 and as a GLP -1 receptor agonist . The peptide precursor of liraglutide, produced by a process that includes expression of recombinant DNA in Saccharomyc es cerevisiae, has been engi neered to be 97% homologous to native human GLP- 1 by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. Liraglutide is made by attaching a C -16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the pept ide precursor . The molecular formula of liraglutide is C 172H265N43O51 and the molecular weight is 3751.2 Daltons. The structural formula (Figure 1) is: Figure 1 Structural Formula of liraglutide VICTOZA is a clear, colorless or almost colo rless solution. Each 1 m L of VICTOZA solutio n contains 6 mg of liraglutide and the inactive ingredients: 5.5 mg; and water for injection. Each pre -filled pen contains a 3 mL solution of VICTOZA equivalent to 18 mg liraglutide (free -base, anhydrous). 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of human Liraglutide increases intracellular c yclic AMP (cAMP) leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose Reference ID: 4144309 concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. Liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose- dependent manner . The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a delay in gastric emptying. GLP-1(7-37) has a half -life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endog enous enzyme s, dipeptidyl peptidase Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half -life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once daily administration, is a result of self -association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP -IV and NEP. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics VICTOZA 's pharmaco dynamic profile is consistent with its pharmacokinetic profile observed after single subcutaneous administration as VICTOZA lowered fasting, premeal and postprandial glucose throughout the day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Fasting and postprandial glucose was measured before and up to 5 hours after a standardized meal after treatment to steady state with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg VICTOZA or placebo. Compared to placebo, the postprandial plasma glucose AUC 0-300min was 35% lower after VICTOZA 1.2 mg and 38 % lower after VICTOZA 1.8 mg. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion The effect of a single dose of 7.5 mcg /kg (~ 0. 7 mg) VICTOZA on insulin secretion rates (ISR) was investigated in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes during graded glucose infusion. In these patients, on average, the ISR response was increased in a glucose-dependent manner (Figure 2). Figure 2 Mean Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) versus Glucose Concentration Following Single -Dose VICTOZA 7.5 mcg/kg (~ 0.7 mg) or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (N=10) During Graded Glucose Infusion Glucagon secretion Reference ID: 4144309 VICTOZA lowered blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A single dose of VICTOZA 7.5 mcg /kg (~ 0. 7 mg) did not impair glucagon response to low glucose concentrations. Gastric emptying VICTOZA causes a delay of gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which post prandial glucose appear s in the circulation. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of VICTOZA on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study. VICTOZA at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption - Following subcutaneous administration, ma ximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 8-12 hours post dosing. The mean peak (C max) and total (AUC) exposures of liraglutide were 35 ng/mL and 960 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively, for a subcutaneous single dose of 0.6 mg. After subcutaneous single dos e administrations, C max and AUC of liraglutide increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg. At 1.8 mg VICTOZA , the average steady state concentration of liraglutide over 24 hours was approximately 128 ng/mL. AUC 0- was eq uivalent between upper arm and abdomen, and between upper arm and thigh. AUC 0- from thigh was 22% lower than that from abdomen. However, liraglutide exposures were considered comparable among these three subcutaneous injection sites. Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. Distribution -The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of VICTOZA 0.6 mg is approximately 1 3 L. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of VICTOZA is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Metabolism - During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide . Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination. Elimination -Following a [ 3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide -related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively). The majority of urine and feces radioactivity w as excreted during the first 6 -8 days. The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 1.2 L/h with an elimination half -life of approximately 13 hours, making VICTOZA suitable for once daily administration . Specific Populations Elderly - Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of VICTOZA based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyse s of patients 18 to 80 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 )]. Gender -Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 25% lower weight - adjusted clearance of VICTOZA compared to males . Based on the exposure response data, no dose adjustment is necessary based on gender . Reference ID: 4144309 Race and Ethnicity - Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of VICTOZA based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included Caucasian , Black, Asian and Hispanic/Non- Hispanic subjects. Body Weight -Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of VICTOZA based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of VICTOZA provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40 - 160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight >160 kg. Pediatric -VICTOZA has not been studied in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Renal Impairment - The single -dose pharmacokinetics of VICTOZA were evaluated in subjects with varyi ng degrees of renal impairment. Subjects with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 -80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end -stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compar ed to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moder ate, and severe renal impairment and in end- stage renal disease was on average 35 %, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific (8.6)] . Hepatic Impairment - The single -dose pharmacokinetics of VICTOZA were evaluated in subjects with varyin g degree s of hepatic impairment. Subjects with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score > 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial. Compar ed to healthy subjects , liraglutide AUC in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Drug Interactions In vitro assessment of drug-drug interactions VICTOZA has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. In vivo assessment of drug-drug interactions The drug -drug interaction studie s were performed at steady state with VICTOZA 1.8 mg/day. Before administration of concomitant treatment , subjects underwent a 0.6 mg weekly dose increase to reach the maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day . Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that C max of VICTOZA (8-12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of VICTOZA at steady state. The concomitant administration with VICTOZA resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; C max decreased by 31%. Digoxin median time to maximal con centration (T max) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of VICTOZA at steady state. The co -administration with VICTOZA resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; C max decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median T max was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with VICTOZA . Atorvastatin Reference ID: 4144309 VICTOZA did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of VICTOZA at steady state. Atorvastatin C max was decreased by 38% and median T max was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with VICTOZA . Acetaminophen VICTOZA did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg , administered 8 hours after the dose of VICTOZA at steady state. Acetaminophen C max was decreased by 31% and median Tmax was delayed up to 15 minutes . Griseofulvin VICTOZA did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with VICTOZA at steady state. Griseofulvin C max increased by 37% while median Tmax did not change. Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of VICTOZA at steady state. VICTOZA lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel C max by 12% and 13%, respectively. There was no effect of VICTOZA on the overall exposure (AUC) of levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between VICTOZA and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit /kg (single -dose) and VICTOZA 1.8 mg ( steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagen esis, Impairment of Fe rtility A 104- week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female CD -1 mice at doses of 0.03, 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection yielding systemic exposures 0.2-, 2-, 10- and 45-times the human exposure, respectively, at the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day based on plasma AUC comparison. A dose- related increase in benign thyroid C -cell adenomas was seen in the 1.0 and the 3.0 mg/kg /day groups with incidences of 13% and 19% in 6% and 20% in females, respectively . C-cell adenomas did not occur in control groups or 0.03 and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. Treatment -related malignant C -cell carcinomas occurred in 3% of females in the 3.0 mg/kg/da y group. Thyroid C- cell tumors are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in mice. A treatment- related increase in fibrosarcomas was seen on the dorsal skin and subcutis, the body surface used for drug injection, in males in the 3 mg/kg/day group . These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the clinical formulation (6 mg/mL) is 10- times higher than the concentration in the formulation used to administer 3 mg/kg/day liraglutide to mice in the carcinogenicity study (0.6 mg/mL). A 104- week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0.075, 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide administered by bolus subcutaneous injection with exposures 0.5-, 2- and 8- times the human exposure, respectively, resulting from the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison. A treatment-related increase in benign thyroid C- cell adenomas was seen in males in 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/day liraglutide groups with incidences of 12%, 16%, in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. A treatment -related increase in malignant thyroid C- cell carcinomas was observed in all male liraglutide -treated groups with incidences of 2%, 8%, 6%, and 14% and in females mg/kg/day with incidences of 0%, 0%, 4%, and 6% in 0 (control), 0.075, 0.25, and 0.75 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. Th yroid C- cell carcinomas are rare findings during carcinogenicity testing in rats. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide -induced C-cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP-1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activation of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto\u00ad oncogene in thyroid C- cells. Human relevance of thyroid C -cell tumors in mice and rats is unknown and has not be en determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Liraglutide was negative with and without metabolic activation in the Ames test for mutagenicity and in a human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test for clastogenicity. Liraglutide was negative in repeat -dose in vivo micronucle us tests in rats. In rat fertility studies using subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg/day liraglutide , males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation da y 17. No direct adverse effects on male fertility was observed at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day, a high dose yielding a n estimated systemic exposure 11 -times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC. In female rats, an increase in early embryonic deaths occurred at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain and food consumption were observed in females at the 1.0 mg/kg/day dose. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In glycemic control trials, VICTOZA has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral anti-diabetic medications or basal insulin. VICTOZA was also studied in a cardiovascular outcomes trial (LEADER trial). In each of the placebo controlled trials, treatment with VICTOZA produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A 1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. All VICTOZA -treated patients started at 0.6 mg /day. The dose was increased in weekly intervals by 0.6 mg to reach 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg for patients randomized to these higher doses. VICTOZA 0.6 mg is not effective for glycemic control and is intended only as a starting dose to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Monotherapy In this 52- week trial, 746 patients were randomized to VICTOZA 1.2 mg, VICTOZA 1.8 mg, or glimepiride 8 mg. Patients who were randomized to glimepiride were initially treated with 2 mg daily for two weeks, increasing to 4 mg daily for another two weeks, and finally increasing to 8 mg daily. Treatment with VICTOZA 1.8 mg and 1.2 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to glimepiride (Table 3). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective Reference ID: 4144309 therapy was 3.6% in the VICTOZA 1.8 mg treatment group, 6.0% in the VICTOZA 1.2 mg treatment group, and 10.1% in the glimepiride- treatment group. The mean age of participants was 53 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Participants were 49.7 % male, 77.5% White , 12.6% Black or African American and 35.0% of Hispanic ethnicity . The mean BMI was 33.1 kg/m2.

Randomization occurred after a 6-week run-in period consisting of a 3-week initial forced metformin titration period followed b y a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin were increased up to 2000 mg/day. Treatment with VICTOZA 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add -on to metformin resulted in a significant mean HbA 1c reduction relative to placebo add-on to metformin and resulted in a similar mean HbA 1c reduction relative to glimepiride 4 mg add -on to metformin ( Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 5.4% in the VICTOZA 1.8 mg + metformin treatment group, 3.3% in the VICTOZA 1.2 mg + metformin treatment gr oup, 23.8% in the placebo + metformin treatment gro up, and 3.7% in the glimepiride + metformin treated group. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 7 years. Participants were 58.2% male, 87.1% White and 2.4% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 31.0 kg/m2.

Patients were to continue their current treatment on metformin at a stable, pre -trial dose level and dosing frequency. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Participants were 52.9% male, 86.6% White, 7.2% Black or African American and 16.2% of Hispanic ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.8 kg/m 2. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA 1c from baseline to Week 26. Treatment with VICTOZA 1.2 mg and VICTOZA 1.8 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c relative to sitagliptin 100 mg (Table 5). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.1% in the VICTOZA 1.2 mg group, 0.5% in the VICTOZA 1.8 mg treatment group, and 4.1% in the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group. From a mean baseline body weight of 94 kg, t here was a mean reduction of 2.7 kg for VICTOZA 1.2 mg, 3.3 kg for VICTOZA 1.8 mg, and 0.8 kg for sitagliptin 100 mg.

Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea t hen all patients entered a 12 -week run -in period during which they received add -on therapy with VICTOZA titrated to 1.8 mg once- daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patien ts (50%) achieved HbA 1c <7% VICTOZA 1.8 mg and metformin and continued tr eatment in a non - randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run -in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] HbA (33% of those who entered the run -in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once- daily insulin detemir administered in the evening as add -on therapy (N=162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with VICTOZA 1.8 m g and metformin (N=161). The starting dose of insulin detemir was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26 week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with VICTOZA 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with insulin detemir . The mean age of participants was 57 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 55.7% male, 91.3% White, 5.6% Black or African American and 12.5% of Hispanic ethnicity. The mean BMI was 34.0 kg/m 2. Reference ID: 4144309 Treatment with insulin detemir as add -on to VICTOZA 1.8 mg + metformin resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c and FPG compared to continued, unchanged treatment with VICTOZA 1.8 mg + metformin alone (Table 6). From a mean baseline body weight of 9 6 kg after rand omization , there was a mean reduction of 0.3 kg in the patients who received insulin detemir add-on therapy compared to a mean reduction of 1.1 kg in the patients who continued on unchanged treatment with VICTOZA 1.8 mg + metformin alone.

Randomization occurred after a 4-week run-in of an initial, 2-week , forced -glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 2 weeks. During the titration period, doses of glimepiride were increased to 4 mg/day. The doses of glimepiride could be reduced (at the discretion of the investigator) from 4 mg/day to 3 mg/day or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization, in the event of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. Participants were 49.4% male, 64.4% White and 2.8% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 29.9 kg/m 2. Treatment with VICTOZA 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as add -on to glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA 1c compared to placebo add -on to glimepiride (Table 7). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 3.0% in the VICTOZA 1.8 mg + glimepiride treatment group, 3.5% in the VICTOZA 1.2 mg + glimepiride treatment grou p, 17.5% in the placebo + glimepiride treatment group, and 6.9% in the rosiglitazone + glimepiride treatment group.

Randomization took place after a 6- week run-in period consisting of a 3-week forc ed metformin and glimepiride titration period followed by a maintenance period of another 3 weeks. During the titration period, doses of metformin and glimepiride were to be increased up to 2000 mg/day and 4 mg/day, respectively. After randomization, patients randomized to VICTOZA 1.8 mg underwent a 2 week pe riod of titration with VICTOZA . During the trial, the VICTOZA and metformin doses were fixed, although glimepiride and insulin glargine doses could be adjusted. Patients titrated glargine twice -weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment based on self- measured fasting plasma glucose on the day of titration. After Week 8, the frequency of insulin glargine titration was left to the discretion of the investigator, but, at a minimum, the glargine dose was to be revised, if necessary, at Weeks 12 and 18. Only 20% of glargine- treated patients achieved the pre\u00ad specified target fasting plasma glucose of 100 mg/dL. Therefore, optimal titration of the insulin glargine dose was not achieved in most patients. The mean age of participants was 58 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 9 years. Partici pants were 56.5% male, 75.0% White and 3.6% Black or African American. The mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2. Treatment with VICTOZA as add -on to glimepiride and metformin resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo add-on to glimepiride and metformin (Table 8). The percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 0.9% in the VICTOZA 1.8 mg + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, 0.4% in the insulin glargine + metformin + glimepiride treatment group, and 11.3% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treat ment group.

VICTOZA was added to the patient's stable pre- trial antidiabetic regimen (insulin therapy and/or metformin, pioglitazone, or sulfonylurea ). The dose of VICTOZA was escalated according to approved labeling to achieve a dose of 1.8 mg per day. The i nsulin dose was reduced by 20% at randomization for patients with baseline HbA 1c 8% and fixed until liraglutide dose escalation was complete. Dose reduction of insulin and SU was allowed in case of hypoglycemia; up titration of insulin was allowed but not beyond the pre -trial dose. The mean age of participants was 67 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Participants were 50.5% male , 92.3% White , 6.6% Black or African American , and 7.2% of Hispanic ethnicity . The mean BMI was 33.9 kg/m2. Approximately half of patients had an eGFR between 30 and <45mL/min /1.73 m2. Treatment with VICTOZA resulted in a statistically significant reductio n in HbA 1c from baseline at Week 26 compared to placebo (see Table 11 ). 123 patients reached the 1.8 mg dose of VICTOZA.

In this study, 9340 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to VICTOZA 1.8 mg or placebo for a median duration of 3.5 years . The study compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events between VICTOZA and placebo when these were added to, and used concomitantly with, background standard of care treatments for type 2 diabetes . The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three part composite outcome which included; cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non- fatal stroke. Patients eligible to enter the trial were; 50 years of age or older and had established , stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or NYHA class II and III heart failure ( 80% of the enrolled population) or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease ( 20% of the enrolled population). At baseline, demographic and disease characteristics were balanced. The mean age was 64 years and the population wa s 64.3% male, 77.5% Caucasian, 10.0% Asian, and 8.3% Black. In the study, 12.1% of the population identified as Hispanic or Latino . The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 12.8 years, the mean HbA1c was 8.7% and the mean BMI was 32.5 kg/m2. A history of previous myocardial infarction was reported in 31% of randomized individuals, a prior revas cularization procedure in 39%, a prior ischemic stroke in 11%, documented symptomatic coronary disease in 9%, documented asymptomatic cardiac ischemia in 26% , and a diagnosis of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I I to III heart failure in 14%. T he mean eGFR at baseline was 79 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 41.8% of patients had mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73m2), 20.7% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m2) and 2.4% of patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2). At baseline, patients treated their diabetes with; diet and exercise only (3.9%), oral antidiabetic drugs only (51.5%), oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin (36.7%) or insulin only (7.9%). The most common background antidiabetic drugs used at baseline and in the trial were metformin , sulfonylurea and insulin . Use and other GLP -1 receptor agonists was excluded by protocol and SGLT-2 inhibitors were either not approved or not widely available. At baseline, cardiovascular disease and risk factors were managed with ; non- During the trial, investigators could modify anti- diabetic and cardiovascular medications to achieve local standard of care treatment targets with respect to blood glucose, lipid, and blood pressure, and manage patients recovering from an acute coronary syndrome or stroke event per local treatment guidelines . For the primary analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non- inferiority against the pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and to test for superiority on MACE if non-inferiority was demonstrated. Type 1 error was controlled across mult iple tests. Reference ID: 4144309 VICTOZA significantly reduced the time to first occurrence of MACE . The estimated hazard ratio (95% CI) for time to first MACE was 0.87 (0.78, 0.97). Refer to Figure 5 and Table 12. Vital status was available for 99.7% of subjects in the trial. A total of 828 deaths were recorded during the LEADER trial. A majority of the deaths in the trial were categorized as cardiovascular deaths and non-cardiovascular deaths were balanced between the treatment groups (3.5% in patients treated with VICTOZA and 3.6% in patients treated with placebo). The estimated hazard ratio of time to all- cause death for VICTOZA compared to placebo was 0.85 (0.74, 0.97).

Risk of Thyroid C- cell Tumors Inform p atients that liraglutide causes benign and malignant thyroid C -cell tumors in mice and rats and that the human relevance of this finding has not been determined. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Dehydration and Renal Failure Advise patients treated with VICTOZA of the potential risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions an d to take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Inform p atients of the potential risk for worsening renal function, which in some cases may require dialysis . Pancreatitis Inform p atients of the potential risk for pancreatitis. Explain that persistent severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to discontinue VICTOZA promptly and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Acute Gallbladder Disease Inform p atients of the potential risk for cholelithiasis or cholecystitis . Instruct p atients to contact their physician if cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is suspected for appropriate clinical follow-up. Reference ID: 4144309 Never Share a VICTOZA Pen Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share a VICTOZA pen with another person, even if the needle is changed, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.
