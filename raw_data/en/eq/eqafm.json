Michael Wilson, Vice-Chair, CAMH Foundation's Board of Directors In February, we lost one of our first and most vocal advocates for mental health with the passing of the Honourable Michael Wilson, Vice-Chair of CAMH Foundation's Board of Directors. For more than two decades, Michael had bravely and openly shared the story of his son's death by suicide. He made it one of his life's missions to bring mental illness out of the shadows and to eliminate prejudice and discrimination. He was one of a kind. He led our earliest fundraising efforts and worked to increase awareness and understanding of mental illness. Michael cared deeply for his community and his country; his humanity and integrity were a beacon for us all. It's impossible to overstate his contribution to Canada, to the cause of mental health, and to all of the lives he touched. With his passing, Canada has lost a statesman, an advocate and a dear friend, but the conversations he ignited will continue. His message is echoed in the simple but powerful statement that \"Mental Health is Health.\" His vision will continue to live on through the Michael Wilson Society, a group of forward-thinking leaders and champions of mental health committed to advancing research and treatment while addressing the stigma associated with mental illness.An advocate, a statesman and a friend \"\"annual report 2018-2019 | 3 Dr. Catherine Zahn President & CEO CAMH Deborah Gillis President & CEO CAMH FoundationDavid Wilson Chair, Board of Trustees CAMHJamie Anderson Chair, Board of Directors CAMH FoundationIn 2018, CAMH celebrated 20 years of progress with a call to action: #MentalHealthIsHealth. Since we launched the campaign, Canadians have shared their stories: the barriers to care and supports they've experienced; the wait lists faced by youth; the frustrations of family members who work to navigate a disjointed system for their loved ones. We've opened the conversation and built awareness and understanding of mental disorders, but we are just getting started. Mental illness is the leading cause of disability worldwide. In Canada, 11 people die by suicide each day. Our health care system must have mental health care at its centre. Funding in the sector falls short of the burden of illness. For too long, we've cobbled together a spectrum of care venues and providers that lacks coordination, continuity or collaboration. Fundamental to our academic mission, we are committed to research and innovation, education and knowledge transfer - toward transforming the lives of patients today and tomorrow, locally and globally. Toward social change, we are promoting mental health as the next frontier of inclusion and creating health care system capacity to build healthy families, communities and cities. During our campaign, we asked provocative questions to encourage conversation. Why do some illnesses get treatment while others get judgment? Is universal health care really universal if it doesn't include mental health? Is a sick day really a sick day if no one believes you're sick? The CAMH response to these questions is a demand for equity. We call for parity when it comes to mental illness. It's only right that our patients have access to integrated care in our publicly funded health care system. People with mental illness deserve a clear pathway to care and hope for recovery. That's the change that will lead to a world where everyone believes that life is worth living.

The program is bringing resources for students right into schools to help young people feel more comfortable talking about mental health, seeking help for themselves and supporting friends in need. \"One goal is to reduce stigma through outreach in schools,\" explains Karleigh Darnay, who co-ordinated a team of 14 Youth Advisors to ensure the program included the voices of young people. \"We want to encourage young people to reach out for support if they need it and also to help them understand how to have these conversations.\" Game Changers is supported by a $1.25-million grant from the HBC Foundation. The people who turn to us for mental health care need us to speak out. We can't be silent. They are counting on us. Working with patients, families, philanthropists and our partners in government and workplaces, we are advocating for a world where mental health is treated the same as physical health. As Canada's largest provider of mental health care, we're committed to eliminating the gap between mental and physical health. We have accomplished so much but we're nowhere near finished. There is so much more to do.The power of advocacy Karleigh Darnay, a CAMH Youth Engagement Coordinator, speaks to the media at the Game Changers launch.annual report 2018-2019 | 7 Thanks to a partnership between Shoppers Drug Mart and CAMH Foundation, CAMH's Provincial Systems Support Program has created an interactive toolkit to help address the unique mental health needs of women. \"We know gender is a key determinant of mental health,\" says Dr. Branka Agic, Director of Knowledge Exchange with PSSP . \"Women have higher rates of depression and generalized anxiety disorder than men.\" PSSP promoted the toolkit - the first of a number of initiatives as part of the partnership - at a number of public SHOPPERS LOVE.YOU. events across the province, including the Run for Women, which promotes physical and mental health. \"Twenty years ago, the restructuring commission made a decision to integrate mental illness and addiction services under one roof and to transform the Queen Street site, leading to the creation of CAMH. We're very grateful for that vision - it has enabled a revolution in mental health care,\" says Dr. Catherine Zahn.For over a decade, Gifts of Light has helped CAMH patients develop the skills and confidence they need for life in the community beyond CAMH. Last year, Gifts of Light supported more than 13,000 patients through 4,500 gifts, 48 special events and 4,000 hours of activities \u2014 art classes, drum groups, cooking classes and more. The program is a shining example of how kindness can transform lives. \"Gifts of Light helped me out a lot,\" says Brian Robert, a CAMH patient who benefitted from the program. \"When you come to CAMH, it's a very safe feeling \u2014 a place of caring and giving.\" Meshach Harvey \u2014 aka MC Shackalacka - performs at the Gifts of Light Holiday Kick-Off in November 2018 as part of the Mindful MCs.

We're embedding research into virtually everything we do, empowering all staff and patients to participate in our leading-edge studies. The Discovery Fund is helping us improve engagement, capacity and alignment to maximize our impact. We're showing promise in reversing the cognitive problems linked to depression and aging with new therapeutic molecules developed at CAMH, ultimately setting the stage for targeting these symptoms in depression for the first time and potentially delaying the onset of such illnesses as Alzheimer's disease. \"The aged cells regrew to appear the same as young brain cells, showing that our novel molecules can modify the brain in addition to improving symptoms,\" says Dr. Etienne Sibille, Deputy Director of CAMH's Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute.Leading research CAMH is set to revolutionize mental health care. We are supporting our experts to advance new preventions and treatments for mental illness. We're working together - across disciplines and centres within CAMH; with patients, their families and the community; with experts across the globe - to revolutionize our understanding of the brain and close the gap in mental health research.Through the Discovery Fund, we aim to lower suicide rates, reduce disability and create improved outcomes for people with serious mental illness.

Yani Hamdani and Meng-Chuan Lai are studying girls and women with autism. Modern \"big data\" and artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to truly transform mental health. The BrainHealth Databank initiative is working collaboratively with teams across CAMH to ensure high-quality, standardized research and clinical data are integrated and accessible to drive life-changing research at CAMH and beyond. This searchable knowledge base of integrated data will enable the application of modern large-scale data analytics, visualization and machine learning techniques with the potential for major impacts on mental health care, research, education and policy. \"The BrainHealth Databank empowers interdisciplinary teamwork, which engages patients, clinicians, data engineers, neuroinformaticians, analysts, privacy, ethics and researchers to accelerate discovery and innovation, transform care, clinical practice, and ultimately, improve mental health outcomes,\" says Dr. Sean Hill, Director of the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics. We're developing innovative natural dietary supplements to prevent post-partum depression by targeting specific brain cells. \"We believe ours is the first study to show such a strong, beneficial effect in reducing the baby blues at a time when postpartum sadness peaks,\" says Dr. Jeffrey Meyer, who holds a Canada Research Chair in the Neurochemistry of Major Depression. Dr. Neil Vasdev, Director of the Azrieli Centre for Neuro-RadiochemistryWorking with CAMH's Wallace and Margaret McCain Centre for Child, Youth & Family Mental Health and the Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Drs. Yani Hamdani and Meng-Chuan Lai are examining the health care experiences of girls and women with autism to improve their diagnosis and treatment. At the Azrieli Centre for Neuro-Radiochemistry, we are developing the radiotracers crucial to showing nerve interactions in the human brain with brain imaging. New and longer living tracers will allow us to better understand the mechanics of degenerative disorders. The work is funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, and sees the Azrieli Centre working with the Yale PET Centre in the U.S.10 | camh & camh foundation Supported by CAMH's Discovery Fund, Dr. Lena Quilty is testing what she hopes is a more accessible, cost-effective way to treat people with substance use disorder online. \"This study is a crucial step in bringing computer-based cognitive behaviour therapy to the patients who urgently need treatments for substance use disorder,\" she says.A CAMH-developed model to treat the agitation and aggression experienced by more than 80% of people with Alzheimer's disease is being tested at 7 sites across CanadaThe best care for patients today \u2014 and tomorrow Dr. Lena Quiltyannual report 2018-2019 | 11A CAMH team led by Dr. Nigel Turner is developing an Internet-based intervention for problem gambling. The project is a joint effort between the Institute of Mental Health Policy Research and the Gambling, Gaming, and Technology Use teams at CAMH, and could help eliminate barriers \u2014 geographic and otherwise \u2014 to treatment access. A CAMH-developed model to treat the agitation and aggression experienced by more than 80 per cent of people with Alzheimer's disease is being tested at seven sites across Canada, thanks to support from Brain Canada and the Centre for Aging and Brain Health Innovation. \"There's been an improvement in the management of aggression and agitation in our patients,\" says Dr. Peter Derkach, Medical Director at the Ukrainian Canadian Care Centre, which participated in the pilot study. In related efforts, a CAMH team is using brain stimulation to better understand why some people with Alzheimer's disease experience agitation. The findings could lead to the development of a new, safe and effective treatment for this population.In a collaboration led by the Slaight Family Centre for Youth in Transition, we are working with service users, family members, policy makers, researchers, clinicians and administrators across the province to launch NAVIGATE, a new early psychosis intervention program, in four communities across Ontario. The project is supported by a $1.5-million grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research, with matching funds from CAMH's PSSP , Project ECHO Ontario Mental Health and CAMH Foundation. \"With its focus on recovery, this coordinated care model is so important,\" said Lillian Duda, a Family Advisory Committee member whose son was hospitalized twice with psychosis in his teens.Set in North America's fourth-largest city with a diverse population, CAMH is the best place to develop the mental health care of tomorrow while caring for the patients of today. We support people across the lifespan, from children to older adults with a wide range of illnesses. Through clinical research, we provide access to the latest treatments while building the evidence needed to make these treatments standard. Lillian DudaFindings could lead to the development of a new safe and effective treatment. \" \"12 | camh & camh foundation Connecting people with care Recovery from mental illness is achievable when people have access to the best evidence- based treatments when they need them. We are committed to streamlining the way people access mental health care by developing programs and services that address the growing demand for acute services. We are quickly connecting people with care that meets their needs; driving research aimed at preventing people from falling through the cracks and we are developing and testing new models that will improve access across the province and beyond.We have opened a new 23-bed inpatient unit to help relieve pressures on CAMH's Gerald Sheff & Shanitha Kachan Emergency Department while meeting the growing need for acute care. The unit emphasizes treatment for patients with both mental illness and addiction, and engages patients in therapeutic programming. \"This new unit is going to transform patients' lives,\" says Joselin Lai, a CAMH social worker and the first person hired for the unit. We have launched a streamlined outpatient service for addiction and other psychiatric disorders called COMPASS that connects people with the best services for them in as quickly as one day. Personalized medical and psychosocial interventions are delivered by a multi-disciplinary team that includes addiction medicine specialists, psychiatrists, nurses, psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists and occupational therapists. \"By streaming patients through COMPASS, we are helping create a better experience for patients that minimizes duplication and standardizes care for addiction and concurrent disorders,\" says COMPASS Manager Shannon Greene.annual report 2018-2019 | 13 Dr. Kristin Cleverley is working to transform the way young people with mental illness transition into and out of adult services. \"Young people are falling through the cracks,\" says Dr. Cleverley, a senior scientist with the McCain Centre. Her work \u2014 the first studies of their kind in Canada \u2014 is supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and involves two hospitals (CAMH and SickKids) and two community mental health agencies (George Hull Centre and SickKids Centre for Community Mental Health).CAMH continues to build on its success in collaborating with community partners to provide mental health care to young people in community hubs. Backed by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and other donors, CAMH is working with other organizations in Toronto to study the effectiveness of the community hub model as provincial, national and international efforts to build such service hubs are underway.CAMH and partners are testing an integrated youth services model of care. Dr. Kristin Cleverley 14 | camh & camh foundation Helping people reach their full potentialWe have made tremendous progress in our efforts to improve the lives of people with a wide range of illnesses. We are developing and testing new techniques in brain stimulation that are giving hope to people with the most difficult-to-treat depression. We are exploring the use of wearable technology to predict and ultimately prevent relapse, and we're developing apps to help young people regain control of their lives. Dr. Daniel Blumberger, Co-Director of the Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, worked with researchers at the University Health Network and the University of British Columbia to complete the largest brain stimulation study of it's kind. The team found that a three-minute version of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was as effective as the standard 37-minute version for hard-to-treat depression. This could allow more than triple the number of people to be treated. \"rTMS has changed my life in so many ways,\" says study participant Shelley Hofer. \"Because of CAMH and this treatment, I know what my future looks like now.\" rTMS is demonstrated on an arm while treatment participant Shelley Hofer looks on. annual report 2018-2019 | 15 Dr. Nicole KozloffCAMH is working with Trillium Health Partners and SickKids to provide young people experiencing first- episode psychosis with the holistic care they need. Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care for Youth brings together an interprofessional team \u2014 a psychiatrist, an occupational therapist, a dietician and social worker \u2014 to provide resources through a web-based platform funded by the Medical Psychiatry Alliance. \"No single hospital has all the resources young people need. This project helps break down geographical barriers,\" says Dr. Peter Selby, CAMH's Director of Medical Education. We are leading the creation of evidence-based, standarized - yet flexible - care pathways for depression so every patient has the greatest hope for recovery. \"We would like this integrated care pathway to become a standard treatment model for all patients with depression,\" says Dr. Stefan Kloiber, a clinician scientist and Medical Head of General Psychiatry Ambulatory Services at CAMH. For adults, the pathway could suggest cognitive behavioural therapy, medications and even brain stimulation. And through the Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression's CARIBOU project, young people are guided through a detailed plan that starts with family education. Early intervention is key to recovery, yet 30 per cent of young people with first-episode psychosis drop out of care. Working in CAMH's Slaight Centre, Dr. Nicole Kozloff is working to strengthen youth and family engagement so young people can stay on track in their recovery. \"This study will help identify young people likely to slip through the cracks \u2014 and why \u2014 so we can ensure all young people with psychosis have access to early and ongoing treatment,\" says Dr. Kozloff. \" We are leading the creation of evidence- based, standardized\u2014yet flexible\u2014 care pathways for depression.

We are taking an important step by participating in this CAMH project. Ningwakwe George, Field Coordinator on the participatory action research project and member of Saugeen First Nations\" In a unique collaboration with Saugeen First Nation in Southampton, Ont., CAMH is taking its mobile research lab on the road to gather the knowledge needed to help develop a community wellness strategy. The mobile unit hosts community interviews and surveys in an approach known as participatory action research, in which members of the community share their experiences and perspectives to determine what is best for the community. We are helping primary care providers in remote and rural areas across Ontario build a better understanding of how to deliver transgender and gender diverse health care. ECHO Ontario Trans and Gender Diverse Healthcare uses video conferencing to connect primary care providers at sites across Ontario with experts in the Toronto hub. \"ECHO offers such a great opportunity to share knowledge and let that excellence of care trickle into places that normally wouldn't have those resources,\" says Kristen Patrick, an ECHO participant and member of the Sunset Country Family Health Team in Kenora.Last June, CAMH hosted a Pow Wow and Inter-Tribal Social.Mental Health is Health Mental Health is Health is grounded in the principles of health equity and the belief we should all have equal access to opportunities to attain a higher level of health through timely, appropriate and high-quality care independent of social, economic and demographic status. At CAMH, we are working to reduce disparities in mental illness and treatment through advocacy, data collection, policy- related activities, research and training programs.annual report 2018-2019 | 17CAMH's Dr. Sean Kidd spent a year with young people who had recently exited homelessness. What he learned concerned him; 25 per cent were soon street homeless again, with the majority of others stalled with unstable lives, major mental illness and trauma. That's why he is leading the Toronto Housing Outreach Program Collaborative, a project with a number of youth-focused organizations that has led to improvements in housing, education and employment in this population. This intervention supports young people as they transition from homelessness to housing in hopes they'll escape homelessness permanently and flourish. \"We very deeply listened to what young people said, and they told us they needed a combination of outreach case management, peer support and mental health support - offered in community settings rather than shelters.\" says Dr. Kidd. The resulting model is now being tested with Indigenous youth in Thunder Bay through a collaboration with Indigenous services, and a \"for youth, by youth\" guide for exiting homelessness is being tested in Thunder Bay and Managua, Nicaragua. CAMH hosted open and honest conversations about reconciliation at its June 19 events to celebrate National Indigenous Peoples Day. The day featured an opening welcome on CAMH's Ceremony Grounds; a panel discussion featuring Dr. Wilton Littlechild, past Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission; and a Pow Wow and Inter-Tribal Social. \"At CAMH, we have colleagues working together around reconciliation. It's not easy all the time but it's important and rewarding work,\" says Dr. Renee Linklater, Director of CAMH's Aboriginal Engagement and Outreach.25% who had recently exited homelessness were soon street homeless again In the first study of its kind, Dr. Alex Abramovich, an Independent Scientist with the Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, is collecting health care data from up to eight clinics across Ontario in hopes of better understanding how transgender people are accessing mental health care, and their overall health care use, through links to International Credential Evaluation Service data repository, for the first time. \"This study aims to identify, recognize and value trans lives, and create new knowledge that will lead to safe and competent health care for the trans population,\" says Dr. Abramovich. He is also using CAMH's mobile research lab to collect data across nine municipalities in York region to better understand youth homelessness among LGBTQ2S youth in a study funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. Our mobile lab helps us take our research to remote communities.Dr. Alex Abramovich (centre) is recognized by York Regional Police for his work with youth homelessness and issues regarding trans health and inclusion.18 | camh & camh foundation We are influencing the way Canadians think about mental health, gathering the evidence needed to inform policy and system change, and leading the conversations needed to bring mental health into a new era. Through the CAMH Monitor, the longest ongoing study of adult mental health and substance use in Canada, we know poor mental health among adults is on the rise. Young people are struggling, too. The CAMH Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey \u2014 the longest-running continuous survey of its kind in the world \u2014 found more than half of girls are facing an elevated level of psychological distress. A third of young people want to talk to someone about their mental health but don't know where to turn. \"We must improve resilience and reduce the burden of mental illness on individuals and their families,\" says Dr. Hayley Hamilton, co-principal investigator on both surveys.Changing attitudes and beliefs about mental health We are committed to reducing suicide rates in Canada. This means changing the conversation by generating a better understanding of the causes through research, and by developing new interventions for diverse populations.annual report 2018-2019 | 19 Dr. Juveria Zaheer hopes her study of hundreds of suicide notes will help clinicians prevent further tragedies. CAMH has long advocated for reform of Canada's system of cannabis control. Our Cannabis Policy Framework, released in 2014, informed decisions around October 2018's legalization of cannabis in Canada, and we have developed guidelines for its use. CAMH led the creation of Canada's Lower-Risk Cannabis Use Guidelines to help people make choices that reduce their long-term risks. CAMH Education worked with Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse Research (CRISM) to create and share \"10 Ways to Reduce Risks to Your Health When Using Cannabis,\" a plain-language adaptation of CRISM's important lower-risk cannabis use guidelines. The same team also worked with the Youth Engagement Initiative and National Youth Action Council to create \"The Blunt Truth,\" a guideline for young people. More than 9,100 copies of \"10 Ways\" and nearly 12,000 copies of \"The Blunt Truth\" have been distributed so far. Education's Digital Innovation team produced an 11-minute podcast, \"What all physicians need to know about cannabis legalization,\" the first of an exciting new podcast by physicians for physicians. The podcast has been downloaded nearly 500 times. In a CAMH and Sunnybrook collaboration, Dr. Juveria Zaheer hopes her study of hundreds of suicide notes will help clinicians prevent further tragedies. \"We have an opportunity to improve our understanding of the mindset of people in the moments prior to their suicide deaths,\" says Dr. Zaheer, a Clinician Scientist in CAMH's Institute for Mental Health Policy Research. Dr. Zaheer also worked with the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) as lead author of the CAF Clinician Handbook on Suicide Prevention. \"Suicide is a deeply complex, multi-dimensional phenomenon with no single cause and no simple solution,\" says Minister of Defence Harjit S. Sajjan. In a study jointly funded by the Cundill Centre and the Centre for Brain and Mental Health at SickKids, we are testing an intervention in which young people who visit the emergency department with acute suicidality receive six weeks of individual and family-based psychotherapy developed specifically for youth. \"There are very few interventions for suicidal youth that include a family component,\" explains Dr. Daphne Korczak. CAMH's Temerty Centre has shown repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation shown rTMS reduces suicidal thinking in a significant portion of people with hard-to-treat depression. \"This is one of the first large studies showing rTMS is effective in treating suicidal ideation,\" says Dr. Jeff Daskalakis, Co-Director of the Temerty Centre.Pictured is Jackie Relihan, Youth Engagement Facilitator. 12,000 copies of \"The Blunt Truth\" have been distributed so far20 | camh & camh foundation Building a future As we move ever closer to completing our vision of a modern, warm and welcoming mental health hospital \u2014 one in which people receive care with respect and dignity \u2014 we've reached an important construction milestone.In mid-December, CAMH and our redevelopment partners \u2014 Plenary Health, PCL and Infrastructure Ontario \u2014 poured the last concrete roof slabs on the McCain Complex Care and Recovery Building and the Crisis and Critical Care Building. Known in the construction world as the \"topping off,\" this event marked the completion of the outer structure of our buildings. We are on track to welcome patients into these buildings in mid-2020. With this milestone now behind us, our focus has shifted to the \"countdown to care,\" ensuring our care models and approaches to patient care match this new hospital. \"With every concrete slab poured, steel reinforcement bar hoisted or wall panel installed, our vision to transform patient care and challenge stigma has come more in focus,\" says David Cunic, CAMH's Vice-President Redevelopment and Support Services. The CAMH community writes messages of hope on a steel beam to be installed in the McCain Complex Care and Recovery Building.Our new buildings will be so much more than walls, floors and ceilings. They will be respectful and dignified places that promote healing and recovery.
