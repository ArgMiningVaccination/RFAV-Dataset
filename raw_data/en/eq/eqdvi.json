It is committed to equal education and employmentopportunities for men and women of all races and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissionspolicies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or anyUniversity-administered program. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and in substantial compliance with Title IX of the EducationAmendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the RehabilitationDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era VeteransAdjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicantsfor employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans ofthe Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without dis-crimination on the basis of age, except in those programs where age is a bona fide acade-mic qualification for admission in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimina-tion Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventists in admissions and employ-ment, including but not limited 42 USC Secs. 12926(d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the CaliforniaCode of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and ArticleI, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulationsare subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with orinfringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh-day Adventistchurch.

Dean, School of DentistryLETTER FROM THE DEAN 21 22 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY School Foundations HISTORY Asmall but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to form an organization that would serve asa catalyst, urging the Seventh-day Adventist church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent withtheir religious beliefs. These men were the founders of the National Association ofSeventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded inmembership and objectives through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country onhis own time in search of fellow Seventh-day Adventist dentists who were willing to pursueNASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as president of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meet- ing in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dentalschool project. Later that year at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the memberspledged a strong financial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H. Branson,asked Dr. Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Official action was taken in 1951 toauthorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda University'sSchool of Medicine. Dr. Prince was selected as the first dean of the School of Dentistry.His leadership in organizing and eventually administering the new School of Dentistrywas facilitated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Associationand as chair of the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty-twostudents comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree was developed in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department ofPeriodontics. Violet Bates became chair of the new department, and the first class of tendental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960 Dr. Charles T. Smith became dean. During this period, the School experi- enced positive growth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculum was developed in1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receivingthe Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program wasinitiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument Valley Dental Clinic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding frompublic sources fiscal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. Newadvanced-education (postdoctoral) programs were initiated in five clinical disciplines:orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, and oral pathology. During the 1970s the School of Dentistry continued its evolution into one of the pre- mier clinical programs in the United States. Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971.One of his major contributions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was completed inMay 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; providedfacilities for specialized areas of clinical instruction; and included eight new research lab-oratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher officespace, and a commensurate expansion of support facilities and services. The Oral andMaxillofacial Surgery Clinic was remodeled, and an out-patient surgicenter was developedto meet the needs of those patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for developmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such atreatment setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory was constructed; and newadvanced-education programs were initiated in pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry,dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics. A new program was established in 1985 toprovide a U.S. dental education for foreign-trained dentists. An increasing number ofdental professionals from other countries were seeking an American education and theopportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain advanced knowledge toshare in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer anintensive, two-year course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree and has added a six-monthcertificate program limited to dental missionaries from other countries who sense theneed for updated continuing education. The first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than twenty years added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two new patiententrances. The expanded Surgery Center for Dentistry and the enlarged PediatricDentistry Clinic were relocated to the ground floor. An additional student laboratory wasalso included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowed for expansion ofthe predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories.L O M A L I N D A U N I V E R S I T Y 23 SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 23ACCREDITATION All programs are accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) of the American Dental Association (ADA) and have been granted the accredita-tion status of approval since May 23, 1957. The CODA is a specialized accredit- ing body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. The Commission on DentalAccreditation can be contacted at (312) 440-4653 or at 211 E. Chicago Avenue, Chicago,IL 60611. All programs have been accredited by the Commssion on Dental Accreditation. OUR MISSION Loma Linda University School of Dentistry seeks to further the healing and teach ing ministry of Jesus Christ by providing an environment wherein: STUDENTS learn to provide high quality oral health care based on sound scientific principles. PATIENTS receive competent care, which is preventive in purpose, comprehensive in scope, and provided with compassion and respect. FACULTY, STUDENTS, AND STAFF value the patient relationship, respect diversity, and share responsibility by working together toward academic, professional, spiri-tual, and personal growth. SCHOLARLY ACTIVITY AND RESEARCH provide a foundation for evidence-based learning and enhance whole person care. THE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT attracts and retains a superior and diverse fac- ulty and staff who motivate, educate, and serve. OUR COMMUNITIES (local, global, and professional) benefit from our service, stewardship, and commitment to life-long learning.24 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYGOALS Each school of the University is encouraged to list its goals; departments, in turn, are encouraged to list their objectives. The goals and objectives in each case areconsistent with the University's overall purpose. The primary goal of the School of Dentistry is the education of men and women qualified to provide dental care that is comprehensive in its technical excellence and inits orientation to an awareness of the total health needs of the patient. Such practitionersmust be responsive to the public as well as to the individual patient's needs\u2014skilled inapplying basic and clinical sciences; providing moral, spiritual, and social leadership intheir communities; and inspiring in themselves and others a reach for excellence and adesire for service that produces ethical and competent teachers, researchers, andspecialists. Additional goals of the School of Dentistry also include creating role models for pre- ventive practices and informing the profession of advances in research and in methods ofpromoting dental health. To further facilitate the achievement of these goals, the Schoolof Dentistry trains dental hygienists and dental specialists to augment the effectiveness ofits primary educational product, the general dentist.SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 2526General Information ADMINISTRATION The dean, the chief administrative officer of the School, is aided by administrative associates. The dean presides over major administrative sessions. The administra-tion and the faculty are responsible for determining curriculum requirements, admitting students, conducting continuing education programs, encouraging activitiesand programs pertinent to the welfare and interest of students, assessing fitness for pro-motion and graduation, and carrying out other functions essential to the overall operationof the School. Department chairs preside over the teaching programs of the departmentsand are responsible for evaluation of faculty members and of student progress. CURRICULA The curricula at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry are designed to corre-late the basic biological sciences with the science and art of dentistry. Curriculaare under continuous review and are, therefore, subject to change and improve- ment without prior notice, as the need occurs. This BULLETIN contains the operating policy statements for the School of Dentistry educational programs. Any deviation from these policies must be approved by the Schoolof Dentistry administration. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essen-tially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health cur-ricula, the School of Dentistry shares the facilities for teaching basic sciences with the School of Medicine. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teachers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the School of Dentistry building named in honor of M. Webster Prince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall, facing theUniversity Church and adjacent to the Medical Center. The facilities effectively accommo-date collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs. The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the stu- dent with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent.Students find varied opportunities for serving and learning in the immediate Universitycommunity, in School-sponsored service learning clinics, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs.GENERAL INFORMATION 27PROGRAMS, DEGREES The School of Dentistry offers the following programs: 1.

The Teaching Learning Center workswith students to develop the reading, writing, ana-lytical, and study skills needed to succeed in pro-fessional education. The center offers three ABLE programs that will help students face academicchallenges by: Assessing learning style and reading skills. Breaking through in reading speed and com- prehension. Learning analytical and memory techniques and skills. Enhancing ability to take tests and examinations. If a student is having scholastic difficulties, the center will assess the student and tailor a pro-gram designed to increase and/or improve his/herreading speed and comprehension, writing clarity,analytical abilities, and other study skills\u2014usingthe student's own course materials. The center is located on campus in Evans Hall, Room 207. There is no charge to the studentfor assessment and evaluation. The regular stu-dent tuition package does not include the TLCtuition. However, TLC tuition is lower than regu-lar tuition. For additional information, please call909/558-8625. THE STUDENT HEALTH PLAN Because the health, vitality, and welfare of itsstudents and their dependents are of major concern to the University, Loma Linda Universitysponsors and funds the Student Health Plan, ahealth care plan that provides health service andmedical coverage to all eligible students. Itincludes the following benefits: Student HealthService, 24-hour coverage, and generous coveragethrough preferred providers. The Student HealthPlan provides a broad range of medical coveragebut does not provide dental or vision coverage. Student Health Service Professional services are rendered by the Student Health Service, which provides basic careto students.

Supplementary medical-coverage policy The Student Health Plan is an \"excess\" policy and only supplements other medical plans that40 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY provide benefits to the student. The student first obtains direct-provider payment, or reimburse-ment for out-of-pocket payments, from all othermedical plans that provide benefits for the stu-dent; only then does the student submit bills tothe Student Health Plan for any remaining bal-ance not covered by the other plans. The studentmust, therefore, follow all rules of his/her primaryinsurance in obtaining medical treatment. Thestudent should contact the primary carrier todetermine what procedure to follow. Eligibility The Student Health Plan automatically covers all full-time students at Loma Linda University inany clinical or academic program. Students arecovered when enrolled for 7 units or more perquarter (or clock-hour equivalent, as defined byeach School) for which Loma Linda University isreceiving tuition enrolled for field practicum are eligiblefor coverage if registered for at least 240 hours perquarter. Coverage during clinicals/rotations Students who are accidentally injured while performing their clinical rotation duties do nothave to pay their co-payment. If a covered studentis doing a school-sponsored clinical or rotationout of the area and becomes ill or injured, anyhealth service and medical care received that iscovered by the Student Health Plan will still becovered as if the student were in the Loma Lindaarea. Effective coverage date An eligible student's coverage becomes effec- tive on the day of orientation or the first day ofclass. Any purchased benefits will become effec-tive on the day the Department of Risk Manage-ment receives the health plan application andpayment within the open enrollment period,which is only the first two weeks of each calendarquarter. Buy-in provision only during open enrollment Eligible students are themselves automatical- ly covered by the plan; however, noneligible stu-dents\u2014those on summer break and part-time stu-dents (e.g., in a clinical program but enrolled forfewer than 7 paid units)\u2014may, if they wish, pur-chase coverage at the Department of RiskManagement. Those wishing to buy in may enroll in the Student Health Plan only during the first twoweeks of each new calendar quarter, that is,during the first two weeks of January, April,July, and October. An eligible student may buy Student Health Plan coverage benefits for his/her spouse and/ordependent child(ren). Eligible dependents are thespouse (residing with the insured student) andhis/her never-married child(ren) under nineteenyears of age, or never-married of age who are full-time stu- dent(s), or never-married children under twenty- seven years of age who are full-time graduate stu-dent(s). If a new spouse or eligible dependent is added to the household of a covered student after thetwo-week enrollment period, then the student hasa thirty-day grace period (after the wedding orafter the birth, etc.) in which to buy coverage forthe new spouse or new dependent; however, thecoverage must be purchased for the entire quarterin which this new status occurred. Buy-in rates per quarter are: $250 Part-time student$320 One dependent$600 Two or more dependents Neither Student Finance nor the Department of Risk Management bills the student's account orsends out reminders. Funds received for buy-incoverage must be in the form of a check or moneyorder (payable to the Department of Risk Manage-ment). Coverage exclusion for \"pre-existing\" condition If a student or patient has not maintained a continuous \"creditable coverage\" under anotherhealth plan during the twelve months prior to thecoverage effective date, the following pre-existing-condition exclusion will apply: This plan will not cover any medical condi- tion, illness, or injury for which medical advice,diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommendedor received by the student or patient during thesix months prior to the effective date of healthplan coverage. This exclusion will apply for twelvemonths from the student's coverage effective date,unless such an individual remains treatment freeduring the six-month term beginning with theeffective date of coverage. If the individualremains treatment free during the six-monthterm, the pre-existing-condition exclusion willapply only during that six-month period. Thisexclusion will not apply to pregnancy-relatedmedical expenses or to medical treatment for anewborn or adopted child. Preferred-provider plan, prescriptions, annual term, benefit limits The Student Health Plan is a preferred- provider plan.

The regular student is subject to strictapplication of the academic standards and policiesand pays the regular tuition rate. Provisional The student who is permitted to remove qual- itative or quantitative deficiencies in order toqualify or requalify for regular standing is classi-fied as a provisional (probationary) student duringthe transition period. The student is registered forcourses taken with the consent of the associatedean for academic affairs. Tuition at the regularrate is paid for such courses. Nondegree The student who enrolls for selected courses rather than for completion of a program leading to adegree or certificate is classified as a nondegree stu-dent. Registration may be for credit or audit. Tuitionis paid at the regular rate. Consent to enroll as anondegree student is granted by the department,with the approval of the associate dean for academicaffairs, and is subject to classroom and laboratoryspace. The undergraduate, nondegree student is one who is permitted to register for a single course onthe basis of a high school diploma, the presentationof a brief application form, evidence to the instruc-tor that the prerequisite has been met, consent ofthe associate dean for academic affairs, and pay-ment of tuition at the regular rate. The postgradu-ate, nondegree student is accepted similarly but onthe basis of a baccalaureate degree. Ordinarily acourse taken during this status applies toward degree requirements only if the student was eligiblefor regular status. No more than 9 units of suchcourse work may be applied toward the degree. Audit A student in any classification may register for a course as an auditor for purposes of supple-mentary education. A laboratory course may notbe audited. An audited course counts as half cred-it on the class load but earns no academic credittowards a degree or certificate.

PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC REVIEW There are four Academic Review Committees:D1, D2, D3 and D4, and Dental Hygiene. Membership of each committee consists of theassociate dean for academic affairs, the associatedean for student affairs, the associate dean for clin-ic administration, the assistant dean for admis-sions, the director of admissions, and the coursedirectors of all courses required of the respectiveclass in the academic year. In addition, each com-mittee has two student members appointed by thedean in consultation with the DSA officers.Student committee members will generally be inthe class ahead of the one being reviewed. The Academic Review Committees meet once per quarter to evaluate the records of student acade-mic performance and progress. Students whose per-formance does not meet the stated academic stan-dards and who are being considered for discontinu-ance may be scheduled for a hearing with the com-mittee. The committee also recommends to thedean all appropriate candidates for promotion, pro-bation, repeat, or other appropriate actions, as wellas students who should receive special recognitionfor academic excellence. The process for evaluating academic perfor- mance is as follows: 1. The Academic Review Committee\u2014by reviewing grades, reports, and other pertinentinformation\u2014identifies students whose acad-emic and clinical performance are belowacceptable levels. 2. The associate dean for academic affairs notifies a student facing possible academic sanctionsregarding the time and place of a meeting calledfor the purpose of allowing the student toappear before the committee to present reasonswhy action should not be taken. The AcademicReview Committee considers the student's pre-sentation and all available information beforemaking a recommendation. 3. The dean enforces one of three sanction options: Remedial action\u2014counseling, tutoring, repeat-ed or additional assignments, repeated or addi-tional course work, or other similar activities asa condition for continued enrollment. Probation\u2014a specified period of time during which the student is given an opportunity tocomply with specific academic standards.Such action must be confirmed by memoran-dum to the student. Academic discontinuation. 4. Grievances of academic review committee deci- sions may be appealed to the dean. The deanwill review the matter and either render a deci-sion or appoint a three-member ad hoc commit-tee. Members of this committee will not havebeen involved in the academic review commit-tee decision process. The ad hoc committee willmake a determination as to whether the processwas appropriately followed and whether therecord supports the decision. They will reporttheir findings and recommendation to the deanwho will make a final and binding decision. Thedean will decide if the appealing student will bepermitted to continue with class and/or clinicalassignments during the grievance proceedings.

In some situations the Academic Review Committee may recommend that a studentrepeat an academic year (or portion thereof)as an alternative to discontinuation. REPEATING A YEAR Astudent who is required to repeat an entireacademic year because of academic difficul- ties must use the following guidelines when registering: 1. Students are not required to register for any course in which a grade of B or better wasearned. 2. Instructor approval must be obtained before the student withdraws from any courses in which agrade of B- or C was earned. 3. Any courses in which a grade of C- or below was earned must be repeated.LEAVE OF ABSENCE Aleave of absence may be for as short as one day and is defined as being away from school for a non-illness-related obligation which may ormay not be School sponsored. The appropriateLeave of Absence form, requiring instructor andadministrator signatures, must be obtained fromthe School of Dentistry Office of Student Affairsand completed prior to departure. RE-ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Astudent who wishes to return from a leave ofabsence must first submit a letter to the asso- ciate dean for academic affairs requesting re-admission to the program. The request will bereviewed by the School of Dentistry AcademicReview Committee, and the student will be con-tacted by the associate dean for academic affairswith the decision of the committee. If the requestfor readmission is approved, the student mustcomplete a Re-entry Form, available at the Officeof Academic Affairs. STUDENT-INITIATED ACADEMIC GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE If a student wishes to contest a grade, s/he should discuss the grade first with the instructor, where appropriate; then with the course director, if applic-able; and finally with the department chair. If thestudent is not satisfied, s/he may then appeal to theassociate dean for academic affairs. APPEAL PROCESS If a student wishes to appeal a suspension or dis-continuation, appeal for reinstatement may be made directly to the dean of the School ofDentistry. Final appeal may be made to theChancellor of the University. In the case of anappeal to the Chancellor of the University, actiontaken will be limited to either denial of the appealor a referral back to the School of Dentistry for fur-ther consideration. Such appeals are not expectedto be routine and should be considered only in cir-cumstances where new and relevant informationexists that was not available for consideration bythe Academic Review Committee. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY The academically dishonest act intentionally vio-lates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, and intentionally compromisesthe orderly transfer of knowledge from teacher tostudent. Examples of academic dishonesty include but are not limited to: a. copying from another student's paper during examinations or quizzes; b. using unauthorized aids during examinations or quizzes; c. looking at another individual's examination or quiz in a way that appears that informationis being sought; d. communicating with another student during examinations or quizzes; e. loud and disruptive behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations; f. plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of some- one else's work in a written assignment; g. falsifying or changing of grades or other acad- emic records; and/or h. excessive unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments. When allegations of misconduct are made, the instructor should confront the accused stu-dent to determine whether or not some reason-able explanation exists. If no satisfactory explana-tion exists, the allegation must be reported to theassociate dean for student affairs, who will initiateprocedures as outlined in the School of Dentistrysection of the University Student Handbook . Each student is responsible for reporting ethicalmisconduct to an instructor or directly to theassociate dean for student affairs. TRANSCRIPTS The Office of University Records provides tran-scripts to other institutions or to the student or graduate only upon the written request of thestudent or graduate.

The student is reminded of individual responsibil-ity to be fully informed not only of these generalrequirements but also of the specific requirementsin the following pages, which govern the curricu-lum of the chosen program.48 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYIII PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS Programs and Degrees Codes and Course NumbersThe Dental Hygiene ProgramThe General Dentistry ProgramThe Departments Anatomy AND DEPARTMENTS 49Programs and Degrees The departments of the School of Dentistry offer a comprehensive range of pro- grams. Each of the School's five programs draws on the offerings of these depart-ments. The School's undergraduate curriculum\u2014the Dental Hygiene Program\u2014prepares the dentist's assistant to enter a variety of careers. Dental Hygiene is a four-year college cur-riculum; the junior and senior years are taken in the LLU School of Dentistry. The four-year General Dentistry Program equips the general dentist to meet the needs of a diverse patient population. The Combined-Degrees Programs enable the student to earn D.D.S./M.S. degrees or D.D.S./Ph.D. degrees by taking programs concurrently in the School of Dentistry and theGraduate School; or to earn D.D.S./M.P.H. degrees by taking programs in the School ofDentistry and the School of Public Health. The twenty-one-month International Dentist Program is designed for the dentist whose dental degree was earned outside the United States. Upon completion of the pro-gram, the student earns a D.D.S. degree from Loma Linda University. The Advanced Dental Education Programs lead to postdoctoral certificates in eight specialty and nonspecialty areas of dentistry\u2014and, at the student's option, additionally,to the Master of Science degree. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Sections III, IV, and V give the setting for each program the School of Dentistryoffers. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professionalprograms are outlined. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. 50 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYCodes and Course Numbers The following course-numbering system and codes are used throughout this BULLETIN . UNIT OF CREDIT Credit is indicated in quarter units: a quarter unit represents eleven class hours in lecture or conference, or in a combination of laboratorypractice and instruction.

GS Graduate SchoolSM School of MedicinePH School of Public HealthCODES AND COURSE NUMBERS 51The Dental Hygiene Program KAREN A. SIMPSON, Chair Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the undergraduate program of the School of Dentistry, is largely concerned with preventive oral health servicesand maintenance care. Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercises, and clinical assignments have been developed to provide training inthe variety of procedures delegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice set-ting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for continualgrowth and proficiency in performance of all traditional and expanded-function procedures.The purpose of the program is to develop professionals prepared for the current practice ofdental hygiene, as well as graduates who are additionally prepared to deal with futurechanges in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem-solving tech-niques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are importantadjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be pre-pared to enter a variety of career options available to a dental hygienist. FACULTY Darlene Armstrong Sharon BoggsTina OF DENTISTRYTHE DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAM 53 DENTAL HYGIENE CURRICULUM BACHELOR OF SCIENCE Dental hygiene, a profession dating back to 1913, is largely concerned with preventive health services. The hygienist works in associationwith the dentist in private-practice offices, indus-trial organizations, schools, hospitals, state or fed-eral public health services, and the armed forces.Salary ranges compare with those for registerednurses. The curriculum is organized as a four-year college program leading to the Bachelor of Sciencedegree. The freshman and sophomore years of largelyprescribed, preprofessional study may be taken atany accredited college. The professional programbegins with the junior year in the School of Dentistry.The program is approved by the Commission onDental Accreditation of the American Dental Assoc-iation. The first class at this University graduated in1961. Philosophy A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integ-rity, industry, responsibility, and depth of humanunderstanding. Therefore, the program of instructionis planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. Thestudent is encouraged to take electives that con-tribute to breadth of knowledge and quality of val-ues. The choice of electives in early college work isimportant for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in appli- cants with the potential to become hygienists whoare well-read and gracious persons\u2014prepared tocommunicate effectively in professional and commu-nity relationships. They should be able to draw onknowledge of the structure and function of man inhealth and in sickness, with resources based onChristian ideals and values to aid in the solution ofpersonal problems. They should also be able todevelop the attitudes and skills which will mosteffectively serve society. Goal The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to educate competent, concerned, and active membersof the dental hygiene profession who possess theability to effectively perform the expanding functionsof the dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole-personcare. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellow-ship among faculty and students are interwoven intodaily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and socialinteractions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, thisprogram also places great importance on providingan atmosphere in which students can develop theskills necessary to objectively assess new theoriesand trends in dentistry, in light of scientific knowl-edge and principles. By combining Christian valueswith an appreciation for research and the scientific method, graduates will continually apply sound prin-ciples to patient care and exhibit God's love in thequality of service they render. Admission The student must have a diploma or its equiva- lent from a four-year secondary school, and mustmeet college-entrance requirements. After successfulcompletion of the prescribed pre-entrance coursework in an accredited college or university, admissionto the Dental Hygiene Program is in the junior year.

GENERAL DENTISTRY CURRICULUM DOCTOR OF DENTAL SURGERY Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to benefit society and therefore continually assesses its professional services to ascertain whatmeasures, attitudes, and skills most effectivelyserve society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foun- dation in the sciences that are basic to knowl-edge of the structure and function of thehuman being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery andcorrelation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists andassociated professional personnel in bothdelivery of health care and contribution tocommunity well-being by education for theprevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contributing to the body of scientific knowledgeby questioning, investigating, and teaching; forremaining sensitive and adaptive to the needs ofhumanity in ever-changing conditions; and formaintaining consciousness of the individual oblig-ation to live, practice, and strive for the good ofhumanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic years, fulfills require-ments for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Objective The primary objective of the dental curricu- lum is to graduate men and women who attest tothe purpose of the University and the goals of theSchool of Dentistry, which include advancingknowledge and understanding of health, disease,and ways to improve health and the dental healthcare-delivery system through basic and appliedresearch. Admission standards Before starting the first (D1) year, the appli- cant must have completed a minimum of threeacademic years and no fewer than 96 semester or144 quarter units in a college accredited by aregional accrediting association. Acceptance is contingent on completion of specified subjectrequirements. A four-year undergraduate curricu-lum leading to a bachelor's degree is highly recom-mended. A student having completed such adegree is given preference for admission to thedental program. As a rule, credits earned in professional schools (business, medical technology, nursing,veterinary medicine, pharmacy, or medicine) donot fulfill admission requirements. Loma Linda University School of Dentistry insists that all dental students must possess thecapabilities required to complete the full curricu-lum in the allotted time and to achieve the levelsof competence required by the faculty. In broadterms, the following are standards required foradmission: Intellectual capability to complete the cur- riculum. Emotional adaptability and stability. Social and perceptual skills. Physical ability to carry out activities in observations and communications, and thepossession of sufficient motor and sensoryabilities to practice general dentistry. For admission, the applicant must meet spe- cific criteria related to past academic performance(G.P.A.), performance on the Dental AdmissionTest, and analysis of a personal profile interview. The weight given to these admission factors isapproximately equal. Students who are enrolled in a graduate pro- gram in the University are not considered foradmission until they have completed or have beenreleased from the graduate program. Credits for college work should show a mini- mum grade point average of 2.7 in science sub-jects and in nonscience subjects, averaged sepa-rately. The student must have a grade of C orabove for all required pre-entrance course work. Prior to consideration for admission, the applicant is required to have taken the test rec-ommended by the American Dental Association.The student entering the first (D1) year is expect-ed to have taken the test within the past twoyears, preferably not later than October of theyear preceding admission. At the applicant'srequest, test results are sent to the School by thetesting service. Information may be obtaineddirectly from the American Dental Association,THE GENERAL DENTISTRY PROGRAM 61 The General Dentistry Program The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the delivery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive inscope, and that is based on sound biological principles.62 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 211 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611. Or an application form and descriptive material maybe obtained from the School of Dentistry. Physical requirements A technical standards policy defines special physical requirements for students entering theSchool. This policy is outlined in section II of this BULLETIN under Admissions Information and is available in the School of Dentistry Office ofStudent Affairs. Background The subjects listed as required form the mini- mum background for professional study. The stu-dent should avoid duplicating science courses thatare offered in the professional curriculum andshould plan a college program in keeping withindividual interests and abilities. The student'spurpose should be the pursuit of diverse knowl-edge, the cultivation of an inquiring mind, thepractice of efficient methods of study, and thehabit of thinking and reasoning independently.These are of paramount importance to the stu-dent's development as a unique and responsiblehuman being. The choice of electives can broaden the stu- dent's view of the scope of knowledge. Being wellread will give a perspective on the sweep of humanthought throughout the ages, and often this will be ofassistance in written and verbal communication andwill improve the ability to think and express oneselfwell. Psychological, social, philosophical, and reli-gious insights will help to develop basic resources forthe solution of personal problems and the growth ofthat self-understanding the student must first haveto understand and help associates. PRE-ENTRY REQUIREMENTS Although a three-year predentistry curriculumin an accredited college is prescribed for acceptance, a baccalaureate degree, or the equiva-lent, is advantageous. The following complete col-lege courses are required for entrance into theD.D.S. degree program: HUMANITIES Freshman English (complete sequence). NATURAL SCIENCES (complete course, one full year or equiva-lent) General biology or Zoology with laboratory. General chemistry with laboratory.General physics with laboratory.Organic chemistry with laboratory. ELECTIVES Strongly recommended: Ceramics. Principles of management.Basic accounting. Mathematics.Basic human nutrition.Anatomy.Histology.Biochemistry.Psychology. The minimum of 96 semester or 144 quarter units may be completed from fields that con-tribute to a broad educational background. Employment Because of the heavy class load, first-year students in dentistry may not accept part-timeemployment during the first term, and may acceptsuch employment thereafter only upon receivingpermission from the Office of the Associate Deanfor Academic Affairs. Microscope The student may be required to have access to a satisfactory binocular compound microscopeduring the first three quarters of the curriculum.If a student does not have a microscope, one maybe rented from the Department of Anatomy. Allmicroscopes should meet the following criteria: 1. The microscope shall be binocular and no older than fifteen years. 2. The lenses shall be in perfect condition.3. The equipment shall include an Abbe con- denser with rack and pinion adjustment, aniris diaphragm, and a mechanical stage. 4. The lens equipment shall include a scanning objective 2.5 or 3x, 16mm objective, 4mmobjective, oil-immersion objective, and 10xeyepiece. If it is necessary for the student to rent a University microscope, the type available willdepend on the rental demand and departmentalpolicy. Instruments, textbooks, additional materials The instruments, textbooks, and materials required for the study and practice of dentistryare prescribed by the School and issued to thestudent as needed in the progress of the curricu-lum. The student must buy from the School theinitial package outfit of instruments specified inthe official instrument list. Unauthorized orincomplete equipment is not acceptable.

Webb Foundation, givingthe library a total floor space of 87,670 square feet.This structure now houses the main library, whilethe old structure is now shared between theDepartment of Archives and Special Collections andthe bound retrospective journals.
