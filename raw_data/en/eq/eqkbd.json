Istoriia the Formation of a Self-Conscious Soul], the core oI the voluminous tZo volumes, occupies center staJe and con-sists of four sections tracing the history of thought and culture in the Greco-Roman-Christian tradition up throuJh the \u00c0rst decades oI the tZentieth century. Belyi\u00b7s study has sections in various staJes oI devel-opment: an edited and revised text, an unrevised text, and a partially edited and revised text. But this edition has so much more: a substantial scholarly apparatus, a rich set of color illustrations, and additional texts by Belyi and the compilers. The \u00c0rst impression oI the tZo tomes is their ZeiJhtiness. The \u0019\u00170 paJ-es of volume I and 800 of volume II attest to the depth and the breadth oI the Zork itselI.

Chapter I is entitled \"Christianity as a TurninJ Point in History\" 188 . Belyi provides an exegesis of the Gospels and the Letters of Paul based on Zhat Zas the prevailinJ biblical scholarship oI his time mostly German . The Gospel oI John \"In the beJinninJ Zas the Zord\" is supplemented by the pivotal contributions oI Paul, the non-Apostle, the one Zho believed Zithout havinJ seen the livinJ Christ that made him the bridJe Irom the intellectual to the self-conscious soul. The historical Christ is seen as connectinJ the JeZish concept oI the 0essiah Zith the incarnation oI the LoJos oI the ancient Zorld. Belyi becomes an apoloJete Ior the VirJin Birth, the concept that Jesus Zas conceived by 0ary throuJh the poZer of the Holy Spirit, a belief embedded in Roman Catholicism but not in Russian Orthodo[y I, 1\u0019\u0019 - 1\u00197 . His knoZledJe oI the NeZ Testament is impressive, and oI course he assumed, much as had Dostoevskii and Tolstoi, that his readers Zere Iamiliar Zith the outlines oI the Christ nar-rative. Belyi additionally relies heavily on and cites frequently from the teachinJs oI RudolI Steiner, but throuJh his described in terms oI Belyi\u00b7s \"curve oI history,\" the sense that human development is not linear but moves through periods oI ascent and descent.

The notes to Belyi\u00b7s thoughts on Gogol, Dostoevskii, and Tolstoi are in themselves a valuable revieZ oI Belyi\u00b7s ZritinJs on those Zriters over the course oI his entire career. One mini essay outlines Belyi's understanding of Kant in rela-tionship to Scholasticism \u00061\u0019\u00169, I, 5\u0019\u0019 .

These commentaries are so complete they seem at some point to be taken for granted, and the reader comes to expect this level of scholarly detail.

The te[t itselI contains photos and reproductions of pages and segments of Belyi's ma-nuscripts in black and Zhite. But nothinJ approaches the Zealth and quality of the color inserts accompanying both volumes. There are eight sixteen-page inserts, four in each volume, for a total of 128 pages of full color reproductions. Each is identi\u00c0ed at the back oI the volumes as to content, date and location (for the most part in previously unpublished archival holdings). Insert I contains sketches, notes, and manuscript paJes alonJ Zith e[-planatory insertions by K. N. Bugaeva.

The colors employed enhance visually the connections oI themes and the \u00c1oZ oI history and culture. These e[tend Irom beIore the birth oI Christ, the Greek empire into AD CE times and the Roman Empire. They continue through the Empire's decline, the emergence of Arabic cultures, the de\u00c0ninJ date oI 1250 CE, then the 0iddle AJes up until the end of the nineteenth century. Belyi's concept of the rise and fall, the spiral or curve of history, is presented visually. Insert IV depicts human development and is speci\u00c0cally marked as not intended for publication until after the author's death. The concern that his anthroposophical convictions could lead to arrest or Zorse Ior himselI and those closest to him, K. N.

Overlaid on some of the pages are photographs of Belyi and his belonJinJs, obMects such as a leaI he collected Ior his oZn her-barium.Insert VI is a complex of sketches, mostly in black and red, some green and blue, that outline his thought.Insert VII has photos or reproductions belonging to Belyi gathered in his travels abroad.Insert VIII is devoted primarily to Zatercolors, sketches, and demonstrate visually Belyi\u00b7s conviction that the \u00c1oZ oI history is not linear but a spiral, or curve, or a series oI repeatinJ ups and doZns, all depicted as one and the same. The illustrations themselves, only part oI the Zhole, Zill continue to invite study and careful scrutiny in the decades to come. What is pre-sented here is a siJni\u00c0cant contribution Ior those unable to access the Iull archives. They represent an introduction to Belyi the artist, and can serve not only as building blocks for further research, but as places or stations to stop and pause and meditate on the meaninJ Zithin.ConclusionOriJinally Zritten Ior himselI and at Ior a limited audience oI Rus-sian nthroposophists, Belyi\u00b7s Zork takes on a neZ liIe in tZenty-\u00c0rst century. The century betZeen its oriJins and noZ its de\u00c0nitive publica-tion has provided a conte[t and Zealth oI supplemental knoZledJe that make the History of the Formation of a Self-Conscious Soul as timely today as Zhen it Zas conceived. For Russians this is an important Zork as the contribution to the documentinJ oI Western Civili]ation by one oI their oZn. It is a Russian rival to SpenJler\u00b7s Decline of the West that Belyi Zas Iamiliar Zith.

For those Zho have studied Belyi, much oI Zhat is presented Zill come not as a surprise, but as a siJni\u00c0cant contribution, a valuable addition to previously published Zorks. Belyi clearly has an enormous Jrasp oI history, and as he summari]es, his selections as Zell as omissions Zill become the subMect oI Iuture studies. His is a condensed history oI the thouJht and development oI Western civili]ation. This tZo-volume Zork belongs on the shelf of any center interested in Russian studies. It is the best and perhaps singular chance to bring together everything related to the seminal Zork under one cover. The limited edition under the aeJis oI Literaturnoe nasledstvo Zill, one can hope, become available in electronic Anthroposophists in Russia and abroad, Belyi\u00b7s Zork Zill com-plement and add a uniTuely Russian perspective to some oI the maMor tenets in the teachinJs oI RudolI Anthroposophy his thouJht even aIter his return to Russia Irom Berlin has noZhere been presented Zith such dramatic evidence. To fully appreciate Belyi's History one must appreciate Steiner's distinctions of Body, Spirit and Soul, and the seven stages of de-velopment: 1 Physical body; 7 Spirit 0an\u00b3Atma. The \u00c0rst three constitute the Body, the \u00c0nal three elements belonJ to the Spirit. The fourth phase corresponds to the three stages of the Soul and its development Irom the sentient soul to the intellectual soul and \u00c0nally the selI -conscious soul. AccordinJ to Belyi, Symbolism in the tZentieth century places us at the beJinninJ oI entrance into the \u00c0Ith staJe. Belyi\u00b7s vision oI Symbolism is his RudolI Steiner and analysis, one cannot simply read Belyi\u00b7s te[t, tracinJ the spiral oI his oZn thouJht as it unIolds and e[pands. It must be savored, meditated upon, revisited, by literary scholars, philosophers, historians, 301597_Slavische-Philologie-1-2022.indb 21916.02.22 11:36(c) 2022 Universit\u00e4tsverlag WINTER Heidelberg / AUTHOR'S COPY - FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY / created March 2022T.

This condensed history aims at comprehensiveness. Some Zill appreciate and try to comprehend Zhat has been presented. Others may Zonder iI the curve oI history has continued as Belyi predicted on an upZard spiral, or have Ze entered in the tZenty-\u00c0rst century one oI the cyclical declines that has characteri]ed the Iormation oI the selI-conscious soul Ior the past tZo millennia\"The editors have demonstrated Zhat a cooperative multinational, mul-tilinJual team oI scholars can produce at its best.
