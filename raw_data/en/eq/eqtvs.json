The roots of Naturopathy go back thousands of years, relying on the healing wisdom of many cultures, including Indian (Ayurveda), Chinese (Taoist), Greek (Corpus Hippocraticum), Arabic, and European Egyptians (Monastic). In these early civilizations people lived in a harmonious relationship with the surroundings and the understanding of disease was accomplished by observing nature and how it interplayed with human life. Naturopathic physicians combine the wisdom of nature with the rigors of modern science. Steeped in traditional healing methods, principles and practices, naturopathic medicine focuses on holistic, proactive prevention and comprehensive diagnosis and treatment. By using protocols that minimize the risk of harm, naturopathic physicians help facilitate the body's inherent ability to restore and maintain optimal health. It is the naturopathic physician's role to identify and remove barriers to good health by helping to create a healing internal and external environment. Naturopathic physicians work in private practices, hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. NDs practice throughout the United States and Canada. Qualified naturopathic physicians undergo rigorous training before they become licensed health-care practitioners. The body possesses an innate ability to heal itself, after removing obstacles of cure. The body, if given the right internal and external stimuli, can achieve homeostasis or health. This is what sets naturopaths apart from conventional medicine. The six principles of naturopathic medicine unite NDs across the world include: Core to all medical practice is the desire to help the human form and condition. NDs typically approach care by utilizing the most natural, least invasive, and least toxic therapies. NDs will refer when the patient's presentation is outside their scope or level of skill. NDs recognize the value of our natural world in assisting the healing process. Not only do NDs utilize substances that originate in nature, but they also incorporate a healthy natural environment as foundational to human health. Naturopathic doctors recognize and harness the body's inherent wisdom to heal itself to guide patients to wellness and total health. There is a time and place for symptom suppression, however most naturopathic patients will benefit from identifying the underlying causes of illness and removing obstacles to cure. Naturopathic doctors elevate patient health literacy. That means that NDs are part of the team helping patients have a better understanding of what it takes to be and stay well. Through education and a trust-based relationship, patients better understand the steps they need to take to achieve and maintain health. Naturopathic doctors understand the interconnectedness of our body, our environment, and our lifestyle on total health. It is only through this whole-person-based approach that NDs seek to restore balance and health. Naturopathic medicine affirms that it is better to prevent illness and suffering whenever possible. Through their comprehensive practice, NDs combine all six principles to identify potential areas of imbalance and teach patients how to get well and stay well. Additional Information The following extract is from the Institute of natural medicine and may accessed at the following website: [https://naturemed.org/faq/faq-how-are-naturopathic-doctors-educated-trained-and-licensed/](https://naturemed.org/faq/faq-how-are-naturopathic-doctors-educated-trained-and-licensed/) The general educational structure for naturopathic doctors is comparable to that of conventional medical doctors (MDs) and osteopathic doctors (DOs). In all three medical programs, the first year emphasizes biomedical sciences such as anatomy and biochemistry. Second-year classes focus on the diagnostic sciences, including areas such as evidence-based medicine and physiological assessment. All programs progressively increase students' problem-based learning and integrated coursework, enabling students to learn how different concepts affect one another. After the first two years, the curricula of the three medical programs focus on applying medical knowledge to real-life situations with simultaneous classroom studies supporting this training. Third- and fourth-year naturopathic medical students have opportunities for hands-on clinical training and practice, often at their schools' teaching clinics and off-site clinics. This period of clinical training is essential to these students' education\u2014so much so that clinical training is now being introduced during the first and second years of education at several AANMC-member schools. As a result, naturopathic medical students graduate with experience in diagnosing and treating patients, even before they begin formal practice. During naturopathic medical school, students are educated in the biomedical sciences as well as the latest advances in science in combination with natural approaches to therapy. They also study disease prevention and clinical techniques. A major [difference between the training of the MDs and naturopathic doctors](https://naturemed.org/faq/characteristics-of-healthcare-professions-differentiating-between-nd-integrative-md-do-and-dc-providers/) is medical residencies. MD residencies are mandated and regulated by conventional medical schools. As a result, many opportunities for residencies exist at a wide variety of medical facilities and are funded by the federal government. There are a rising number of residency opportunities available to new NDs, with many completing 1-2 yr Primary Care Physician (PCP) or specialty residencies each year. [Naturopathic medical schools](https://aanmc.org/naturopathic-schools/) that are part of the [American Association of Accredited Naturopathic Colleges ](https://aanmc.org/)can apply for residencies for their students. The Institute for Natural Medicine is proud to augment this growth by hosting the INM Residency Consortium (IRC). This accredited program provides naturopathic medical school graduates two years of valuable clinical residency time, in addition to enrichment in practice management and other skills. Like MDs, a growing number of naturopathic doctors choose to specialize or focus their practices. Specialty associations currently exist for [Endocrinology](http://www.endoanp.org/), [Oncology](https://oncanp.org/). In addition, while practicing Family Medicine, many naturopathic doctors choose an area of focus based on a therapeutic, condition, or population subset. There are currently seven accredited schools with eight campus locations in the United States and Canada, as listed below. A degree from an accredited medical school is required for licensure or certification by a state. Prior to admission into an accredited naturopathic medical school, the [typical entering student](https://aanmc.org/naturopathic-schools/academic-prerequisites/) has completed three years of pre-medical training and earned a Bachelor of Science degree. Students are expected to have completed courses in English and the humanities as well as math, physics, and psychology, with a strong emphasis on chemistry and biology. In addition to prerequisite course work, prospective students must demonstrate appropriate observational and communication skills, motor function, intellectual-conceptual abilities, integrative and quantitative abilities, and behavioral and social maturity. The exam required to qualify for Naturopathic Doctor licensure is administered by The [Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX)](https://www.nabne.org/home/exam-overview/) as well as the [North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE)](https://www.nabne.org/home/) is a two-part examination. Only students and graduates from accredited or candidate naturopathic programs are eligible to sit for the NPLEX. Passing the NPLEX is required before a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine can be licensed by a state.

The office offers one-on-one advising that's tailored to pre-health students. You can get advising on prerequisite courses, extracurricular opportunities, and personalized help throughout the entire application process. You are encouraged to join the HPAO Pre-Health Organization Club where you will meet with students of the same career persuasion. "}
