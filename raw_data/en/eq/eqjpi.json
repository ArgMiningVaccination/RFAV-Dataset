Testimonials Samantha has a warm, sympathetic manner that put me completely at ease. I initially sought out Samantha Conboy after I learned that I had two uterine fibroids, one of which was quite large and starting to cause some discomfort. Samantha is extremely thorough-before my first appointment, she had me fill out a detailed questionnaire, then followed up with additional questions during our in-person consult. Afterwards, she had an exhaustive picture of my unique constellation of symptoms, both physical and emotional, as well as my diet and lifestyle. Based on the data she collected, she recommended a remedy that was the best fit for my symptoms, then stayed in contact via email to monitor how I was responding to the remedy. We made adjustments as needed, and we've continued to meet every few weeks to assess my progress. The remedies (combined with systemic enzymes) have been quite effective at shrinking the fibroids-my latest ultrasound showed that the smaller fibroid was gone, and the larger one had shrunk by two centimeters. But because homeopathy doesn't simply address an isolated set of symptoms but treats the person as a whole, I've experienced improvements to my overall well being that I hadn't expected, such as increased energy and decreased anxiety in social situations. And as other minor health issues have cropped up, Samantha has recommended remedies that have helped with those, as well. Homeopathy's comprehensive holistic approach requires that you share a lot of sensitive personal information with your practitioner, which can be uncomfortable; but Samantha has a warm, sympathetic manner that put me completely at ease. If you're looking for a knowledgeable, conscientious homeopath who genuinely cares about her patients, you can't go wrong with Samantha.

I had been diagnosed with arthritis and needed a solution that would let me continue to dance without pain. At our first meeting, Samantha was very easy to talk with and a good listener. She not only helped me with my arthritis but now I consult her for all of my health needs. I compete in different dance events around the country and she has created a custom remedy travel kit for me that keeps me healthy on the plane and in the hotel environment. Carol P I have no words to express my gratitude for the treatment that Samantha gave to my daughter. My daughter at the age of 3 years was having the issue of enlarged adenoids. Because of this, she used to get cough, cold and fever very often. Visit to urgent care became a very common thing. She was not getting good sleep because of the nasal congestion and that used to make her cranky all day. Allopathic doctors suggested to undergo surgery to get the adenoids removed. We were confused and anxious. After consulting Samantha, things started to change. Her medicines made a lot of improvements on my child's overall health. The frequency of her cough and cold occurrences reduced a lot. Her sleep improved. Her immunity also developed well. Neethu She is amazing! and so warm and lovely, I immediately felt comfortable in her presence. I consulted with Samantha Conboy on sinus cold that affected my throat and my ears were so congested I could not hear out of one. I had been in great pain and discomfort for a week. Within 24 hours, after the consultation and the purchase of the remedies she recommended, I felt 75% better. I will continue to work with her for any current and future health issues. She is amazing! and so warm and lovely, I immediately felt comfortable in her presence.
