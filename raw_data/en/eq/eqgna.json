Ayurveda addresses every aspect of life in a holistic manner, including consciousness and mind, lifestyle, healthy behaviors, diet and digestion, stress management and environmental influences. Ayurveda utilizes natural approaches to restore balance and keep the patient healthy. It's a personalized system of health care that's used for promotion and maintenance of health, prevention of disease and also treatment of chronic disorders and diseases. Ayurveda treats the disease at its source rather than just treating the symptoms of disease. Personalized recommendations for a patient may include dietary recommendations, lifestyle recommendations, herbal preparations, rejuvenation therapies, detoxification therapies to eliminate the buildup of toxins (ama) in the body, Ayurvedic self-massage, breathing exercises and meditation. The Ayurvedic recommendations are individualized, depending on the patient's body constitution, current imbalances in their system and toxic buildup (ama) in their system. I've been practicing Ayurveda since 1995 and have practiced at Ohio State Integrative Health since its inception in 2005. I've also conducted and published extensive research on the various modalities of Ayurveda. I have presented these research findings worldwide, including to the World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, and Food and Drug Administration. I've written six books on topics related to Ayurveda, including Ayurvedic Healing, The Answer to Cancer and Dynamic DNA. I also teach Spontaneous Meditation and pranayama (breathing exercises). Spontaneous Meditation is a natural and simple technique of consciousness that strengthens and supports both the mind and body to enhance health and well-being. Pranayama includes various forms of breathing exercises that create vitality and enhanced energy, and helps in restoring health.
