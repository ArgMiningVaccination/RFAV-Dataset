We expect students, faculty and staff to follow the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html) and the Florida Department of Health guidance to protect their health and support the safety of everyone. We encourage you to monitor your health and if you feel ill, take steps to minimize interactions with others. What should I do if I'm feeling ill? If you are feeling ill, you should follow CDC guidance by limiting your contact with others, get tested and monitor yourself. For any additional guidance, please contact your primary care physician or the Student Health Care Center at 352-392-1161. For questions about isolation or quarantine call the Florida Department of Health in Alachua at 352-273-9790. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911. - If you are concerned you have COVID-19, and are presenting with the symptoms found on this CDC symptoms webpage, complete a COVID-19 test as soon as possible. If you test negative for COVID-19, test again 1 to 2 days after your first test. - You can get a test through your primary care provider, a retail pharmacy or with an at-home COVID test kit. [Order your free at-home COVID-19 tests](https://www.covid.gov/tests). - UF students can schedule a clinical appointment for a COVID-19 test by contacting the [Student Health Care Center](https://shcc.ufl.edu/appointments/)at 352-392-1161. Testing UF has suspended its easy-access COVID-19 test sites due to a number of factors, including the universal availability of free or low-cost, at-home testing as well as testing provided by retail pharmacies and private care providers. While the current need for mass testing is low in our community, plans are in place to reestablish a mass testing site in the event it is deemed necessary. If you feel sick, please stay home. Anyone who is experiencing COVID symptoms is encouraged to get tested. Effective June 17, you will no longer be able to register for testing or report illness through ONE.UF. Testing is readily available using at-home test kits, local pharmacies or through your primary care physician. To report a case of COVID, call the health department in the [county where you reside](https://www.floridahealth.gov/all-county-locations.html).

It is the decision of the instructor whether to provide additional attendance options for the course. If necessary, Campus Assistance & Resources for Empowerment (CARE) in the Dean of Students Office is available to support you with [instructor notifications](https://click.info.gator360.ufl.edu/?qs=7a49dd896c738b51c4452f0f05253f8437249f5a98b674a013b6cd97059f01b8ddcf2e284a40085e88f2559bba3355755a0f11e82c403069). Instructor Notifications are not an official excuse to miss class, but they do provide communication to faculty on a student's behalf to request that the instructor work with the student to complete missed coursework/exams when appropriate. It is worth noting that you do not need to share medical information with your instructor. Faculty and Staff If you are feeling well enough to work from home and your department has granted you permission to work at an alternate work location, you may work from home. If you are not feeling well enough to work, there are several options for taking leave or you may also apply for additional leave through UF's leave donation program. [ Please review the UF HR guidelines for these programs.](https://hr.ufl.edu/covid-19/guidance-on-taking-leave/) Vaccines and Boosters Students, faculty and staff can receive [vaccines and boosters](https://coronavirus.ufhealth.org/vaccinations-2/vaccine-boosters/) from the UF Student Health Care Center and UF Health pharmacies at no cost. UF expects but does not require that faculty, staff or students receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Masks Effective June 15, 2022, following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance for Alachua County, UF is recommending that members of our campus community and visitors wear masks in indoor public settings and on public transportation. Blue surgical masks are available in UF classrooms, libraries and other campus locations. Within UF Health hospitals or other patient-facing clinical facilities, including dentistry practices and veterinary hospitals, face coverings are required. Face masks are recommended in non-clinical spaces, such as academic and research areas of our academic health center's health colleges that do not involve interaction with patients, as well as administrative offices at off-site non-clinical locations like the UF Health Professional Park. Please continue to practice physical distancing. Where to get masks on campus - Masks and other supplies are available for faculty and staff through each unit's [HR liaison](https://hr.ufl.edu/about/hr-liaisons/)for use in connection with assigned duties. Masks can be purchased for personal use at Office Depot through the [UF GatorPerks](https://benefits.hr.ufl.edu/gatorperks/)program. - Disposable masks will continue to be available in locations across campus, including in classrooms, for anyone who may need one; however, campus community members are encouraged to purchase their own KN95 masks. - Information on [masks for UF Health faculty and staff](https://bridge.ufhealth.org/response/2022/01/18/1-18-22-kn95-and-level-1-ear-loop-mask-ordering/)can be found on the UF Health intranet.
