A pharmacist fol - lows behind you and cancels the order before it is administered. Why? At the August P&T Committee meet - ing, a policy was approved that allows pharmacists to discontinue orders for are indicated. Although vaccines are usually given in the outpatient setting, the administration of vaccines to hospi - talized patients is a method of promot - ing the use of these vaccines. When followed, these measures can keep patients out of the hospital, decrease morbidity and mortality, and decrease the cost of healthcare. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to determine a patient's vaccination sta - tus. In order to comply with these stan - dards, pneumococcal vaccines are often ordered without regard to a patient's vaccination history. When vaccines are repeated within a short period, it increases the chances a patient will experience an adverse reaction. Shands at UF's pharmacy computer system will track when patients have previously received a pneumococcal vaccine in the inpatient setting. In order to comply with national quality standards, but not increase the risk of adverse effects, the P&T Committee has established the policy that will allow the order for the repeat vacci - nation to be discontinued, as long as the date of the previous vaccination is documented in the chart. This can be done without contacting the prescriber and requiring the prescriber to write a new order. This policy will not track previous vaccinations given in the outpatient clinics or when it was administered at another health system. Thus, a thorough medication history and documentation of previous vaccinations should be done. The goal is to promote appropriate pneumococcal vaccination, but only when it is indicated. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Automatically discontinuing pneumococcal vaccine orders? pneumococcal vaccines when there is documentation that the patient has received a previous pneumococcal vac - cine within 5 years. A new \"P&T-Ap - proved\" order will be written discon - tinuing the order for the vaccine. This action will also be documented in the Progress Notes along with the rationale for the discontinuation. The date the patient previously received the pneu - mococcal vaccine will be documented in the discontinuation order and in the progress note. The Center of Medicare and Medic - aid Services, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organiza - tions, and other quality and peer-re - view organizations have established a Core Measure for Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP) that promotes the screening of patients in the hospital and/or the administration of pneumo - coccal vaccination. This quality mea - sure is based on data that recognize the impact pneumonia has on patients and healthcare in general. Several mea - sures are associated with CAP includ - ing prompt administration of the first dose of antibiotic, appropriate collec - tion of cultures before initiating antibi - otic therapy, and provision of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, when they 2Amyl nitrite is an inhaled vasodi - lator. It was re-added in the Formu - lary for use in the Cardiac Catheter - ization Laboratory and the Echocar - diography Laboratory. It was deleted in May when it was thought it was no longer being used. However, the rapid vasodilation and rapid offset is used for diagnostic procedures (eg, for diagnosing structural heart abnormalities). Dasatinib is a small tyrosine kinase molecule similar to imatinib (Gleevec\u00ae), which is listed in the Formulary . It was evaluated as part of a comprehensive review of oncol - ogy drugs. Dasatinib is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of 5 critical oncogenic tyrosine kinases/kinase families that have been linked to multiple forms of human malignancies. Dasatinib has demonstrated clinical efficacy in pa - tients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast crisis (myeloid or lymphoid), as well as in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lympho - cytic leukemia (ALL). Dasatinib has been evaluated in patients who were resistant to or intolerant to imatinib. Most patients treated with dasatinib had been exposed to at least a year of imatinib and 50% or more were exposed to at least 3 years of imatinib. In high-risk pre-treated patients, dasatinib produced complete hema - tologic responses in 90% with CML and a complete cytogenetic response in 33%. As expected, response rates in patients with accelerated phase and blast crisis were lower. Myelosupression is a hallmark of CML and is a characteristic adverse effect of chemotherapy. Therefore, my - elosuppression is common in patients receiving dasatinib. It may occasionally result in dosage reductions or interrup - tions in therapy. CBC monitoring is re - quired. Bleeding from impaired platelet aggregation may also occur. Other common adverse effects include gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), pyrexia, peripheral edema, asthenia, rash, dys - pnea, pleural effusion, and headache. Cardiomyopathy occurred in a small of patients. Dasatinib therapy costs approxi - mately $125-$230 per day, depending on indication and dosage. There is no alternative therapy. Dasatinib offers an alternative in patients who are refractory to or in - tolerant to imatinib. Since it is an oral therapy, it maintains quality of life with an outpatient therapy. Gammagard\u00ae S/D is now the low IgA version of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) listed in the Formulary. This brand change became necessary when Polygam\u00ae S/D was discontinued by its manufacturer. Some patients, particularly those requiring chronic replacement IgG therapy (primary im - munodeficiency), develop sensitivity to the IgA \"contaminant.\" Because there is a limited supply of Gammagard\u00ae S/D, it will be reserved for those patients requiring a low-IgA product. The American Red Cross no longer markets intravenous immune globulins, which has contributed to the nation - wide shortage of IVIGs. Panglobulin\u00ae is no longer listed in the Formulary be- cause it is also no longer being made. Our allocation of Gamunex\u00ae has been increased to make up for the loss of Panglobulin\u00ae. This is an improvement because Panglobulin\u00ae used sucrose as a stabilizer. The high sucrose content in some IVIGs has been associated with renal failure. Gamunex\u00ae does not use sucrose as a stabilizer. Pregabalin is an analogue of ga - bapentin marketed as the patent for gabapentin expired. Pregabalin has the same mechanism of action as gabap - entin, but has more predictable phar - macokinetics. It is well-absorbed with predictable pharmacokinetics over the range of dosages that are used. Dosage titration is simpler with pregabalin than gabapentin. Pregabalin has labeled indications for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neu - ropathy, management of postherpetic neuralgia, and as adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures. Pregabalin has been used off-label for a variety of disorders. Like gabapentin, the potential for additional off-label uses is great.Although the dosage regimen varies based on indication, doses are generally given 2 or 3 times per day. Starting dosages are 150 mg per day with usual dosages of 300 mg per day. The maximum dosage is 600 mg per day. Dosages must be decreased for impaired renal function. When stopped, pregabalin must be tapered to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Because there is negligible metabo - lism of pregabalin, there is no dosage reduction with impaired liver function. There are also no known metabolic drug interactions. Pregabalin causes sedation, and additive sedation with other CNS depressants has been noted. Placebo-controlled, clinical trials show that pregabalin is effective for its labeled indications. There are no published trials comparing pregabalin with gabapentin, nor any other active treatment for any of its labeled indica - tions. Thus there are no data showing that the improved pharmacokinetic profile results in better outcomes. Pregabalin is 5-6 times more ex - pensive than gabapentin. Whether this increased cost can be justified is not known at this time. If twice-daily dosing can be used, compliance may be better. Because pregabalin is a controlled substance, storage and han - dling is more difficult and expensive than with other drugs. The main adverse effects of prega - balin are dose-related dizziness, som - nolence, dry mouth, blurred vision, peripheral edema, weight gain, and abnormal thinking. Newly developed myoclonus has been reported in patients with epilepsy taking prega - balin. Pregabalin was designated a Schedule V controlled substance be - cause it caused euphoria in patients with a history of drug abuse. Although there was insufficient evidence to justify the addition of pregabalin in the Formulary , its ad - dition was necessary because it is a controlled substance. Patients cannot use their own supply of controlled substances at Shands at UF. Also, pa - tients with seizure disorders cannot easily be converted to gabapentin. Optison\u00ae was deleted from the Formulary because its manufacturer discontinued it. Optison\u00ae had not been used in the last year due to a re - call and the subsequent removal from the market. Perflutren liquid micro - spheres (Definity\u00ae) is the IV diagnos - tic contrast agent used for echocar - diography in the Formulary . Natalizumab is humanized antibody that binds to the alpha-4 subunit of integrin receptors expressed on the surface of (continued on next page) CRITERIA FOR USE CHANGES Clofarabine (Clolar\u00ae by Genzyme Corporation) Use in adults approved . Leflunomide (generic) Mercaptopurine (generic)\u00a7 \u00a7Must be ordered on a Chemotherapy Order Form. Podofilox (generic) Podophyllum Resin (generic) No longer requires a chemotherapy order form. THERAPEUTIC INTERCHANGES Senna Liquid for Senna Tablets ** **When patients cannot take oral solidsFormulary update, from page 13Formulary update, from page 2 leukocytes (except neutrophils). This binding prevents the attachment of leukocytes to counter-receptors on vascular endothelium, and inhibits the passage of leukocytes across the endothelium and into inflamed tis - sues. By blocking these receptors on the blood-brain barrier, natalizumab is thought to prevent the passage of inflammatory mediators into the central nervous system (CNS). Natalizumab has a labeled indica - tion for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. It was first approved in November 2004, but was withdrawn from the market in February 2005 because 3 patients developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). On June 5, 2006, natalizumab was re-marketed with a special restricted distribution program (ie, Tysabri Out - reach Unified Commitment for Health [TOUCH] prescribing program). This program includes a risk-minimization program with mandatory patient and outpatient infusion center registra - tion. Patients must undergo periodic follow-ups. Natalizumab was desig - nated nonformulary and not available because it cannot be obtained for inpatient use. Oral phenylephrine tablets are used as an alternative to pseudo - ephedrine in the outpatient setting for nasal decongestion. Oral phenyl - ephrine has become prevalent in the outpatient setting because of recent restrictions placed on the availability of pseudoephedrine (ie, behind the counter, requiring proof of identifica - tion, and the signing of a log book). A review of the available data shows there is insufficient evidence that oral phenylephrine 10 mg tab - lets are effective. Also, the purported duration of action is only 4 hours, which is much shorter than the 12- hour duration for sustained-release pseudoephedrine. Since pseudo - ephedrine is listed in the Formulary , oral phenylephrine was designated nonformular y and not available. Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analog with immunomodulatory activity. While the exact mechanism of action is not known, it appears to inhibit production of tumor necro - sis factor alpha, activate CD4+ and CD8+ cells, enhance the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, and have direct antitumor activity. Lenalidomide has labeled indica - tions for myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma. Use for myelodysplastic syndromes is for the treatment of patients with transfu - sion-dependent anemia due to low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic associated with a deletion of 5q abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Lenalidomide is used to treat multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy. Only 1 clinical trial has been pub - lished for myelodysplastic syndromes. In this open-label phase 1-2 study, there was a 56% response rate and 63% of patients became transfusion-inde - pendent. All responders with 5q minus abnormalities developed cytogenetic responses. Dose-limiting neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the most significant adverse effects requiring interruption of therapy and subsequent dosage reductions. A second, phase 2 study published as an abstract found similar results. 63% of patients reached transfusion independence on therapy. A higher rate of transfusion independence was reached with patients with an isolated 5q31.1 del (69% vs 49%). Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were again the dose-limiting adverse effects. The indication for multiple myeloma was approved at the end of June 2006. Approval was based on 2 unpublished randomized studies. These multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo- controlled studies compared - mide oral pulse high-dose dexa - methasone therapy to dexamethasone therapy alone, in patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least 1 prior treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was time to progression (TTP). Preplanned interim analyses of both studies showed that the combination of lenalidomide/dexa - methasone was significantly superior to dexamethasone alone for TTP. The studies were unblinded to allow pa - tients in the placebo/dexamethasone group to receive treatment with the lenalidomide/dexamethasone combi - nation. Complete response, partial re - sponse, and total response rates were also higher in lenalidomide-treated patients. Diarrhea, pruritus, rash, and fatigue have been associated with lenalido - mide use. Increased risk of venous thrombosis has been observed in le - nalidomide trials for multiple myeloma. Like thalidomide, lenalidomide is pregnancy category X and is available only via a limited distribution program (RevAssist). Since lenalidomide is available only from designated special - ty pharmacies via a restricted distribu - tion program, it cannot be added in the Formulary. Patients will have to use their own supply if treatment is contin - ued during their inpatient stay. Clofarabine is a purine nucleoside antimetabolite that has been shown to have activity against refractory or relapsed ALL in both children and adults. It has been shown to have a favorable toxicity profile with the primary dose-limiting toxicity being reversible elevations in liver enzymes. Long-term studies assess - ing effects of therapy on survival are currently lacking. In March 2005, clofarabine was added in the Formulary for use in pediatric patients with acute leukemia who failed at least 2 prior regimens. At this time, adult patients were excluded because of insufficient evidence. Based on recent evidence, the criteria for use were expanded to include adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALBL) who have failed at least 2 prior regimens and adult patients with AML. Leflunomide, podofilox, and podophyllum resin no longer have to be ordered on a Chemotherapy Order Form. The P&T Committee reviewed the list of agents that require order - ing on a Chemotherapy Order Form and determined that these agents can safely be removed from the list. Mercaptopurine was added in the list of agents that must be ordered with a Chemotherapy Order Form. The limited use for non-oncology indications and the risk of bone mar - row suppression with an overdose led to its addition in the list. Senna liquid can now be automati - cally interchanged for senna tablets in patients who cannot swallow solid oral dosage forms. Senna is a plant derivative used as a nonprescription stimulant laxative. It is commonly used to treat constipation associ - ated with opioid use. The typical oral dosage is 1 or 2 tablets once or twice a day. The official dose of senna is based on the sennoside content. The amount of sennoside in a typical senna tablet (eg, Senokot\u00ae) is about 8.6 mg of sennoside, but the amount varies from manufacturer to manufac - turer. The amounts of sennoside in liquids are slightly different and also varies among manufacturers; thus, direct interchange was not possible without a P&T-approved interchange. Since the typical tablet senna dose is 1 or 2 tablets and the typical liquid dose is 10 mL or 15 mL, an inter - change of 1-tablet-equals-10 mL and 2-tablets-equal-15 mL was approved. This allows nurses to use the tablets or liquid, depending on whether the patient can tolerate an oral solid dosage form, without obtaining a new order. This dosage form change will be documented in the chart as a \"P&T-Authorized\" interchange.\u0018Volume 20, No. 8 September 2006 This publication is produced by the Drug Information and Pharmacy Re - source Center under the direction of the Department of Pharmacy Services and the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee.

This has been common for medications like pain medications and antibiotics. For several years, the Shands at UF P&T Committee has tried to decrease the use of Automatic Stop Orders. Although review and reordering is a good concept, the chance that an order would be inadvertently stopped is always a concern (ie, an error of omis - sion). When antibiotics are still needed or a patient is still in pain, the last thing needed is therapy to be prema - turely stopped. Our current Automatic Stop Order Policy only has 2 situations requiring the re-writing of orders to prevent them from being stopped. Any time a patient is transferred from 1 level of care to another (eg, from a critical care unit to a general ward or from the OR to a criti - cal care unit) their medication orders have to be re-written. Respiratory medications adminis - tered by a respiratory therapist also have to be rewritten after 72 hours (ie, a 72-hour stop order). This is designed to prevent the unnecessary continu -ation of medications (eg, nebulized albuterol) when they are no longer needed. The respiratory medication stop-order policy explicitly excludes patients with chronic respiratory diseases (eg, COPD, asthma, lung transplant patients). An automatic stop order will not be applied to these pa -tients in order to avoid an error of omis - sion. Before the respiratory medication is stopped, reminders will be placed in the chart (ie, stickers) requesting that the order be rewritten. This policy will not apply to respiratory medications administered by nurses or patients (eg, metered-dose inhalers). hands Children's Hospital at UF S is transitioning to standard con - centrations for intravenous products to comply with Joint Commission-man - dated medication safety standards. Pediatric clinical pharmacists and anesthesiology attendings developed the list, which was reviewed by the various pediatric specialties. At the August P&T Committee meeting, a policy was approved that requires the use of these standard concentrations. There are 2 lists of standard IV concentrations. There is a list specific to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and a list for the rest of the pediatric patients. These standard concentra - tions are based upon the weight of the patient in order to control the amount of fluid needed to deliver the appropri - ate amount of medication. Concentra - tions that will be used in children will also be used in most adult patients. A list of adult standard concentrations is still being developed. Shands Children's Hospital is using a computerized order entry process for pediatric intravenous medications that helps prescribers choose the appropri - ate standard concentration and manage the amount of fluid that is delivered to the patient from the intravenous medications prescribed (ie, Accupe - dia\u00ae). A complete list of these standard concentrations is available from the Department of Pharmacy Services.POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Standardized IV concentrations in pediatrics "}
