Anthroposophic medicine is an integrative multimodal treatment system based on a holistic understanding of man and nature and of disease and treatment. It builds on a concept of four levels of formative forces and on the model of a three-fold human constitution. Anthroposophic medicine is integrated with conventional medicine in large hospitals and medical practices. It applies medicines derived from plants, minerals, and animals; art therapy, eurythmy therapy, and rhythmical massage; counseling; psychotherapy; specific nursing techniques such as external embrocation. Forschende Komplement\u00e4rmedizin / Research in Complementary Medicine 2011 Global advances in health and medicine : improving healthcare outcomes worldwide 2014 Anthroposophic medicine is a physician-provided complementary therapy system that was founded by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman. Anthroposophic therapy includes special medicinal products, artistic therapies, eurythmy movement exercises, and special physical therapies. The Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study (AMOS) was a prospective observational multicenter study of 1631 outpatients starting anthroposophic therapy for anxiety disorders, asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, low back pain, migraine, and other chronic indications under routine conditions in Germany. AMOS INCORPORATED TWO FEATURES PROPOSED FOR THE EVALUATION OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY SYSTEMS: (1) a sequential approach, starting with the whole therapy system (use, safety, outcomes, perceived benefit), addressing comparative effectiveness and proceeding to the major system components (physician counseling, anthroposophic medicinal products, art therapy, eurythmy therapy, rhythmical massage therapy... Drug design, development and therapy Anthroposophic medications (AMED) are prescribed in 56 countries. To study clinical outcomes in patients prescribed AMED for chronic disease. Prospective cohort study. 110 medical practices in Germany. 665 consecutive outpatients aged 1-71 years, prescribed AMED for mental, respiratory, musculoskeletal, neurological, genitourinary, and other chronic diseases. Disease and Symptom Scores (physicians' and patients' assessment, 0-10) and SF-36. During the first six months, an average of 1.5 AMED per patient was used, in total 652 different AMED. Origin of AMED was mineral (8.0% of 652 AMED), botanical (39.0%), zoological (7.2%), chemically defined (13.0%), and mixed (33.0%). From baseline to six-month-follow-up, all outcomes improved significantly: Disease Score improved by mean 3.15 points (95% confidence interval 2.97-3.34, p < 0.001), Symptom Score by 2.43 points (2.23-2.63, p < 0.001), SF-36 Physical Component Summary 3.04 points (2.16-3.91, p < 0.001), and SF-36... BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2008 BMC Research Notes This article narratively reviews the evidence of 2 therapeutic modalities, massage and passive movement. The authors suggest that these 2 treatment techniques may be combined as 1 treatment to be used in a variety of clinical settings. We present the rationale through which the concept of massage with movement (MWM) has been developed and constructed from the principles of passive movements with gentle massage during Lomi Lomi massage. It is hypothesized that through further investigation and empirical studies, this concept may allow bodywork and movement therapists, nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists to combine the positive effects of passive movements with those of massage for patients' health benefits, most notably through enhanced relaxation. European journal of medical research BMC Geriatrics 2010 The open neurology journal Anthroposophic treatment for migraine is provided by physicians and includes special artistic and physical therapies and special medications. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 45 consecutive adult outpatients (89% women) starting anthroposophic treatment for migraine under routine conditions. Main outcomes were Average Migraine Severity (physician and patient ratings 0-10, primary outcome), Symptom Score (patient rating, 0-10), and quality of life (SF-36); main follow-up time point was after six months. The anthroposophic treatment modalities used were medications (67% of patients), eurythmy therapy (38%), art therapy (18%), and rhythmical massage therapy (13%). Median therapy duration was 105 days. In months 0-6, conventional prophylactic antimigraine medications were used by 14% From baseline to six-month Average Migraine interval 2.40-3.87, p<0.001); patient-rat...
