The symposium, titled Immuno- Oncology Biomarkers 2010 and Beyond: Perspectives from the iSBTc/SITC Biomarker Task Force , gathered approximately 230 investigators equally from academia, industry and governmental/regulatory agencies from around the globe for panel discussions and presentations on the following topics: 1) immunologic monitoring: standardization and validation of assays; 2) correlation of immunity to biologic activity, clinical response and potency assays; 3) novel methodologies for assessing the immune landscape: clinical utility of novel technologies; and 4) recommendations on incorporation of biomarkers into the clinical arena. The presentations are summarized in this report; additional program information and slides are available online at the iSBTc/SITC website. Introduction Over the last decade, cancer therapies that target specific molecular pathways or specific cell types have moved from the laboratory into clini cal practice. Similarly, bio- markers that may indicate su itable patient populations for these therapies or act as surrogates for the potential development of a clinical resp o n s ea r ei n c r e a s i n g l yu s e d in the clinic. The clinical application of biomarkers to assess the effect of immune-b ased cancer therapies is important for several reasons. First, immune-based treat- ments, such as vaccines, are often designed to elicit a spe- cific response so that the measurement of that response could be a marker of product (e.g., vaccine) potency. Sec- ondly, as immune-based therapies are tested earlier in the therapeutic pathway (e.g., in the adjuvant setting), biomarkers of response become increasingly important as potential endpoints of clinical trials. Finally, clinically qualified biomarkers are needed so that new immu- notherapies can be rapidly and efficiently tested and translated to clinical practice.As laboratory-based assays are being transitioned to clinical assays, several issu es are raised. The assays must be robust. The clinical samples collected for analysis must be processed in a uniform way to ensure reproduci- bility of results. Results must be reported in a detailed and uniform way. New assays which have been devel- oped, that will allow broad analysis of multiple immune parameters, must now be better utilized. The lessons learned from bioma rker studies in fields such as HIV/ AIDS and other infectious diseases, must be better incor- porated into cancer immunotherapy studies. To address these and other issues related to the devel- opment and application of biomarkers in cancer immu- notherapy, the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer (iSBTc, recently renamed the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, SITC) hosted a one-day symposium at the National Institutes of Health on September 30, 2010.

SITC President Bernard A. Fox, PhD (Earle A. Chiles Research Institute) initia ted the symposium with a pre- sentation on critical hurdles in cancer immunotherapythat lead to delays of scientific discoveries which providestrong evidence of antitumor effects in preclinical modelsto be tested in patients. As an extension from the 2009iSBTc-FDA-NCI Workshop on Biomarkers, SITC andcollaborating organizations had identified seven critical hurdles to the effective translation of cancer immu- notherapy: 1) the inadequacy of animal models as predic-tors of efficacy; 2) the prolonged time to obtain approvalfor clinical trials; 3) the complexity of cancer biology/immunology; 4) the inability to obtain approval to com-bine most promising new agents in trials; 5) the lack ofdefinitive biomarker(s) for assessment of clinical efficacy;6) the paucity of translational research teams; and 7) the insufficient exchange of information critical to advancing the field. Fox discussed each of these problems andstressed the need to intensify collaboration to definepotential solution. Accordingly, following the symposium(October 1, 2010) SITC hosted a Collaboration Summitwith representatives from nine other domestic and inter-national associations with si milar interests in promoting research and translation of cancer immunotherapy (see Appendix). In an effort spearheaded by Fox, on behalf of SITC, the collaborating associations are preparing a jointpublication that further defi nes these critical hurdles to cancer immunotherapy and joint initiatives to overcomethe identified barriers. Samir N. Khleif, MD (National Cancer Institute, Cen- ter for Cancer Research) spoke briefly on the prioritiesin biomarker development in immunotherapy. He started by identifying the gaps between the ideal setting/ goals of immunotherapy, its current state, and the rolethat biomarkers may play to bridge such gaps. He out-lined the current state of immunotherapy/vaccineapproaches as highly empiri cal in their design, which is partly a result of the lack of full understanding of theimmune system response to therapy and its consequentinteraction with the tumor microenvironment; and the lack of understanding of effective immune endpoints measurements. He described the complexity of immu-notherapeutics compared to other types of cancer-tar-geted therapy for the need of immunotherapy agents tointeract with the immune system, tumor microenviron-ment, and the tumor, to be able to generate a meaning-ful clinical response. This further reflects the complexityof developing biomarkers for immunotherapy and theneed for a wider array of biomarkers that goes beyond the standard needed for development of cancer-targetedtherapy (diagnostic, predictive, metabolism and outcomebiomarkers). Immunotherapy may also require selectingbiomarkers (e.g., to identify patients expressing a specificantigen and the ability to express the antigen), and bio- logic response biomarkers that determine the ability to generate an immune response to the therapy, which isneeded for tumor response. He also addressed the com-plex variability of the \"effective \"immune response bio- markers and what biomar kers would predict the susceptibility for the generation of an effective immuneresponse. A major effort is required to integrate imm une profile biomarkers within the clinical trial design with better strategies to correlate objective responses. Further, a bio-marker development process should be defined. Khleifconcluded his presentation with the identification of thefollowing critical areas for biomarker development: bios-pecimens; Monitoring: Standardization and Validation of Assays Lisa H. Butterfield, PhD (University of Pittsburgh) chaired a session on standardization and validation onassays for immunological monitoring and delivered thefirst presentation in the session. In this update from the 2009 iSBTc Workshop, Butterfield summarized work completed by the iSBTc/SITC Biomarkers Taskforce,which included the recent preparation of the society 's position paper Recommendations from the iSBTc-SITC/ FDA/NCI Workshop on Immunotherapy Biomarkers [3]. Road blocks biomarkersare the inherent variability of patients, variability of col-lection and processing of their blood and tissues, of selec- tion and conduct of assays, and of the information reported on samples and assays reported in clinical trialand biomarker study manuscripts. The Taskforce recom-mendations include sugge stions for ways to minimize variability by using standardized methods for blood andtissue processing and banking; standardized functionalassays, thorough reporting of details and controls in pub-lications, and banking of not only blood and serum but also patient DNA, tumor cells and tumor RNA (to deter- mine patient genotypes and tumor gene expression pro-files), and sufficient blood and serum for testing noveldeveloping assays and hypothesis generation. Paul V. Lehmann, MD, PhD (Cellular Technology Limited, Shaker Heights, OH) , discussed the challenges of T cell monitoring: determining what parameters tomeasure, how to measure them, and most importantly,Butterfield et al.Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 8:130 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/8/1/130Page 3 of 9how to measure parameters precisely and reproducibly. He focused on the milestones that have lead to thesuccessful standardization of enzyme-linked immunosor-bent spot (ELISPOT) assays. These milestones included:1) the development of protocols for the freezing of per-ipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) without func- tional loss; 2) the developme nt of library of reference PBMCs for assay comparisons, qualification/validation,and harmonization across ins titutions; 3) the develop- ment of serum free media for all steps of PBMC proces-sing and testing; 4) the development of objective,automated analysis; 5) th e development of ELISPOT assay qualification, validation, and high throughput test-ing; and 6) the demonstration that a unified platform suffices for obtaining highly reproducible ELISPOT data across technicians and institutions. Representing the Association for Cancer Immunother- apy (CIMT), Cedrik M. Britten, MD (University MedicalCenter of the Johannes and BioN-Tech AG, Mainz, Germany) presented on harmonizationof monitoring across institutions. Brittenreviewed the CIMT Immunoguiding Program (CIP), a proficiency panel program wit h 40 participating labora- tories in 12 European countries. The aims of this pro-gram are to promote: 1) quality assurance by providingimmediate feed-back about p erformance relative to the group (or to a dynamic reference value); 2) assay harmo-nization by using the collected data to systematicallyinvestigate the performance of subgroups and deduceharmonization guidelines; and 3) protocol optimization by using the collected data to systematically identify criti- cal process steps. Britten presented CIP recommenda-tions for harmonization ELISPOT, using allogeneic antigen presenting cells(APCs), using triplicate we lls for each antigen, introdu- cing a resting time of the PBMCs before they are addedto the ELISPOT plate, cell 4\u00d71 0 5lymphocytes per serum-free test conditions, and using a sc ientifically sound method for response determination . Large-scale harmonization initiatives may lead to dyna mic reference values to rank test performance, increased comparability of results gen-erated across institutions, and improved assay perfor-mance in a group, thereby p otentially accelerating clinical development of new cancer immunotherapies. Britten also discussed the Minimal Information About T cell Assays (MIATA) initiative, which is part of a larger effort of \"Minimal Information \"projects for different t y p e so fd a t as e t s .T h ea s s a yh armonization efforts con- ducted over the past five years have led to the identifica-tion of several critical experimental process steps. As aconsequence, MIATA was launched as a community dri-ven reporting framework for T cell experiments [5]. Pub-lished reports of T cell experiments, suggested Britten,should include sufficient information on all critical test variables and process steps, as agreed upon by a panel ofparticipants, through a web-based iterative process withbroad input from the immunotherapy field. Session 1 fin-ished with a panel discussion with the audience, led byButterfield, Lehmann, Britten, Sylvia Janetzk, MD (Zell- net Consulting, Inc., Fort Lee, NJ) and the CIC, and Michael Kalos, PhD (University of Pennsylvania). Correlation of Immunity to Clinical Response and Potency Assays In a session focused on correlating immunity to clinical responses and potency assays, chaired by Mary L. Disis(University of Washington), Raj K. Puri, MD, PhD (Divi- sion of Cellular and Gene Therapies, Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, CBER, FDA) first discussedthe FDA 's considerations on potency and immune mon- itoring for cancer vaccines and cancer immunotherapyproducts. He discussed the importance of full productcharacterization, including development of potencyassays according to FDA regulations, in successful pro-duct development. Puri discussed approaches for potency measurements, including 1) direct measurement of biological activity with in vitro orin vivo bioassays; 2) indirect measurement (i.e., surrogate assay) of biologi-cal activity using analytical, non-bioassays that are corre-lated to biological activity; and 3) the combination ofmultiple assays (a combination of biological or analyticalassays where the combined results constitute an accep-table potency assay). Successful potency assays indicate biological activity(s) specific and relevant to the product and measure activity of all components deemed neces-sary for in vivo activity. Potency assays must provide a quantitative readout, indicate product stability, and meetpredefined acceptance and/or rejection criteria. Resultsmust be available in time for lot release. Importantly,fully-developed potency assays are required prior to theinitiation of Phase 3 clinical trials so they may be vali- dated during Phase 3 trials. Puri summarized possible approaches to the successful development of potency assays, emphasizing the need toidentify functional biomarkers (e.g., biomarkers that cor-relate with in vitro different iation and/or detect func- tional cells in complex mixt ure). These may include the development of genomic or proteomic techniques toidentify functional biomarkers, assessment of unique bio- chemical markers and secreted proteins, and/or flow cytometric assessment of cell phenotype for purity, whichmay link to identity and/or potency. Immunological monitoring during development and evaluation of cancer immunotherapies can supportproof of concept, advance understanding of immunolo-gical mechanisms (including T cell responses and modu-lation of regulatory cells), and provide information onButterfield et al.Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 8:130 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/8/1/130Page 4 of 9mechanisms of action. Indeed, an immune response may correlate with clinical benefit, harm, or lack of either;thus immune monitoring ma yp l a yas i g n i f i c a n tr o l ei n both early and late phases of immunotherapy productdevelopment. The FDA has drafted guidance documentsfor industry and for therapeutic cancer vaccines [6,7]. Additional references for the regulatory process for the Office of Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies(OCTGT) for manufactures are available from the FDA [8]. Immunologic biomarkers as correlates of clinical response after cancer immunotherapy were presented bysession chair, Mary L. Disis, MD. Citing recent datafrom clinical trials and population-based studies that have correlated biomarkers with clinical outcomes, Disis identified unifying themes around what constitutes an effective anti-tumor response, immunity types and thetumor microenvironment. For example, there is a strongcorrelation between gene expression in type I T cells(T H1cells) and relapse in colorectal cancer [9] and the density of intratumoral T ce lls and overall survival in ovarian cancer [10]. Moreover, the composition of tumor-infiltrating T cells is associated with clinical out- comes; higher CD8+/CD4+Tc e l lr a t i o sa n dC D 8+/T reg+ratios are independent predictors of survival in ovarian cancer [11]. Effective anti-tumor immunity also correlates with measurable changes in the tumor microenvironment fol-lowing cancer immunotherapy. Modulation of self-regu-lation within the tumor is associated with response, as exemplified by the correlation between low T reg cell density within ER +breast cancer tumors [12]. Modula- tions of immune evasion within the tumor microenvir-onment are likewise linked to response, with high levelsof PD-L1 expression correlating with lower density ofCD8 +T cells and survival in ovarian cancer [13]. Growth-factor mediated changes within the tumormicroenvironments are also predictive of outcomes; lower TGF b-1 levels within the tumor independently predicted longer disease free survival (DFS) amongpatients with breast cancer [14]. Functional persistenceis also associated with an effective anti-tumor response,with higher density of CD45RO +memory T cells within the tumor independently predicting DFS among patientswith colorectal cancer [15]. As a unifying theme surroun ding immunological bio- markers of clinical response after cancer vaccine and T cell therapy, Disis emphasized that Type I immunityfacilitates cross-priming a nd that autoimmunity is the ultimate endpoint of effective cross-priming. While cur-rent biomarker candidates generally focus only on thetreatment-induced immune response, the impact oftherapy on the tumor microenvironment may best pre-dict maintenance of the induced immune response.Newer approaches that integrate measurement of effec- tors and environmental impact need to be fully assessedand larger studies are needed to demonstrate strongerassociations between biomarkers and clinical responseafter cancer immunotherapy. David Stroncek, MD (National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center) presented on measuring the potency of dendritic cell preparations using transcriptional analysis.Stroncek noted the importance of identifying biomarkersfor new cellular therapies that can be used to assess:1) consistency i.e., technical validation, includingmethod validation inter-indi-vidual variability associated and clinical conditions, and intra-individual variability asso- ciated with changes in an individual over time orchanges in health status. Potency biomarkers must dis-criminate between active reflectmanufacturing variability. Stroncek et engaged in identifying biomarkers to assess maturedendritic cells (DCs). Standard phenotypic markers are useful for assessment of DC identity and purity, but not functional analysis. Stroncek reported on RNA microar-ray strategies for assessing patterns in DC gene expres-sion that could be correlated with assay variability,manufacturing variability, and inter- or intra-donorvariability. He provided examples of different levels oft h ee x p r e s s i o no fs e v e r a li m m u n er e s p o n s eg e n e s( e . g . ,CCL1, AIM2, and CD80) associated with these classes of variability. Stroncek 's group is refining this strategy to systematically characterize cellular therapy potency bio-markers that reflect product consistency as well as indi-vidual and manufacturing variability. Dendritic cells areparticularly challenging due to their environmentalresponsiveness, and thus, their phenotypic and func-tional changes during manufacture. Stroncek et al areusing the concepts of this broad approach to design vali- dation studies during clinical trials. Sipuleucel-T immune parameters and correlation with overall survival was presented by Mark W. Frohlich,MD (Dendreon Corporation, Seattle, WA) based onrecently reported results from the randomized Phase 3IMPACT Trial (Immunotherapy AdenoCarci-noma Treatment) product measures (i.e., CD54 upregulation as a marker of APC activation) and measures of cellular and humoral response. After theinitial treatment with Sipu leucel-T, APC activation increased, indicated by CD54 upregulation, as did secre-tion of Type 1 cytokines. Proliferation and ELISPOTassays demonstrated specific T cell responses to theimmunizing antigen after the initial dose. Sipuleucel-Twas also shown to generate a persistent antigen-specificButterfield et al.Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 8:130 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/8/1/130Page 5 of 9humoral response, which was characterized by antibody class switching from IgM to IgG (for anti-PA2024). In acombined analysis of Phase 3 Sipuleucel-T data, CD54 + cell counts, number of total nucleated cells, and CD54upregulation correlated significantly with overall survi-val, even after adjustment for baseline prognostic factors (PSA and LDH levels). The IMPACT study revealed a correlation between overall survival and measures of anantigen-specific antibody response, T cell proliferation,and ELISPOT. The APC activation and cytokine profile is sugges tive of an immunological prime-boost mechanism. T he correlation between overall survival and the monitored immunological parameters suggests these measures may be useful bio- markers for assessing the clin ical activity of this new cancer immunotherapy. Session 2 finished with a paneldiscussion led by Stroncek, Nicholas Restifo, MD (NCI SurgeryBranch). Novel Methodologies for Assessing the Immune Landscape: Clinical Utility of Novel Technologies The iSBTc/SITC Biomarkers Symposium included a ses- sion designed to address emerging methodologies thatare proving useful in immune assessment for clinicalimmunotherapeutic approaches to cancer treatmentchaired by Francesco Marincola (NIH) and Peter P. Lee(Stanford University). Thomas R. O 'Brien, MD (National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics) presented on genetic variants in IL28B (IFN- l) as major predictors of response to IFN- atherapy for chronic hepatitis virus C (HCV). Chronic HCV infectionis the leading cause of liver cancer in the United Statestoday. Standard treatment of chronic HCV infectioninvolves pegylated IFN-alfa in combination with riba-virin, a regimen that generates a sustained virological r e s p o n s ei na b o u th a l fo fi n f e c t e dp a t i e n t sb u tw h i c h can have significant adverse effects. Use of appropriatemarkers and technologies to identify patients less likelyto benefit from standard HCV treatment would be bene-ficial, as would more effective treatment approachesamong these patients. O'Brien reported on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have helped to link genetic variants in IL28B (which encodes IFN- lB )w i t ht h er e s p o n s et o standard therapy. Analysis of global distribution of twoIL28B alleles that differ by only a single nucleotide sug- gests that the higher frequency of the unfavorable allelewithin populations of African descent partially explainsracial differences in response to standard treatment,pointing to a potential clinical role for IFN- lin chronic HCV infection. While IL28B genotype may be helpful inindentifying patients who are not good candidates for therapy, personalized clinical decisions must considerother factors (e.g., viral load and hepatic fibrosis score)associated with a sustained virological response. Samuel C. Silverstein, MD (Columbia University) pre- sented data and mathematical models that indicate that a critical concentration of cytolytically active, tumor antigen-specific CD8 +T cells is required to control growth of cognate antigen-expressing tumor cells. Sil-verstein described a clonogenic assay varyingnumbers of CD8 +T cells from an OT-1 transgenic mouse whose T cell receptor s pecifically recognizes SIINFEKL peptide were mixed with B16 with SIINFEKL peptide) and co-incubated in a collagen/fibrin gel for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The gel was dissolved, the surviving cells pla-ted, and the resulting colonies were counted to deter-mine the number of surviving melanoma cells. In thea b s e n c eo fs p e c i f i cC D 8 +T cells, the melanoma cells demonstrate log-linear With increasing numbersof co-incubated CD8 +T cells, the melanoma cell growth rate is reduced, and at a critical CD8+T cell concentra- tion, the cytolytic cells kill the tumor cells at the same rate as tumor cell growth. Silverstein reported on a mathematical model for determining killing efficiency inwhich the constant kwas equal to the volume of anti- gen-expressing tumor cells cleared per cytolytically active, tumor antigen-specific CD8 +T cell per minute. He presented killing efficiencies for in vitro (collagen- fibrin gels) and in vivo models (spleen cells of mice infused with LCMV-pulsed target cells) and demon- strated that kdecreases 0.7 log 10for every log 10increase in CD8+T cell concentration and was dependent on the percent of cytolytically active , antigen-specific CD8+ T cells present PhD (INSERM, Cordeliers Research Center)presented on immune biomarkers, drawing from work that demonstrated that the immune contexture (nature, functional orientation, density and location of immunecells in colorectal cancer) had a prognostic value thatwas superior to that of the classic UICC-TNM classifica-tion system. He reviewed data that indicated that thepresence of memory T cells within the tumor correlateswith the absence of early-metastatic invasion andimproved clinical outcome in colorectal carcinoma. He also discussed the prognost ic value of tumor invasion vs. immune reaction, demonstrating an inverse relation-ship between intratumoral density of CD8 +Tc e l l sa n d the T stage of the in colorectal carcinoma tumor at thetime of surgery. Moreover, data he summarized indi-c a t e dt h a tm o s tp a t i e n t sw i t has t r o n ga n dc o o r d i n a t e dcytotoxic response presented with early-stage colorectal carcinoma, whereas patients with a weak cytotoxicButterfield et al.Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 8:130 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/8/1/130Page 6 of 9response progressed to late-stage disease. Additionally, the density of CD8+T cells at the center of the tumor also correlated inversely with tumor T stage and relapse. Peter P. Lee, MD (Stanford University) presented information on the assessment of immune changes intumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) as novel biomar- kers using an integrated image analysis approach. Using 5-color immunohistochemical staining, automated high-resolution (whole section) imaging, and customizedimage analysis software, Lee 's group have been able to create composite images that map each cell type withinsections of TDLNs. The number, proportion, and spatialcharacteristics (i.e., spatial relationships betweenimmune and tumor cells) were compared to five year clinical outcome data. Lee reported changes in immune cells in TDLNs, both in number and spatial relationship,and that some of these changes appear to predict clini-cal outcome. He noted that quantitative, spatial analysistools for histology have been developed for highthroughput analysis, thus image analysis of immunecells in TDLNs may serve as a novel biomarker for can-cer. Initial analysis of TDLNs from patients with breast cancer suggests that this approach may also have broader utility in other cancers. Session 3 finished witha panel discussion led by Marincola, Lee, O 'Brien, Sil- verstein, and Galon. Recommendations on Incorporation of Biomarkers into the Clinical Arena The final session geared toward providing insight into the incorporation of biomarkers into clinical applications was chaired by John M. Kirkwood, MD (University of Pitts-burgh). First, Diane Longo, PhD (Nodality, Inc., FosterCity, CA) presented on single cell network profiling(SCNP) technology and applications in immunologicalmonitoring. This technology, based on multiparameterflow cytometry, provides measurement of both extracel-lular surface markers and intracellular signalling within single cells. This approach can be used to distinguish basal, unevoked subsets of cells from evoked cells afterclinically-relevant stimulation, making it useful forimmunological monitoring. SCNP technology may helpin disease characterization by mapping deregulated path-ways. In pre-clinical drug profiling efforts, SCNP may beuseful in characterizing drug potency, target selectivity,and off-target activity, and resistance. Additionally, SCNP may assist in patient stratification and individual patient drug profiling. Thus, interroga tion of cell signaling with SCNP allows a direct means to classify disease activityand response to treatment. The relationships of signalingevents to each other can be used to infer a structure tothe immune system, providing useful immunologicalinformation during develop ment and clinical testing of immunotherapies.Daniel Normolle, PhD (University of Pittsburgh Can- cer Institute) presented on bio statistical considerations for biologics and biomarkers in oncology, summarizingthe limitations of the 3 + 3 design of early phase clinicalstudies and outlining alternative designs that includeimmunotherapy biomarker s. Among the limitations of the 3 + 3 trial design, often used in early clinical trials of biological therapies of cancers, is that this studydesign is intended for trea tments in which toxicities increase with dose. A large proportion of participantsare treated with sub-therapeutic doses. This studydesign can results in a slow dose escalation even when no dose limiting toxicities a re observed and there is no quantitative mechanism to e mploy prior understanding of toxicities in the design. While the 3 + 3 design can eliminate harmful doses from further testing, it is under-powered for selecting among the remaining doses. Thus,while this design can eliminate extremely toxic doses, itdoes not choose between doses that are not extremelytoxic and is less suited for evaluation of biological thera-pies that have low toxicities or toxicities that do notincrease with dosing. In the context of non-cytotoxic biological therapies, monitoring toxicity is distinct from escalating dose basedon toxicity. In the 3 + 3 design, if toxicity is low with agiven dose, the dose is automatically moved to the nexthighest dose, which may not be the best therapeuticdose. Moreover, if an added component reduces toxicity,escalating dose on toxicity may again fail to choose themost useful dose. Importantly, cohorts of 3 and 6 patients are often too small to provide meaningful statistical information to guide dosing decisions. Normolle outlined an alternate, adaptive design to escalating dose based on toxicities which incorporatedthe assessment of biomarkers. The alternate early trialdesign should be constructed to provide information toprove the principle and identify sources of variability inbiomarker assessment. It should estimate the biologically effective doses and eliminate ineffective doses as well as provide information on the relationships between bio-markers at biologically effective doses. An adaptive trialdesign of immunotherapies should establish immunologi-c a la c t i v i t ya tt h eh i g h e s td o s ea n dd e t e r m i n ei fl o w e rdoses are as effective as the highest dose, while avoidingineffective doses. Toxicity must be monitored and a glo-bal stopping rule for toxicity should be in place. In ran- domized trials, participants should be allocated equally to the dosing arms of the study. The studies can be designedas simple randomized trials, two- or three-staged rando-mized trials or as trials of combination therapy to reducetoxicity. It is critical that the trial be statistically poweredto achieve the primary objective of the study. Holden T. Maecker, PhD (Stanford University) dis- cussed prospects for new clinical flow cytometry assays.Butterfield et of Translational Medicine 2010, 8:130 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/8/1/130Page 7 of 9While clinical tests for cellular immunity are largely lacking, flow cytometry rep resents a powerful technol- ogy for dissecting cellular i mmune responses. In asses- sing immune responses it is useful to determine thenumber of functional and non-functional T cells specificto a particular antigen. Qualitative information on T cells to a specific antigen is also invaluable. Such qua- litative information may include the breadth of epitopesrecognized, the types of cytokines produced, degranula-tion or lytic capacity, and phenotypic markers on theT cells memory/eff markers, markers of exhaustion [PD-1], perforin, granzymes). Flow cytometrycan provide much of this information because it canused to measure multiple markers on individual cells, detect rare cell populations, and can measure both cellu- lar phenotypes and functions. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) has and standardized for flow cytometry using plateswith lyophilized antigen. This approach has been usefulin dissecting the cytokine profile of various T cell sub-sets in response to HIV and cytomegalovirus. Phospho-Flow assays are useful for the assessment of intracellular signaling as they can measure phosphorylation events in very short-term stimulated whole blood, PBMC, andother cells. These assays can measure multiple cell-sur-face and intracellular markers in combination, usingmultiparameter flow cytometry and detect signalingthrough T cell receptors, surface Ig, cytokines and othermolecules. Phospho-Flow assays may be used to detectsignaling defects in aging or immune-mediated diseases. Flow cytometry can provide useful information on early and late cellular immune responses and may have clini-cal utility in the assessment of cellular changes inresponse to various disease and treatment. Simplificationand standardization of methodology will be necessaryfor clinically useable tests [17]. In the final presentation, Howard L. Kaufman, MD (Rush University) discussed predictive biomarkers for tumor immunotherapy and whether the community is ready for clinical implemen tation. Kaufman outlined requirements for an ideal biomarker -that it correlate with disease progression or treatment response, be easilycollected and accurately measured, that it be validated,and that it be cost-effective. Biomarkers may be usefulfor monitoring adverse events , identifying potential tar- gets for drug discovery, and informing decisions about clinical trials, including selection of patients, endpoints and dosing. In immunotherapy studies, biomarkers haveincluded soluble factors (e.g., serum proteins, circulatingDNA, circulating tumor cells), tumor factors (e.g., recep-tor expression, cellular infiltrates), patients factors (indi-cators of humoral and cellular immune responses,immune system polymorphisms) and mathematical pre-dictions. Cancer immunotherapy trials have includedCD4 +,C D 8+T Treg responses and anti- body titre as predictors for clinical response. The utilityof these biomarkers has been limited by the small sizeof most of these trials, limited clinical response and bythe fact that biomarker analysis is often retrospectiveand unplanned for in the trial design. A number of biomarkers have been evaluated in IL-2 immunotherapy in renal cell including cell expansion, and levels of CD4 +CD25hiTreg cells. Kaufman et al have employed a computational model that includesdensity and distribution of the IL-2 receptor in conjunc-tion with delivered IL-2 dose to predict the clinical response to IL-2 immunotherapy for renal cell carci- noma. These otherpotential soluble and cellular biomarkers warrant incor-poration into prospective clinical trials of cancer immu-notherapies and further validation in larger trials. Thesession finished with a panel discussion led by Kirk-wood, Longo, Normolle, Maecker and Kaufman. In summary, the Symposium speakers presented pro- mising new data on emerging immune biomarkers in cancer. Several themes recurred through many of thepresentations: first, standardization and harmonizationefforts have identified critical parameters in patient sam-ple handling and assay conduct and reporting; second,we are observing clinical and subclinical autoimmunityin treated patients as well as extensive responses to selftumor antigens, which may indicate the critical role for in vivo cross-presentation; third, there were examples of large scale trials in which biomarkers were examinednot only in blood, but also in tumor and lymph nodes,which were highly significantly correlated to clinical out-come; and fourth, that the labs, taskforces, and societiesrepresented were all participating in overlapping colla-borations, indicating the success of working together.Intensive interaction betw een academia, industry and government -as represented in this iSBTc/SITC sympo- sium -is necessary to promote the development dictive biomarkers for improved cancer outcomesthrough immunotherapy.
