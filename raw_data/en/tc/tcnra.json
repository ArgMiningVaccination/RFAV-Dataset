We are here as a support to educate and walk you through how to be your own funeral director, a right you have by law. We are also here to provide ministerial services, helping you create and execute a service that is both healing and honoring. We will be available to you 24 hours a day for the duration of your set up and service\u2014usually 1 to 3 days. We will also help guide you through the logistics and paperwork. There's nothing to be afraid of. This is your legal right. Embalming is unnecessary and not required by law. There are non-invasive, non-toxic alternatives. There are places in the Bay Area that allow burial in a shroud or simple pine box. Most cemeteries require a concrete vault to be buried along with a casket. However, there are more environmentally friendly alternatives. Return to the natural way of burial. The average funeral in the U.S. costs $6500. The home funeral alternative saves you thousands, while doing the more environmental and loving thing for your loved one. Ceremonies can be 1 to 3 days rather than just a few hours. Most people believe that money equals honor; we believe that love and personal caring are the highest form of honoring your loved one. You get to treat your loved one with all the care and compassion they deserve, not hand the job over to a professional who does not love them the way you do. You get to stay with them for the amount of time you need to heal and say good-bye, rather than having them whisked away, embalmed, made up, and re-presented to you as something that doesn't feel quite right. You get to create a ceremony with your family and friends that honors who this person really was and a ceremony that incorporates your needs to help you heal from this loss more quickly. A full good-bye is a very healing thing. "}
