Box 670460 Cincinnati, OH 452670460 3/2015 FAQ'S What if I am unable to obtain documentation for my childhood vaccines? If official documentation is not obtainable from your physician's office, primary or secondary school or military records, the following is recommended: 1. Receive twostep TB testing (see below) 2. Receive a Tdap. 3. Have the following blood tests drawn - Rubeola antibody IgG, Mumps antibody IgG, Rubella antibody IgG. If you have completed the Hepatitis B series also have a Hepatitis B Surface antibody test drawn. 4. If you have had chickenpox, have a varicella antibody IgG drawn. If you have not had chickenpox receive 2 doses of vaccine. Do I have to get a MMR titer if I have documentation of two vaccines? The University of Cincinnati does not require it at this time. However there may be specific clinical sites that would require it. If you cannot provide documentation of 2 MMR vaccines, then a titer will be required. If the titer is negative, a booster will required followed by a repeat titer 30 days later. I had the Hepatitis B Vaccine years ago but did not get a titer, what should I do? If you have documentation of all three doses of Hepatitis B Vaccine have a titer drawn to see if you have antibodies (HBSAB). If the test is negative get a booster then retiter in 12 months. If this test is negative, you will have to repeat the series then retiter 12 months later. If no documentation is available from your original series, you will need to repeat the series then have a titer drawn 12 months later. I do not have immunity to hepatitis B after receiving 3 vaccines, now what do I do? Not all individuals will have a positive titer result after the initial 3 vaccinations. A protective antibody response is 10 or more milliinternational units per milliliter (>=10mIU/mL). You will get a booster and then retiter 1 month later. If at that point you show immunity, you are considered complete. If you are not yet showing immunity you will be receiving a 2 more vaccines and then a final titer four weeks after your last vaccine. After a total of 6 vaccines and final titer you will not be requested to obtain further vaccines. I had chickenpox, do I have to have varicella titer? YES. Most people who have had the disease will develop antibodies, however because there are some that may not, a titer is required. We have found about 8% of our health profession students with a history of disease have negative titers. Some histories are not totally reliable. For these reasons, we have to be 100% certain that we do our part to prevent the spread of this disease, to our patients. If your titer is positive, no further action is necessary. If your test is negative, you will have to get 2 doses of varicella vaccine. I had two doses of Varicella vaccine, do I need to have a titer drawn? No, the requirement is either a positive Varicella titer (VZVIGG) OR 2 doses of the varicella vaccine. A titer after the vaccine is not required. What is a Twostep TB test and do I need it? A twostep TB test is simply having a TB test administered, then having another one administered 1 3 weeks later. If you receive annual TB tests, you can submit your last 2 testing dates to meet the TB requirement. If you have not had a TB test within the past 2 years you will need to obtain a twostep test. Twostep testing is required for the initial skin testing of adults who are going to be tested periodically, such as health care workers. This twostep approach can reduce the likelihood that a boosted reaction to a subsequent skin test will be misinterpreted as a recent infection. For more information on twostep testing: www.cdc.gov/tb Why does UHS use secure email to communicate with me?

Revised 3/2015 COM student clinical rotation health records release University of Cincinnati University Health Services Notice Regarding Confiden tiality of Health Records Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA) The privacy of your health information is important to all of us at University Of Cincinnati Health Services. This Notice wil l tell you about the way we protect that privacy by complying wi th the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). What is FERPA? FERPA is a federal law that protects the pr ivacy of students' \"education records.\" The University of Cincinnati follows FERPA regulations because it receives funds that are administered by the U.S. Department of Education. Under FERPA, \"Education Records\" are very broadly defined as record s that are directly related to a student an d are kept by an educational agency or institution, or someone acting for the agency or institution. How does FERPA apply to my records at University Health Services at UC? Under FERPA, the records maintained by University Health Services (UHS) are either \"Treatment Records\" or \"Education Records.\" The majority of records maintained at UHS are cons idered to be \"Treatment Records\" under FERPA, including the records created by your healthcare provider or counselor while providing you with care. \"Treatment records\" are records that are made or maintained by a health care professional; are used only for your me dical or psychological treatment; and are available only to treatment providers. How does UHS use my Treatment Records? UHS uses your Treatment Records to provide you with heal thcare services. We may disclose your records to other healthcare providers who are also providing you with treatment. In general, we will ask you to sign a written consent form before we provide your information to another healthcare provider for treatment. If there is an emergency situation, however, we may provide this information to other providers for your treatment without having you sign a written consent. At your request, we will also provide your Treatm ent Records to a physician or other appropriate professional for review. Can my Student Health and Counseling Services treatment records be shared with people other than healthcare providers without my consent? In general, we will ask you to sign a written consent before we disclose your UHS records to anyone for a purpose other than treatment. In the following circumstances, as permitted by FERPA regulations, we may disclose your UHS records without your written consent: (a) to comply with a judicial order or lawful subpoena; (b) disclosure to the court in connection with a legal proceeding involving the University an d you or your parents; and (c) disclosure in connection with a health or safety emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health and safety of you or other persons; The FERPA regulations also list other situations in which we may discl ose your UHS records without your prior written consent. May I make a request to see my UHS records? Yes, you may make a written request to see your UHS records. We may provide you with copies of the records or arrange for a healthcare provider to be with you when you review them in order to explain the records and/or answer your questions. However, when your records ar e disclosed to you in this manner, they are considered Education Records (and no longer Treatment Records) and are covered by FERPA regulations govern ing Education Records. At other healthcare providers, I've been told that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) applies to my health records. Why doesn't HIPAA apply to my UC UHS records? UHS is covered by both FERPA and HIPAA re gulations. Federal regulations make clear that university Education Records and Treatment Records are excluded from coverage under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. Accordingly, the FERPA regulations prescribe the federal rules that UHS must follow in protecting the privacy of a student's medical and counseling records. If you receive health care from a medical provider ou tside of University Health Services, then the HIPAA regulations will apply to the records maintained by thos e facilities. Of course, all UC facilities also comply with any applicable state l aws and University policies regarding the privacy and confid entiality of healthcare records, including UHS. What about counseling or mental health records? In addition to FERPA, there are ot her state laws that place additional privacy protections and di sclosure restrictions on mental health and couns eling records, including records held at UHS. Where may I direct any other questions I may have about the privacy protections for my UC UHS records? University Rules 10.43.11 and 10.43.13 establish Un iversity of Cincinnati procedures for FERPA compliance. You may contact or the UC Direct or of Privacy at (513) 556-3483. What if I have a complaint? FERPA affords students the right to file a complaint with the U. S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, D.C. 20202-5920 I have been informed about the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
