Tracking COVID -19 Immunizations in Community ........................................ 18 Community Clinic Planning As vaccine rollout relies heavily on good collaboration, the roles and responsibilities will vary in each community and will be different in Communities that receive health services directly from FNHA and Communities with transfe rred health services. As seen in the tables below, t he 'Responsibility' column provides examples of who may be tasked with the action item. As part of your Community's clinic readiness process, please take the time needed to identify the responsible peopl e/roles. This document provides considerations for Communities that host their own clinics. When a Community collaborates with the Regional Health Authority (RHA) to host a vaccination clinic, there may be additional considerations than those found in this document. It would be prudent to connect with your RHA clinic partners ahead of time to ensure the clinic is planned to flow smoothly. COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 3 As Soon A s Possible Task # Task Responsibility 1 Ensure your Immunization Certification is up to date. If you are a new immunizer, please ensure you have completed the required process to be certified to provide COVID -19 immunizations. See Appendix A for educatio n requirements. Please email immunize@fnha.ca if you have any questions about this process. Immunizing Nurses 2 Ensure you are aware of how to navigate to the DST - the BCCDC Immunization Manual - o nline. If you have a paper copy of the DST, ensure you are keeping this up to date. Ensure you are signed up to receive DST updates from cdc@fnha.ca . Please email cdc@fnha.ca to sign up for this mailing list. CHN 3 Ensure access to FNHA Gathering Space folder for Nursing resources related to COVID -19 vaccine administration : https://partners.fnha.ca/sites/HomeandCommunityCare/Immunization%2 0Resources/COVID -19%20Vaccine%20Resources If you are a Nurse working in First Nations Communities in BC and do not have access to this folder, please follow these steps to request access: Fill out the request form at this link: https://www.fnha.ca/Documents/FNHA- Nursing -Services- Request -for- Access c ompleted form to panorama@fnha.ca CHN 4 Ensure cold chain equipment is in good working order: Vaccine fridges: Please make sure your vaccine fridge has had regular maintenance checks. If you do not have a fridge that can maintain temperature in the event of a power outage (i.e. TempArmour), ensure the vaccine fridge connects to a back- up generator. Ensure backup generator is working and has fuel. Temperature monitoring: Ensure calibrated data logger and min max thermometer. Identify a plan for 24 -hour monitoring and site process in the event of a cold chain break. Ensure familiarity with additional temperature monitoring and tracking required with mRNA vaccines. Refer to Appendix B for guidance. Ensure the most up to date vaccine -specific cold chain standard operating procedures a re posted near the vaccine fridge. Ensure vial labels and labels for pre -drawn syringes of mRNA vaccine are accessible. Refer to Appendix B for more information. CHN CHR 5 Ensure understanding of reporting process for cold chain breaks. In the event of a temperature excursion, complete the BCCDC Cold Chain Incident Form an d fax to your local RHA Public Health Unit. If you have questions on how to manage exposed vaccine and where to report, please email immunize@fnha.ca . CHN COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 4 Task # Task Responsibility 6 Ensure fa miliarity with reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs). Send AEFI Case Report Form to the Regional Health Authority as per instructions found on this AEFI is a plan in place for post -vaccine monitoring and for emergency response. Identify where clients can call to report adverse reactions following immunization if the event occurs after the client has left the clinic. Ensure supplies are available for post- vaccine monitoring and emergency response. Stock anaphylaxis kits as per the instructions found in Part 3 of the BCCDC Immunization Manual . Check the expiry date of the vials and ensure additional epinephrine vials are available on site . Ensure vital signs machine/blood pressure cuff is available on site in the event of an anaphylactic reaction Ensure there is a mat/cot on site CHN CHR 8 Ensure eF orm acce ss for documentation of vaccine and for verification of vaccine history . See Appendix C and Appendix D for more information. CHN Admin 9 Establish process for daily clinic safety huddles and implement interventions to mitigate errors ahead of hosting clinics. See Appendix E for error mitigation strategies. Ensure all immunizers are aware of incident reporting process. Nurses employed at FNHA direct service sites report through the Hailcista platform. Nurses employed in Communities providing transferred health services submit a paper incident reporting form to immunize@fnha.ca . Incident reports help inform education and error mitigation strategies. CHN Community Health Lead 10 Ensure there is an established internal process for tracking COVID -19 immunizations provided at your site. See Appendix G for some options to assist with tracking COVID -19 immunizations. Share the internal tracking process w ith all health staff in your community. CHN Administrativ e Data Entry Support 11 Define roles for no n-immunizing support staff if they are available to support the clinic. Consider any training that might be needed for clinic support staff . Examples: PPE use, infection control practices, accessing records , data entry requirements, cold chain consideratio ns (if applicable) CHN CHR 12 Explore community engagement sessions / opportunities / plan for vaccination promotion. Explore strategies to build vaccine confidence and how to respond to misinformation on social media, etc. Refer to communication tools in the BCCDC COVID -19 Vaccination Toolkit for Health Professionals w hen engaging with community members Immunization Communication Tool for Immunizers COVID -19 Immunizati on Communication Tool Community Health Lead CHN COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 5 When booking a clinic Task # Task Responsibility 1 Confirm clinic type Identify if this is a COVID -19 vaccination -only clinic or if other products be offered (i.e. influenza vaccine, school -program vaccines) Identify separation strategy for COVID -19 vaccine . It is NOT recommended that the same immunizer provide multiple types of COVID -19 vaccine for multiple indications during the same clinic. Each immunizer should be working with one type of COVID -19 vaccine, preferably for one indication (i.e. the Pediatric Pfizer for 5 -11 year olds only). Refer to Appendix E for error mitigation strategies . Community Health Lead CHN 2 Confirm v accine details Is vaccine available for the planned date? What p roduct (s) will you receive? When? How many doses?

Note: these supplies are required for mass clinic settings as well as during transport of vaccines Communities are responsible for supplying insulated coolers, freezer packs, min/max thermometers etc. for vaccine s. If FNHA -employed Nurses at FNHA Nursing Stations and Health Centres need vaccine transport supplies, please go through normal supply request channels with the Nursing Admin. Community Health Lead 6 Confirm ancillary supplies are on site Prep are kits for each vaccine indication. Refer to Appendix F for a list of items to include in the kit. *Note: Regional PPE hubs are receiving ancillary supplies such as needles, syringes (low dead volume syringes), swabs, Band -Aids, hand sanitizer, wipes, labels for pre- drawn syringes, etc. Put order request in with your PPE contact if supplies not already on site . Refer to Appendix B for links to labels if printing your own. CHN Community Health Lead and Regional PPE Lead 7 Advertise COVID -19 Vaccine Clinic FNHA -communities- and-local - governments Community Health Lead 8 Book appointments Allot 30 minutes or more for each appointment, and factor in 15- 30 minutes of observation time. Booked appointments are highly recommended for immunizing the pediatric population. Assess whether clients require accommodations at the clinic for a positive immunization experience. For example, a low stimulus vaccine clinic with reduced levels of noise, lowered lighting/sunglasses, easily disinfected calming toys etc (or if they can bring their own) may be helpful for some children. See sample poster for low stimul us vaccine clinic on the FNHA Gathering Space COVID -1 9 Vaccine Resources folder, under the heading of Clinic Planning . Share tips for reducing pain, stress, & anxiety with vaccinations an d resources with families like the CARD system for a more positive immunization experience. Complete BCCDC COVID -19 Vaccine Screening Checklist for scheduled clients to ensure smooth process on clinic day and to confirm the number of doses of ea ch product required For 'subsequent dose' clinics: o Ensure you have verified information regarding initial dose (s) for scheduled clients. See Appendix D for more information When booking, ask whether the client experienced any reactions following their previous dose(s) that impacted daily activities or where they sought medical attention. Assess need for CHN to report AEFIs. CHN and team COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 7 Task # Task Responsibility If AEFI previously reported for client, ensure reco mmendations from Medical Health Officer/RHA are reviewed prior to booking client 9 Arrange picking up doses, if applicable If picking up from RHA on the day of your clinic, relay this information to your RHA contact the day before so they can prepare the correct number of vials for pick up and confirm pick up time Refer to Appendix B for CHN responsibilities when receiving mRNA vaccine CHN Day Before Clinic Task # Task Responsibility 1 Confirm vaccine availability, clinic space, site logistics, staffing , ancillary supplies Ensure labels for mRNA vaccine vials and pr e-drawn syringes are accessible.

Community Health Lead CHN 2 Complete d aily clini c check -in and role confirmation with all staff Clearly define clinic flow , assign staff for various products and dosages , and discuss error prevention strategies. Refer to Appendix E Ensure immunizers have completed appropriate courses and have completed sign -off on appropriate Immunization Skills Checklist. Refer to Appendix A for more information . Provide each immunizer with appropriate kit for the product they are administering. Refer to Appendix F for list of items to include in kit Ensure the current version of the decision support tool (DST) - the BCCDC Immunization Manual - is accessible at each immunizer's station. Review any recent changes to the DST for the COVID -19 vaccine products as a group prior to the start of the clinic. P rint the vaccine product pages f rom the DST on the day of the clinic or use directly online . Review importance of applying labels to all COVID -19 vaccine vials, multi -dose influenza vials, and pre -drawn syringes of COVID -19 vaccines. Refer to Appendix B for links to labels if printing your own. Identify how immunizers will keep track of number of punctures for Moderna vials (cannot exceed 20 punctures for 0.2mg/ml Moderna Red Vial Cap (and cannot exceed 10 punctures for 0.1mg/ml Moderna Royal Blue Vial Cap). E.g. one immunizer per vial - use a tally sheet and/or dedicate 10 or 20 syringes per vi al. Confirm emergency management plan (AEFI/Anaphylaxis) with all immunizers and support staff. Identify who will be responsible for following up with adverse events following immunization if they occur after the clinic . This step is especially important if the immunizers are not local community providers. This individual will need to be available to submit AEFI reports and liaise with the client upon receipt of MHO recommendations. Ensure all immunizers have aftercare information accessible to provide to clients. Ensure all immunizers are aware of the callback number to provide to clients if they need to report any adverse reactions. Confirm immunizers have live access to eForm to review client's vaccine history. Confirm immunizers are aware of how to document doses accurately, to retain copy of documentation, and provide the client a vaccine record card. Lead CHN (Lead CHNs have routine immunization certification & experience immunizing all age groups) COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 9 Task # Task Responsibility Ensure immunizers have access to the tally sheet if this is utilized at your clinic.

Please reach out to your Regional Practice Consultant if any support is required or contact panorama@fnha.ca COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 13 Appendix D: Documentation Considerations for Second /Subsequent COVID -19 Vaccin e Clinics Verify initial dose (s) of COVID- 19 vaccine when planning for subsequent /booster dose clinics . Many of the clients presenting at subsequent /booster dose clinics will have received their first dose (s) in the same Community. However, some clients presenting at subsequent dose clinics may have received their previous dose (s) elsewhere and may not be in your Community's records. Please verify the date of previous dose (s) and the product these clients received prior to scheduling subsequent dose appointments. Please note: A designated lead Community Health Nurse likely receives a line list from the FNHA Panorama team containing COVID -19 doses administered at your Service Delivery Location (SDL ). The line list contains dose history f or clients up to the date that the line list was generated and ONLY contains doses administered at the specified SDL and correctly submitted into the system . The FNHA Immunization team does not recommend utilizing the line list to confirm client dose history . It is up to the immunizer to ensure the y have the client's complete vaccine history in order to determine eligibility and spacing for the subsequent dose prior to immunizing. Here are some ways to verify information regarding a client's initial dose (s) of COVID -19 vaccine: 1) eForm system a) Real-time eForm use at the point of care is best practice. By using the eForm system to complete general checks for immunization administration, the provider will be able to see information regarding the previous COVID -19 vaccine (s) (product type and date administered) while confirming the client's demographic information and SDL. b) If real -time eForm use is not available at point of care , the provider should check the eForm system a few days prior to the scheduled clinic in order to verify subsequent dose eligibility. 2) Verification through Panorama (PIR). Panorama charts are up to date for individuals that received COVID -19 vaccine at any SDL if there were no errors in the eForm /ImmsBC submission. a) If you have direct access to Panorama (PIR) but not the eForm system, please check their immunization profile in Panorama. b) If you do not have direct access to or are unable to access Panorama (PIR) or the eForm system, email the Panorama team to ask for verification. Email urgent inquiries to panorama@fnha.ca with the subject line \"Urgent Dose Verification C -19\". Please state in the email if a callback is preferred over an email for expediting response. The Panorama team will look up the immunization profile and email or call back with dose verification. IMPORTANT: eForm account access will be locked/deactivated if a user has not logged in or accessed the account for 90 consecutive days. Please ensure to test log into your eForm account at least a week prior to any clinics to ensure you are able to login successfully. If you require any further assistance, please contact us at panorama@fnha.ca . Please refer to the COVID -19 Immunization Entry eForm FAQ for more information. The FAQ includes documentation considerations when there are shared immunization clinics with the local Health Authority staff. The FAQ is found under the heading 'Documentation' in the COVID -19 Vaccine Resources folder o n the FNHA Gathering Space. COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 14 Appendix E: COVID -19 Vaccine Error Mitigation The purpose of this appendix is to highlight common COVID -19 vaccine errors and share ways to mitigate them. Health care sites may be managing up to multiple vaccine indications including: 1. Primary series a. 3-dose primary series for moderately to severely immunosuppressed b. 12+ 2 -dose primary series (Moderna & Pfizer) c. 5-11 2 -dose primary series (Pfizer preferred ) or 6-11 2 -dose primary series (Moderna) d. 6m-4y 2- dose primary series (Moderna) 2. Booster doses a. 0.5mL b ooster with Moderna vaccine b. 0.25 mL booster with Moderna vaccine c. 0.3mL booster with Pfizer vaccine 3. Influenza vaccine (all ages) This increased complexity raises the opportunities for errors. The most common or anticipated error is the client recei ving the incorrect vaccine . Error Mitigation T ips Carefully reviewing clinic set- up and clinic flow is key for error mitigation. RHA mass clinic sites dedicate specific areas, tables, nurses, and/or screeners to separate products and indications appropri ately and clients are repeatedly confirmed for what vaccine they should be receiving. Rural and remote sites may not have the space or resources to implement similar separation and multiple layers of confirmation. To mitigate risk of errors, we strongly recommend that immunizers do not concurrently administer multiple COVID -19 vaccine products for multiple indications. Identify a separation strategy for your clinics. Consider separating by time of the day or week or by immunizer if you have capacity . (i.e. will all immunizers provide COVID -19 vaccine for one indication only during the allotted time or will there be different immunizers assigned to different products/indications? ). The most appropriate level of separation will vary by site and community needs. Please consider administering multiple products only if there is enough space and human resources to clearly implement separation and when more than one person can validate/con firm correct vaccine for clients. Examples: One immunizer providing Moderna vaccine for 6m -4y/o and another providing Pfizer for 5- 11 One immunizer providing 0.5mL boosters and primary series with Moderna vaccine, another immunizer providing 0.25mL boos ters with Moderna vaccine , another immunizer providing 0.3mL Pfizer primary series and boosters for 12+, another immunizer providing pediatric Pfizer (5-11) vaccine Adults Moderna 1 st, 2nd, 3rd doses from 9 -11am, then Adults Pfizer from 12 -2pm, then Pfi zer Pediatric 5 -11 from 3 -5pm. Monday Adults Moderna, Tuesday Pfizer Adults, Wednesday Pfizer Pediatrics. The following pages contain examples of errors and mitigation strategies gathered from FNHA reports, Regional Health Authorities' reports, ISMP Canada Safety Bulletins, and ISMP Frequently Asked Questions about COVID -19 Vaccines. Please reference the following table when planning your clinic to identify strategies that can be implemented at your site. COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 15 Error Examples Error Mitigation Actions Storage and Handling Vaccine stored or transported outside of recommended temperature range. Product refrozen once thawed, resulting in vaccine wastage. Power outage resulted in vaccine wastage. Prior to transporting vaccine, ensure there is direct communication between senders and receivers about the product and thaw information. Utilize Moderna or Pfizer specific Total Transport Log. Clearly label all vials with thaw date and time. Refer to Appendix B for links to labels if printing your own. Separate vials by type when storing. Ensure the most up to date vaccine-specific cold chain standard operating proc edures a re posted near the vaccine fridge. Ensure there is plan to maintain cold chain in the event of a power outage. Clinic Screening Eligible Clients Not Offered Vaccine Client recovered from COVID -19 was not offered vaccine Immunizers to review the DST - specifically the relevant BCCDC Immunization Manual Biological Product p ages - prior to start of clinic & have on hand throughout clinic , with particular attention to eligible populations Ensure immunizers are signed up to receive emails from cdc@fnha.ca for important practice updates and aware to email immunize@fnha.ca if there are questions about eligibility. Vaccine Preparation Incorrect vaccine dilution for Pfizer vaccine Pfizer prepared with too little volume of diluent Pfizer prepared w ith too much volume of diluent Pfizer prepared with no dilution, syringe was filled with air instead of normal saline If your site will be handling both Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, separate the vaccine and create specific kits for each indication. See Appendix F for more information regarding kit contents. When preparing the vaccine, dedicate a space where only one vaccine / kit is on the table and only one person is preparing the vaccine. Wherever possible, only pre -draw one vial at a time. Vaccine dilution/preparation instructions should be visible and referenced with each vial. Utilize a second person check for correct diluent volume in syringe prior to injecting into vaccine vial. COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 16 Incorrect vaccine drawn up Significant bubble in syringe ca using administration of less than intended volume Pfizer vaccine labelled as Moderna or vice versa Syringe drawn up with normal saline instead of vaccine Same actions as above Use low dead vol ume (LDV) syringes and needles Label all pre -drawn doses immediately . Refer to Appendix B for links to labels if printing your own. When gathering syringes and needles for preparing vaccine, only gather enough material to draw up one vial. It makes it easier to detect that a n error is present if the number of syringes/needles used doesn't match the intended number of doses for the vial. Vaccine Administration Administered dose at less than minimum/ recommended interval Client received first dose from RHA and so first dose is not on the list; client states received vaccine a month ago but misremembers the date Client received booster dose too early Review client vaccine history using the live eForm tool or the PIR/Panorama - this allows the immunizer to view immunizations given at other locations with real time information on documented doses Ensure immunizers are referencing appropriate biological product pages to determine appropriate intervals between vaccines, paying close attention to relevant footnotes Administered wrong product/dose for the age group Pre-drawn syringes for multiple age groups placed near each other Syringes not labelled or label not checked Child looked older and DOB was not confirmed by nurse Siblings provided incorrect product for ag e Develop a plan for segregating and storing adult and pediatric COVID -19 vaccines in refrigerators and coolers so these are organized and properly labeled. Store the adult (12 years and older) and pediatric (5- 11) and mini-pediatric (6m-4y) COVID -19 vaccines apart from one another, such as in separate labeled plastic bins. Confirm DOB and age of client when booking appointments At start of clinic, write on poster/display board date of birth range for that clinic indication. Apply labels to vaccine vials and pre- drawn syringes, ensuring product information is clear visible and legible. If possible, have screeners verify date of birth Immunizing nurse should always confirm date of birth . Involve the parent or client in verifying the vaccine by reading the vial label or pre -drawn syringe label to confirm the correct vaccine. Confirm dose amount and dose concentration being mindful that the same dose amount could contain different concentration depending on product Manage noise levels and work with colleagues to limit distractions during clinic. Some have found it helpful to request assistance from clinic support staff when immunizing large families and/or multiple siblings COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page 17 Documentation Incorrect documentation Documented vaccine administration on the wrong client as the name were similar If documenting directly into eForm system, complete search using PHN and then confirm details match (name/DOB/etc) If completing a downtime form , document all indicated information on form and ensure it is legible - if details do not match upon attempt to enter into eForm system, follow- up with client to confirm the details prior to submitting into eForm system Immunizer s should review the community line list or the client charts to ensure that all administered doses appear correctly in the system (regardless of whether the doses are documented by admin istrative staff or the care provider ) Appendix F: Product Kit List The following is in addition to current processes used to set up your clinic . Create a k it for each product/indication in an a ppropriately sized container to keep all below items . 1. Part 1: Clinic Table/Area a. Name of Product and Indication as display sign. Include date of birth range, if appropriate. b. Product and lot # written down, ready for documentation on paper or computer record. 2. Part 2: Vaccine Preparation a. Based on the estimated number of vials needed for the clinic, prepare diluent (if needed), syringes and needles for diluent (if needed), syringes and needles for doses, alcohol swabs, labels for pre -drawn syringes, appropriate pen for labelling and documentation b. Instructions for how to prepare the product for specific indication 3. Part 3: Additional Reference Materials a. HealthlinkBC file for COVID -19 vaccine and/or relevant posters b. BCCDC COVID -19 Vaccine Aftercare Sheet c. BCCDC Vaccine Screening Checklist d. BCCDC COVID -19 Vaccine Eligibility table e. Appropriate and current BCCDC DST pages f. Wallet cards to provide to clients COVID -19 Vaccine: Clinic Planning Checklist July 25, 2022 Page Tracking COVID -19 Immunizations in Community eForm submissions continue to be the required documentation tool for COVID -19 clinics in First Nations Communities. However, u pon submission of the eForm, the Community should also securely retain a record of their COVID -19 clinics. There have been scenarios where downtime forms are missed or entered incorrec tly and doses do not appear in P anorama or do not appear correctly. For this reason, it is important that there is an established internal process for tracking immunizations provided so the information is not lost in the event that remediation is required. Options: Securely store downtime forms (or printed PDF copies of th e eForm) Utilize alternative internal documentation system used in your Community (i.e. secured spreadsheet or master list) COVID -19 Immunization Clinic Tally Sheet which you may choose to use if your community does not already have an internal documentation system in place (See next page for sample - please print in Legal size ) Please note: Internal tracking is not considered legal immunization documentation. eForm submission continues to be the required documentation tool for COVID -19 clinics in First Nations Communities Please share the internal tracking process with all health staff in your Community. immunize@fnha.ca | Community and Public Health Team | July 2022 COVID -19 Immunization Clinic Tally Sheet Purpose: This form can be used to track COVID -19 immunizations administered at your site.
