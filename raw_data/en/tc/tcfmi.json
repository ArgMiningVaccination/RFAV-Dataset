BPE Agenda Page 40INDIANA COMMISSION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION New Program Proposal Form For BPE Authorized Institutions A.A.S in Medical Assist ant Technology To Be Offered by Lincoln College of Technology in Indianapolis , IN Degree Award Level2: Associate's Degree Mode of Delivery (In-person or Online3): Online Career Relevant/Out -of-Classroom Experiences 4: Internship Suggested CIP Code5 for Program: 51.0801 Name of Person Preparing this Brent Jenkins Telephone Number and Email Address: 317-632-5553 brentjenkins@lincolntech.edu Date the Form was Prepared (Use date last revised): 4/7/2023 BPE Agenda Page 411 The format: [degree designation] in [field of study]. Examples of program names are A.S. in Nursing or B.S. in Business Administration. The term \"program\" refers to an approved set of courses or a curriculum, completion of which leads to the award of an undergraduate or graduate certificate or an associate or a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Some institutions use the term \"major\" interchangeably with \"degree program,\" in which case the Commission will also regard the major as a degree program. Programs approved by the Commission are listed in its Academic Program Inventory (API), a comprehensive listing of all active and inactive certificate and degree programs at all levels offered by Indiana colleges and universities. The term \"program\" does not typically refer to a curricular subdivision, such as a major, concentration, specialization, track, or option. However, under some circumstances, such as those relating to workforce needs, economic development, accreditation requirements, licensure/certification, the Commission may regard curricular subdivisions as programs needing to be approved by the Commission and listed in the API. 2 The \"Degree Award Level\" refers to the following categories (see Degree Award Level Definitions for additional detail. 1. Award of Less than One Academic Year 2. Award of at Least One but Less than Two Academic Years 3. Associate's Degree 4. Postsecondary Award, Certificate, or Diploma of at Least Two but Less than Four Academic Years 5. Bachelor's Degree 6. Post -Baccalaureate Certificate 7. Master's Degree 8.

The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Readiness Competencies and Statewide Career Relevance Definition provide additional information about student engagement experiences with career relevance. 5 CIP Code refers to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), a six-digit code in the form of xx.xxxx that identifies instructional program specialties offered by educational institutions. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) developed these codes as a taxonomy for reporting student enrollment and degree completion data by area of study to the federal government. The State of Indiana uses these codes for similar purposes. The CIP taxonomy is organized on three levels (2-digit, 4-digit, 6-digit). The 2-digit series (sometimes called a CIP family), represents the most general groupings of related programs while the 6 -digit codes represent specific instructional programs. NCES initially published CIP codes in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020.

Rationale for the Program BPE Agenda Page 456 a. Institutional Rationale (Alignment with Institutional Mission and Strengths) Why is the institution proposing this program and how does it build upon institutional strengths? This program provides medical assistants with the opportunity to pursue additional training that adds medical administrative training to the clinical skills. It allows students to graduate with an Associate's degree which provides additional career opportunities and progressions in the work place . Our Program Advisory Committee shared their interest in students trained in both clinical and clerical skills. How is it consistent with the mission of the institution and how does this program fit into the inst itution's strategic plan (please provide a link to the strategic plan)? The program trains the student s to a level of proficiency that qualifies them for entry level as a medical assistant. Students are trained to be multi -functional medical assistants, thoroughly prepared to perform front office and clinical patient care duties. b. State Rationale: General How does this program address state priorities as reflected in the Commission's most recent strategic plan Reaching Higher In a State of Change ? The associates program addresses a number of items in the Reaching Higher in a State of change Strategic Plan Blueprint . First, Lincoln Tech's pathway allows students enrolled in the medical assisting program to be awarded a diploma as they continue toward their associate degree. Following the completion of the program, students are prepared to sit for the RMA exam. In addition, LT Career Services offers Career Edge, an online learning experience in addition to guest speakers, field trips, and assistance with finding a job. The Career Edge program prepares students for the soft skill aspect of employment. c. State Rationale: Equity -Related How does this program address the Equity section of Reaching Higher In a State of Change (see pages 15-17), especially with respect to considerations of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and geography? The graduat ion rate of LT's medical assisting program has shown success in closing the achievement gap among race and gender. The program has a gender breakdown of 92% female to 8% male. This program will provide female graduates with marketable skills to be employed. Lincoln employs someone who focuses on Student Services. The position keeps a food pantry on campus, assists with finding local housing or helps set them up at the Extended Stay, local child- care services or 24-hour care, and provides bus passes. This position also helps students who live relatively close set -up carpooling. Lincoln also has gas cards for students in need. The Student Services Coordinator scours a variety of sources for scholarships, talks to classes, and helps students complete the scholarships. All students are provided a laptop, stethoscope and scrubs on the first day of scho ol to begin their professional journey. Students have an option to purchase a laptop as part of the program or they may bring their own. The skills and equ ipment position them for better hiring opportunities upon graduation. BPE Agenda Page 467 The Internship class provides students with the opportunity for an employer to see the students skillset for five weeks, at no cost to the employer.

Examples of program names are A.S. in Nursing or B.S. in Business Administration. The term \"program\" refers to an approved set of courses or a curriculum, completion of which leads to the award of an undergradu ate or graduate certificate or an associate or a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Some institutions use the term \"major\" interchangeably with \"degree program,\" in which case the Commission will also regard the major as a degree program. Programs a pproved by the Commission are listed in its Academic Program Inventory (API), a comprehensive listing of all active and inactive certificate and degree programs at all levels offered by Indiana colleges and universities. The term \"program\" does not typica lly refer to a curricular subdivision, such as a major, concentration, specialization, track, or option. However, under some circumstances, such as those relating to workforce needs, economic development, accreditation requirements, licensure/certification , the Commission may regard curricular subdivisions as programs needing to be approved by the Commission and listed in the API. 2 The \"Degree Award Level\" refers to the following categories (see Degree Award Level Definitions for additional detail. 1. Award of Less than One Academic Year 2. Award of at Least One but Less than Two Academic Years 3. Associate's Degree 4. Postsecondary Award, Certificate, or Diploma of at Least Two but Less than Four Academic Years 5. Bachelor's Degree 6. Post -Baccalaureate Certificate 7. Master's Degree 8.

The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Readiness Competencies and Statewide Career Relevance Definition provide additional information about student engagement experiences with career relevance. 5 CIP Code refers to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), a six -digit code in the form of xx.xxxx that identifies instructional program specialties offered by educational institutions. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) developed these codes as a taxonomy for reporting student enrollme nt and degree completion data by area of study to the federal government. The State of Indiana uses these codes for similar purposes. The CIP taxonomy is organized on three levels (2 -digit, 4 -digit, 6 -digit). The 2 -digit series (sometimes called a CIP fami ly), represents the most general groupings of related programs while the 6 -digit codes represent specific instructional programs. NCES initially published CIP codes in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. BPE Agenda Page 642 1.

Rationale for the Program a. Institutional Rationale (Alignment with Institutional Mission and Strengths) Why is the institution proposing this program and how does it build upon institutional strengths? How is it consistent with the mission of the institution and how does this progra m fit into the institution's strategic plan (please provide a link to the strategic pl an)? The Diagnostic Medical Sonography program at the John Patrick University of Health and Applied Sciences is designed to train individuals to become skilled in using ultrasound technology . Diagnostic Medical Sonography is a rewarding career in healthcare, where the sonographer plays a critical role in helping healthcare providers diagnose and treat medical conditions. The curriculum covers various topics such as anatomy and physiology, ultrasound physics, patient care and communication, and pathology. Students will learn how to operate ultrasound equipment, perform scans, and analyze images to identify abnormalities . The program emphasizes the importance of p atient care and communication skills, as sonographers work closely with patients to ensure their comfort and safety during the scanning process. Students will also learn about legal and ethical considerations in medical sonography, safety, and professional development. This program requires an externship, where the student is placed in the clinical setting for college credit. During the externship, students will work under the supervision of licensed sonographers in healthcare settings such as hospitals, clinics, or imaging centers. This practical experience provides students with valuable hands -on training and the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills in a real -world setting. BPE Agenda Page 7210 There is a shortage of healthcare workers in the United States and t his includes allied healthcare workers that typically need specialized, technical training. JPU has the means to reduce the workface shortages by offering new programs such as diagnostic medical sonography. JPU has already proven successful in offering pr ograms through distance learning formats. The DMS program will use online classroom instruction, ultrasound simulation technology, and a hands -on clinical externship, to present a distinctive and comprehensive learning experience. JPU's dedication to sound educational infrastructure and teaching practices ensures the quality of education and maximizes students' learning outcomes. The DMS program clearly aligns with the mission statement as it will help students develop ultrasound skills , building competent entry -level scanners by the end of the program. The DMS program aligns with industry standards in curriculum to ensure student success in this technical field. Strategically, as a school with a strong focus on becoming a comprehensive institution in the field of radiological science, the addition of dedicated ultrasound program is of utmost importance. This program will not only support our strategic goal of program growth but also bring about positive changes in terms of community recognition and vendo r relationships. By adhering to industry standards and providing students with a clear understanding of the pathways to credentials, JPU aims to establish itself as a leading institution in the ultrasound education field. JPU's Strategic Plan is available here . b. State Rationale: General How does this program address state priorities as reflected in the Commission's most recent strategic plan Reaching Higher In a State of Change? JPU's online Diagnostic Medical Sonography program is well equipped to meet the CHE's priorities of completion, equity, and talent. Completion: An online ultrasound program can help students complete their education by providing a flexible and convenien t way to earn the necessary qualifications for a career in ultrasound. Online programs can offer asynchronous learning, allowing students to study on their own time and at their own pace. This can be particularly helpful for students who are working or hav e other commitments that make traditional classroom learning difficult . JPU offers classes year -round, allowing students more flexibility in their pathway to completion, be it at an accelerated pace or as a part -time student. Equity: JPU's Online ultras ound program can also help promote equity in higher education by reducing barriers to entry. For example, students who may not have access to a physical ultrasound program in their area can still pursue their education and career goals through an online pr ogram. Additionally, online programs can often be more affordable than traditional programs, which can help make education more accessible to a wider range of students. JPU is dedicated to creating an environment that is learner -centric, including personal ization of BPE Agenda Page 7311 education and tools students need to succeed. Talent: JPU's online ultrasound program can help Indiana and other states develop and retain talented individuals in the healthcare industry by providing high -quality education and training. By at tracting and retaining skilled healthcare professionals, Indiana can strengthen its healthcare system and improve patient outcomes. The program aims to bring high -quality sonography education that exceeds accreditation standards. c. State Rationale: Equity -Related How does this program address the Equity section of Reaching Higher In a State of Change (see pages 15 -17), especially with respect to considerations of race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and geography? When considering equity in higher education JPU's online Diagnostic Medical Sonography program removes or reduces barriers in many ways. Accessibility: Anyone with access to a device and the internet can attend classes at JPU. This reduces barriers to edu cation for those who live in rural areas and have mobility, or transportation struggles. Diversity: As an online program, students will have the opportunity to learn in an environment that allows students to connect with others from different backgrounds , geographical locations, abilities, and cultures. JPU will create an inclusive environment, encouraging students to connect their learning with their own experiences and share those experiences so others can gain insight and understanding. Socioeconomic : JPU offers many tuition, loan and scholarship options for students. Care has been taken to find affordable learning material and class design to optimize credit hours. The online component improves affordability by not requiring on -campus living or relo cation to attend. d. Evidence of Labor Market Need National, State, or Regional Need o Is the program serving a national, state, or regional labor market need? Please describe. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected growth in Diagnostic Medical Sonogra phy from 2021 -2031 to be 10% or about 14,700 jobs. This is faster than the average growth in other occupations. In -person programs and online programs cap their enrollment, thus limiting the current number of students able to enter the field each year. To meet the growing needs, programs need to increase their enrollment, or new programs need to be developed. Additionally, many schools are in or near high -population areas to maximize enrollment, which creates barriers for rural and low -population areas. An online program can bring ultrasound education to places that need it. There are currently only 5 programs in the United States that BPE Agenda Page 7412 are fully online, and only one of these programs offers a degree. With new simulation ultrasound technology, portabl e ultrasound units, and high -quality internet -based learning platforms, creating an online ultrasound program will fill workforce gaps throughout the country. e. Placement of Graduates Please describe the principal occupations and industries, in which the majority of graduates are expected to find employment. If the program is primarily a feeder for graduate programs, please describe the principal kinds of graduate programs, in which th e majority of graduates are expected to be admitted. Diagnostic medical sonographers are employed in multiple healthcare settings such as hospitals , clinics, imaging centers , and mobile imaging services. Students may also find opportunities in related f ields such as research , development , and education. f. Job Titles List specific job titles and broad job categories that would be appropriate for a graduate of this program. Students graduating from JPU with an AAS in Diagnostic Medical Sonography will mainly find employment as a diagnostic medical sonographer, which goes under many titles such as sonographer, ultrasound technologist, or ultrasound technician. 6.

Examples of program names are A.S. in Nursing or B.S. in Business Administration. The term \"program\" refers to an approved set of courses or a curriculum, completion of which leads to the award of an undergraduate or graduate certif icate or an associate or a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Some institutions use the term \"major\" interchangeably with \"degree program,\" in which case the Commission will also regard the major as a degree program. Programs approved by the Commiss ion are listed in its Academic Program Inventory (API), a comprehensive listing of all active and inactive certificate and degree programs at all levels offered by Indiana colleges and universities. The term \"program\" does not typically refer to a curricu lar subdivision, such as a major, concentration, specialization, track, or option. However, under some circumstances, such as those relating to workforce needs, economic development, accreditation requirements, licensure/certification, the Commission may regard curricular subdivisions as programs needing to be approved by the Commission and listed in the API. 2 The \"Degree Award Level\" refers to the following categories (see Degree Award Level Definitions for additional detail. 1. Award of Less than One Academic Year 2. Award of at Least One but Less than Two Academic Years 3. Associate's Degree 4. Postsecondary Award, Certificate, or Diploma of at Least Two but Less than Four Academic Years 5. Bachelor's Degree 6. Post -Baccalaureate Certificate 7. Master's Degree 8.

Doctor's Degree -Other 3 For Commission purposes, \"online\" includes two categories: 100% online and blended programs, i.e. 80-99% is online, with the remaining portion in -person. 4 Career Relevant/Out -of-Classroom Experiences include, but are not limited to, co -ops, internships, clinicals, practica, capstone projects, employer critiques, and study abroad programs. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Readiness Competencies and Statewide Career Relevance Definition provide additional information about student engagement experiences with career relevance. 5 CIP Code refers to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), a six -digit code in the form of xx.xxxx that identifies instructional program specialties offered by educational institutions. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) developed these codes as a taxonomy for reporting student enrollme nt and degree completion data by area of study to the federal government. The State of Indiana uses these codes for similar purposes. The CIP taxonomy is organized on three levels (2 -digit, 4 -digit, 6 -digit). The 2 -digit series (sometimes called a CIP fami ly), represents the most general groupings of related programs while the 6 -digit codes represent specific instructional programs. NCES initially published CIP codes in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. BPE Agenda Page 902 1.

Rationale for the Program a. Institutional Rationale (Alignment with Institutional Mission and Strengths) Why is the institution proposing this program and how does it build upon institutional strengths? How is it consistent with the mission of the institution and how does this program fit into the institution's strategic plan (please provide a link to the strategic plan)? The Natural Medicine program at the John Patrick University of Health and Applied Sciences is designed to train individuals to become skilled in natural, complementary and alternative medical modalities and assume roles as health and wellness professionals in private business and industry, community organizations, and public health and alternative care settings. The curriculum covers various topics such as anatomy and physiology, naturopathic principles , practices, laws, & e thics , nutritional biochemistry, functional medicine blood lab and h erbal, vitamin & mineral therapies . The program emphasizes the importance of client care and a cquire the professional tools and experience for entry -level integrative wellness and public health positions . This program does not require an externship . This does require an on -campus practical experience during the first semester of studies and provides students with valuable hands -on training and the opportunity to apply their foundational knowledge of natural medicine and skill s with their professors and classmates. There is a shortage of healthcare workers in the United States and this includes allied healthcare workers that typically need specialized, technical training. JPU has the means to reduce the workface short ages by offering new programs such as natural medicine . Overall employment of healthcare practitioners and technical workers is at a growth rate of 6% (as fast as the national average) , et al Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupatio nal Outlook Handbook , October 2022. Additional employment in the fields of health education specialists and community health workers is projected to grow 12 percent from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. About 16,000 openings for health education specialists and community health workers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor BPE Agenda Page 979 force, such as to retire et al Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook , October 2022. JPU has already proven successful in offering programs through distance learning formats. The Natural Medicine program will use o nline classroom instruction, industry -relevant technologies and tools, and a n on-campus practical experience to present a distinctive and comprehensive learning experience. JPU's dedication to sound educational infrastructure and teaching practices ensures the quality of education and maximizes students' learning outcomes. The Natural Medicine program clearly aligns with the mission statement as it will help students evaluate, analyze, and synthesize information to become more skillful at creating solutions in an integrative wellness and public health career environment by the end of the program. The Natural Medicine program aligns with industry standards in curriculum to ensure student success in this occupational field. Strategically, a s a school with a strong focus on becoming a comprehensive institution in the field of allied health science s, the addition of dedicated natural medicine program is of utmost importance. This program will not only support our strategic goal of program gro wth but also bring about positive changes in terms of community recognition and vendor relationships. By adhering to industry standards and providing students with a clear understanding of the pathways to credentials, JPU aims to establish itself as a lead ing institution in the natural medicine, complementary and alternative medicine education field. JPU's Strategic Plan is a vailable here . b. State Rationale: General How does this program address state priorities as reflected in the Commission's most recent strategic plan Reaching Higher In a State of Change? JPU's online Natural Medicine program is well equipped to meet the CHE's priorities of completion, equity, and talent. Completion: An online natural medicine program can help students complete their education by providing a flexible and convenient way to earn the necessary qualifications for a career in natural medicine, complementary and alternative medicine . Online programs can offer asynchronous learning, allowing students to study on their own time and at their own pace. This can be particularly helpful for students who are working or have other commitments that make traditional classroom learning difficult . JPU offers classes year -round, allowing students more flexibility in their pathway to completion, be it at an accelerated pace or as a part -time student. Equity: JPU's Online natural medicine program can also help promote equity in higher education by reducing barriers to entry. For example, students who may not have access to a physical natural medicine program in their area can still pursue their education and career goals through an online program. Additionally, online programs can often b e more affordable than traditional programs, which can help make education more accessible to a wider range of students. JPU is dedicated to creating an environment that is learner -centric, including personalization of education and tools students need to succeed. BPE Agenda Page 9810 Talent: JPU's online natural medicine program can help Indiana and other states develop and retain talented individuals in the healthcare industry by providing high -quality education and training. By attracting and retaining skilled healthcare p rofessionals, Indiana can strengthen its healthcare system and improve patient outcomes. The program aims to bring high -quality natural medicine, complementary and alternative medicine education that exceeds accreditation standards. c. State Rationale: Equity -Related How does this program address the Equity section of Reaching Higher In a State of Change (see pages 15 -17), especially with respect to considerations of race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and geography? When consideri ng equity in higher education JPU's online Natural Medicine program removes or reduces barriers in many ways. Accessibility: Anyone with access to a device and the internet can attend classes at JPU. This reduces barriers to education for those who live i n rural areas and have mobility, or transportation struggles. Diversity: As an online program, students will have the opportunity to learn in an environment that allows students to connect with others from different backgrounds, geographical locations, abilities, and cultures. JPU will create an inclusive environment, encouraging students to connect their learning with their own experiences and share those experiences so others can gain insight and understanding. Socioeconomic: JPU offers many tuition, loan and scholarship options for students. Care has been taken to find affordable learning material and class design to optimize credit hours. The online component improves affordability by not requiring on -campus living or relocation to attend. d. Evidence of Labor Market Need National, State, or Regional Need o Is the program serving a national, state, or regional labor market need? Please describe. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected growth in overall employment of healthcare practitioners and technical workers is at a growth rate of 6% (as fast as the national average), et al Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupation al Outlook Handbook, October 2022. Additional employment in the fields of health education specialists and community health workers is projected to grow 12 percent from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. About 16,000 openings for health education specialists and community health workers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to BPE Agenda Page 9911 result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force , such as to retire et al Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, October 2022. In-person programs and online programs cap their enrollment, thus limiting the current number of students able to enter the field e ach year. To meet the growing needs, programs need to increase their enrollment, or new programs need to be developed. Additionally, many schools are in or near high -population areas to maximize enrollment, which creates barriers for rural and low -popul ation areas. An online program can bring natural medicine education to places that need it. e. Placement of Graduates Please describe the principal occupations and industries, in which the majority of graduates are expected to find employment. If the pr ogram is primarily a feeder for graduate programs, please describe the principal kinds of graduate programs, in which the majority of graduates are expected to be admitted. Natural Medicine graduates may seek employment in multiple healthcare settings such as public health departments, community wellness centers, integrative wellness clinics, traditional medical clinics incorporating complementary and alternative medicine gui dance, fitness and wellness centers, natural and pharmaceutical research facilities, data science collection and research, health research and writing, and independent consultants (both in -person and virtual.) The Natural Medicine program also provides a continued pathway to continue their education at JPU to earn their upper -division degrees in BS in Integrative Health & Lifestyle Medicine and MS in Integrative and Functional Medicine. f.

Examples of program names are A.S. in Nursing or B.S. in Business Administration. The term \"program\" refers to an approved set of courses or a curriculum, completion of which leads to the award of an under graduate or graduate certificate or an associate or a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Some institutions use the term \"major\" interchangeably with \"degree program,\" in which case the Commission will also regard the major as a degree program. Progr ams approved by the Commission are listed in its Academic Program Inventory (API), a comprehensive listing of all active and inactive certificate and degree programs at all levels offered by Indiana colleges and universities. The term \"program\" does not t ypically refer to a curricular subdivision, such as a major, concentration, specialization, track, or option. However, under some circumstances, such as those relating to workforce needs, economic development, accreditation requirements, licensure/certific ation, the Commission may regard curricular subdivisions as programs needing to be approved by the Commission and listed in the API. 2 The \"Degree Award Level\" refers to the following categories (see Degree Award Level Definitions for additional detail. 1. Award of Less than One Academic Year 2. Award of at Least One but Less than Two Academic Years 3. Associate's Degree 4.

Rationale for the Program a. Institutional Rationale (Alignment with Institutional Mission and Strengths) Why is the institution proposing this program and how does it build upon institutional strengths? How is it consistent with the mission of the institution and how does this program fit into the institution's strategic plan (please provide a link to the strategic pl an)? The Radiation Therapy Technology program at the John Patrick University of Health and Applied Sciences is designed to train individuals to become skilled as members of the radiation oncology team in the role of radiation therapist . Radiation Therapy Technology is a rewarding career in healthcare, where the radiation therapist performs a critical role in helping healthcare providers treat cancer and other conditions in the patients they serve . The curriculum covers various topics such as anatomy and physiology, radiation physics, patient care and communication, and clinical o ncology . Students will learn how to operate treatment simulation and treatment delivery equipment to safely and effectively deliver radiation treatments to treat cancer and other conditions. The program emphasizes the importance of patient care and commun ication skills, as radiation therapists work closely with patients to ensure their comfort and safety during the simulation and treatment processes. Students will also learn about legal and ethical considerations in radiation therapy , radiation safety, and professional development. This program requires clinical practic um sessions , where the student is placed in the clinical setting for college credit. During each clinical practicum session , students will work under the supervision of licensed and registered radiation therapists and other qualified practitioners in radiation oncology in healthcare settings such as hospitals or free-standing cancer clinics. This practical experience provides students with valuable and required hands -on training and the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills in a real -world setting. There is a shortage of healthcare workers in the United States and this includes allied healthcare workers that typicall y need specialized, technical training. JPU has the means to reduce the workface shortages by offering new programs such as radiation therapy at the Associate's degree level . JPU has already proven successful in offering programs through distance learning formats. The radiation therapy program will use online classroom instruction and hands -on clinical practic um sessions to present a distinctive and comprehensive learning experience. JPU's dedication to sound educational infrastructure and teaching practic es ensures the quality of education and maximizes positive students learning outcomes. BPE Agenda Page 12210 The radiation therapy program clearly aligns with the JPU mission statement as it will help students develop skills in radiation therapy technology , developing competen t entry -level radiation therapists by the end of the program. The radiation therapy program aligns with industry standards in using the curriculum developed by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) and required by the programmatic accred iting body [J oint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) ] to ensure student success in this technical field. Strategically, as a school with a strong focus on becoming a comprehensive institution in the field of radiological sci ence, the addition of an Associate's -level radiation therapy technology option is significant . This additional level of degree will not only support our strategic goal of program growth but also bring about positive changes in terms of community recogniti on and vendor relationships. By adhering to industry standards and providing students with a clear understanding of the pathways to credentials, JPU aims to further establish itself as a leading institution in the education of radiation therapy technology at both the Associate's and Baccalaureate degree levels . JPU's Strategic Plan is available here . b. State Rationale: General How does this program address state priorities as reflected in the Commission's most recent strategic plan Reaching Higher In a State of Change? JPU's online radiation therapy technology program is well equipped to meet the CHE's priorities of completion, equity, and talent. Completion: An online Associate's -level radiation therapy program can help students complete their education by providing a flexible and convenient way to earn the necessary qualifications for a career as an entry -level radiation th erapist . Online programs can offer asynchronous learning, allowing students to study on their own time and at their own pace. This can be particularly helpful for students who are working or have other commitments that make traditional classroom learning d ifficult . JPU offers classes year -round, allowing students more flexibility in their pathway to completion, be it at an accelerated pace or as a part -time student. Equity: JPU's Online radiation therapy technology program can also help promote equity in higher education by reducing barriers to entry. For example, students who may not have access to a physical radiation therapy technology program in their area can still pursue their education and career goals through an online program. Additionally, onlin e programs can often be more affordable than traditional programs, which can help make education more accessible to a wider range of students. JPU is dedicated to creating an environment that is learner -centric, including personalization of education and t ools students need to succeed. Talent: JPU's online radiation therapy technology program can help Indiana and other states develop and retain talented individuals in the healthcare industry by providing high -quality education and training. By attracting and retaining skilled healthcare professionals, Indiana can strengthen its healthcare system and improve patient outcomes. The program will educate high - BPE Agenda Page 12311 quality radiation therapy technology students who exceed accreditation standards. c. State Rationale: Equity -Related How does this program address the Equity section of Reaching Higher In a State of Change (see pages 15 -17), especially with respect to considerations of race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and geography? When consideri ng equity in higher education JPU's online radiation therapy technology program removes or reduces barriers in many ways. Accessibility: Anyone with access to a device and the internet can attend classes at JPU. This reduces barriers to education for thos e who live in rural areas and have mobility or transportation struggles. Diversity: As an online program, students will have the opportunity to learn in an environment that allows them to connect with others from different backgrounds, geographical locat ions, abilities, and cultures. JPU will create an inclusive environment, encouraging students to connect their learning with their own experiences and share those experiences so others can gain insight and understanding. Socioeconomic: JPU offers many tu ition, loan , and scholarship options for students. Care has been taken to find affordable learning material s while class es are design ed to optimize credit hours. The online component improves affordability by not requiring on -campus living or relocation to attend. In addition, students complete clinical training at JPU affiliates at locations convenient to them. d. Evidence of Labor Market Need National, State, or Regional Need o Is the program serving a national, state, or regional labor market need? Please de scribe. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected growth in radiation therapy technology from 2021 - 2031 to be 6% or about 800 jobs per year . This is comparable to the average growth in other occupations. Further, delays in graduating students throughout COVID has resulted in a current shortage of entry -level radiation therapists entering the workforce. In-person programs and online programs cap their enrollment, thus limiting the current number of students able to enter the field each year. To meet the growing needs, programs need to increase their enrollment, or new programs need to be developed. Additionally, many schools are in or near high -population areas to maximize enrollment, which creates barrie rs for rural and low -population areas. An online program can bring radiation therapy technology education to underserved geographic regions. e. Placement of Graduates Please describe the principal occupations and industries, in which the majority of BPE Agenda Page 12412 graduates are expected to find employment. If the program is primarily a feeder for graduate programs, please describe the principal kinds of graduate programs, in which th e majority of graduates are expected to be admitted. Radiation therapists are employed in multiple healthcare settings , including hospitals , free- standing cancer centers, and major university teaching facilities. Radiation therapists are also employed by manufacturers of radiation therapy equipment. In addition, graduates may also find opportunities in related fields such as research , development , and education. Many radiation therapists also advance their education and careers into the clinical field o f medical dosimetry. f. Job Titles List specific job titles and broad job categories that would be appropriate for a graduate of this program. Students graduating from JPU with an AAS in radiation therapy will find employment as a radiation therapist. Once graduates pass the national certifying examination administered by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT), graduates use they designation radiation therapist [RT(T)(ARRT)]. 6.

Examples of program names are A.S. in Nursing or B.S. in Business Administration. The term \"program\" refers to an approved set of courses or a curriculum, completion of which leads to the award of an undergradu ate or graduate certificate or an associate or a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Some institutions use the term \"major\" interchangeably with \"degree program,\" in which case the Commission will also regard the major as a degree program. Programs a pproved by the Commission are listed in its Academic Program Inventory (API), a comprehensive listing of all active and inactive certificate and degree programs at all levels offered by Indiana colleges and universities. The term \"program\" does not typica lly refer to a curricular subdivision, such as a major, concentration, specialization, track, or option. However, under some circumstances, such as those relating to workforce needs, economic development, accreditation requirements, licensure/certification , the Commission may regard curricular subdivisions as programs needing to be approved by the Commission and listed in the API. 2 The \"Degree Award Level\" refers to the following categories (see Degree Award Level Definitions for additional detail. 1. Award of Less than One Academic Year 2. Award of at Least One but Less than Two Academic Years 3. Associate's Degree 4. Postsecondary Award, Certificate, or Diploma of at Least Two but Less than Four Academic Years 5. Bachelor's Degree 6. Post -Baccalaureate Certificate 7. Master's D egree 8.

The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Readiness Competencies and Statewide Career Relevance Definition provide additional information about student engagement experiences with career relevance. 5 CIP Code refers to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), a six -digit code in the form of xx.xxxx that identifies instructional program specialties offered by educational institutions. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) developed these codes as a taxonomy for reporting student enrollme nt and degree completion data by area of study to the federal government. The State of Indiana uses these codes for similar purposes. The CIP taxonomy is organized on three levels (2 -digit, 4 -digit, 6 -digit). The 2 -digit series (sometimes called a CIP fami ly), represents the most general groupings of related programs while the 6 -digit codes represent specific instructional programs. NCES initially published CIP codes in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. BPE Agenda Page 1382 1.

Rationale for the Program a. Institutional Rationale (Alignment with Institutional Mission and Strengths) Why is the institution proposing this program and how does it build upon institutional strengths? How is it consistent with the mission of the institution and how does thi s program fit into the institution's strategic plan (please provide a link to the strategic pl an)? The Diagnostic Medical Sonography program at the John Patrick University of Health and Applied Sciences is designed to train individuals to become skilled i n using ultrasound technology . Diagnostic Medical Sonography is a rewarding career in healthcare, where the sonographer plays a critical role in helping healthcare providers diagnose and treat medical conditions. BPE Agenda Page 1459 The curriculum covers various topics suc h as anatomy and physiology, ultrasound physics, patient care and communication, and pathology. Students will learn how to operate ultrasound equipment, perform scans, and analyze images to identify abnormalities . The program emphasizes the importance of patient care and communication skills, as sonographers work closely with patients to ensure their comfort and safety during the scanning process. Students will also learn about legal and ethical considerations in medical sonography, safety, and profession al development. This program requires an externship, where the student is placed in the clinical setting for college credit. During the externship, students will work under the supervision of licensed sonographers in healthcare settings such as hospital s, clinics, or imaging centers. This practical experience provides students with valuable hands -on training and the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills in a real-world setting. There is a shortage of healthcare workers in the United States, and this includes allied healthcare workers that typically need specialized, technical training. JPU has the means to reduce the workface shortages by offering new programs such as diagnostic medical sonography. JPU has already proven successful in offering programs through distance learning formats. The DMS program will use online classroom instruction, ultrasound simulation technology, and a hands -on clinical externship, to present a distinctive and comprehensive learning experience. JPU's dedication to sound educational infrastructure and teaching practices ensures the quality of education and maximizes students' learning outcomes. The DMS program clearly aligns with the mission statement as it will help students develop ultrasound skills , building competent entry -level scanners by the end of the program. The DMS program aligns with industry standards in curriculum to ensure student success in this technical field. Strategically, as a school with a strong focus on becoming a comprehensive institution in the field of radiological science, the addition of dedicated ultrasound program is of utmost importance. This program will not onl y support our strategic goal of program growth but also bring about positive changes in terms of community recognition and vendor relationships. By adhering to industry standards and providing students with a clear understanding of the pathways to credenti als, JPU aims to establish itself as a leading institution in the ultrasound education field. JPU's Strategic Plan is available here . b. State Rationale: General How does this program address state priorities as reflected in the Commission's most recent strategic plan Reaching Higher In a State of Change? JPU's online Diagnostic Medical S onography program is well equipped to meet the CHE's priorities of completion, equity, and talent. Completion: An online ultrasound program can help students complete their education by providing a flexible and convenient way to earn the necessary quali fications for a career in ultrasound. Online programs can offer asynchronous learning, allowing students to study on their own time and at their BPE Agenda Page 14610 own pace. This can be particularly helpful for students who are working or have other commitments that make tra ditional classroom learning difficult . JPU offers classes year -round, allowing students more flexibility in their pathway to completion, be it at an accelerated pace or as a part -time student. Equity: JPU's Online ultrasound program can also help promot e equity in higher education by reducing barriers to entry. For example, students who may not have access to a physical ultrasound program in their area can still pursue their education and career goals through an online program. Additionally, online progr ams can often be more affordable than traditional programs, which can help make education more accessible to a wider range of students. JPU is dedicated to creating an environment that is learner -centric, including personalization of education and tools st udents need to succeed. Talent: JPU's online ultrasound program can help Indiana and other states develop and retain talented individuals in the healthcare industry by providing high -quality education and training. By attracting and retaining skilled healthcare professionals, Indiana can strengthen its healthcare system and improve patient outcomes. The program aims to bring high -quality sonography education that exceeds accreditation standards. c. State Rationale: Equity -Related How does this program address the Equity section of Reaching Higher In a State of Change (see pages 15 -17), especially with r espect to considerations of race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and geography? When considering equity in higher education JPU's online Diagnostic Medical Sonography program removes or reduces barriers in many ways. Accessibility: Anyone with access to a device and the internet can attend classes at JPU. This reduces barriers to education for those who live in rural areas and have mobility, or transportation struggles. Diversity: As an online program, students will have the opportunity to lea rn in an environment that allows students to connect with others from different backgrounds, geographical locations, abilities, and cultures. JPU will create an inclusive environment, encouraging students to connect their learning with their own experienc es and share those experiences so others can gain insight and understanding. Socioeconomic: JPU offers many tuition, loan, and scholarship options for students. Care has been taken to find affordable learning material and class design to optimize credit hours. The online component improves affordability by not requiring on -campus living or relocation to attend. d. Evidence of Labor Market Need National, State, or Regional Need o Is the program serving a national, state, or regional labor market need? Please describe. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected growth in Diagnostic Medical Sonography from 2021 -2031 to be 10% or about 14,700 jobs. This is faster than the average growth in other occupations. In -person programs and online programs cap their enrollment, thus limiting the current number of students able to enter the field each yea r. To meet the growing needs, programs need to increase their enrollment, or new programs need to be developed. BPE Agenda Page 14711 Additionally, many schools are in or near high -population areas to maximize enrollment, which creates barriers for rural and low -population a reas. An online program can bring ultrasound education to places that need it. There are currently only 5 programs in the United States that are fully online, and only one of these programs offers a degree. With new simulation ultrasound technology, p ortable ultrasound units, and high -quality internet -based learning platforms, creating an online ultrasound program will fill workforce gaps throughout the country. e. Placement of Graduates Please describe the principal occupations and industries, in whic h the majority of graduates are expected to find employment. If the program is primarily a feeder for graduate programs, please describe the principal kinds of graduate programs, in which the majority of graduates are expected to be admitted. Diagnostic medical sonographers are employed in multiple healthcare settings such as hospitals , clinics, imaging centers , and mobile imaging services. Students may also find opportunities in related fields such as research , development , and education. f.

BPE Agenda Page 162INDIANA COMMISSION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION New Program Proposal Form For BPE Authorized Institutions BS Healthcare Administration and Leadership To Be Offered by Stellar Career College (SCC) at Crown Point, IN Degree Award Level2: Bachelor's Degree Mode of Delivery (In-person or Code5 Preparing this Form: Dr. Satti Telephone Number and Email Address: (773 ) 317-7284 Date the Form was Prepared (Use date last revised): September 30, 2022 BPE Agenda Page [degree designation] [field of study]. Examples of program names are A.S. in Nursing or B.S. in Business Administration. The term \"program\" refers to an approved set of courses or a curriculum, completion of which leads to the award of an undergraduate or graduate certificate or an associate or a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Some institutions use th e term \"major\" interchangeably with \"degree program,\" in which case the Commission will also regard the major as a degree program. Programs approved by the Commission are listed in its Academic Program Inventory (API), a comprehensive listing of all active and inactive certificate and degree programs at all levels offered by Indiana colleges and universities. The term \"program\" does not typically refer to a curricular subdivision, such as a major, concentration, specialization, track, or option. However, under some circumstances, such as those relating to workforce needs, economic development, accreditation requirements, licensure/certification, the Commission may regard curricular subdivisions as programs needing to be approved by the Commission and listed in the API. 2 The \"Degree Award Level\" refers to the following categories (see Degree Award Level Definitions for additional detail. 1. Award of Less than One Academic Year 2. Award of at Least One but Less than Two Academic Years 3. Associate's Degree 4. Postsecondary Award, Certificate, or Diploma of at Least Two but Less than Four Academic Years 5. Bachelor's Degree 6. Post-Baccalaureate Certificate 7. Master's Degree Commission purposes, \"online\" includes two categories: 100% online and blended programs, i.e. 80-99% is online, with the remaining portion in-person. 4 Career Relevant/Out- of-Classroom Experiences include, but are not limited to, co-ops, internships, clinicals, practica, capstone projects, employer critiques, and study abroad programs. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Readiness Competencies and Statewide Career Relevance Definition provide additional information about student engagement experiences with career relevance. 5 CIP Code refers to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), a six-digit code in the form of xx.xxxx that identifies instructional program specialties offered by educational institutions. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) developed these codes as a taxonomy for reporting student enrollment and degree completion data by area of study to the federal government. The State of Indiana uses these codes for similar purposes. The CIP taxonomy is organized on three levels (2-digit, 4-digit, 6-digit). The 2-digit series (sometimes called a CIP family), represents the most general groupings of related programs while the 6-digit codes represent specific instructional programs.

Examples of program names are A.S. in Nursing or B.S. in Business Administration. The term \"program\" refers to an approved set of courses or a curriculum, completion of which leads to the award of an undergraduate or graduate certificate or an associate or a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Some institutions use the t erm \"major\" interchangeably with \"degree program,\" in which case the Commission will also regard the major as a degree program. Programs approved by the Commission are listed in its Academic Program Inventory (API), a comprehensive listing of all active and inactive certificate and degree programs at all levels offered by Indiana colleges and universities. The term \"program\" does not typically refer to a curricular subdivision, such as a major, concentration, specialization, track, or option. However, under some circumstances, such as those relating to workforce needs, economic development, accreditation requirements, licensure/certification, the Commission may regard curricular subdivisions as programs needing to be approved by the Commission and listed in the API. 2 The \"Degree Award Level\" refers to the following categories (see Degree Award Level Definitions for additional detail. 1. Award of Less than One Academic Year 2. Award of at Least One but Less than Two Academic Years 3. AA's Degree 4. Postsecondary Award, Certificate, or Diploma of at Least Two but Less than Four Academic Years 5. Bachelor's Degree 6. Post-Baccalaureate Certificate 7. Master's Degree Commission purposes, \"online\" includes two categories: 100% online and blended programs, i.e. 80-99% is online, with the remaining portion in-person. 4 Career Relevant/Out- of-Classroom Experiences include, but are not limited to, co-ops, internships, clinicals, practica, capstone projects, employer critiques, and study abroad programs. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Readiness Competencies and Statewide Career Relevance Definition provide additional information about student engagement experiences with career relevance. 5 CIP Code refers to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), a six-digit code in the form of xx.xxxx that identifies instructional program specialties offered by educational institutions. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) developed these codes as a taxonomy for reporting student enrollment and degree completion data by area of study to the federal government. The State of Indiana uses these codes for similar purposes. The CIP taxonomy is organized on three levels (2-digit, 4-digit, 6-digit). The 2-digit series (sometimes called a CIP family), represents the most general groupings of related programs while the 6-digit codes represent specific instructional programs. NCES initially published CIP codes in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. BPE Agenda Page 1962 1.

Examples of program names are A.S. in Nursing or B.S. in Business Administration. The term \"program\" refers to an approved set of courses or a curriculum, completion of which leads to the award of an undergraduate or graduate certificate or an associate or a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Some institutions use the term \"major\" interchangeably with \"degree program,\" in which case the Commission will also regard the major as a degree program. Programs approved by the Commission are listed in its Academic Program Inventory (API), a comprehensive listing of all acti ve and inactive certificate and degree programs at all levels offered by Indiana colleges and universities. The term \"program\" does not typically refer to a curricular subdivision, such as a major, concentration, specialization, track, or option. However, under some circumstances, such as those relating to workforce needs, economic development, accreditation requirements, licensure/certification, the Commission may regard curricular subdivisions as programs needing to be approved by the Commission and listed in the API. 2 The \"Degree Award Level\" refers to the following categories (see Degree Award Level Definitions for additional detail. 1. Award of Less than One Academic Year 2. Award of at Least One but Less than Two Academic Years 3. Associate's Degree 4. Postsecondary Award, Certificate, or Diploma of at Least Two but Less than Four Academic Years 5. Bachelor's Degree 6. Post-Baccalaureate Certificate 7. Master's Degree Commission purposes, \"online\" includes two categories: 100% online and blended programs, i.e. 80-99% is online, with the remaining portion in- person. 4 Career Relevant/Out- of-Classroom Experiences include, but are not limited to, co-ops, internships, clinicals, practica, capstone projects, employer critiques, and study abroad programs. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Readiness Competencies and Statewide Career Relevance Definition provide additional information about student engagement experiences with career relevance. 5 CIP Code refers to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), a six-digit code in the form of xx.xxxx that identifies instructional program specialties offered by educational institutions. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) developed these codes as a taxonomy for reporting student enrollment and degree completion data by area of study to the federal government. The State of Indiana uses these codes for similar purposes. The CIP taxonomy is organized on three levels (2-digit, 4-digit, 6-digit). The 2-digit series (sometimes called a CIP family), represents the most general groupings of related programs while the 6-digit codes represent specific instructional programs. NCES initially published CIP codes in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. BPE Agenda Page 2302 1.
