In daily conferences, morning rounds, practical studies and discussions with the preceptor, students will gain an understanding of the practice of medicine in a non-western environment. They will see a strong demonstration of the importance of taking a patient history without benefit of extensive diagnostic testing. Medical education differences will be apparent to the student as well as international efforts to upgrade health care through the transfer of technology to Armenian hospitals. Written evaluation of student performance will be obtained from preceptors. The elective organizers will see that all student evaluation forms are completed and mailed back to the student's school.

Gikas, M.D. and M.D., Ph.D. Location: Heraklion, Greece Number of Students: 18 for the Spring Semester Period to be offered: Four week blocks (Spring Semester) No students will rotate during times of national or regional holidays, including Easter. Contact: Ana Gregory email: [anagreg@bu.edu](mailto:anagreg@bu.edu) Description of Elective: This is an elective designed to develop skills in history taking, physical examination and differential diagnosis appropriate for the evaluation of adult and geriatric patients. Knowledge goals include the physiology of normal adult subjects and the impact of aging on disease development and treatment. The elective takes place in the island of Greece (Department of Medicine) where adult and geriatric patients are cared for on general medical service. Daily rounds take place there with the residents and the attending physicians. There are three nursing homes in the Heraklion area, one public and two private ones. The geriatric rotation includes regular visits to them. Crete is the third largest island within the Mediterranean basin with strong family ties. Emphasis is placed on understanding adult and geriatric care within the cultural enviroment of the island. As such the rotation contributes to multicultural awareness and delivery of care to populations with different cultural backgrounds and societal values. Of interest the island has served over the years as the prototype for the Mediterranean diet and students should be able to gain first hand-experience experience in its natural setting. The elective takes care at the University of Crete teaching hospital (PAGNH), a tertiary care University consisting of 820 beds. It is located in the scenic area of Voutes, 7 km from the center of Heraklion in Crete. GOAL: Develop skills in history taking, physical examination and differential diagnosis appropriate for the evaluation of the adult and the geriatric patients. OBJECTIVES: Discuss the physiology of normal aging Review the impact of aging and the pathogenesis of disease in the elderly and treatment modalities Participate in geriatric care adjusted to the cultural experience, needs and expectation of the elders of Crete Develop competence in delivery of health care in adult and aged subjects in diverse cultural environments FACULTY The Department of Medicine was one of the first established in the University Hospital. The staff consists of 4 physicians appointed by the Faculty of the Medical School (Professor and past-Chair DT Boumpas, Professor and Chair G Samonis, Professor A Gikas, Associate Professor E Ganotakis Assistant Professor DP Kofteridis), Ass Professor P Sidiropoulos Director Division of Rheumatology) and 7 physicians appointed by the National Health System (JA Papadakis, GN Fanti, G Vrentzos, E Barbounakis, S Panagiotakis and G Hamilos).

The attending physicians will also help translate as needed. Adult and Geriatric patients are seen throughout the general medical inpatient and outpatient services and the emergency room admissions. There is also a dedicated Geriatric Clinic for comprehensive geriatric assessment of older people. A significant portion of the Emergency Room evaluation of patients involves the elderly, their safety and their home environment. Visits to nursing homes with faculty are available elective options. Following the morning reports, each visiting student will be assigned to follow the status and the treatment of 1 to 2 cases of patients, along with a Greek medical student. Emphasis will be placed on the geriatric patients. Both the visiting and the Greek students will be under the supervision of the attending physician. See the attached weekly calendar to understand the responsibilities and opportunities while on service. Below are descriptions of different key elements of the rotation. Geriatrics Clinic Attendance of the Geriatrics Clinic under the supervision of Dr Panagiotakis. Older people with problems such as falls, unsteadiness, cognitive disorders and depression are assessed there. The assessment is comprehensive and multidisciplinary. There is a cooperation with the Psychiatry and the Neurology Clinics for referrals of more complex cases and the Social Service Department for older people with special needs in the community. Emphasis is given on the maintenance of functional autonomy of the patients and the relief of the burden of their families. Geriatric rounds: Geriatric rounds are held once a week. The rounds are either sitting and/or by the bed of the patient. Special issues of care and discharge plan on complex geriatric cases are discussed. The rounds run by a multidisciplinary team composed by Dr Panagiotakis, a senior resident on Neurology, the physiotherapist and the social worker of the ward and a nurse. Didactic lectures/ Teaching sessions/Appraisal presentations: These are detailed in the attached weekly calendar. Of note, morning report is held daily. The new admissions and the interesting follow-ups are discussed. When there are students rotating in Geriatrics, Journal Clubs and noon conferences are devoted to geriatric issues. Students from Boston University do also their appraisal presentations on geriatric topics in these meetings. Students will be required to complete a patient log describing the disease entities they encounter and learn. Nursing Home rounds/Open Care Centers for Older people visits: Kalokairinou Nursing Home is a Charity of the Philanthropistic Institutions of A & M Kalokairinou in Heraklion city with almost 120 residents. Dr Panagiotakis visit the Institution with the students for rounds. Rounds involve the social worker of the Institution and a nurse. Matters regarding the well being of the residents, drug prescriptions, and referrals to subspecialties in the university hospital are discussed. In addition, Dr Panagiotakis and the students may visit the Open Care Centers of the Municipality of Heraklion and the Alzheimer Association, depending on the timing of their rotation. In these visits the students have the opportunity to meet and discuss with ambulatory older Cretan people in the community or even visit bed ridden people in their homes and understand the type of existing services and modes of care are offered in the community. ER (Emergency Room) Rotation is held either on Monday or Tuesday Professor Rounds are held either on Wednesday or Thursday, the same day with the Firm Chief Rounds Firm Chief Rounds are held either Wednesday or Thursday Nursing Home Rounds are held twice a week in the afternoon (Monday or Tuesday on the day that there is no ER rotation and on Thursday) 190.12 Global Health Elective Instructor: Suzanne Sarfaty, M.D., Director, Global Health Program, BUSM [Global Health Program](http://www.bumc.bu.edu/ihbusm/) (provides expanded details in relation to information below) Description of Elective: This is a clinical clerkship or research opportunity for medical students interested in the field of Global Health (GH).
