In fact, the success of American Muslims and our determination to guard against any encroachments on their civil liberties is the ultimate rebuke to those who say that we're at war with Islam. \u2014US President Barack Obama, May 23, 2013 This community is under siege. And even if they're not under siege, they think they are. \u2014Tom Nelson, attorney, Portland, Oregon, August 13, 2012 Terrorism entails horrifying acts, often re sulting in terrible losses of human life. Governments have a duty under internationa l human rights law to take reasonable measures to protect people within their ju risdictions from acts of violence. When crimes are committed, governments also have a duty to carry out impartial investigations, to identify those responsible, and to prosecute suspects before independent courts. These obligations require ensuring fairness and due process in investigations and prosecutio ns, as well as humane treatment of those in custody. However, since the September 11, 2001 a ttacks on New York and Washington, DC, the United States government has failed to meet its international legal obligations with respect to its investigations and pros ecutions of terrorism suspects, as well as its treatment of terrorism suspects in custory. This has been true with regard to foreig n terrorism suspects detained at the US military detention center at Guantanamo Ba y, Cuba, most of whom are being held indefinitely without charge. And, as this report documents, it is also too often true with regard to American Muslim defendants investigated, tried, and convicted of terrorism or terrorism-rela ted offenses in the US criminal justice system. This report examines 27 such cases\u2014from initiation of the investigations to sentencing and post-conviction conditio ns of confinement\u2014and documents the significant human cost of certain countert errorism practices, such as aggressive ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 2 sting operations and unnecessarily restrict ive conditions of confinement. Since the September 11 attacks, more than 500 individuals have been prosecuted in US federal courts for terrorism or related offenses\u201440 cases per year on average. Many prosecutions have properly target ed individuals engaged in planning or financing terror attacks. But many others have targeted individuals who do not appear to have been involv ed in terrorist plotting or financing at the time the government began to investigate them. Indeed, in some cases the Federal Bure au of Investigation may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individual s by conducting sting operations that facilitated or invented the target's willingn ess to act. According to multiple studies, nearly 50 percent of the more than 5 00 federal counterterrorism convictions resulted from informant-based cases; almost 30 percent of those cases were sting operations in which the informant played an active role in the underlying plot. In the case of the \"Newburgh Four,\" for example, a judge said the government \"came up with the crime, provided the means, and removed all relevant obstacles,\" and had, in the process, made a terrorist out of a man \"whose buffoonery is positively Shakespearean in scope.\" In such instances, the government's purp ose appears to have been preventive: to root out and prosecute individuals it beli eves might eventually plan and carry out terrorism. To this end, it has substa ntially changed its approach, loosening regulations and standards governing the conduct of terroris m investigations. While some of these cases involved foreign nationals and conduct overseas, or individuals who are not Muslim, many of the most high-profile terrorism prosecutions have focused on \"homegrown \" terrorist threats allegedly posed by American Muslims. Human Rights Watch and Columbia Law Scho ol's Human Rights Institute found that at times, in aggressively pursuing terror ism threats before they even materialize, US law enforcement overstepped its role by effectively participating in developing terrorism plots\u2014in at least two cases even offering the defendants money to entice them to participate in the plot. 3 JULY 2014 In theory, the defendants in these cases should be able to avoid criminal liability by making a claim of \"entrapment.\" However, US law requires that to prove entrapment a defendant show both that the governme nt induced him to commit the act in question and that he was no t \"predisposed\" to commit it. This predisposition inquiry focuses attention on the defendant's background, opinions, beliefs, and reputation\u2014in other words, not on the crime, but on the nature of the defendant. This character inquiry makes it exceptionally diff icult for a defendant to succeed in raising the entrapment defense, particularly in the terrorism context, where inflammatory stereotypes and highly charged characteri zations of Islam and foreigners often prevail. Indeed, no claim of entrapment has been successful in a US federal terrorism case to date. European human rights law\u2014instructive for interpreting internationally recognized fair trial rights\u2014suggests that the current formulation of the US defense of entrapment may not comport with fair trial standards. Meanwhile, the law enforcement practices de scribed in this report have alienated the very communities the government relies on most to report possible terrorist threats and diverted resources from other, more effective ways, of responding to the threat of terrorism. Its proclaimed success in convicting alleged terrorist conspirators has come with serious and unne cessary costs to the rights of many of those prosecuted and convicted, to thei r families and communities, to the public, and to the rule of law. Ultimately, these costs threaten to undermine the goal of preventing and effectively prosecutin g and sanctioning terrorism crimes. Our research explored cases from a chrono logical and geographic cross-section of the post-September 11 terrorism pros ecutions. Cases spanned the months immediately after the September 11 attacks to more recent indictments, in order to explore which trends, if any, persisted or developed over time. We also sought cases from across the United States to examine the impact of such prosecutions on various American Muslim communities and to account for regional investigative and prosecutorial differences. Cases includ e prosecutions for material support and conspiracy, some resulting in sentences of more than 15 years or life imprisonment. These cases do not constitute a represen tative sample that would allow us to generalize about all federal prosecutions, but they raise troubling questions about the fairness and effectiveness of many of the policies, practices, and tactics ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 4 employed by the Federal Bureau of Invest igation (FBI), the Ju stice Department, and the Bureau of Prisons in terrorism cases. In some cases, the unfairness arises from the application of certain laws, some of which Congress greatly expanded after Se ptember 11, including material support laws, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillan ce Act, and the Classified Information Procedures Act. Human Rights Concerns We documented the following patterns that raise serious human rights concerns: Discriminatory investigations, often targeting particularly vulnerable individuals (including people with intellectual and mental disabilities and the indigent), in which the government\u2014often acting through informants\u2014 is actively involved in developing the plot, persuading and sometimes pressuring the target to participate, and providing the reso urces to carry it out. Use of overly broad material support charges, punishing behavior that did not demonstrate intent to support terrorism. Prosecutorial tactics that may violate fa ir trial rights, such as introducing prejudicial evidence\u2014including evidence obtained by coercion, classified evidence that cannot be fairly contes ted, and inflammatory evidence about terrorism in which defendants played no part; and limited ability to challenge surveillance warrants due to excessive government secrecy. Harsh and at times abusive conditions of confinement, which often appear excessive in relation to the security risk posed. These include: Prolonged solitary confinement and se vere restrictions on communicating in pretrial detention, possibly impeding defendants' ability to assist in their own defense and contributing to their pleading guilty. Excessive lengthening of sentence s and draconian conditions post- conviction, including prolonged so litary confinement and severe restrictions on contact with famil ies or others, sometimes without explanation or recourse. One detainee called it \"a touch of hell\": \"My 5 JULY 2014 children... could see, but not touch me as though I had some sort of contagious disease.\" Taken together, these patterns have contri buted to cases in which individuals who perhaps would never have participated in a terrorist act on their own initiative and might not even had the capacity to do so, were prosecuted for serious, yet government-created, terrorism plots. In other cases, people who contributed to charities in the Middle East ended up convicted of \"material support\" based on fl imsy connections to al leged terrorism. Illustrative examples of the cases do cumented in this report include: Targeting People with Mental or In tellectual Disabilities in Stings\u2014 Rezwan Ferdaus : Although an FBI agent even told Ferdaus' father his son \"obviously\" had mental health problems, the FBI targeted him for a sting operation, sending an informant into Ferdaus' mosque. Together, the FBI informant and Ferdaus devised a plan to attack the Pentagon and US Capitol, with the FBI providing fake weaponry and funding Ferdaus' travel. Yet Ferdaus was mentally and physically dete riorating as the fake plot unfolded, suffering weight loss so severe his cheek bones protruded, loss of bladder control that left him wearing diapers, and depression and se izures so bad his father quit his job to care for Ferdaus. He was eventually sentenced on material support for terrorism and explosives charges to 17 years in prison with an additional 10 years of supervised release. Use of Evidence Obtained by Coercion\u2014Ahmed Omar Abu Ali : Abu Ali, a US citizen, was swept up in a mass arrest campaign in Saudi Arabia in 2003. Ali alleged being whipped, denied food, and threatened with amputation, and ultimately provided a confession he says was false to Saudi interrogators. Later on trial in Vir ginia, the judge rejected Ali's claims of torture and admitted his confession into evidence. He was convicted of conspiracy, providing material support to terrorists, and conspiracy to assassinate the president. He received a life sentence, which he is serving in solitary confinement at the supe rmax prison in Florence, Colorado. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 6 Abusive Detention Conditions\u2014Uzair Paracha: Uzair Paracha was held in solitary confinement for nearly two years before he was convicted on charges of material support. Nine mont hs after his arrest and while he was refusing to take a plea deal, the fe deral government moved Paracha to a harsh regime of solitary confinemen t pursuant to Special Administrative Measures (SAMs)\u2014special restrictions on his contact with others imposed on the grounds of protecting national security or preventing disclosure of classified material\u2014ostensibly due to ties with Al-Qaeda. For a time, Paracha was only permitted to speak to prison guards. \"You could spend days to weeks without uttering anything significant beyond 'please cut my lights,' 'can I get a legal call/toilet paper/a razor,' etc., or just thanking them for shutting our ligh t,\" he wrote to us. After he was convicted, the SAMs were modified to permit him to communicate with other inmates. \"I faced the harshest part of the SAMs while I was innocent in the eyes of American law,\" he wrote. Ignoring Alternative Solutions and Adverse Impact on American Muslim Communities\u2014Adel Daoud: Adel Daoud was 17 years old when undercover FBI employees began communicating with him through an online Islamic forum. At the time, Daoud was a reclusiv e student at an Islamic high school in a Chicago suburb, spending most of his time on the computer in his parents' basement. He sought guidance from his parents about terms like jihad that he was reading about online; they told him jihad meant the struggle to be supportive of your parents. Yet online, undercover FBI employees slowly cultivated a fake pl ot with Daoud to attack a bar in downtown Chicago. Daoud's arrest in fall 2013 shocked his community and others in the Chicago area, prompt ing speculation about why the FBI deployed undercover agents to ensnare the teenager, rather than contact his parents or community leaders. \"These kids don't wake up one day and decide, 'I'm going to blow society up,'\" a Muslim community advocate in Chicago told us, pointing out that just as some teenagers begin to turn to drugs, others may go online and start exploring extremist websites. Daoud's trial is scheduled for November 2014. 7 JULY 2014 While we examined more than two doze n specific cases in-depth, we also conducted a statistical analysis of the 49 4 cases the Justice Department identified as relating to international terrorism for the period from September 11, 2001 to December 31, 2011. Among the 494 cases examined , there were 917 separate convictions. The two most frequent offe nses, \"Providing Material Support\" and \"Conspiracy,\" account for more than 1 in 4 of the convictions. The analysis examines the numbers and percentages of convictions secured through pleas or trials as well as the sentences that were meted out for certain offenses or combinations of offenses. While we documented prob lematic practices in 27 specific cases, others of the 494 raise similar concerns. Adverse Impact on American Muslim Communities, Law Enforcement The cases we examined\u2014and the hundreds of other terrorism prosecutions in the US since the September 11 attacks\u2014have not occurred in a vacuum. At the same time as the government has aggressively sought out terrorism suspects, sometimes before the individual concerned has expres sed any intention to use violence, it has sought to build relationships with Amer ican Muslim community leaders and groups, believing they are critical sources of in formation to prevent terrorist attacks. It has also sought to build American Mu slim communities' sense of cohesion and trust in law enforcement, as part of a stra tegy for what it calls \"Countering Violent Extremism.\" However, many of the practices described in this report are counter to the goals of these policies: in some communities, they have led to anxiety and a fear of interacting wi th law enforcement. Some Muslim community member s said that fears of government surveillance and informant infiltration had negatively tran sformed the quality of the mosque from a place of spiritual sanctuary and togetherne ss to one of vigilance. Now, they said, they must watch what they say, to wh om, and how often they attend services. The impact on communities and individual s is not uniform. Many advocates and community leaders said they continue to have strong relationships with local law enforcement. But with some American Mu slims less willing to reach out to law ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 8 enforcement, the FBI's goal of learning of potential terrorist plots before they progress may have been thwarted by it s own abusive investigation tactics. There are significant changes that the US government can implement immediately to reduce the rate of people being prosecuted with little or no evidence of intent to engage in terrorism, and to improve th eir relationships with American Muslim communities. These include: Key Recommendations to the US Federal Government Restrict the use of informants and ensu re the practice is subject to robust oversight. Informants should not be sent into community or religious institutions in pre-investigation stag es before there is particularized suspicion of wrongdoing. Develop rights-respecting partnerships with local community groups and support community-driven programs as an alternative to aggressive investigations that can lead to abus es and end up doing more harm than good. Ensure that prosecutors do not charge individuals or groups for providing material support based on activity pr otected under freedom of expression principles of international human rights law. Ensure humane prison conditions, and do not subject prisoners to prolonged solitary confinement. 9 JULY 2014 Methodology This report is primarily based on interviews conducted between April 2012 and February 2013, information obtained from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, court documents, and othe r publicly available sources. Human Rights Watch and Columbia La w School's Human Rights Institute conducted more than 215 interviews with individuals charged or convicted of terrorism-related crimes, members of their familie s and members of their communities, criminal defense attorneys, judges, current and former federal prosecutors, government officials, academics, and other experts. In choosing which cases to investigat e, we sought to explore cases that represented a cross-section of the post-September 11 terrorism prosecutions, ranging in time, geography, and type of investigation. We chose to examine cases that spanned the timeline from the mo nths immediately after the September 11, 2001 attacks to those in which defendants we re only recently indicted, in an effort to explore the broadest possible post-9 /11 timeframe. Of the 27 cases we examined, 10 involved indi ctments before 2006, 10 involved indictments between 2006 and 2009, and 8 involved indictme nts since 2010. We sought cases from across the United States, in order to in clude the various narratives of Muslim communities and account for regional inve stigative and prosecutorial differences. Our cases generally fell into four regional clusters\u2014 northeast, midwest, south, and northwest\u2014both for ease of research and to allow fo r in-depth examination of particular communities. We spoke with families and community members in 10 cities, frequently accounting for multip le Muslim communities within each city. We closely reviewed 27 federal prosecutions that involved 77 total defendants by examining publicly available court documents recovered from public databases or defense counsel records. Of these 77 defendants, we examined in-depth the experiences of 42. We sought to speak wi th each individual, but were sometimes advised by defense counsel or families to refrain from corresponding with defendants due to ongoing litigation or for other reasons. In all 20 cases where litigation was no longer ongoing, or in which defense counsel or family assented to ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 10 our requests for interviews, we sought access from the Bureau of Prisons to a confidential in-person interv iew with detained individuals. We were granted access to four individuals. In denying two of our access requests, the Bureau of Prisons advised us to submit new requests detail ing our research protocols, which we did in March and June 2013. We received no response. Where the Bureau of Prisons denied our re quest to interview detained individuals, we sought to correspond with them by letter, email or telephone, and corresponded with an additional 12 deta inees in this way. We also continued correspondence with two detainees with whom we were able to speak in person. In addition to our communication with defe ndants currently in Bureau of Prisons facilities, we interviewed in person three defendants who had completed their sentences in federal prison or who were held at a detention facility other than a federal prison. For the 42 individuals involved in cases ex amined in this report, we conducted in- depth interviews with a total of more th an 123 people, includ ing defense counsel, family members, friends, defense experts, and representatives from civil society organizations that work on i ssues directly related to th ese cases. In addition, we requested interviews with prosecutors in 22 cases: three current prosecutors and four former prosecutors agreed to speak with us. The remainder either turned down or did not respond to our request. While we attempted to speak with commu nity members in most cities, mosque attendees were often reluctan t to speak for fear of su rveillance or government scrutiny for any association with the ca ses we were examining. When necessary, we provided family members and congregant s the opportunity to be interviewed by us without providing a last name. In each of the 27 cases that form the ba sis of this report, we obtained publicly available court records from Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER); occasionally we received copies of publicly filed court records from defendants, family members or their counsel. 11 JULY 2014 For information on detention conditions, we docu mented the experience of solitary confinement for 32 individuals charged with or convicted of terrorism offenses or alleged to be involved in te rrorism. Twenty-four of thos e individuals were held in solitary confinement prior to their conviction; 8 were held in solitary post- conviction. We also documented the ex periences of 14 current or former Communications Management Un it (CMU) detainees in person, or via email or by telephone, and 6 individuals subjected to Special Administrative Measures (SAMs). To account for the almost 500 cases that the National Security Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ-NSD) consid ers \"terrorism or terrorism-related\" prosecutions, we also conducted a stat istical analysis of these cases using publicly available government and court re cords. On June 6, 2012, pursuant to a FOIA request, the DOJ-NSD released its most updated version of its chart of terrorism or terrorism-relate d crimes, documenting basic criteria of these cases. Those 494 cases span from September 11, 2001 to December 31, 2011.1 The chart only includes those cases resulting in co nvictions.2 In order to gauge statistical correlations across criminal charge, se ntence, and detention conditions, we disaggregated the information from the static chart and input it into a database for analysis with additional information obtained from a variety of primary sources including: each case's docket, the indict ment or superseding indictment in the case, and the judgment entry in the case, when those documents were available. Detention status and location for each defendant were cross-checked with the Bureau of Prison's Inmate Locator service between the dates of July 23, 2013 and July 25, 2013. Where relevant, those statistics were integrated into this report. That data is also publicly available onli ne at http://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/. 1 In 2012, Human Rights First received these updated statistics from the Department of Justice through a Freedom of Information Act request, \"Let the Numbers do the Talking: Federal Courts Work [Infographic],\" Human Rights First press release, July 12, 2012, http://www.humanright sfirst.org/press-release/let-numbers- do-talking-federal-courts-work-infographic (accessed Ju ne 18, 2014) ; US Department of Justice, National Security Division, \"Introduction to Na tional Security Division Statistics on Unsealed International Terrorism and Terrorism-Related Convictions,\" June 6, 2012, ht tp://www.fas.org/irp/agency /doj/doj060612 -stats.pdf (accessed June 18, 2014). 2 a distinction between \"international terrorism\" and \"domestic terrorism,\" and crimes related solely to domestic terrorism are explicitly excluded from its chart. See US Department of Justice, National Security Division, \"Introduction to National Security Division Statistics on Unsealed International Terrorism and Terrorism-Related Co nvictions,\" http://www.fas.org/irp/ agency/doj/doj060612-stats.pdf (accessed June 28, 2014), pp. 1-2. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 12 We pursued requests under the Freedom of Information Act from the Bureau of Prisons, the Federal Bureau of Investig ation, and the Depa rtment of Justice National Security Division. We met wi th the FBI and DOJ- NSD in person, and conducted written correspondence. We sub mitted written questions to DOJ-NSD on February 25, 2013, which were answered in writing on May 23, 2013 (see Appendix - D). After an initial meeting with the FBI's Office of General Counsel and Office of Public Affairs, we submitted written questions to the FBI on November 21, 2012 (see Appendix - D). Between November 20 12 and May 2013, we followed up with the FBI General Counsel's office eight time s and received five emails assuring us that our questions were under review and that responses were being prepared or finalized. At time of writing, the FBI ha s not provided answers to our questions or formally declined to respond to our letter. We shared a copy of this report with DOJ- NSD and the FBI prior to publication. All interviews were conducted in English wh en possible, with Arabic or Urdu used in four cases, via translator. All participants were informed of the purpose of the interview and consented orally or in writin g. No interviewee received compensation for providing information. Where appropriate, Human Ri ghts Watch and Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute provided interviewees with contact information for organizations providing legal, counseling or social services . 13 JULY 2014 I. \"Homegrown Terrorism\" and the Preventive Approach to Investigations Between 2002 and 2011, nearly 500 individuals were convicted of terrorism or terrorism-related offenses in the United States, with the federal government charging an average of about 40 individual s every year, according to Department of Justice data. 3 Some of these cases resulted from what appear to have been deliberate attempts at terrorism or terrorism financing. 4 However, in most of the cases involving the use of informants we reviewed in depth for this report, the defendants do not appear to 3 See Methodology. In analyzing the data, we relied on p ublicly available information released by the Department of Justice. In September 2013, a federal audit revealed that the Justice Department had overstated the number of terrorism convictions, as well as several other key indicators. Ellen Nakashima, \"Audit: Justice Department office overstated terrorism conviction statistics,\" Washington Post , September 17, 2013, http://articles.wa shingtonpost.com/2013-09-17/world/42141849_1 _terrorism-charges-u-s-attorneys-horowitz (accessed June 18, 2014). It is not po ssible to determine how the audit's findings relate to the information publicly released by the Justice Department because individual-level data were not provided, making it impossible to determine which inaccuracies, if any, were contained in the aggregated document. 4 According to one study, since 9/11, terrorist attacks by American Muslims have caused 37 deaths within the US, spread over seven cases. Charles Kurzman, \"Muslim-Americ an Terrorism in 2013,\" University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Department of Sociology, February 5, 2014, http://sites.duke.edu/tcths/files/2013/06/Kurzman_Muslim-American_Terrorism_in_2013.pdf (accessed June 18, 2014). There is no single definition of terrorism under international law, and many of the definitions used by countries are overly broad. However, the United Na tions (UN) special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism has argued that the concept of terrorism includes only those acts or attempted acts \"intended to cause death or serious bodily injury\" or \"lethal or seriou s physical violence\" against one or more members of the population, or that constitute \"the intentional taking of hostages\" for the purpose of \"provoking a state of terror in the general public or a segment of it\" or \"compelling a Go vernment or international organization to do or abstain from doing something.\" See UN Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Ra pporteur on promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, Ten areas of best practices in countering terrorism, A/HR C/16/51, December 22, 2010, http://daccess-dds- ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G1 0/178/98/PDF/G1017898.pdf?OpenElement (accessed June 18, 2014), para. 28. Scheinin's successor, Ben Emmerson, has stated he intends to \"adopt and build\" on these recommended practices. \"Intervention,\" UN Special Rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights, Ben Emerson, speech before the Secretary-General's Symposium on International Terrorism Cooperation, UN Headquarters New York, September 19, 2011, transcript at http://www.un.org/en/terrorism/ctitf/pdfs/sr_on_ct_a nd_hr_sg_symposium.pdf (accessed June 18, 2014). Similarly, the UN Secretary-General's High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change concluded that for a violent act to be deemed terrorist, its purpose must be \"t o intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.\" UN High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, \"A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility,\" December 2004, http://www.un.org/en/peacebuilding/pdf/historical/hlp_mor e_secure_world.pdf (accesse d June 18, 2014), para. 164(d).

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 14 have been involved in terrorist plotting or financing at the time the government began to investigate them. Rather, in these cases, the government's purpose appears to have been preventive: to root out and prosecute individuals the government believes might eventually plan and carry out acts of terrorism. To this end, the US government has substantially changed the way it conducts policing and investigations related to terroris m\u2014loosening regulations and standards governing the conduct of in vestigations, and engaging in extensive surveillance and use of informants, particularly in American Muslim communities. Post 9/11 Changes to Priorities and Rules Governing Federal Terrorism Investigations Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the FBI reorganized to make prevention of terrorism its top institutional priority, shifting resources fr om traditional crime investigations to counterter rorism. More than 40 perc ent of the FBI's operating budget of $3.3 billion is now devoted to counterterrorism.5 In 2006, then-Deputy Attorney General Pa ul McNulty described the Department of Justice's preventive approach as \"doing ever ything in its power to identify risks to our nation's security at the earliest st age possible and to re spond with forward- leaning\u2014preventative\u2014prosecutions.\"6 Congress assisted by allocating significant funding to the FBI to further the goal of prevention.7 At the same time, the US government subs tantially downgraded legal restrictions on the Department of Justice and FBI in particular, which had been designed to 5 See US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Invest igation, \"Report to the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States: The FBI's Counterterro rism Program Since Septembe r 14, 2004, http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/fbi_c t_911com_0404.pdf (accessed June 18, 2014); US Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General, Audit Division, \"The External Effects of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Reprioritization Efforts,\" Audit Report no. 05-37 (September 2005), http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/FBI/a0537/final.pdf (a ccessed June 18, 2014); US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, FY 2013 Budget Request At A Glance, http://www.justice.gov/jmd/2013summary/pdf/fy13-fb i-bud-summary.pdf (acce ssed June 19, 2014). 6 Deputy Attorney General Paul J.

These changes include: Increased surveillance of communications : Congress expanded the communications that may be subject to surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) (see section IV). Expansive information collection : The Department of Justice, under revised Attorney General Guidelines, gave the FBI expansive authority to conduct pre-investigation \"assessmen ts\"\u2014gathering information in the absence of suspicion of wrongdoing or threat to national security\u2014for unlimited periods. 9 As a Brennan Center study notes, the FBI can now \"gather and store in their databases information about where individuals pray, what they read, and who they associate with.\" 10 The FBI may also task and recruit informants from a particul ar community without any articulable suspicion of criminal activity, in contrast to previous limits.11 8 See Amna Akbar, \"Policing 'Radicalization,'\" UC Irvine Law Review , vol. 3, no. 4 (December 2013).

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 18 on their validity.20 The FBI now believes that the th reat and activity of \"homegrown violent extremists,\" though gr owing, is also unpredictable.21 Fears of homegrown terrorism and radicalization theories have driven federal agencies to treat American Muslim communities as uniquely susceptible to terrorist propaganda and to subject them to greater government scrutiny. 22 Yet this assumption is unsubstantiated. As a 2009 Pew study put it, \"[v]iolent jihad is discordant with the values, outlook and attitudes of the vast majority of Muslim Americans, most of wh om reject extremism.\" 23 Widespread Surveillance of American Muslims and Use of Informants With expanded authorities, and based on radicalization theories, the FBI has conducted surveillance on communities base d on their religious and ethnic make- up. It has created demographic profiles to map the racial, ethnic and religious composition of neighborhood s, including the location of mosques and beliefs of congregants.24 As we describe in section VII, the FBI has also used voluntary 20 For a discussion of divergent views of radicalization among US government agencies, see Faiza Patel, Rethinking Radicalization (New York: Brennan Center for Justice 2011), http://www.brennancenter.org/publication/rethinking-radicalizati on (accessed July 11, 2014), pp.13-18. 21 \"These individuals have no typical pr ofile; their experiences and motives are often distinct,\" Director of the FBI Robert S.

Documents that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) obtained through FOIA corroborate these reports. 19 JULY 2014 interviews and activities presented as \"c ommunity outreach\" to solicit information from American Muslims, which have fed fears of law enforcement and distrust within communities. As part of the \"assessments\" that the FBI now has the authority to conduct, the FBI has utilized undercover agents or paid informants. Posing as newcomers or converts, informants infiltrate religious and cultural inst itutions in communities of which they are not already a part. As several journalists have documented, these informants secretly gather information on religious practices and political beliefs of community members attending mosques an d participating in cultural events. 25 Informants may also pose as newcomers at coffee shops, delis, and other local hangouts, seeking to gather information or befriend and inform on locals they meet. It is not clear how often the FBI uses paid and unpaid informants generally, or in national security cases in particular, but in a budget request from 2008 the FBI stated it has over 15,000 paid informants. 26 The FBI has repeatedly denied conducting surveillance solely based on race or ethnicity 27 or sending informants in to mosques to \"troll\" for leads, although as we describe in the next chapter, it has clearly done the latter.28 American Civil Liberties Union, \"ACLU EYE on the FBI: The FBI is Engaged in Unconstitutional Racial Profiling and Racial 'Mapping,'\" October 20, 2011, https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/aclu_eye_on_the_fbi_alert_- _fbi_engaged_in_unconstitutional_racial_profiling_and_racial_mapping_0.pdf (accessed June 19, 2014). For an analysis of this and related practices, see Akbar, \"Policing 'Radicalization,'\" UC Irvine Law Review . 25 For example, in February 2012, FBI informant Arvinder Singh alleged that the FBI asked him to infiltrate mosques throughout Iowa and particularly in Des Moines, giving him pictures of persons of interest and asking him to report on their conversations.

Discriminatory and Overly Aggressive Investigations Using Informants All of the high-profile domestic terroris m plots of the last decade, with four exceptions,30 were actually FBI sting operations \u2014plots conducted with the direct involvement of law enforcement informants or agents, including plots that were proposed or led by informants. According to multiple studies, nearly 50 percent of the more than 500 federal counterterrori sm convictions resulted from informant- based cases; almost 30 percent of those cases were sting operations in which the informant played an active role in the underlying plot.31 For this report, we reviewed in-depth 13 law enforcement investigations where informants played an active and central role. 32 At least eight of the investigations we examined were sting op erations in which government officials identified someone as a potential target, helped him plan a terrorist attack and subsequently arrested him for involvement in that plan.33 In a traditional sting operat ion, law enforcement officials, through an informant or undercover agent, give their target an opportunity to commit a crime he or she might not have committed othe rwise. Traditional stings tend to take place when 30 The four exceptions are: the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, an attempted car bombing at Times Square in 2010 by Faisal Shahzad, a plot to bomb the New York Ci ty subway system in 2009 involving Najibullah Zazi, and the shooting at an El Al counter at Los Angeles airport in 2002 involving Hesham Hadayet. 31 Journalist Trevor Aaronson conducted a statistical study of terrorism-related prosecutions of 508 defendants and found that nearly half of the investigations resulting in terrorist-related charges involved the use of confidential informants. Of the 508 defendants convicted on terrorism or terrorism-related charges, 243 cases involved the use of an informant, 158 involved a sting operation, and 49 defendants were actually guided by the informant in forming the plan which would ultimately lead to their convictions.

For ex ample, a person suspected of buying drugs may be approached by an undercover agent pretending to be a drug dealer, or someone known to view child pornography online may be approached with an offer to meet a child in person. A prosecutor can bring charges against the target of an investigation wh en he or she seizes on the proffered opportunity, such as buying the drugs or agreeing to meet a child for illegal sexual conduct. Former FBI agent Michael German told us: Today's terrorism sting operations reflect a significant departure from past practice. When the FBI undercover agent or informant is the only purported link to a real terrorist group, supplies the motive, designs the plot and provides all the weapons, one has to question whether they are combatting terrorism or crea ting it. Aggrandizing the terrorist threat with these theatrical productions only spreads public fear and divides communities, which doesn't make anyone safer. 34 In many of the sting operations we exa mined, informants and undercover agents carefully laid out an ideological basis fo r a proposed terrorist attack, and then provided investigative targets with a ra nge of options and the weapons necessary to carry out the attack. Instead of beginni ng a sting at the point where the target had expressed an interest in engaging in illegal conduct, many terrorism sting operations that we investigated facilitated or invented the target's willingness to act before presenting the tangible opportun ity to do so. In this way, the FBI may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals. In these cases, the informants and agen ts often seemed to choose targets based on their religious or political belief s. They often chose targets who were particularly vulnerable\u2014whether because of mental disability, or because they were indigent and needed money that the government offered them. In some cases\u2014which have been particularly troubling for American Muslim communities\u2014targets were seeking spir itual guidance, and the government 34 Email from Michael German, fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, to Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute, April 8, 2014. 23 JULY 2014 informants or agents guided them towards violence. Relevant aspects of these cases are described below. Identifying Targets for Investigation Due to Religious or Political Views As previously noted, the FBI's \"radicaliz ation theory\" appears to consider certain beliefs, sympathy with particular caus es, and even certain forms of religious expression as likely precursors to terrorist activity.35 While there seems to be little evidence to support this theory\u2014and ther e is a great deal of disagreement among government agencies about the validity of \"radicalization theories\"\u2014the FBI appears to have relied on it to such an extent that it has entirely subverted its traditional approach to investigations. In the 13 sting cases we examined closely, paid informants and law enforcement officials relied on various political or reli gious indicators to de termine the extent to which a target was a potential threat. Some of the cases we reviewed appear to have begun as virtual fishing expeditions, where the FBI had no basis to suspect a pa rticular individual of a propensity to commit terrorist acts. In those cases, the in formant identified a specific target by randomly initiating conversations near a mosque. Assigned to raise controversial religious and political topics, these inform ants probed their targets' opinions on politically sensitive and nuanced subj ects, sometimes making comments that appeared designed to inflame the targets. If a target's opinions were deemed sufficiently troubling, officials concerned with nascent radicalization pushed the sting operation forward. For example: Case of the Newburgh Four: In the \"Newburgh Four\" case, one of the defendants, James Cromitie, first met FBI informant Shahed Hussain in the parking lot of the Musjid Al-Iklhas mo sque in Newburgh, New York in June 2008. At the FBI's direction, the informant had been frequenting the mosque for months and trying to stri ke up conversations about jihad with people there.36 35 See description of the \"radicalization theory,\" described above. 36 Trial Transcript at 1398, United States v. Siraj, 468 F.Supp. 2d 408 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (No. JUSTICE 24 Case of Shawahar Matin Siraj: In this case, Osama Eldawoody, a New York Police Department (NYPD) informant, fi rst identified Siraj as part of an assignment, which began in August 2 003, to monitor mosques in Brooklyn and Staten Island.37 No publicly available reports indicate that Eldawoody's surveillance was based on suspicion of criminal activity; on the contrary, Eldawoody's reports to his handlers merely covered demographics and religious behaviors, such as the number of people at prayer services and the subject matter of sermons.38 He met Siraj in September 2003 on one of his routine surveillance visits to Brookl yn. At the time, Siraj was working at his uncle's bookstore next door to the Bay Ridge mosque to support his family after his father had become disabled.39 Eldawoody, 50, posed as a terminally ill nuclear engineer with deep knowledge about Islam. He told Siraj that suicide bombings were forbidde n in Islam, but \"killing the killers\" was not. 40 He also showed Siraj pictures of human rights abuses against Muslims. Siraj described them in a letter written from prison: [H]e showed me grotesque abuses of the Muslim prisoners at Abu Ghraib and added his emotional voice as to not wanting to die without a purpose, of cancer. Then while I was inflamed with emotions at work, he would give me websites that I should visit when I got home to keep me insighted [sic] overnight.

For example: Case of the Fort Dix Five: The government claims that its case began on January 31, 2006, when a store cler k contacted the FBI. As he was converting a customer's VHS tape to a DVD, the clerk saw men with beards, the brothers Dritan and Eljvir Duka, saying \" Allahuakbar \" (God is Greatest) in Arabic at a shooting range, and contacted the authorities.42 But, Mohamed Shnewer, one of the other de fendants, had been in touch with FBI informant Mahmoud Omar for months before the clerk called the police, suggesting the sting operation had begun months earlier.43 Case of Rezwan Ferdaus: Ferdaus came to the atte ntion of the FBI after an owner of a gun shop reported someon e \"acting suspiciously.\" Ferdaus was not the person in the store, but the car's license plate traced back to the Ferdaus family\u2014leading to the FBI qu estioning him at home in October 2010. 44 On December 17, 2010, the FBI sent a confidential informant into a mosque Ferdaus was attending in Worcester, Massachusetts.45 Case of Yassin Aref: Aref was the imam of Masjid As-Salam, a small storefront mosque in Albany, New York .

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 26 settled in Albany.46 He and his wife Zuhur have four children. Prior to his arrest in August 2004, Aref had no criminal record.47 He had served as imam of the Albany mosque for almost five years.48 The FBI first took interest in Aref when it found his name, Albany address, and phone number listed in a notebook collected during a military raid in Rawah, Iraq in June 2003.49 The notebook was written in Kurdish, but the FBI's Arabic translator incorrectly translated the word kak, a common word in Kurdis h for \"brother,\" as \"commander.\"50 Informant Shahed Hussain targeted Aref, as well as another Albany Muslim named Mohammed Hossain, and the Albany mosque, starting in August 2003. 51 The prosecutors claimed Aref was an Al- Qaeda operative throughout the tr ial and appeal, despite evidence suggesting that Aref was not the operative the FBI had believed him to be.52 In other cases, government agents identified vulnerable young men and individuals with mental or intellectu al disabilities, and exploited their vulnerabilities. In some of those cases, informants met young men in online chat rooms and engaged them in di scussions, sometimes urging them down the perceived path toward radicali zation, as occurred in the cases of Adel Daoud and Hosam Smadi, described fu rther below. While it is true that young men and individuals with mental or intellectual disabilities have, on occasion, been involved in terrorism, and therefore cannot be ruled out for investigation, there are special concerns when highly aggressive and invasive police tactics are used on such vulnerable people. 46 Ibid. 47 Ibid. 48 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute intervie w with Shamshad Ahmed, president of Masjid As-Salam, Albany, New York, June 20, 2012. 49 Petitioner's Brief at 30, United States v.

Aref's attorneys recently filed a Motion to Vacate Sentence Conviction, alleging that Mohammed Yassin was in fact an Al-Qaeda agent who was killed in a 2010 missile strike in Gaza. Despite construc tive knowledge of that fact, the prosecution continued to allege in ex parte filings to the District and Circuit courts that Yassi n Aref was an Al-Qaeda ag ent named Mohammed Yassin.

At le ast eight of the defendants in cases we examined showed serious signs early on that they struggled with mental or intellectual disabilities\u2014diagnosed mental health problems or significantly low intelligence or difficulty comprehending basic co ncepts. These included: Case of Shawahar Matin Siraj: According to his attorney, Siraj was more interested in cartoons than world affairs when NYPD informant Osama Eldawoody began visiting him.53 Once Eldawoody showed Siraj grotesque pictures of abuses against Muslims, Siraj described himself as \"blinded\" by emotions; Eldawoody reported to his NYPD handlers that Siraj was \"impressionable.\"54 A forensic psychologist who evaluated Siraj for sentencing on behalf of the defens e described Siraj as having impaired critical thinking and analytical ski lls, and diminished ju dgment. \"Based on his intellectual limitations\" the expert said, \"he is susceptible to the manipulations and demands of others.\"55 Siraj's sister Saniya described her brothe r's juvenile interests, saying, \"Every day he would watch cartoons [and] play video games, Pok\u00e9mon in particular.\" 56 Even after his conviction, when he was placed in the Communication Management Unit in Te rre Haute, Indiana (see section VI), Siraj's first request was access to Pok\u00e9mon.57 Siraj wanted to please Eldawoody, whose alleged terminal i llness reminded him of his father's disability.58 In late June 2004, Siraj told Eldawoody that he was like a father to 53 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute interview with Saniya Siraj, Queens, New York, August 14, 2012. 54 Trial Transcript at 2289, United States v.

His mother, Mona, said in an interview that Daoud required extra assistance in school , and was heavily dependent on her: \"He's not the person with a complete min d. He didn't talk until five. He was the last one of my kids to talk. He does n't even talk Arabic....like the rest of our family, because he's slow.\" 63 Without many friends at school, Daoud was socially isolated and took refuge in the Internet, his parents told us. According to the criminal complaint, Daoud came to the governme nt's attention when he posted on online message boards and emailed ma terial relating to violent jihad. 64 In May 2012, less than six months afte r Daoud turned 18, two FBI online undercover employees began emailing with him.65 In July, Daoud met with an undercover FBI employee.

We tried to explain there is no jihad here. .... I told him when you give money to the poor, this [is] jihad. When you stay with your mother and father who need you, this is jihad. And he was so convinced, he said, \"I'll stay with you mom.\" 68 At this point, Daoud hesitated abou t what was religiously proper, and sought further religious guidance from the undercover employee, asking if his sheikh overseas could issue a fatwah (religious decree) justifying attacks on Americans.69 The undercover employee told him his sheikh could not provide the fatwah and continued to plan the plot with Daoud.70 On September 14, 2012, the undercover employee drove Daoud to downtown Chicago, to a green jeep loaded with fake explosives.71 Daoud drove the jeep to the target loca tion\u2014a bar in downtown Chicago.72 Daoud exited the jeep and attempted to deto nate the device, after which he was taken into custody by the FBI.73 Mona Daoud expressed her confusion at the government's pursuit of her son, contending that he would not have been capable of such a plot on his own: They say that he went downtown.

I have to tell his little sister to go with him.74 Case of Hosam Smadi: The FBI first identified Smadi on a website promoting terrorism in January 2009.75 Undercover FBI agents initiated correspondence with him, first online and then later in person. During their written correspondence, Smadi repeatedly emph asized that he did not know much about Islam, did not want to hurt innocents, and wanted to learn more about Islam before proceeding with any violence. 76 Yet rather than encourage these views, the FBI appears to have encouraged him to pursue violence. Throughout the government's correspondence with Smadi, an FBI behavioral analyst assessed his progress along the \"radicalization spectrum.\" For example, on April 28, 2009, the analyst noted that Smadi was \"experiencing anger displacement\" from his mother's death, and that he was \"motivated to please his father.\" 77 The analyst further noted, \"[h]is mother's death places him at the firs t stage of the radicalization process known as pre-radicalization.\"78 The analyst also noted Smadi's discussions on \"jihadist\" websites, noting that Smad i's \"singular nature of Internet use, affirms a hypothesis\u2014SMADI is acting as a lone wolf exhibiting three of the four stages of the radicalization process 1) pre-radicalization, 2) identification and 3) indoctrination.\" 79 In May, after viewing a video tape of Smadi's first in-person meeting with a government agent, the FBI analyst recommended that the government 74 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute intervie w with Mona Daoud and Ahmed Daoud, October 8, 2012. 75 \"Terror Plot Foiled: Inside the Smadi Case,\" US Depart ment of Justice, FBI press release, November 5, 2010, http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2010/november/terror-pl ot-foiled/terror-plot-foiled (accessed June 28, 2014). 76 Motion for Downward Departure and or Variance and Memo randum in Support at 20, United States v.

Smadi drove what he believed to be an explosive to the parking gara ge and then met an undercover agent in a waiting car. 81 From the car, he dialed a number on his cell phone that he believed was a code to detonate the explosive.82 Smadi was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use.83 In May 2010, he pleaded guilty to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, and the government dropped the bombing charge. 84 He was sentenced to 24 years in prison.85 Case of the Newburgh Four: Two of the defendants in this case, James Cromitie and Laguerre Payen, had some history of mental disability.

Yet he had severe mental he alth problems that even the FBI had acknowledged, raising questions about wh ether he would have been capable of following through with any plans on his own. Ferdaus was born in 1985 to parents who had immigrated to the United States inspired by what they saw as its economic opportunity and political freedoms.90 His father, a Muslim from Bangladesh, was a defense contractor. His mother, a Catholic of Portuguese descent raised in Angola, worked for the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance.

In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, six men flew from Portland to Hong Ko ng; from there they traveled to western China in an attempt to get to Afghanistan. After several unsuccessful attempts to get into Afghanistan, the group dispersed. 108 While the men were abroad, October Lewis, wife of defendant Jeffrey Battle, wired money to the group (she was later charged as the seventh defendant). 109 Most of the men eventually returned to Portland. After Battle returned to Portland, th e FBI sent confidential informant Khalid Mustafa to befrie nd some of the men an d obtain evidence of criminal conduct. Mustafa had previo usly been charged with drug and weapons offenses, but the charges were later dismissed due to his cooperation with the Port land Seven investigation. 110 The primary focus of the case was th e attempted travel to Afghanistan\u2014 allegedly to support the Taliban and Al-Qaeda\u2014conduct that had long since been completed by the time the informant was introduced. 111 However, while the informant did talk to the men about details of the group's travel to China, it is troubling that the informant seemed to hone in on Battle\u2014who may have had a mental disability\u2014in an effort to elicit inflammatory statemen ts from him.

And then these are the statements that the prosecution [used] to paint a picture of Battle's character.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 38 for Jeffrey Battle (t he latter two pleaded guilty to conspiracy to levy war against the United States). In at least two cases that we examined , an informant\u2014Shahed Hussain, the same in both cases\u2014offered the defendants mone y to entice them to participate in the plot. These are: The Newburgh Four: Forty-five-year-old James Cromitie was struggling to make ends meet when, in 2009, FBI in formant Hussain offered him as much as $250,000119 to carry out a plot which Hussain\u2014who also went by \"Maqsood\"\u2014had constructed on his own.120 The plot involved firing rocket- propelled grenades at Stewart Air Base and placing bombs at a synagogue in Riverdale, New York. Cromitie initiall y responded enthusiastically, slapping hands with the informant.121 Still, Cromitie was wary of proceeding with the plot and refused to speak to the info rmant for several weeks. But Cromitie had lost his job at Walmart and his financial situation became dire. He eventually called the informant to tell him he was broke and needed to make money. The informant immediately reiterated his original offer: \"I told you, I can make you $250,000, but you don't want it brother. What can I tell you?\" The transcript indicates that Cromitie agreed to see him. 122 The promise of financial reward was al so crucial to the recruitment of the other three members. Cromitie rela yed the informant's offer to David Williams, insisting that he would share the spoils with Williams to help with his sick brother's medical costs. 123 Williams' younger brother was sick with liver cancer and in need of a new liver. The pair drew in Laguerre Payen and Onta Williams with similar promises. Th e FBI also authorized the informant 119 Because Hussain was not authorized to offer this amount of money, he turned off the recording device when he made it and subsequently lied about the offer at trial.

In keeping with Islamic religious requirements pertaining to borrowing money, Hossain would take the loan without interest, and proposed that Yassin Aref, then imam of the mosque, serve as the witness to the loan transaction.129 The informant at times told Hossain that he had the $50,000 to lend from legitimate business deals. 130 But, on other occasions he also indicated that the money came from buying and selling a Chinese surface-to-air missile, which was to be given to a group called Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM). FBI Agent Thomas Coll, who handled the informant during the investigation, explained that he suggested the informant talk about JEM because it was based in Pakistan and the informant was Pakistani, so \"it would be a good cover story.\" 131 Neither Hossain nor Aref had any preexisting relationship with 124 Cromitie Appellate Brief at 17, United States v.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 40 JEM.132 The informant implied that givi ng these loans to Hossain was beneficial for business purposes and that he was involved on the side with the sale of ammunition.133 The government argued that the informant thereby offered both Hossain and Aref the opportunity to engage in illegal money laundering, for the benefit of JEM. Yet the government itself argued that Hossain's motive for participating in the loan transaction was money and that Aref was motivated by religious duty. 134 Aref's primary concern appeared to be in witnessing the loan transaction be tween Hossain and the informant, and ensuring there was proper documentation.135 When the informant pulled out the missile's trigger\u2014a re ctangular metallic box\u2014during a video-recorded meeting about the loan transaction in January 2004, Aref appeared preoccupied with counting the money the informant had handed him.136 Aref argued that this was because he was not privy to the di scussion about the missile transaction; the prosecution argued that it was because he was callous to it.137 Throughout the sting operation, Aref appeared uninterested in Malik's attempts to discuss terrorist organizations. In response, Aref would simply give his opinion, as an imam, on whether Malik's conduct was appropriate according to Islam. 138 Both men were convicted and sentenced to 15 years on charges of material support and money laundering.139 132 Trial Transcript at 1918, United States v.

Their continued participation in the government plot ensured periodic payments and, for some, additional money upon accomplishment of the plot. Vulnerable Targets: Individuals Seeking Religious Guidance In some cases we examined, a government agent appears to have taken on the role of a religious authority figure for a targ et who was searching for guidance about Islam because he was young, a recent convert, or socially outside the mainstream Muslim community due to race or ethnicity. These cases are particularly troubling to many in American Muslim communities, where members feel law enforcement is expl oiting the very paranoia described in detail in section VII. In some cases, the FBI employed versions of Islam when interacting with the target that led targ ets towards specific mindsets and actions. For example: Case of the Fort Dix Five: According to his famil y and friends, Mohammed Shnewer, who was 19 years old wh en informant Mahmoud Omar first approached him, was a loner.141 Omar was 40 years old and exerted a powerful influence over Shnewer as the two became friends. He hounded Shnewer to collect and burn to DVD videos depicting jihad-oriented violence; he even purchased, with FBI funding, a DVD burner for Shnewer. 142 The fact that Shnewer watched these videos with the informant, and the existence of some of the violent videos themselves, was used against 140 Barry Bujol; James Cromitie; Williams. 141 Law School's Human Rights Institute interview with Lamese Shnewer, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, September 26, 2012; Columbia Law School's Human Righ ts Institute and Human Rights Watch interview with Dritan Duka, ADX Florence, July 19, 2012. 142 Trial Transcript at 3014-15, United States v.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 42 Shnewer at trial. Omar also regularly initiated conversation about politics, and encouraged Shnewer to turn from non-violent actions, like prayer, to action. In an August 1, 2006 reco rded discussion between Shnewer and Omar, Shnewer brought up the confli ct in Chechnya. Omar said, \"Well then, what shall we do?\" Shnewer, su ggesting prayer, replied, \"Call upon our lord.\" Omar replied, \"Should we pray only, Mohamed?\" Omar also rejected Shnewer's suggestion to prov ide charity and continued to push Shnewer to suggest something more tangible. Under Omar's persistent pressure, Shnewer suggested a potential target to the informant: \"If you want to do anything, there is Fort Dix.\" 143 Eventually, Mohamed Shnewer and four others were indicted in 2008 for conspiracy to murder members of the US military and possession of firearms. 144 On December 22, 2008, all five men were convicted; Shnewer was sentenced life in prison.145 Case of Barry Bujol: Bujol was raised in a devout Baptist family in Louisiana. He converted to Islam as a student at Prairie View A & M. Tariq Ahmed, a lawyer with the Muslim Civi l Liberties Union (MCLU) in Houston, told us that \"Bujol was sincerely th inking about Islam and his obligations when he came about the topic of jihad,\" but he couldn't get answers from the local community, which feared th at the African-American convert might be an informant (another member of their community, Adnan Mirza, 143 Government Exhibit 605-B, Shnewer , No. 1:07-cr-00459-RBK (D.N.J.

Al-Awlaki forwarded to Bujol his book 42 Ways of Supporting Jihad .148 Bujol responded at least three times seeking further guidance.149 After placing Bujol under extensive su rveillance for more than a year,150 in about November 2009 the FBI planted a Muslim of Arab descent as a confidential informant (CI) in a jail cell alongside Bujol, who had been picked up for outstanding traffic tickets. 151 Bujol and the informant stayed in contact, and the informant told Bujol he was an operative for AQAP.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 44 just accepts it and tries to justify or accept what the CI said was the correct answer.... The e ffect on Barry was profound. Someone was finally willing to answer his questions.152 Daphne Silverman, Bujol's attorney at sentencing, said the informant encouraged Bujol to turn from \"defen sive jihad,\" related to the self or community, to \"offensive jihad,\" marked by proactive violence. \"Barry had always believed he had to participate in defensive jihad, but the CI told him he has to do this ,\" she said.153 Also, despite the FBI's instructions, the informant offered Bujol a job and gave money to his wife, telling him that \"people\" would support her while Barry was overseas. 154 Mark Wells White, a federal prosecutor on the Bujol case during the investigation and original plea nego tiations, disputed any concern about the FBI's investigative tactics: \"Why di d your guy get a bunch of stuff from [someone who said he was] an AQAP operative? Why did he get on a boat?\" 155 White also defended the info rmant's conduct as \"rapport- building.\"156 White explained, \"Barry was asking him questions [about religion, jihad], and the CI has to answer. He can't blow his cover.\"157 But several defense advocates told us that the CI's responses did not accurately represent the mainstream Muslim advice that Bujol would have gotten had community me mbers been available and willing to talk.158 With the encouragement of the government informant, Bujol eventually agreed to participate in a plot. A SW AT team arrested Bujol in May 2010 when, using a false ID provided by the informant, Bujol tried to board a ship with money, army manuals, phone cards, and GPS units that the informant 152 Human Rights Watch interview wi th Tariq Ahmed, June 26, 2012. 153 Human Rights Watch interview with Daphne Silverman, Houston, Texas, June 25, 2012. 154 Ibid. 155 Human Rights Watch interview with Mark Wells White, Houston, Texas, June 25, 2012. 156 Ibid. 157 Ibid. 158 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute and Human Rights Watch interviews with several defense advocates. 45 JULY 2014 told him to carry to an AQAP contact in Algeria.159 Bujol was arrested, and, after a bench trial, sentenced to 20 year s in prison for attempting to provide material support to AQAP and aggravated identity theft.160 Informants Ignoring Targets' Reluctance to Engage in Terrorism In several of the cases we examined, after identifying their ta rgets and cultivating them over months of close, intimate inte raction, government agents proposed new theories, ideas or\u2014eventually\u2014plots to see if their targets might take the bait. If they did, the government appears to have considered itself vind icated in its early assessment of the individual's underlying threat. The government appears unconcerned with whether these individuals would have actually had the interest, commitment, and ability to plan terrorist attacks without informants' aggressive recruitment or cult ivation. On the contrary, in some cases where the defendant initially or repeatedly expressed a reluctance to engage in violence generally or even, in a planning stage, to go through with the plot, informants ignored those statements and in stead pressed them to stay with the plot. For example: Case of Shawahar Matin Siraj: There are many indica tions that Siraj was hesitant to carry out the bombing in the days immediately leading up to it. When Eldawoody drove Siraj toward the 34th Street subway station where he would instruct Siraj to place false ex plosives in garbag e cans, Eldawoody asked Siraj if he was committed to their plan. Siraj said he would not participate if the situation seemed dangerous. 161 \"I have to, you know, ask my mom's permission. Every single thing matters, you know?\"162 said Siraj (who, as previously noted, was found to have impaired critical thinking skills and diminished judgment). Siraj also emphas ized that he would prefer to be a lookout to placing what he believed to be explosives in the subway.163 When 159 Government's Trial Brief at 15, United States v.

Case of the Newburgh Four: Early in their relationship, James Cromitie was quick to engage the informant, Hussain, in hateful rhetoric and to fabricate lofty stories of past violence, includin g tall tales that involved shooting a drug-dealer's son and firebombing NYPD stations.165 Still, the informant had to expend considerable efforts to over come Cromitie's re sistance to using violence.166 For months, the informant enco uraged Cromitie to turn his tough talk into action , but Cromitie refused,167 even, initially, upon the offer of valuable incentives.168 In many of their conv ersations, the informant responded to Cro mitie's expressions of ange r by urging him toward violence in the name of Islam.169 Cromitie, however, repeatedly explained that it was not for him to act si nce \"Allah will take care of it.\"170 At one point, when the informant continued to insistent on jihad, Cromitie 164 Ibid. 165 Decision and Order Denying Defendants' Renewed Moti on to Dismiss the Indictment Based on Outrageous Government Misconduct at 11, United States v.

But the promise of Pa radise proved insufficient to get Cromitie to take any affirm ative steps toward planning a jihadist attack. On December 10, Hussain pointed this out to Cromitie; defendant re sponded, \"Maybe it's not my mission then. Maybe my mission hasn't come yet.\" 172 Even after the informant offered Cromitie $250,000 to carry out an attack, Cromitie appeared hesitant and disappeared for six weeks, refusing to speak to the informant, despite the informant's constant effort s to contact him. Cromitie sold a $200 camera that the informant had bought him for surveillance of Stewart Air Base for around $60. 173 But he had lost his job at Walmart, and eventually returned to the informant, who reiterated his offer. In the same conversation, the informant told Cromitie that he was concerned for his own safety, and hinted that harm could come to Cromitie as well if he failed to engage in a terrorist attack. 174 Cromitie then said he was willing to go forward with Hussain's plan, but he did not want anyone to get hurt.175 Informants Playing Key Roles in Generating or Furthering the \"Plot\" In the cases examined, we found that info rmants not only encouraged targets to engage in violence, but came up with the \"plot\" themselves, and provided the targets with the means to carry it out. For example: Case of Newburgh Four: In this case, the FBI inform ant came up with a plot to detonate explosives near a synagogue in th e Bronx and to shoot military 171 Ibid., p. 721. 172 at 827, 3054, Cromitie , 7:09-cr-0558-CM-1 pp. 1824-1828. 175 Cromitie Appellate Brief at 16, United States v.

He also played a primary role in preparing the plot and inducing action (including through the offer of substantial financ ial rewards) by the defendants. As Judge Reena Raggi put it in reviewing the case on appeal at the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, \"The government came up with the crime, provided the means, and remo ved all relevant obstacles.\" 176 Indeed, Cromitie was not even able to buy a gun in Newburgh, although Hussain, the informant, had asked him to do so more than a dozen times.177 Hussain had to choose the targets, pr ovide the plot and the weapons, and direct the recruitment of the other part icipants. He even had to drive them from place to place in order for them to carry out the simple missions he assigned them, such as photographin g the targets and \"inspecting\" the weapons. 178 As trial judge McMahon put it: The essence of what occurred here is that a government, understandably zealous to protect its citizens from terrorism, came upon a man both bigoted and suggestible, one who was incapable of committing an ac t of terrorism on his own.... I suspect that real terrorists would not have bothered themselves with a person who was so utterly inept. ... Only the government could have made a terrorist out of Mr. Cromitie, whose buffoonery is positively Shakespearean in scope. 179 176 Transcript of Oral Argument, November 5, 2012, United States v.

The FBI interviewed both friends; one of th em was Jim Coates\u2014who worked with Mirza on the \"Why Islam\" campaign that sought to educate people about Islam to reduce negative stereotypes and perceptions. 184 Coates agreed to become a paid informant for the FBI. In 2005, the government introduced an undercover agent named \"Malik Mohammed\" to the group of Coates, Mirza, and co-defendant Kobie Williams. Mohammed posed as someone with a military backgrou nd who speciali zed in teaching hand-to-hand combat.185 The group regularly went to a camping area in Willis, Texas, where they barbecued, shot at a shooting range, and engaged in discussions on a variety of topics, ra nging from women to group travel to Afghanistan.186 Based largely on their conver sation, the prosecution in the case against Mirza alleged that thes e were \"training camps\" to prepare Mirza and his friends to go to Afghanistan and fight against US forces.187 According to the defense and Mirz a's acquaintances, though, these activities were far less menacing\u2014littl e more than men going camping, with the shooting and \"military training\" sessions suggested and encouraged by the FBI agents. Mirza's attorney, David Adler, told Human Rights Watch that even at the most egregious moments of discussion, it seemed to him \"similar to rednecks sitting around talking about the IRS.\" 188 Nonetheless, Mirza was eventually ch arged with eight counts of weapons charges and one count of conspira cy to provide material support. 189 183 Trial Transcript vol. 2 at 255, Mirza , No. No. 4:06-cr-00421-2 (S.D.

On cross-examination, the FBI agent admitted that Mirza never made a recorded statement about wanting the mo ney to go to the Taliban; however, there were recorded statements about the money going to a hospital or to families in Pakistan. 191 The prosecution argued, through recordings of the group's conversations, that the hospit al was a cover for getting the money to the intended beneficiaries: the Taliban or the Taliban's families.192 The remaining eight counts related to the handling of various guns and ammunition. For all but one of the gun-related charges\u2014a shotgun Mirza personally owned\u2014the possession occurred because the FBI agents brought the guns to the camping sites and provided them to Mirza to fire. 193 According to an FBI agent's own test imony, there was no evidence that Mirza wanted to practice shooting before the FBI informant came up with the idea. 194 There was no evidence Mirza was interested in meeting someone with a military background before the FBI introduced an undercover agent with that profile.195 Coates, the paid informant, appears to have initially suggested the idea of traveling overseas.196 The informant and count of possessing ammunition while illegally in the US.

Involving Third Parties in Conspiracies: The Case of the Fort Dix Five Mohamad Shnewer, Serdar Tatar, and the brot hers Dritan, Eljvir, and Shain Duka were indicted in 2007 for conspiracy to murder members of the US military and possession of firearms.198 Then-US attorney Chris Christie (now governor of New Jersey) praised law enforcement efforts as though a genuine plot had been stopped by detective work.199 In fact, the investigation involved two paid informants, more than a year of fruitless surveillance, and the dubious linking of an i llegal gun purchase to a plot of which only two of the defendants were aware. After pressing 19-year old Mohammed Shnewer to come up with a plot to attack Fort Dix, the informant, \"Mahmoud Omar,\" said they would need more support to pull off an attack.200 Shnewer offered to recruit the Duka brothers, but there is no indication that th e informant Omar or a second informant on the case, Besnik Bakalli, ever spoke directly with the Dukas about an attack. At trial, Omar stated that he did not believe th e Dukas knew about the Fort Dix plot.201 Instead of direct conversation with the Duka brothe rs, Omar would inquire with Shnewer to the progress of the recruitment, and Shnewer wo uld give alternating reports of progress.

Tatar was suspicious of the informan t and reported him as a potential terrorist threat to a Philadelphia police sergeant who frequented the 7-Eleven convenience store where Tatar worked.202 The police officer helped Tatar report Omar to the FBI.203 However, Tatar ultimately provided Omar a map of Fo rt Dix which he had because his father's pizza shop delivered to it.204 It is unclear why Tatar provided the map to Omar. Tatar aspired to become a law enforcement o fficer himself, and was in the process of applying to multiple police departments.205 A month passed between the time Omar first requested the map, and when Tatar actua lly gave it to him. Tatar claims that by stalling and eventually providing the map to Omar, he was attempting to support law enforcement efforts.206 Tatar, for example, had made recordings of Omar at their mosque, which he attempted to present to the FBI.207 During the same period, the FBI deployed another informant named Besnik Bakalli, who befriended the Duka brothers.208 Bakalli pretended to be seeking guidance on Islam and help in turning his life around.209 The Duka brothers embraced Bakalli, a fellow Albanian, as someone who needed assistance and a sense of family.210 As their relationship developed, Bakalli repeated ly asked the brothers about jihad, and whether it included violent acts. The brothe rs repeatedly told Bakalli that jihad was non-violent struggle to sustain their families and livelihood in the US.211 202 Ibid., p. 4714. 203 Tatar, who himself was interested in entering law enforcement, offered his phone number and address for the sergeant to give to the FBI.

On one trip during a holiday weekend in 2006, Bakalli asked each brother, \"We're training, right?\" According to the brothers, th ey answered no and were surprised at the question.212 However, at trial their paintbal l trips were used to support the government's claim that they were training for jihad.213 The recordings of the informant's conversations, in explicably, leave off the period of time during which these particular conversations occurred. In addition to the illegal gun sale, the gove rnment's case against Tatar and the Dukas was based on various pieces of evidence introduced at trial, including videos of attacks on US troops abroad found on Mohammed Shnewer's laptop, which prosecutors claimed served as inspiration and guidance for the Fort Dix operation. Prosecution expert witness Evan Kohlmann (see section IV) tried to connect these videos with the paintball and trips to the Poconos; he also tried to portray the acquisition of guns as evidence of jihadist activity. None of the prosecutors in the case responded to requests for comment. All five men were convicted on December 22, 2008.

Beginning in August 2006, the FBI paid Omar $1,500 per week during the investigation. Om ar received a total of $240,000 from the FBI. This included: $183,500 in payment unrelated to expenses, and $54,000 for expenses incurred during the investigation including car repair and rent. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 56 Under international law, a government may restrict freedom of association, expression or privacy for national securi ty purposes within strict limitations.221 However, a government may never do so in a discriminatory manner.222 The UN Human Rights Committee, the international body of experts that monitors state compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), has repeatedly highlighted that restri ctions on freedom of expression and privacy must be necessary to achieve a le gitimate aim, and be proportionate to the aim pursued. 223 Pursuing sting operations on the basis of individuals' religious practice or political beliefs violates the obligation under international law that investigations and prosecutions be impartial, and conducted in a non-discriminatory fashion. 224 221 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), adopted Decemb er 16, 1966, G.A. Res. 2200A (XXI), 21 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 16) at 52, U.N. Doc. A/6316 (1 966), 999 U.N.T.S. 171, entered into force March 23, 1976. Under article 19, \"1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference; 2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. 3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: ... (b) For the protection of national security or of public order ( ordre public ), or of public health or morals.\" While article 17 on the ri ght to privacy and family does not specifically allow for national security restrictions, it prohibits any interference that is arbitrary or unlawful. 222 See ICCPR, art. 2, which states that \"Each State Part y to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, co lour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status .\" According to Prof. Manfred Nowak in his authoritative analysis of the ICCPR, the restrictions specified in the rights to freedom of expression and association should be interpreted narrowly. For example, terms such as \"natio nal security\" and \"public safety\" refer to situations involving an immediate and violent threat to the nation. See Manfred Nowak, U.N.

What Constitutes Entrapment? The United States is obligated to provide criminal defendants with fair trials, both under US constitutional law and international human rights law.225 So-called entrapment\u2014where the government create s the opportunity for criminal activity, encourages an otherwise law-abiding person to engage in it, and then prosecutes him for it\u2014may violate fair trial rights. US law allows criminal defendants to raise the affirmative defense of entrapment, but may not adequately protect their rights to fair trials. Under US law a defendant can avoid criminal liability by showing both that the government induced him to commit the ac t in question and that he was not \"predisposed\" to commit it. 226 This \"predisposition\" in quiry focuses attention on the defendant's background, opinions, beli efs, and reputation\u2014in other words, not on the crime, but on the nature of the de fendant. In effect, it asks whether the government induced a good person or a bad one, and leaves that character determination to the jury.227 This character inquiry makes it exceptionally difficult for a defendant to succeed in raising the entrapment defense, particularly in the terrorism context, where inflammato ry stereotypes and highly charged characterizations of Islam and foreigners often prevail. Indeed, no claim of entrapment has been successful in a US federal terrorism case to date.228 (ICCPR), adopted December 16, 1966, G.A. Res. 2200A(XXI), 21 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 16) at 52, U.N. Doc.

Federal courts and juries have overwhelmingly upheld the use of undercover operations in terrorism sting cases. While entrapment may routinely be cited as a defense in these cases, to date, no terro rism defendant since 9/11 has won acquittal using such a defense.\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Department of Justice National Security Division Spoksman Dean Boyd's response to Trevor Aaronson's Terror Factory, cited in \"How the FBI Helps Terrorists Succeed,\" Atlantic , February 26, 2013, http://www.theatlantic.com/internat ional/archive/2013/02/how-the-fbi-helps-terrorists- succeed/273537/ (accessed June 20, 2014). ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 58 In several cases we examined, political an d religious views often appear to have been the primary \"predisposition\" leadin g authorities to conduct prolonged sting operations in which the authorities played a significant, if not leading, role in planning and financing the ultimate plot, raising serious fair trial concerns. For example, in the Matin Siraj case (see sect ion IV), the evidence submitted by the prosecution to prove Siraj's predisposition included a range of political statements including his empathy for Palestinian su icide bombers living under occupation, and his fascination with Osama Bin Laden. Particularly given the heightened jury emotions in terrorism cases, defense atto rneys believe that it would be impossible to win on entrapment grounds.229 In contrast with US law, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) of sting operations focuses on the whether induceme nt (also described as \"incitement\") to a crime occurred\u2014calling for the suppression of all evidence stemming from the incident. It also focuses on the defendant's conduct up to the point when the government intervened by introducing an informant or undercover agent. The United Kingdom Hous e of Lords has laid ou t a similar standard. 230 The court asks whether there has been a violation of the right to a fair trial as a result of improper undercover tactics by examin ing two issues: the conduct of law enforcement, particularly whet her it rises to \"incitement,\"231 and the domestic procedural safeguards available to the de fendant in arguing entrapment. While the ECtHR has rejected claims of incitement or entrapment where there was \"concrete evidence\" that the defendant had engaged in significant steps\u2014or at least \"initial steps\"\u2014toward committing the specific cr iminal offense before law enforcement 229 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute interview with Martin Stolar, defense attorney for Matin Siraj, New York, May 30, 2012. 230 \"The only proper purpose of police participation is to obtain evidence of criminal acts which they suspect someone is about to commit or in which he is already engage d.

Moreov er, law enforcement might not engage in some of the mo re problematic investigative tactics documented in this report if the entrap ment defense involved a more searching inquiry into police conduct rather than an investigation into the defendant's so- called predisposition to engage in terrorism offenses. 232 European Court of Human Rights, Case of Veselov and Others v.

Broad Charges: Material Support Cases Of the 494 individuals prosecuted in the United States for terrorism or terrorism- related crimes between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2011, 225 were charged under one of 23 federal statutes di rectly related to international terrorism. The remaining 269\u2014more than half of the total\u2014were charged under some other statute. They are included as \"terrorism -related\" in government reports because the Justice Department's National Security Division claims that the cases have some link to inte rnational terrorism. 234 In tandem with the expansion of the FB I's investigatory capabilities after the September 11 attacks, Cong ress amended its laws cr iminalizing the provision of material support or resources to terrorists or designated terrorist organizations to reach a broader range of conduct, leadin g to prosecutions that raise concerns about infringements on the rights to freedo m of expression and association. At the same time, prosecutors have increasing ly pursued material support charges against defendants. Indeed, the largest sh are of convictions in terrorism-related cases since September 11 is based on material support charges. Changes to the Material Support Statute The original incarnation of what is known as the material support statute, 18 USC \u00a7\u00a7 2339A and B, was enacted in 1994 as a response to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. It was intended to prohib it supply of weapons, physical goods, 234 While DOJ-NSD does distinguish between international and domestic terrorism, all of the cases we discuss here are considered \"international terrorism\" cases per DOJ-NSD classification, although many appear to have no international link. (See, for example, the Matin Siraj and Fort Dix cases discussed above.) 18 U.S.C. sec. 2331(1) defines \"international terrorism\" as activities that: \"(1)(A) in volve violent acts or acts dang erous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum [emphasis added].\" The definition of domestic terrorism is the same, with the exception that such acts \"occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\" See 18 U.S.C. sec. 2331(5). 61 JULY 2014 money and training to terrorist s and terrorist organizations.235 It made explicit exceptions for humanitarian assistance236 and traditionally protected expression.237 Amendments to the statute in 1 996, in response to the Oklahoma City bombing, narrowed the huma nitarian assistance exception,238 and removed restrictions on speech-based investigation.239 The 1996 statute also expanded the scope of the statute to enable prosecution fo r material support to \"designated foreign terrorist organizati ons\" (FTOs) under 18 USC \u00a7 2339B. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Congress passed the controversial Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing the Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act), which dramatically expanded the material support law. It broadened the scope of prohibited \"material support\" to include \"expert advice or assistance\" to a designated FTO, substantially\u2014and vaguely\u2014widening the ra nge of activities that qualified as support for terrorism. 240 It also provided the same maximum punishment for attempts and conspiracies to provide material support as for actually and directly providing material support. 241 In 2004, partially in response to litigation, Congress clarified some of the definitional lang uage in the material support statutes.242 Then in 2010, in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , a divided Supreme Court upheld the application of the law, including it s criminalizing of peace and human rights- 235 The original statute, 18 USC \u00a7 2339A, made it a crime to provide or conceal \"currency or other financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel, transportation and other physical assets\" with the knowledge or intent that th ey be used to further an act of terrorism. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, 1994, tit. XII ons not directly involved in such violations.\" 237 The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act forbid s investigations initiated based on \"expressions of support or the provision of financial support for the nonvio lent political, religious, ph ilosophical, or ideological goals or beliefs of any person or group.\" See ibid. 238 The new 1996 material support statute allowed for the provision of \"medicine or religious materials.\" Antiterrorism and Effective Death 2339A(b)), Act,\" tit. R. 3162, Pub.L. 10 7-56 (2002); The 2001 version also increased the maximum term of imprisonment for material su pport offenses from 10 to 15 years with a possible life sentence if a death occurs as a result of the support rendered. 241 Ibid.,\u00a7 811(f). 242 The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the definition of \"material support or resources\" applying to both sections , and the meaning of \"knowingly\" was ex panded to require \"knowledge that the organization is a designated terrorist organization,...that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorist activity..., or that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorism.\" \"Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Stat. 3638 (2004). ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 62 promoting activities provided to a designat ed terrorist organization, if coordinated with that group.243 The law empowers prosecutors to prosec ute conduct that might seem otherwise innocuous\u2014 translating books and publishi ng them online, or storing ponchos and socks, as described in two cases below\u2014for the ostensible purpose of preventing terrorism. While US courts have interpre ted this law as criminalizing conduct only\u2014 and not as infringing on freedom of a ssociation\u2014many scholars disagree. David Cole, a law professor who also served as counsel for plaintiffs in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , has written, \"what good is it to have a right to join or associate with a group if the government can make it a crime to do anything whatsoever on the group's behalf?\"244 One former prosecutor told us that in the interest of security, the material support statute allows a prosecutor to act well before any harm is imminent: \"From the perspective of a doctor who's identified a cancer, you don't want to take a chance. You take a bigger margin.\" 245 Our research suggests that the breadth of the material support laws has led federal prosecutors to levy criminal charges for reli gious or political conduct itself, or as the primary evidence of criminal activity. Waves of Material Support Prosecutions Prior to September 11, 2001, section 2339A was used twice and section 2339B was used four times. 246 But the expanded material support law resulted in a substantial increase in prosecutions. Based on our analysis of 494 cases the Department of Justice categorizes as terrorism or terrorism-related si nce September 11, 2001, the 243 Human Rights Watch joined a brief of amicus curiae in th e case, arguing that purely peaceable activities it conducts could fall within the ambit of the material support statute.

First, in the years immediately following the expansion, the Justice Depa rtment pursued cases based on a \"deep reservoir\" of information about politica l activists and charitable organizations obtained through intelligence collected prior to September 11, according to a former assistant United States Attorney. 248 In some cases the alleged conduct took place prior to 2001\u2014even decades before. The intelligence was newly available to the Justice Department as a result of th e USA PATRIOT Act, passed in 2002, which knocked down the \"wall\" between the FBI and the Justice Department and permitted much greater sharing between intelligence gathering and prosecution. 249 The Justice Department moved quickly to prosecute based on that evidence, and publicly touted the indictments as succe sses in the war on terrorism. As noted above, while the Justice Department had on ly prosecuted a total of six material support charges in the six years before 9/11, federal prosecutors charged 92 material support cases in the first three years thereafter. 250 The trend upward continued with a second generation of cases, beginning around 2005, which illustrate how the material su pport statutes offer law enforcement an alternative to resource-h eavy sting operations. 251 In some of these cases, the 247 Among the 494 defendants in our analysis, there were 917 se parate convictions. Of these, 18 percent (168 total) convictions, since September 11, 2001 have been pursuant to material support charges under sections 2339A or B. Another 10 percent of convictions (92) were for Conspira cy, and 6 percent (58) for False Statements. Human Rights Watch analysis of US Department of Justice data.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 64 government has used evidence of politica l speech to link individuals to terrorist organizations and prosecuted s eemingly non-criminal conduct. The following cases raise concerns about the use of material support charges: Case of Sami al-Arian In 2003, Dr. Sami Al-Arian, a professor of en gineering at the University of Southern Florida, was charged with 53 counts of supporting Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), including charges of providin g PIJ with material support. Al-Arian's case was one of the first material support prosecutions after September 11, 2001. DOJ reviewed almost 21,000 hours of wire tapped telephone recording amassed mostly pursuant to warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The crux of the prosecution's case centered on phone conv ersations Al-Arian had with PIJ prior to its designation as an FTO in 1995 252; prosecutors then relied heavily on evidence of Al-Arian's political views to convince the jury to convict him without establishing a link to any specific act of violence.253 Ultimately, after a trial lasting more than five months, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Rather than face th e prohibitive costs of another trial, Al- Arian decided to negotiate a plea agreement. In April 2006, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to make and receive contributions to PIJ.254 The judge departed from the government's recommendation in the plea agreement and sentenced Al-Arian to the maximum possible sentence under the agreement. Under that sentence, he was set to be released in April 2007. 255 After a series of contempt charges in Virginia, Al-Arian was released to house arrest in September 2008.

(\"There was never any evidence in the trial to show that Al-Arian or his co-defendants were involved with any violent acts.

The government indicated its intention to proceed with his deportatio n pursuant to a May 2006 removal order.256 Holy Land Foundation Prosecution The FBI began investigating the Holy La nd Foundation (HLF) long before the September 11 attacks. Although the case ag ainst HLF centered around its charitable contributions in the Occupied Palestinian Te rritories that allegedly assisted Hamas, much of the conduct at issue took place before Hamas was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997.257 The HLF, founded in 1989, was the largest Mu slim charity in the US in 2001, raising around $13 million a year. It provided funds directly to zakat committees in Palestine\u2014so-called because zakat , or charity, is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. The investigation of HLF began in 1993 after US citizen Muhammad Salah was arrested in Israel for his alleged role in Hamas.258 In 1993, Salah told Israeli interrogators that HLF provided support to Hamas, and the FBI began investigating HLF and other Muslim charities.259 After word leaked to the media that HLF was 256 In May 2006, shortly after his plea agreement was entered, the same prosecutor who tried the case against Al- Arian in Florida charged him before a grand jury in Northern Virginia. Gordon Kromberg, the AUSA, was investigating whether Islamic charities in the area were providing material support to terrorists. Al-Arian refused to testify on the basis of the content of his plea agreement. The court held him in civil contempt in November 2006, with the days served for civil contempt not counting towards his plea agreement sentence. In December 2007, the court lifted the order, and he continued to serve the rest of his sentence pu rsuant to the plea agreement. He was subpoenaed again in October 2007 and March 2008. In June 2008, after two separate federal courts held that the plea agreement did not preclude him from testifying, he wa s indicted on two counts of criminal contempt. He was released to house arrest in September 2008. Motion to Di smiss, United States v. Al-Arian, no. 1:08-cr-00131-LMB (E.D. Va.

HLF hired former congressman John Bryant as its attorney. Bryant repe atedly spoke to people at the Israeli embassy, the FBI, the State Department an d elsewhere; no one would provide him with information about whether HLF was vi olating US law, including whether it should stop funding any particular group.260 Bryant described the prosecution as \"a terrible, terrible tragedy.\"261 He believed the case was politically motived, and described it as \"grossly unjust.\"262 The defendants were never a ccused of directly funding terrorist organizations or terrorist attacks nor were the individual zakat committees accused of doing so.263 Rather, the prosecution's case rested on the following argument: HLF provided funds to Palestinian charities; the charit ies implemented Hamas' social programs, the social programs helped win the \"hea rts and minds\" of the Palestinian people, and that support enabled Hamas' military wing to carry out terrorist attacks. Former US Consul-General in Jerusalem Ed Abingt on called this the \"house of cards\" theory of Hamas financing. 264 The first trial ended in a hung jury; all the defendants were convicted in a second trial. The defendants could be prosecuted in th is manner because the material support statutes do not require any showing that a defendant intended his or her support to be used for an illegal end. Instead, the statute as interpreted by the Supreme Court bars any support\u2014even that aimed at en couraging compliance with international law\u2014on the theory that it is fungible and frees up resources that terrorists can then use for criminal ends. 265 To be convicted of material support, an individual need not have intended to commit any underlying crime or even know how the terrorist 83.

Hashmi was a recent graduate of Brooklyn College when he traveled to the UK to pursue a Master's degree. Hashmi, a devout Salafi Muslim, was an outspoken activi st against US foreign policy. 269 He had voiced his criticism in public forums both in the United States and the UK.270 In 2006, the US government intercepted Ha shmi at a UK airport as he was about to board a plane to Pakistan.

At trial and on appeal the government insisted that the translation of this document alone was sufficient to garner a conviction.297 The trial judge denied a defense motion to dismiss the material support charges on the ground that the charges were base d on activity protected by the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. 298 The judge also denied a motion by the defense requesting a special verdict form that would show whether the jury based any material support verdicts on speech protected by the First Amendment.299 After an eight-week trial, the jury convicted Mehanna on all counts, including material support. While prosecutors argued that evidence of Mehanna's speech and trip to Yemen were separate and sufficient bases for convicting him of material support, the jury did not indicate whether it co nsidered speech alone to be sufficient. 300 Mehanna appealed the verdict on the basis of unduly prejudicial evidence and First Amendment violations.

Yaghi was also charged with conspiracy to murder, kidnap or maim, but the prosecution never specified where, when or how.304 The FBI began investigating Yaghi in 2006 after allegedly receiving tips from the Muslim community about him. 305 In late 2006, Yaghi told Daniel Boyd\u2014who had established himself as a leader among Mu slim youth in Raleigh\u2014that he would be traveling to Jordan to visit his grandmot her and other family, further his Islamic education, and hopefully, find a wife.306 In response, Boyd recommended a mosque where Yaghi could study and gave him the name of a Muslim woman in Jordan looking to get married. 307 Prosecutors said that terms like \"getting married,\" \"going to the beach,\" and \"getting en gaged\" were actually code words for advancing the conspiracy; the governme nt then used expert witness Evan Kohlmann (see section IV) to lend credence to that theory.308 301 United States v.

Yaghi traveled to Amman, Jordan in October 2006, staying for about three months. There were three short phon e calls, and three emails between Yaghi and Boyd during that time, and the govern ment said the emails showed that Yaghi had criminal intent.309 Yaghi had asked about the loca tion of the mosque Boyd had recommended and questi ons about the ideology of violent jihad.310 To bolster this point, the government used posts on Ya ghi's Facebook profil e, which included political opinions, observ ations, and self-styled \"gangsta rap\" lyrics.311 The government used the same type of evidence against Hassan with respect to his 2007 trip to Jordan. 312 At trial, Boyd testified that he had never made any agreement to provide material support or to mu rder anyone in a foreign country.313 In February 2007, Yaghi learned that Boyd and his family were planning a trip to Israel/Palestine and asked if he and Hassan could join. 314 Boyd agreed to let Yaghi come but told him that the trip was a \"famil y thing\" and that Yaghi would be on his own.315 The Boyds, Hassan and Yaghi were denied entry to Israel. Although they all eventually went to Jordan instead, Boyd had no contact with Hassan and Yaghi while they were overseas. 316 Hassan and Yaghi vacationed at a beach in Egypt before returning to the United States in July 2007.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 74 Hassan and Yaghi bought roundtrip tickets, paid for their own tickets, used their real names and proper identification docu ments, and openly told law enforcement authorities at several airports they were there to \"see the sights\" and see Daniel Boyd.318 Nonetheless the government told the jury in its opening statement that \"the evidence, in cumulative form, will sh ow convincingly that [the 2007 trip] was for the purpose of finding a way to the ba ttlefield, trying to get hooked up with terrorists overseas who can take them to the battlefield to kill Americans.\"319 After Yaghi returned from Jordan in 2007 , the FBI visited his home more than 10 times, though Yaghi's mother, Leila Yaghi, told us that she refused them entry.320 Yaghi and Hassan communicated with Boyd two times after returning from Jordan, meeting him at his store in Raleigh in the summer of 2008. They had no communication thereafter. Both men were ar rested in July 2009. Boyd and his two sons pleaded guilty to the charges agai nst them and testified against Yaghi and Hassan at trial. 321 Boyd was sentenced to 18 years in prison; his sons were sentenced to seven years each. Hassan an d Yaghi were convicted and sentenced to 15 and 45 years, respectively.322 Human Rights Concerns Several of these cases raise serious concerns about violations of individuals' rights to free speech and association under the US Constitution and international law. According the UN Human Rights Committee, \"The criminalisation of expression relating to terrorism should be restricted to actual participation in terrorist acts or instances of intentional in citement to terrorism.\"323 Similarly, the government can only punish association with a group that intends to commit crimes if the association itself is intended to further the illegal aims.324 318 Ibid., Day 2, pp. 123-24. 319 Ibid., Day 2, p. 88. 320 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute interview with Leila Yaghi, Raleigh, North Carolina, October 14, 2012. 321 Sentencing Statement for Dylan and Zak Boyd at 10, 48, United States v.

Some of the cases discussed above raise serious questions about whether the US is co mplying with those obligations. arguments below was the proposition th at expressive activity that would otherwise be protected by the First Amendment becomes unprotected when engaged in with a group that the executive branch has designated. Under the Court's well-established precedents, however, associat ion with a group that engages in unlawful activity cannot be punished unless it is intended to further the group's unlawful aims. Hinging application of the statute on a disfavored association only compounds the constituti onal problem by layering an impermissible restriction on the right to association upon an impermissible restrictio n on speech. 'For liability to be imposed by reason of association alone, it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held a specific intent to further those illegal aims.'

ICCPR in article 14 requires, among other things, a fair and public hearing that includes the right to examine witnesses, and the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 76 IV. Unfair Trials Terrorism suspects, like all criminal defendants, have the right to a fair trial, guaranteed under both the US Constitution 327 and international human rights law.328 A fair trial requires that defendants have access to competent counsel and adequate time and resources to prepare their defense. In a fair trial, if prosecutors seek to introduce evidence th at would unfairly prejudice the jury, the judge will exclude the evidence. Defendants also have the right to challenge the basis for any warrant and to test whether law enforcement complied with the law during the investigation. Terrorism cases in the US si nce September 11, 2001 have raised serious fair trial concerns. This is largely due to investigat ive and detention tactics that occur prior to trial including prolonged solitary confinement during pretrial detention, as well as procedural impediments imposed by the US Congress or courts; use of prejudicial evidence such as evidence obtained through coercion; classified evidence obtained by warrantless wiretaps that cannot be fairly contested; and inflammatory evidence, including evidence about terror ism in non-terrorism cases that unfairly plays on jurors' fears. Prejudicial Evidence Terrorism is by definition terrifying. Whil e most crimes have specific victims, a major purpose of terrorism is to instill in the general population a fear that they themselves at any time could be victims of a terrorist attack. This means that jurors in terrorism trials may already be frig htened or anxious about the crimes in question and the defendant's role; th ese fears may be heightened by the introduction of certain forms of evidence at trial. 327 U.S. C ONST . amend. VI. 328 ICCPR, arts. 14(1), 14(3)(e), and 14(3)(g). The UN Huma n Rights Committee has said that the specific elements of article 14(3) are \"minimum guarantees, the observance of which is not always sufficient to ensure the fairness of a hearing.\" UN Human Rights Committee, General Comment 13 , Equality before the courts and the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent court established by law (Art. 14) (Twenty-first session, 1984), Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Ad opted by Human Rights Tr eaty Bodies, para. 5. 77 JULY 2014 In a number of terrorism-related cases we examined, federal prosecutors have introduced, and federal judges have acce pted, various types of evidence that should have been considered overly pr ejudicial\u2014that is, evidence that might unfairly influence the jury. Such evidence may taint the jurors' ability to judge objectively and deprive the defendant of a fa ir trial, which includes the absence of any influence on the judge or ju ry, regardless of motivation.329 Evidence that has been admitted in terro rism cases and that raises concerns includes statements obtained from the defendant by coerci on, references to terrorism unrelated to the charges, and ev idence that might be more prejudicial than probative. With the specter of terro rism looming largely over the case, some judges allowed witnesses to testify anonym ously (including by shielding their true identity from the defense), making it di fficult for the defend ant to challenge the veracity of witness testimony, and permitted other witnesses to testify when their personal circumstances suggested th ey were biased or unreliable. Evidence Obtained by Coercion Under international law, evidence obtained from defendants by coercion cannot be admitted against them. 330 Similarly, US law, follow ing the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in Miranda v. Arizona,331 requires law enforcement to give the defendant a series of advisories about his rights before the defendant's confession can be admitted as evidence against him. 329 UN Human Rights Committee, General Comment 32, Article 14 : Right to Equality Before Courts and Tribunals and To A Fair Trial (Ninetieth session, 2007), Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Adopted by Human Rights Treaty Bodies, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/32 (2007), para. 25. (\"Fairness of proceedings entails the absence of any direct or indirect influence, pressure or intimidation or intrusion from whatever side and for whatever motive. A hearing is not fair if, for instance, the defendant in criminal proceedings is faced with the expression of a hostile attitude from the public or support for one party in the courtroom that is tolerated by the court, thereby impinging on the right to defence, or is exposed to other manifestations of hostility with similar effects.\"). 330The ICCPR provides an individual with the right \"not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.\" This right includes the right not to have confe ssions obtained by torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment introduced at trial. ICCPR, art. 14(3 )(g). The committee also noted that sometimes torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or pu nishment (prohibited by article 7 of the ICCPR) are used to compel the accused to confess or testify against hims elf, and that \"[t]he law should require the evidence provided by mean of such methods or any other form of compulsion is wholly un acceptable.\" See UN Human Rights Committee, General Comment 13, para. 14. 331 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 78 The Miranda requirements do not apply to evidence taken by foreign agents. Accordingly, US courts have adopted a separate \"voluntariness\" standard, which provides that for a confession obtained by foreign agents to be admitted in a US court, it must be the product of the defe ndant's \"essentially free and unconstrained choice.\"332 If the defendant's \"will has been overborne and his capacity for self- determination critically impaired, the use of his confession offends due process.\"333 However, in terrorism cases in the US, prosecutors have repeatedly introduced evidence that appears to have been th e product of coercion, and courts have accepted it. For example: Case of Muhammad Salah In 1993, Israeli authorities arrested Salah at a checkpoint between Israel and Gaza.334 The Israeli Security Agency interrogated him for about 50 days.335 In federal court proceedings in 2006, Salah alleged that, while in interrogation, an Israeli interrogator stripped Salah naked and threaten ed that his family would be harmed or killed if he did not cooperate. 336 Salah said the interrogater deprived him of sleep for 48 hours, and forced him to sit shackled on a slanted child-size chair while he interrogated Salah. 337 He then moved Salah to a 2 X 3 foot \"refrigerator cell\" with his hands handcuffed behind his back to a metal bar, all while wearing a hood reeking of vomit and urine. 338 Salah said he was subjected to loud music and the sound of people screaming in pain. Under these conditions, Salah signed two documents written in Hebrew\u2014a language he did not speak or read. He wrote a third statement after being transferred to a cell where he was threatened by other inmates. 339 When Salah challenged the admission of th ese statements against him at trial in the US, the judge found the testimony of his Israeli interrogators\u2014who testified 332 Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 225 (1973). 333 Bustamonte , 412 US 218, 225-26 (quoting Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 US 568, 602 (1961)). 334 United States v. Marzook, 435 F. Supp. 2d 708 (N.D.

Salah was ultimately acquitted of terrorism charges in the fede ral case, though convicted of obstruction of justice and sentenced to 21 months in prison.342 Case of Ahmed Abu Ali In September 2002, Abu Ali, a US citizen, traveled to Saudi Arabia to study at the Islamic University in Medina. In May 2003 , three compounds primarily occupied by Westerners in the Saudi capital of Riya dh, were bombed. The Saudi authorities engaged in mass arrests in Riyadh, Mecca, Medina, and elsewhere. In June 2003 the Saudi security service, the Mabahith al-Amma (General Investigations), detained Abu Ali, holding him for 20 mo nths without charge. Abu Ali later said Saudi agents subjected him to physical abuse, including slapping, whipping, and scarring; threatened him with amputation ; and denied him food and access to a lawyer.343 Abu Ali made statements that he la ter claimed were involuntary and the product of torture.344 He alleged that after about one month in detention, a captain of the Mabahith had him copy in his own handwrit ing a \"confession\" that his Saudi interrogators had summarized.345 While Abu Ali was in Saudi custody, FBI officials 340 Ibid., p. 718. 341 Ibid., pp. 736-37. 342 United States v.

Salah had also be en placed on a \"specially designated terrorist\" list by the Department of Treasury in 1995, pursuant to Israeli proceedings, and was kept on the list despite his acquittals of terrorism related ch arges in 2007. The designation, which as imposed by executive order and without a means to challenge it, re stricted Salah's ability to work and conduct basic transactions.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 80 traveled to Saudi Arabia and watched from behind a two-way mirror while the Saudis interrogated him, including questions based on inquiries the FBI had provided.346 The FBI also interrogated Abu Al i directly, with and without the presence of Saudi officials, though Abu Ali did not allege the FBI mistreated him.347 Nearly a year later, in May 2004, the FBI to ld a family friend of Abu Ali that the FBI had no further interest in his detention. Also that month, the US Embassy informed the Saudi government that there were no pending US legal proceedings against Abu Ali and that his detention should not continue at the behest of the US. Nevertheless, the Saudi authorities co ntinued to hold Abu Ali. His parents filed a petition for his release in federal court in Washington, DC, arguing that he was in constructive US custody. In December 2004, District Judge John Bates ordered the US government to provide information regarding Abu Ali's arrest and detention. 348 Instead, a federal grand jury issued an indictment against hi m in the Eastern District of Virginia. In February 2005, Abu Ali was handed over to US authorities and flown to Virginia. The indictment charged him with providing material support to and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and designated terrorist groups.349 During the trial, the defense moved to suppress videotaped \"confessions\" of Abu Ali made while in Saudi custody on the grou nds that they were involuntary and the product of torture. The government conducted an \"investigation within an investigation,\" to determine if his claims were credible. 350 Former prosecutor David Laufman told us that the prosecutors were aware of reports that Saudi Arabia had a record of torturing prisoner s, including an annual US State Department country report on human rights. 351 Saudi officials testified via live video-feed that Abu Ali had not been tortured in Saudi custody, and other witnesses testified that Abu Ali's behavior in the period after his arrest was not consistent with someone who had recently been tortured. 352 District Judge Gerald Bruc e Lee found the testimony of 346 Abu Ali , 395 F.

In opposing Abu Ali's motion to suppress his statements, the prosecution brief began: \"The defendant in this case represents one of the most dangerous terrorist threats that America faces in the perilous world after September 11, 2001: an Al-Qaeda operative born and raised in the United States, trained and committed to carry out deadly attacks on American soil.\" 354 The government deemed Abu Ali's allegations of torture \"a fabrication\" designed to \"thwart justice\" and relied he avily on the testimony of Saudi officials that they had treated Abu Ali humanely.355 The judge did not allow the defense to introduce as evidence at trial the many reports by the US State Department and organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that have documented torture in Saudi Arabia\u2014inclu ding evidence of torture of two UK nationals in prison at the same time as Abu Ali. 356 The judge concluded that evidence of other individuals' torture was not relevant to whether Abu Ali had been tortured.357 Abu Ali was convicted of conspiracy and pr oviding material support to terrorists, as well as conspiracy to assassinate fo rmer President George W. Bush.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 82 Inflammatory or Improper Evidence Particularly in cases that are the result of an FBI \"sting\" operation, prosecutors wish to show the defendants' state of min d and pre-existing interest in terrorism. To do so, prosecutors frequently displa y videos or show websites found on defendants' computers. They seek to introduce evidence about the defendants' views of Islam and certain religious words or phrases. In a number of cases, prosecutors have introduced as evidence statements that were mistranslated, and as a result were much more inflammatory than they would have been if correctly translated. And in some cases where the ch arges have nothing to do with terrorism, prosecutors seek\u2014and judges have permi tted\u2014the introduction of inflammatory evidence of terrorist violence unrelated to the case that is highly prejudicial. Inaccurate Translations In many terrorism cases we reviewed, the prosecution's expert asserted a singular, extreme and contested meaning of an Arabic word, which failed to accurately represent the subtleties of language. Thes e translations often resulted in highly inflammatory\u2014and inaccurate\u2014evidence being presented against the defendant. For example: Case of Adnan Mirza: In this case, the judge allowed an FBI undercover employee involved in the sting operat ion who had no demonstrated expertise in Islam or Arabic to testify about the Arabic word \" Shaheed ,\" which the undercover claimed Mirza had said he hoped he would get. According to the undercover employee, \"' Shaheed' was, basically, the blessings that you would get if you lived a proper Muslim life and went out as a martyr, died as a martyr.\"359 The undercover employee did no t explain\u2014and probably did not have the expertise to even know\u2014that the term has a broad meaning, which includes not only dying while fighting to defend Islam, but also dying because 359 The following exchange was between the prosecutor and th e FBI employee: \"Q. And what kind of travel were y'all talking about? A. Going over to the Pakistan/Afghanistan/Ira q region. Q. And then Mr. Mirza says in reference to that conversation, 'I hope that I get' \u2014I'm pron ouncing it wrong, I'm sure\u2014 'Shaheed'? A. Yes. ... Q. Can you describe from your experience, working as an undercover and working within th e Muslim community, what this term meant? A. In my experience, 'Shaheed' was, basically, the blessings that you would get if you lived a proper Muslim life and went out as a martyr, died as a martyr.\" Trial Transcript , vol. 2, pp. 265-67, United States v. Mirza, No. 4:06-cr-00421-2 (S.D. Tex. Oct. 28 , 2010), aff'd , No. 10-2075 (5th Cir. Oct. 25, 2011), cert. denied , 132 S.Ct. 1725 (2012) 2011 Term; renumbered No. 11-8595, 2012 Term). Al so problematic in this case is the fact that the terrorism- related conspiracy charge against Mirza related to sending mone y to the Taliban, not traveling directly to fight with the Taliban; this conversation does not appear particularly probative of the conspiracy charge of sending money. 83 JULY 2014 of religious persecution, or for th e well-being of others. It was also problematic that, over the defense' s objection, the judge allowed the undercover employee, with no demonstrat ed expertise in Islam, to define for the jury an Islamic concept.360 As with the repeated references to \"jihad\" in Mirza's trial and many other terrorism trials, the prosecution presented a definition that was the most extreme, ignoring other inte rpretations of key words like Shaheed .361 Case of Barry Bujol: Evidence introduced agai nst Barry Bujol also raised concerns about language. When the informant talked to Bujol about traveling to Yemen and fighting with the \"holy warriors,\" Bujol often responded, \" Inshallah \"\u2014an Arabic term that lite rally means \"God willing.\" The prosecution presented this as demonstrating Bujol's clear determination to fight with Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). But, Bujol was a recent convert to Islam, and the word inshallah may be used in many different ways\u2014such as simply to signal \"okay\"\u2014particularly by those who have recently acquired an Islamic vocabulary.362 The government's definition of other Arabic terms, including hijrah , or emigration, was likewise controversial.363 In Bujol's case, becaus e he chose to represent himself at trial, the government's us e of inaccurate or disputed phrases went largely uncontested until the sentencing phase. In some cases, mistranslation of record ed conversations between the defendants and the informants, or misidentification by the government of the speaker, may have distorted their meaning in ways that had a negative impact on the defense. For example: 360 Ibid. 361 The word \" Shaheed \" comes from the root word \" Shahadat, \" which means testimony or witness. A core tenet of Islam is the Shahada, in which Muslims bear witness to the oneness of God and the finality of Muhammed's prophecy. A Shaheed is any individual who dies as a witness to his or her faith. While it does apply to someone who dies fighting defending Islam, the term Shaheed can also refer to someone who dies as a sacrifice for the well-being of others, or someone persecuted for religious reasons. 362 See, e.g., Human Rights Watch interview with Ali Sadiqi , Falls Church, Virginia, July 18, 2012 (\"Americans often use it as 'okay, okay.' They've just learned an Arabic word, so they use it a lot, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything.\") Sadiqi filed an expert report in Bujol's sent encing case.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 84 Case of Matin Siraj (see section II): One part of the transcription of a conversation between the informant and Siraj, which was conducted in Urdu (a Pakistani language), refers to \"SUB #1\" who described concern for people's lives. The speaker was Siraj, yet was not labeled as such. 364 Siraj described in a letter from prison that later in the transcript \"I clearly state 'We have to drop it!' which the transcri ber identifies with a (?) mark, as if I were asking a question, as I was clearl y declaring dropping the 34th Street station scheme.\" 365 Siraj felt that the transcription failed to present that he was attempting to back out of the plot. Case of Yassin Aref (see section II): During the trial, Aref became extremely agitated and the defense proposed that another translator double-check the accuracy of the translations. 366 Aref said the government distorted almost all the recordings they had, particul arly when he spoke in Kurdish.367 Aref alleges the government also manipulated his statements to make him sound dangerous, for example by playing over and over recordings of terms like \"jihad \" that he or the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan (IMK) used in the 1990s, to make it look like the IMK was calling for jihad against the West or that he was praising mujahideen . \"They knew very well that the jury took these words as though they were a call for using violence against civilians in the west, while they knew it was all about Kurdish peshmerga and their struggle for freedom. They had nothing to do with any 'global ji had' activity.\"368 Evidence of Unrelated Terrorism or Violence The most frequent terrorism-related of fenses\u2014charges of providing material support to terrorism or terrorist organizations, or conspiracy\u2014are extremely broad.

Pr osecutors in US terrorism cases have sought to establish knowing participation in a conspiracy by showing videos or websites found on defendants' computer s. Yet, often the videos have little relevance to the charges. In the trial of Tarek Mehanna (see sectio n III), the government presented a variety of inflammatory pictures to the jury: 28 different images of New York's World Trade Center in flames, 33 video clips and 95 th umbnail photos, many of which were only found as cache files on Mehanna's computer. 369 The prosecutors mentioned Osama Bin Laden 18 times before the close of the trial, even though there was no evidence presented of any relationship between Mehanna and Bin Laden. 370 This tactic was particularly troubling in th e case against the Fort Dix Five, where the prosecution showed numerous violent vide os found on the defendants' computers, alleging that defendants possessed and viewed the videos, without even attempting to show that the defendants in tended to commit acts similar to those in the videos. A journalist observing the tr ial described the videos as follows: The [sniper] video opens with several scenes of American troops in Iraq, moments before a sniper's bullet cuts them down. Next comes a blaring air-raid siren, followed by still images of US troops lying on the ground or being dragged from the street, presumably dead or gravely wounded.

A more graphic description followed: ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 86 The videos also depicted beheadings. In response to a defense motion, the judge ordered that the actual decapitations not be shown to jurors, for fear of unduly prejudicing them against the defendants. Shain Duka, one of the defendants, describe d one juror reacting to a lengthy video of US soldiers being killed in battle by insurgent snipers. The juror \"got up from her seat before exiting for the break, gave us all a stare of death, turned around and slammed the binder of transcripts...

Informant Besnik Bakalli testified that after Dritan Duka watched a video of Anwar Al-Awlaki, the US-born Yemeni cleric wh o was killed by a US drone strike in September 2011, Dritan said he was \"going to start something,\" and that \"we have enough people ... you can do a lot [of damage] with seven people.\" 374 But in later recordings, Dritan essentially retrac ted his statement, telling Bakalli that people are not allowed to train with terro rists, and that to him jihad meant not Much of the content played like a jihadist version of MT V or Grand Theft Auto, with fast-cut action, screeching soundtracks, and heavy use of cartoonish graphics to accompany fetishistic violence. In addition to the surreptitiously shot sniper footage, prosecutors played a video tribute to Osama bin Laden, made with the same aesthetics. There also was video of roadside bomb attacks on US military Humvees and other vehicles in Iraq. In one, off-camera bombers shout, \" Alla Akbar ,\" which means \"God is great,\" as they detonate the explosives. Another lengthy video depicted jihadist fighters sett ing up mortars and engaging in a nighttime firefight. 372 Letter from Shain Duka to Columbia Law School's Huma n Rights Institute, August 17, 2012 (on file with Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute). 373 Troy Graham, \"Fort Dix Juror: 'They were going to do it,'\" Philadelphia Inquirer , January 25, 2009, http://articles.phi lly.com/2009-01-25/news/25280685_1_juror-fort-d ix-split-verdict (accessed June 25, 2014).

Th e ruling meant that if Dritan wanted to rebut the recording he would have to give up his right not to testify and expose himself to wide-ranging questioning from the government.376 Evidence Suggestive of Terrorism in Non-Terrorism Cases Some of the most troubling evidence we examined was adduce d in non-terrorism cases, where the government nevertheless sought to draw connections between the defendant and known terroris ts or terrorist activities. The issue is closely tied to the government's use of the Foreign In telligence Surveillance Act (FISA) (see discussion below). For example: Case of Pete Seda In February 2005 the government charged Pete Seda (born Pirouz Sedaghaty) with conspiracy to defraud the US government and filing a false tax return, in connection with an investigation into Al -Haramain Islamic Foundation, a charity based in Saudi Arabia; in 2000, Seda had founded the Ashland, Oregon branch of Al-Haramain. Seda was living overseas at the time he was indicted 2005; he voluntarily returned to the US to face char ges in August 2005. At the outset of the trial, the federal prosecutor stressed that the government was not seeking to hold Seda to account for any terrorism offenses. 377 Yet the specter of terrorism permeated Seda's trial. The government used as a demonstrative exhibit (it was never admitted into evidence) a 3 x 4 foot chart with photographs of Seda, his co-defendant Soliman al-Buthe, an Al-Haramain 375 Appellants' Joint Opening Brief and Joint Appendix Vol. I (Pages 1 -26) at 72, United States v.

The government's theory was that Seda falsified his tax returns in orde r to funnel money to the Chechen mujahideen. One of Al-Haramain's activities in the US was the distribution of Qurans and other religious material to US prisons. One version of the Quran that Al-Haramain distributed was called the Noble Quran and included a controversial appendix describing forms of jihad. The prosecutors argued that Seda shared the mindset of the authors of the index, which, the pros ecutors claimed, called on prisoners to \"Perform jihad against polytheist s by wealth, body, and tongue.\" 379 The judge did not permit Seda to introduce a volume of letters, articles, emails, and a book he had written about Islam that the defense argued would have countered the government's portrayal of him \"as a fundamentalist supporter of terrorism.\" 380 The Department of Justice touted Seda's conviction as a success in the fight against terrorism. 381 In contrast, prominent local attorney and Muslim convert Tom Nelson described Seda's trial as \"Islamophobia on parade.\"382 In August 2013, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part Seda's conviction, ordering a new trial.383 The opinion noted that Seda's \"tax fraud trial was transformed into a trial on terrorism.\"384 The court went on to note: 378 Ibid., pp. 8-9, 25, 29, 32. 379 Transcript of Trial at 38-40, Sedaughty , No. 05-60008-HO, 2011 WL 356315. 380 Many of the documents were excluded because they had been in Seda's possession or found on computers used by one of his employees.

Yasrebi was initially charged with violations of the sa nctions regime, as well as tax fraud and money laundering, though the indictment and supers eding indictment remain sealed.386 Though he was not charged with terrorism-related offenses, prosecutors attempted to draw connections betwee n his charitable work and terrorism throughout the proceedings against him. Child Foundation, based in Portland, Oregon, provided education and assistance to impoverished children in Iran, and Yasrebi accordingly had significant communication with individuals in Iran . In September 2000, Yasrebi contacted OFAC to inform it of his work and requ est a determination that his work did not violate the sanctions regime. Yasrebi was aw are of a similar char itable organization that received information from OFAC that its charitable donations to Iran did not violate OFAC regulations an d was represented by the same attorney that had represented that organization. 387 OFAC responded to Yasrebi's corresponden ce by noting that filing a license application or requesting information\u2014as Child Foundation had\u2014did not excuse noncompliance, but did not tell Yasrebi or Child Foundation that a license was required. OFAC then transferred Child Fo undation's request to its Enforcement Division. While noting that the ordinary procedure would be to issue a demand letter, internal OFAC documents indica te that \"[b]ecause of the criminal investigative interest by the US Attorney's Office and US Customs Service in this matter, OFAC Enforcement will not proc eed with the issuance of a demand 385 Ibid.

Th e government initiated surv eillance of Yasrebi shortly after September 11\u2014it is not clear wh ether his second letter triggered the surveillance.389 For eight years, US authorities amassed a mountain of eviden ce, none of which appears to have shown any support for terrorism. Yet the case was investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force and FISA was utilized (see below) . Yasrebi ultimately pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud OFAC and the Internal Revenue Service. Prosecutors repeatedly made reference to terrorism even though Yasrebi was never charged with any terrorism-re lated offense. The sentencing judge, District Judge Garr King, noted that even though the mone y Child Foundation sent to Iran was for humanitarian purposes, it \"did violate the embargo in effect at that time.\"390 The prosecution sought a sentence of 30 months' imprisonment in part because of the \"national security\" and \"terrori sm\" implications of the case,391 which the judge apparently rejected in imposing one year of home detention in which Yasrebi could go out in consultation with his probation officer.392 Yasrebi's defense attorney, David Angeli, told us that he felt that once the government suspected terrorism it was unab le to let go of the idea. Recognizing that the volume of money tran sferred to Iran ($10 million over several years) might reasonably arouse suspicion, he nevertheless felt that the government was unable to see the facts clearly: 388 Office of Foreign Assets Control License Determination, Referral #02-102-08, June 17, 2002 (on file with Human Rights Watch). 389 Yasrebi's defense memorandum explains: \"[T]he government used FISA wiretaps to listen in on a voluminous number of telephone calls involving Dr. Yasrebi and ot hers. On multiple occasion s, the government also intercepted mail, faxes, and other commun ications to or from CF [Child Fou ndation], Dr. Yasrebi, and others. And in the middle of the night on December 10, 2006, government agents covertly entered CF's offices, copied seven computer hard drives, rifled through CF's files, photog raphed numerous documents, and left without leaving a trace that they had ever been there.\" Defendant Mehrdad Yasrebi's Sentencing Memorandum at 15, United States v.

And the result is that these people's lives ar e just being destroyed.393 Holy Land Foundation Case In this case (see section III) the defendan ts were never accused of directly funding terrorist organizations or terrorist attacks, nor were the Palestinian charities they funded accused of doing so. Nonetheless, they were prosecuted on the notion that the social programs they financed help win the \"hearts and minds\" of Palestinian people for Hamas. Former US Consul-General in Jerusalem Ed Abington told us that the United States Agency for International Developm ent (USAID) had funded the same zakat committees that the Holy Land Foundation (HLF) provided funding to, and that clearly the US government did not consider them fronts for Hamas.394 Abington testified at both HLF trials. He te stified about personally visiting zakat committees, and noted that while some committees ha d members who were also members of Hamas, he did not believe the committees were controlled by Hamas.395 Abington also testified that the Central Intellig ence Agency (CIA) had assisted in the development of Palestinian se curity forces, and that Israel's intelligence\u2014on which much of the case was based\u2014was not reliable.396 393 Human Rights Watch telephone interview with David Angeli, December 18, 2012. 394 Ibid. 395 Ibid.; Defendants' Amended Joint Motion to Compel Discovery, United States v.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 92 After the trial, the CIA sent Abington a le tter saying he had spoken contrary to his obligation to keep information confiden tial, and that he could be prosecuted.397 During the second trial, the CIA sent a la wyer to observe Abington's testimony, and the judge provided less latitude, limitin g the scope of his testimony about CIA involvement in Israel.398 Because the defendants were accused of ultimately supporting a structure that permitted Hamas' military wing to engage in terrorist acts, the court admitted evidence pertaining to bombings committe d by Hamas. It also admitted images of Palestinian school skits of suicide attacks with no relationship to the defendants, and images that were pulled from the de fendants' computers even though they were images that automatically download onto a user's computer when viewing particular websites. 399 Many US terrorism cases involve allegations that the defendant was either in contact with known terrorist groups (or believed he was when in fact he was communicating with an undercover agent or informant), or aspired to be associated with those groups. In order to prove a charge of providing material support for terrorism (discussed in section III), the prosecutors can introduce evidence of terrorist activities about which the defendant himself may have no knowledge. They generally do so through the use of expert witnesses. Unlike eyewitnesses, expert witnesses have wide latitude to te stify on matters about which they do not have firsthand knowledge. In particular wi th informant cases\u2014in which the defendant may have believed he was in contact with a member of a terrorist group but actually was not\u2014expert witnesses have provided evidence about terrorist groups about which the defendants themselves ma y have been entirely unaware.

Kohlmann has testified as an expert in at least 24 federal cases and 2 military commissions.400 While he wrote a thesis on Arab Afghans, Kohlmann does not speak fluent Ar abic or any other language relevant to his research, meaning that his online research focuses on English-language material.401 Nor does Kohlmann have an extensive hi story of travel to or field work in regions where Islamist armed groups operate.402 Yet Kohlmann's testimony has been relatively wide-ranging, arguably far outside his areas of expertise. For example, while K ohlmann more typically testifies about Al- Qaeda, the district judge in Yassin Aref's trial allowed him to testify about Jamaat-e- Islami (JEI) of Bangladesh, the Islamic Mo vement of Kurdistan, and other Kurdish groups. Kohlmann had 36 to 48 hours in which to prepare his written report, and during a deposition indicated that he di d not know anything about the political situation in Bangladesh or the JEI of Ba ngladesh, including who its leaders were.403 The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the prosecution's use of Kohlmann's expert testimony, citing a \"liberal standard for the admissibility of expert testimony.\"404 The appeals court reviewed the tria l judge's decision on an abuse of discretion standard, so Kohlmann's test imony on JEI Bangladesh was admissible even despite his professed lack of knowledge about it. Often, Kohlmann's testimony reaches dr amatic conclusions, suggesting that activities or materials linked to the defen dants are characteristic of terrorism.

Nevertheless, he concluded that the defendants likely \"fit the classic profile of contemporary violent extremists and that there is a high prob ability of the existence of a home-grown terrorist network.\"407 Kohlmann believes that people overestimate the impact of his testimony and that his testimony is often useful to the defense as well as the prosecution.408 Defense attorneys see it differently. Daphne Silverma n, Barry Bujol's attorney at sentencing, told Human Rights Watch: Kohlmann is an expert in how to use th e Internet, like my 12-year-old. He has found all the bad [stuff] about Islam, and testifies as if what he is reading on the Internet is fact. He was paid ar ound $30,000 to look at websites, documents, and testify.409 She contrasted that with a judge's denial of Bujol's request to call a religious expert at trial, concluding, \"The [imbalance] in expe rt testimony is an injustice that is really coloring these trials\u2014you end up with just a government show.\"410 Anonymous Witnesses Trials in US courts are co nsidered public, and virtually all witnesses testify using their true names.

At times the witness' identity is hidden even from defe nse counsel, making it nearly impossible for the defense to investigate the person's background. The use of anonymous witnesses raises concerns about adequate protections of the right to a fair trial. International human rights law requires that everyone charged with a criminal offense be able to examine the witnesses against them. 412 The use of anonymous witnesses violates fair trial righ ts because it deprives the accused of the necessary information to challenge the witness' reliability. The Human Rights Committee has said that anonymous testimon y should not form th e primary basis for conviction.413 While the cases we documented did not rely exclusively or primarily on 411 The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution requires that \"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right...to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" See Crawford v. Washington, 541 US 36 (2005) . International law provides for the right to a fair and public hearing, and that the accused has the right \"[t]o examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him.\" ICCPR, art. 14(3)(e). The UN Human Rights Committee considers the defendant's right to confront witnesses in the same manner as the prosecution a necessary component of equal access and equality of arms. Equality of arms\u2014equal rights for both the defense and prosecution\u2014\"is a key element of human rights protection and serves as a procedural means to safeguard the rule of law.\" UN Human Rights Committ ee, General Comment No. 32, para. 2. The defendant is entitled to examine witnesses in the same manner as the prosecutors. The Human Rights Committee has interpreted this right \"to guarantee to the accused the same legal powers of compelling the attendance of witnesses and of examining or cross-examining any witn esses as are available to the prosecution.\" UN Human Rights Committee, General Comment 13, para. 12. While intern ational law requires that tr ials be public, the ICCPR does permit closure of portions of trial to the public and media for national security reasons (the ICCPR also permits closure of trials for reasons of morals or public order). See ICCPR, art. 14(1). But the provision is about publicity, not the defendant's right to be informed of all evidence against him. 412 ICCPR, art. 14(3)(e). 413See UN Human Rights Committee, \"Consideration of Repo rts Submitted by State Parties under Article 40 of the Covenant, Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee, Nether lands,\" CCPR/CO/72/NET, August 27, 2001, http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G01 /443/74/PDF/G0144374.pdf?OpenElement (accessed June 28, 2014), para. 12. The UN Office of the High Commissi oner for Human Rights, in its training materials on fair trials states: \"Testimony of anonymous victims and witnesses during trial is unlawful, but can in exceptional cases be used in the course of criminal investigations.

The international criminal tribunals and the European Court of Human Rights have not completely ruled out the use of anonymous witnesses. See, e.g., Rome Statute of the In ternational Criminal Court (R ome Statute), A/CONF.183/9, July 17, 1998, entered into force July 1, 2002, art. 68(5) (anonymity of a witness where necessary for that witness's protection may be permitted so long as \"[s]uch measures are exercised in a manner which is not prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused to a fair and impartial trial\"); Europe an Court of Human Rights, Krasniki v. the Czech Republic , no. 51277/99, 28 February 2006; European Court of Human Rights, Doorson v. the Netherlands , 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 96 anonymous testimony, the use of such testimony for critical components of the case, including expert testimony, raises fair trial concerns. Anonymous witnesses were used in the Holy Land Foundation case 414 and the case of Muhammad Salah. They were also used in the case of Mohamed Mohamud, who was convicted in January 2013 of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction following a sting operation. 415 Mohamud twice thought he was detonating a bomb via his cell phone at a Christmas-tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. At trial, the FBI agents who had been involved in the sting operation testified using pseudonyms and in light disguise. In January 2013, Mo hamud was convicted of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction; in June 2014, the district court denied his motion for a new trial. At time of writing, Mohamud has not been sentenced. 416 Evidence from Warrantless Wiretaps under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act In dozens of terrorism ca ses, prosecutors have used as evidence information obtained by wiretaps or physical search es not subject to the standard probable cause requirements in criminal cases. In these cases, the government obtained information pursuant to either the Foreig n Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), or the FISA Amendments Act (FAA)\u2014two statut es that permit surveillance without a traditional warrant. Applications under FISA are reviewed by the specially created Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), which sits in secret and does not have any structures in place that would of fer meaningful opposition to government requests. The FISC issues warrants based only upon a showing of probable cause that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, not that there is probable cause that the target is suspected of criminal activity. 414 In the Holy Land Foundation case, defendants claimed they had difficulty adequately challenging a fact witness and an expert witness who testified anonymously. Defendants found it particularly challenging to test the expert's credentials. See United States v. El-Mezain, 664 F.3d 467 (5th Cir.

Since its inception, the FISC has received more than 30,000 applications for authority to conduct electronic surveillance or physical searches. Of those, it has denied nine, and partially denied another three.417 Under the FAA, the government does not need any kind of warrant at all. Rather, it obta ins year-long authorizations from the FISC to collect \"foreign intellige nce information,\" defined broadly (see below) so long as one end of the communication is \"reasonably believed\" to be outside the US and the government follows cert ain procedures it submits to the FISC for approval, intended to minimize the amount of in formation collected on \"US persons.\"418 In practice however, an enormous number of US-person communications are still swept up in the surveillance.419 Background: Broadening of the Foreign In telligence Surveillance Act since 9/11 The US Congress enacted FISA in 1978 in the wake of the Watergate scandal and other concerns about warrantless wiretapping.420 FISA was intended to rein in government surveillance excesses by requir ing judicial authorization to conduct surveillance to collect \"foreign inte lligence information\" inside the US.421 417 In its 2012 annual report to Congress regarding FISA, th e Justice Department noted that in that year the FISC reviewed 1,856 government applications \"for authority to conduct electronic surveillance and/or physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes.\" None of the requests for electronic surveillance were denied (although 40 were subject to unspecified modifications). The annual report to Congress does not make clear whether any requests for physical searches were denied or modified.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 98 Ordinarily, electronic searches and physic al evidence-collection are governed by the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which protects against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\"422 This generally requires that evidence used against a defendant be obtained through a warrant based on probable cause of criminal activity.423 FISA does away with the traditional warrant requirement in certain circumstances, on the theory that the government has the inherent authority to conduct foreign inte lligence surveillance, even inside the US, without a traditional warrant.424 Instead, the government can obtain an order from the FISC in an ex parte (only one party) proceeding upon a showing of probable cause that the intended target of the su rveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.425 FISA originally required that the collection of foreign intelligence information be a primary purpose of the surveillance, leading to what was colloquially referred to as the FISA \"wall,\" in which law enforcement could not be involved directly in coordina ting surveillance with the intelligence community under FISA. 426 However, after 9/11, Congress amended FISA in 2001, substantially broadening its scope. The amendments took down the wall, permitting law enforcement to become more directly involved in coordinating surveillance under FISA. 427 And Congress changed the requirement that foreign intelligence collection be \"a primary purpose\" to merely \"a significant purpose.\"428 422 US Constitution, amendment IV. 423 Mapp v.

Bush authorized warrantless surveillance\u2014surveillance without either a traditional warrant or an order from the FISC\u2014inside the US. 431 It is not clear to what extent information obtained pursuant to that prog ram was used in criminal prosecutions. In 2008, Congress broadened FISA even fu rther, by passing the FISA Amendments Act (FAA), which permits the attorney genera l and director of national intelligence to issue one-year blanket authorizatio ns for surveillance of non-US persons \"reasonably believed\" to be outside the Unit ed States in order to acquire \"foreign intelligence information\" without a warrant. 432 \"Foreign intelligenc e information\" is defined very broadly, to include not just information important to national security, such as information about weapons of ma ss destruction or terrorism, but also information that merely \"relates to\" the \"s Purpose Requirement,\" Harvard National Security Journal , p. 101; In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 735 (FISACR 2002) (\"If the certification of the application's purpose articulates a broader objective than criminal prosecution\u2014such as stopping an ongoing conspiracy\u2014and includes other potential non-prosecutorial responses, the government meets the statutory test.

These procedures are purportedly intended to minimize the acquisition of US-person commu nications as well as apply limits to the use and dissemination of the information obtained.434 These procedures are classified, though the US has declassi fied some minimization procedures in response to certain Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. It is not clear if these procedures will be made available to the public going forward. As for targeting procedures, the only ones made available to the public thus far are a 2009 version that was leaked to the media435 by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.436 Both the one-year authorizations as well as the targeting and minimization procedures must be approved by the FISC, but once approved, there is no requirement that th e court monitor how the rules are applied or conduct oversight.437 When the government plans to use the FISA-obtained evidence in a criminal prosecution against a defendant who was under surveillance, 438 the attorney general must give advance notice.439 However, if the evidence was obtained through FISA but not directed at the defendant\u2014for example, if a co-defendant or witness was subject to surveillance or phys ical searches pursuant to a FISA order\u2014 FISA does not require the government to notify the defendant in advance of its plans to use the evidence.440 Because FISA orders are issued in secret, the subjects 434 50 U.S.C. \u00a71881a(d) and (e) and 50 U.S.C. \u00a71801(h). 435 Glenn Greenwald and James Ball, \"T op Secret Rules That Allow NSA To Use US Data Without a Warrant,\" Guardian, June 20, 2013, http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-without-warrant (accessed June 26, 2014). 436 Letter from Human Rights Watch to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, \"Comments of Human Rights Watch to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB),\" August 1, 2013, http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_mater ial/Comment%20HRW%20PCLOB%2 0Final%208-1-13_0.pdf, p. 5; \"Strengthening Privacy Rights a nd National Security Oversight of FISA Surveillance Programs,\" testimony of Jameel Jaffer, Deputy Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Lara W.

The \"use restrictions\" are themselves quite general, namely, that use should be for a permissible general purpose such as countering various ty pes of security threats, rather than for an obviously impermissible purpose, such as discrimination. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 102 either on the basis that it was obtained illegally, or that the surveillance exceeded the bounds of what was authorized.445 In practice, however, it is extremely difficu lt for the defense to exercise this right due to the secrecy that pervades the collec tion of evidence pursuant to FISA and the FAA. If the prosecution intends to use evidence obtained from electronic surveillance under FISA, the attorney genera l must disclose in advance intent to use that information. 446 However, if the defendant cha llenges that information, the attorney general may file an affidavit in dicating that disclosing the information pertaining to the order would harm national security; if he does so, the court must consider the application and any order in camera , and the defense cannot participate.447 The court can disclose certain in formation to the defense to help determine if the surveillance was lawful, but \"only where such disclosure is necessary to make an accura te determination of the lega lity of the surveillance.\" 448 This means that the defense must operate blindly, challenging the legality of the order (or surveillance absent a FISC order), or law enforcement's compliance with it, without being able to see the materials that initially suppor ted the surveillance. The statute requires that similar notice be provided if information obtained pursuant to the FAA is to be used. 449 Yet until recently, the government refused to provide such notice by inst ead using FAA-obtained information to support a FISA application. Defendants were provided notice that info rmation was obtained under FISA, but the fact that the basis for the investigation originated from warrantless surveillance under the FAA was not disclosed. If the defendants had been aware that they were subject to warrantless surveillance, they might have filed constitutional or other challenges. 450 Following an internal Justice Department 445 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 attorney general is required to provide the same notice of intent to use information obtained pursuant to the FAA as for information obtained pursuant to FISA. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1881(e). 450 In July 2013, FBI Deputy Director Se an Joyce publicly described warrantless surveillance of Basaaly Moalin, five months after he and his co-defendants had been convic ted of conspiracy and material support for terrorism, among other offenses. Moalin's defense attorney had sought information about warrantless surveillance, but his motions had been denied. After Joyce's statement, the defe nse filed a motion for a new trial, raising, among other things, the constitutionality of warrantless surveillance. The defense motion for a new trial was denied. See United 103 JULY 2014 debate about whether to disclose the fact that warrantless surveillance formed part of the chain of information that led to a FISA order,451 in 2013 the government began providing such notice.452 Since 2007, the FBI has used secret eviden ce obtained under FISA to prosecute at least 27 accuse d terrorists. 453 These include the following: Case of Amina Ali and Hawa Hassan : Amina Ali and Hawa Hassan were arrested in August 2010 as part of a country-wide investigation into support for the Islamist armed grou p Al-Shabaab in Somalia.454 They were convicted of providing material support for terro rism for sending clothing and money to Al-Shabaab. On the same day they were arrested, the Department of Justice unsealed indictments against 12 other individuals in two other states.455 Only during the trial did the public learn that Ali's and Hassan's phones had been tapped for months . Ali's attorney said the order authorizing the surveillance was pursuant to FISA but that he never saw the order or the underlying facts cited in su pport for its acquisit ion.

In 2007, the Nint h Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the suit was not barred by the state secrets privilege.468 On remand, the district court found that Al-Haramain had established it had been su rveilled and the government had presented no evidence that established it had a warrant.469 The judge granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs, and awarded $20,400 each to two Al-Haramain attorneys in liquidated damages fo r the FISA violation, and $2.5 million in attorneys' fees and costs.470 On appeal, however, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the suit was barred by sovereign immunity, \"effectively bring[ing] to an end the plaintiffs' ongoing attempts to hold the Executive Branch responsible for intercepting telephone conversations without ju dicial authorization.\"471 The plaintiffs elected not to appeal to the Supreme Court.472 The Ninth Circuit's ruling means that even if a plaintiff can establish violation of FISA, as Al-Haramain di d, it has no recourse in court. If other circuits follow that reasoning, the government will remain immune from liability for violating FISA. 2299, 09-2300, 09-2301, 09-2302) .

The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), enacted in 1980, provides procedures for prosecuting federal criminal cases involving clas sified information, including at both the di scovery and trial stages. 473 CIPA was originally passed in 1980 to address cases of \"graymail,\" or \"the tactic of a defendant who threatens to disclose classified informatio n in the course of a prosecut ion,\" particularly in cases of espionage.474 Today, CIPA and CIPA-inspired procedures (in civil cases) are frequently used in terrorism cases where cla ssified information is in play, usually in the form of classified evidence provided by the government against the defendant.475 CIPA requires both parties to provide notice when classified information is at issue, initially at a pretrial conference. 476 Courts applying CIPA pr ocedures are called on to determine whether discoverable classified information can be \"(1) omitted, (2) summarized, or (3) substitu ted with an admission.\" 477 While this usually occurs ex parte, the record is preserved for appeal.478 Upon the government's request, the court can issue a protective order preventing defe nse from disclosing cl assified information to a defendant.479 Where a court authorizes disclosure of specific classified information, the government may request that in lieu of disclosure the information be substituted with a summary or an admission.480 Finally, where fair trial necessitates the disclosure of classified information that the government is unwilling to disclose, remedies include dismissal of the indictment or of certain counts.481 Throughout this 473 Robert T. Reagan, National Security Case Management: An Annotated Guide (Washington, DC: Federal Judicial Center, 2011), http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf /lookup/TSGuid01.pdf/$file/TSGuid01.pdf (accessed June 29, 2014), p.3. 474 Richard P.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 108 process, the defendant must retain \"substantially the same ability to make his defense as would disclosure of the specific classified information.\"482 CIPA causes significant delays, both because counsel must obtain security clearances, and because the process of substitutions and summaries can add months or even years to discovery and pretrial proceedings. Several lawyers involved in the Barry Bujol case (see sectio n II) said that key evidence against Bujol was classified, and they faced delays in getting access to that evidence while waiting for clearance. CIPA presents particular challenges when it comes to discovery. Defense counsel may have trouble identifying what inform ation they believe the prosecution has that would be helpful to the defense. Defense counsel must do so without consulting their client, affecting the client's ability to have effective assistance of counsel. And even if defense attorneys do identify relevant material, CIPA permits the court to provide summaries or make substitutions, meaning the defense will never have access to th e original evidence. 483 Evidence obtained by foreign governments is frequently classified. In the earlier post-September 11 cases, this tended to involve evidence obtained when Americans were picked up in foreign countries and interrogated by foreign agents, often at the behest of the United States. The following cases illustrate how the in troduction of classified evidence can create serious difficulties for the defense and undermine the fair ness of the trial: 482 18 U.S.C app. 3 \u00a7 6(c)(1). Classified evidence may not be shown to the jury but withheld from the defendant. \"The district court's admission of the classified versions of the documents as evidence for consideration by the jury without disclosing the same versions to Abu Ali . . . wa s clearly contrary to the rights guaranteed to Abu Ali by the Confrontation Clause.\" US v. Abu Ali, 528 F.3d 210, 253 (4th Cir. 2008). 483 See, for example, Jonathan Hafetz, Habeas Corpus after 9/11: Confronting America's New Global Detention System (New York: NYU Press, 2011), p. 224. \"To help facilitate this review, courts have ordered disclosure only to members of the defense team with a security clearance and barred the defendant himself from seeing the information. This 'cleared counsel' solution, however, presents a problem from a defense perspective. It prevents a defendant from helping his lawyer assess the relevance of materials, thus impairing a defendant's constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. It also can jeopardize a defend ant's constitutional right to self-representation, since defendants typically lack the security clearance necessary to review classified info rmation themselves. Furthermore, judges can evaluate the relevance of materials requested in discovery ex parte, considering arguments by the government but excluding the defendant and his counsel from participating.\" See also, E llen Yaroshefsky, \"Secret Evidence Is Slowly Eroding the Adversary System: CIPA and FISA in the Courts,\" Hofstra Law Review , vol. 34 (2006), p. 1067. 109 JULY 2014 Case of Mohamed Warsame: Warsame was held in solitary confinement while awaiting trial for five-and-a-half years, the longest re corded period of time for any pretrial detainee in the federal system (see below). In an interview, District Judge John Tunheim attributed part of that delay to the length of time involved in processi ng classified material under CIPA.484 The district judge had personally compared all of the unclassified substitutions proposed by the government with the classified source material. 485 The slow process contributed to Warsame' s lengthy pretrial detention under abusive conditions. Case of Ahmed Abu Ali: In this case, the court appointed private attorney Nina Ginsberg well into the proceedings to review classified evidence for the defense, although she was not otherwis e part of Abu Ali's defense team. Abu Ali's main defense lawyers, who did not have security clearances, 486 were not allowed access to any classified inform ation or permitted to be present at hearings determining the admissibility of classified evidence and the sufficiency of evidence meant to substitute for the classified evidence. This situation hampered Abu Ali's defense ov erall, with Abu Ali's long-standing defense attorneys completely in the da rk about the defenses Ginsberg had raised in the classified hearings. \"Part of how you develop your defense is people talking to each other and develo ping strategies,\" Ginsberg explained. \"I wasn't allowed to tell them anythi ng that was classified, and I thought there were substantial issu es that ought to have been part of the defense that were excluded by the judge....There were entire other defenses that were the subject of classified hearings which we lost.\" 487 Yet Ginsberg was never able to share these with the main defense team. 484 Human Rights Watch interview with District Judge John Tunheim, Minneapolis, Minnesota, July 23, 2012. Judge Tunheim previously had significant exposure to classified information, as he served as the chair of the US Assassination Records Review Board, an independent federal agency in char ge of declassifying the government records on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, from 1 994-98. Tunheim is the curren t chair of the US Judicial Conference Committee on Court Administration and Case Management. His experience presiding over cases involving CIPA prompted him to consider proposing revisions; in particular, he believes judges should be able to review classified material electronically. 485 Federal Judicial Center, \"National Security Case Studies,\" http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/TS130625.pdf/$file/TS130625.pdf, p. 254. 486 The government denied one of the defense attorneys secu rity clearance, while the other attorney did not apply.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 110 Classified Statements by Persons Subjected to Torture The difficulties the defense can face when seeking access to classified information were dramatically evident in the case ag ainst Uzair Paracha. Paracha sought the testimony of Majid Khan, Ammar al Baluch i, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who at the time were believed to be in se cret custody of the US government.488 While not conceding that they were in US government custody, the prosecution argued that for the purposes of the motion, if they were in go vernment custody, producing them would damage national security by allo wing \"Al-Qaeda operatives [to] use the US legal system to interfere with the milita ry's prosecution of the war on terrorism.\"489 The judge determined that Mohammed's te stimony was not material, but that both Khan and al Baluchi likely had material and favorable evidence to present. Saying that he was balancing the government's concerns of national security against Paracha's right to present such evidence, Judge Stein ordered that unclassified summaries of statements provided by the two men could be admitted, along with instructions to the jury detailing the circumstances in wh ich the statements were obtained. The jury instruction included that \"[t]he witnesses' statements were obtained under circumstances that were designed to elicit truthful and accurate information from witnesses because the statements are relied upon by United States officials responsible for making national security decisions.\"490 As we now know, the men were held in secret CIA custody for years and subjected to incommunicado detention and torture, calling into question the veracity of their statements.491 The government\u2014and the judge\u2014 willingly vouched for the truthfulness of st atements obtained by people subjected to torture by the same government, highlighting the problems that can ensue when a 488 In September 2006, then-president Bush announced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and 13 other \"high-value\" detainees had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay from over seas detention facilities run by the CIA. Khan and al Baluchi were among them. \"President Bush's Speech on Terrorism,\" New York Times , September 6, 2006, http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/washington/06bus h_transcript.html?pagewa nted=alland_r=0 (accessed June 26, 2014). 489 Opinion at 22, United States v.

Paracha's case is somewhat unusual because it was the defendant, not the government, who had an interest in establis hing the veracity of witness statements that may have been taken under duress. Judg e Stein did not permit the government to use the statements affirmatively, perh aps in acknowledgment of that fact. Because the defense does not have the abilit y to review the classified information, it operates blindly when challenging the adequacy of a summary or substitution. While the system relies on prosecutors an d district court judges to protect the rights of the defendant, the system can fail, either through bad faith or because structurally the absence of the defense means the trial judge will not have the benefit of hearing all sides of an issue (though the defense can present its theory of the case to the judge in order for him or her to take it into consideration when reviewing the classified material). In Pete Seda's case, the Ninth Circuit fo und the government's failure to make an appropriate substitution\u2014and the district judge's acceptance of the inadequate substitution\u2014an additional basis for orde ring a new trial for Seda. The appeals court concluded \"that the substitution's language unfairly colo red presentation of the information and, even more problemati c, that the substitution omitted facts helpful to Seda's defense.\" 492 Although the court did not find bad faith on the part of the prosecutors, it found that \"the government appears to have looked with tunnel vision at limited issues that it believed were relevant.\"493 Anonymous and Biased Juries While the majority of terrorism cases (like most criminal cases) do not go to trial, those that do face challenges obtaining unbiased juries, as well as the use of anonymous jurors\u2014a practice rare in crimin al cases though used in high-profile, organized crime trials. 492 United States v.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 112 Anonymous juries\u2014that is, juries whose na mes and identities are shielded from the public, and sometimes even from the part ies and judge, in order to protect their safety\u2014were used in several of the cases we examined, including the cases of Fort Dix Five, Abdelhaleem Ashqar and Mohammed Salah. If a judge declares the jury \"anonymous,\" usually for security reas ons, defense lawyers may be hampered from examining prospective jurors for bias. Moreover, identifying unbiased jurors, whether anonymous or not, is particularly challenging in terrorism cases, especia lly those involving Muslims. In federal terrorism prosecutions, some judges have elected to use written jury questionnaires, which allow them ask a broad range of questions that may root out more prospective jurors who may have bias towards the defendant. In the case of Hossam Smadi (who pleaded guilty shortly before he was scheduled to go to trial) the judge provided a questionnaire to the approximately 175 members of the jury pool. One of Smadi's defense attorneys, Richard Anderson, described the judge as \"outstanding\" and felt that the questionnaire was appropriately crafted to identify bias. 494 But many judges do not use questio nnaires, which can make it harder to identify biases. Pretrial Solitary Confinement and Ot her Conditions of Confinement The US government frequently imposes solitary confinement on suspects in terrorism cases prior to trial.495 Prolonged pretrial solitary confinement not only raises concerns of cruel and inhumane trea tment or punishment, but it also has an impact on defendants' ability to assist in their own defense, and may compel them to waive their trial rights and accept plea deals.496 494 Human Rights Watch interview with Richar d Anderson, Dallas, Te xas, June 26, 2012.

See European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), \"T he CPT Standards, Substant ive Sections (2002) June 29, 2014), para. 57(a). 113 JULY 2014 We documented the experiences of 24 men who were held in solitary confinement on terrorism charges prior to conviction, often for months or years on end.497 In some of these cases, solitary confin ement was imposed as \"administrative segregation,\" that is, not for a discipli nary infraction but purportedly for the security of the prison or the personal security of the detainee.498 For example, Syed Hashmi was held in solitary confinement for about three years, imposed as administrative segregation an d pursuant to Special Administrative Measures (SAMs)\u2014special restrictions imposed to protect national security or prevent disclosure of classified material (SAMs are discussed in detail in section VI)\u2014for much of that time.499 The UN special rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, who sought information from the US government about Hashmi, said its explanation of the case \"mad e no mention of Mr. Hashmi' s behavior in custody as a reason for any disciplinary sanction\" bu t appeared based on \"the seriousness of the charges he faced.\"500 He concluded that Hashmi's prolonged pretrial solitary confinement constituted a violation of his rights under the Convention against Torture \"absent contrary evidence.\" 501 Barry Bujol was kept in isolat ion in his cell for 19 months prior to his sentencing, in the special housing unit of the federal detention center in downtown Houston. 502 Bujol had only one hour of recreation out of his cell each day, during which he 497 For a list, see charts in Appendix. 498 Solitary confinement in US prisons is imposed for different reasons, but most commonly it is used as punishment for breaches of discipline (\"disciplinary se gregation\") or to manage prisoners considered to be particularly difficult or dangerous (\"administrative segregation\"). Corrections officials prefer to use terms such as \"segregation\" rather than solitary confinement. We consid er the terms interchangeable since both refer to 22 to 24 hours a day in cell confinement. 499 Hashmi was held at MCC 10-South from May 25, 2007 to on or around April 27, 2010 when he pleaded guilty to one count of material support of terrorism\u2014t hat is, for at least three years, ten months, and 20 days.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 114 \"occasionally, but rarely\" had someone else in the recreation room with him.503 Bujol expressed his suffering in a story he drafted prior to hi s sentencing, titled Dungeon in the Sky . He begins the piece: Solitude can be many things. It can be a time for reflection, a healthy and therapeutic exercise that inspires creativity. It can be a sanctuary for spiritual growth and self-discovery.... Unless of course solitude is how you live daily\u2014and you're forced to. Then it becomes much more than that. Th en it becomes what people in here call it\u2014a hole. A hole that swal lows the spirit like a black hole in space swallows all light and matte r. Then it strips the hours of their significance and the days of their meaning[,] turning them instead into a perpetual void of timelessness. It becomes a living tomb constricting movements, thou ghts, and every thing else that makes us human[,] the way a boa cons tricts its prey. At least for the prey death is imminent.504 In at least some cases we reviewed, the go vernment's restrictions appear to have far exceeded what was necessary to addr ess the stated security concerns. For example, in the cases of Adnan Mirza and Tarek Mehanna, who were ultimately convicted of non-violent crimes, each was he ld in pretrial solitary confinement for more than two years. They th en were told they were being held in solitary for their own security. Yet it is hard to justify the severe restrictions on their human contact on those grounds: it took three weeks fo r Mirza to receive mail from his family, even from those who lived in Texas, and he was allowed only a single 15-minute phone call to his family a month. 505 Jay Carney, Mehanna's attorney, noted that, \"You can protect an inmate and still allow him to have contact with other people on a regular basis, and not be put in that cell sometimes 24 hours a day.\"506 503 Human Rights Watch phone interview with Daphne Silverman, Bujol's defense attorney at sentencing, June 6, 2012. 504 Barry W.

He was held in a 10 x 10-foot cell in a state prison alongside prisoners convicted of serious crimes.507 He was permitted one hour of out-of-cell exercise and one shower a week.508 \"He has not been outside nor been near an open window, let alone look out a closed window to the outside prison yard\" for four years, his lawyer wrote in 2007, \"except for the few times he has been transported to court.\"509 District Judge John Tunheim grew so concerned about Warsame's solitary confinement that at times he would hold status conference hearings simply to allow Warsame to leave the prison an d go to court, he told us.510 Warsame ultimately pled guilty to charges of conspi racy to provide material s upport for terrorism. Under the plea deal, he was sentenced to 92 months in prison, including time served, and immediately deported to his home country of Canada. As professors Laura Rovner and Jeanne Theoharis put it, \"forcing Warsame to leave the country seems at odds with the immediate danger repeatedly asse rted by the government of Warsame's unmonitored communication.\"511 Other Ill-Treatment in Pretrial \"Special Housing Unit\" Detention More than half of all individuals being he ld pretrial by the Bureau of Prisons who are charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses\u201430 out of 52\u2014are held in Special Housing Units (SHUs).512 507 Warsame was originally held as a material witness but, after he refused to cooperate with the government, he was indicted on material support charges .

Human Rights Watch has previously document ed similarly abusive conditions of confinement in SHUs for individuals held as \"special interest\" detainees shortly after 9/11 and individuals held un der the material witness statute.514 Among the poor conditions faced by many individuals held in solitary confinement was extreme cold, including for defendants at New York Metropol itan Correctional Center (MCC) \"10-South,\" and other defendan ts in metropolitan detention facilities, such as the Fort Dix Five defendan ts held at Philadelphia FDC. Conditions at MCC 10-South MCC 10-South is a SHU in New York City that includes six individual cells that have repeatedly housed individuals indicted on terrorism or terrorism-related charges, including those under Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) (discussed in section VI). Individuals are held in 23 or 24-hou r solitary confinement. Public access to 10- South is severely limited and many prisoner s there are under SAMs that bar them from speaking with the media or anyone other than their attorneys and family members (who are, in turn, barred from relaying any information). These restrictions limited our ability and the ability of other researchers to document conditions there. However, former detainees have described harsh conditions and harassment: Tarik Shah, a professional jazz bassist and martial arts instructor who was prosecuted after an elaborate sting operation that spanned four years and involved two informants, spent 33 months in solitary confin ement at 10-South. 513 See Bureau of Prisons Program Statement, \"Speci al Housing Units,\" no. 5270.10, July 29, 2011, http://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/527 0_010.pdf (accessed June 26, 2014). 514 Human Rights Watch, Presumption of Guilt: Human Rights Abuses of Post-September,11 Detainees , vol. 14, no. 4(G), August 2002, http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/us 911/USA0802.pdf, pp. Human Rights Watch, Witness to Abuse , pp. 41-44. 117 JULY 2014 In a letter to his sister, he described a \"bright light on for twenty-four hours\" a day.515 He described his cell as \"extremely cold throughout the year\": \" [W]e could not purchase hats, gloves, extra sweats or extra thermals, so I wore an extra pillow case on my head, three pairs of socks on my feet, a pair of socks on my hands for gloves...just to be somewhat insulated.\" 516 Uzair Paracha was held in pretrial soli tary confinement at 10-South for 23 months. \"Some officers...came to the door and looked straight at me through the windows while I was sitting on the toilet,\" he wrote. \"Other times I overheard them talking to me or about me while I was on the toilet, talking about how we would clean ourselves afte rwards.... I felt too embarrassed and humiliated to discuss or complain about it.\"517 Paracha also described guards taking his blankets and clothes in wintertime, and blasting the radio while he and other Muslims prisoners were pray ing, turning it down when they finished. \"They knew we couldn't talk or do other things during our prayer,\" Paracha wrote, and would purposefully deli ver food or ask for food trays back while Paracha was praying.518 Some defendants or thei r families also reported harassment by particular correctional officers at pret rial facilities.

Denied phone calls to his family for seven months, Kassir's only human contact was with his lawyers, consulate officials and prison staff.527 His \"only exercise facility was the provision of a cell identical to his own,\" according to a statement his defense counsel provided to th e European Court of Human Rights.528 Kassir's attorney, Marc DeMarco, told us that Kassir often spent the first hour of their meetings only able to speak about the horrible conditions of confinement.529 Though Kassir was an intelligent person, his focus on his conditions made him seem like a \"rambling lunatic\" during their discussions.530 Kassir's counsel moved to lift the SAMs, arguing that they were restricting legal access, destro ying Kassir's mental well being, and harming his ability to prepare for trial. 531 The motion was denied.532 Case of Yassin Aref: Aref, an imam convicted in October 2006 of providing material support for witnessing a lo an agreement between an informant and mosque congregant, and who had no criminal record or history of violence (see section II), began havi ng trouble communicating after he was in solitary confinement at Raybrook prison, his attorneys told us.533 According to attorney Kathy Manley: \"When he was at Raybrook, he was 526 See European Court of Human Rights, Babar Ahmad and Others v. the U.K. (dec.), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, \u00a7 85, 6 July 2010. 527 See Letter from Susan Lee, Programs Director, Americas Regional Program, Amnesty International, to Eric Holder, Attorney General, US Department of Justice, \"RE: Special Housing Unit in the Metropolitan Correctional Centre,\" February 16, 2011, http:/ /www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AM R51/028/2011/en/c175ece2-d33a-4db9- a577-039ed17c5fb4/amr51 0292011en.pdf (accessed June 28, 2014). 528 See ECHR, Babar Ahmad and Others v. the U.K. (dec.), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, \u00a7 85, 6 July 2010. 529 For a description of his conditions, see section IV. 530 Human Rights Watch phone interview with Marc DeMarco, May 17, 2012. 531 United States v.

The SAMs initially barred him from talking to any other inmates, an d he was only permitted to speak to prison guards. \"You could spend days to weeks without uttering anything significant beyond 'please cut my lights,' 'can I get a legal call/toilet paper/ a razor,' etc., or just thanking them for shutting our lights,\" Paracha wrote in an email to Human Rights Watch. Paracha developed claustrophobia and would eventually be diagnosed with depression that required medication: \"Many times during the day I saw myse lf doing things th at I saw people with psychological problems do. The way I sounded (my voice), my gestures,\" he stated. 543 Paracha's SAMs were purportedly based on the government's belief in Paracha's dangerousness and connections with Al-Qaeda, yet that rationale evidently did not extend far: the government offered Paracha a plea bargain of only 22 months' imprisonment, which he refused. 544 \"I faced the harshest part of the SAMs while I was innocent in the eyes of American law,\" Paracha wr ote. After Paracha was convicted in December 2006, the SAMs were modifi ed, permitting him to communicate with other inmates. \"The fact that th ey became more lenient about a month after my conviction was counterintuitive and made the SAMs look more like a pressure tactic and less like an y security measures,\" Paracha wrote. 545 541 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute interview with Fatima Sarwar, Chicago, Illinois, October 8, 2012. 542 Ibid. 543 Letter from Uzair Paracha to Human Rights Watch, December 26, 2012. 544 While Paracha has sought SA Ms memos concerning this period of co nfinement through Freedom of Information Act requests, he has not received them.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 122 V. Disproportionate Sentences Sentences in terrorism and terrorism-related cases vary considerably. In the 494 terrorism and terrorism-relate d prosecutions we reviewed based on Department of Justice data, defendants who went to trial re ceived a median sentence of 11.3 years, while those who took plea agreements re ceived a median sentence of 3.2 years. More than one-third of those who took a plea deal received either no prison sentence or a sentence of time served. 546 However, 91 defendants rece ived sentences of 15 years or more, including 19 life sentences (which, in the federal system, means life without the possibility of parole). 547 Over one in ten of defendants who we re convicted by trial received a life sentence.548 In many of the cases we documented, these lengthy sentences appeared disproportionate to the underlying offense. Lengthy sentences violate international huma n rights law and US constitutional law when they are grossly disproportiona te to the offense committed and the individual's culpability. 549 Both US and international human rights jurisprudence on sentencing emphasize the importance of a judicial determination based upon individualized consider ation of the defendant. 550 546 See sections Methodology and Appendix. 547Ibid. 548 Ibid. 549 Under international human rights law, the \"essential aim\" of a penitentiary system should be the \"reformation and social rehabilitation\" of prisoners, and sentencing that is solely retributory is disfavored. See ICCPR, art.10(3) (\"The penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation.\"); UN Human Rights Committee, General Co mment 21, Replaces general comment 9 concerning human treatment of persons deprived of liberty (Art. 10) (Annex VI, B) (Forty-fourth Session, 1992), Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Adopted by Human Rights Treaty Bodies, UN Doc.

The \"Terrorism Adjustment\" Federal judges making sentencing determinatio ns for any federal crime are to take into account as a starting point the guidelines issued by the US Sentencing Commission. Because the guidelines are advisory, judges may depart from the sentencing ranges they establish to lengthen or reduce sentences. 553 By statute they must consider a range of factors in sentencing, includin g the individual characteristics of the defendant and the purposes of sentencing as applied to a particular case.554 The sentencing guidelines establish sentencing ranges based on a matrix, which cross-references 43 \"offense levels\" with six \"criminal history\" categories. 555 For example, the offense level for homicide is the highest, 43, while involuntary manslaughter starts at level 12. 556 The guidelines also contain \"adjustments\" based on qualities of the offense, the of fender, or the victim. These adjustments 551 See, e.g., Human Rights Watch, An Offer You Can't Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug Defendants to Plead Guilty (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2013), http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/12/05/offer-you-can-t- refuse; Human Rights Watch, Old Behind Bars: The Aging Prison Population in the United States (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2012), http://www.hrw.org/reports/201 2/01/27/old-behind-bars-0; and Human Rights Watch, Cruel and Usual: Disproportionate Sentences for New York Drug Offenders , Cruel and Unusual: Disproportionate Sentences for New York Drug Offenders , vol. 9, no. 2(B), March 1997, http://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/usny/. 552 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. 553 Congress created the US Sentencing Commission (USSC) in 1984 and authorized it to promulgate mandatory guidelines, with the aim of reducing \"unwarranted sentencing disparities.\" Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 124 have the effect of raising, and in some cases lowering, the offense level or criminal history category level. 557 Among all of the adjustments in the fede ral sentencing guidelines system, the terrorism adjustment has the most drastic effect of lengthening sentences, and it stands out for applying acro ss a wide range of conduct.558 (The history of the adjustment is briefly explained below.) Th e adjustment raises the offense level by 12, and if the resulting offense level is less than 32, it creates a minimum offense level of 32\u2014regardless of the character of the actual crime. It also automatically raises a defendant's criminal history level to category 6, the highest category, regardless of the defendan t's actual criminal history. 559 As one judge in a terrorism case put it, the effect is to \"impute to a defendant who has had no criminal history a fictional history of the hi ghest level of seriousness.\"560 The government has successfully sought the terrorism adjustment for 259 individuals since 2002, the first year statistics are available. In 2012, the adjustment applied to 46 defendants, while in previous years, it applied to an 557 In addition, mandatory minimum sentences require judges to impose specified mini mum prison terms.

On its own, an increase of 12 offense levels can add as much as 20 years to a sentence, while a jump to the highest criminal history categorization can also add several year s to a sentence. Taken together, the two aspects of the terrorism ad justment have the potentia l to add 30 years to a sentence or lead to life imprisonment for a crime that, without the adjustment, might otherwise entail only a sentence of five years. 562 In addition, mandatory minimum sentence s require judges to impose specified minimum prison terms. Created by vari ous federal statutes, mandatory minimum sentences are typically triggered by as pects of criminal offense conduct or a defendant's criminal history, an d result in longer sentences.563 As Human Rights Watch has reported in the past, mandatory minimums are one of the most significant obstacles to fair senten cing in the criminal justice system. 564 Lengthy Sentences Based on Unproven Conduct Under the federal sentencing system, sentences are not limited to the conduct for which an individual was charged or convicted but rather are based on a court's determination of a defendant's \"actual conduct.\" 565 As a result, an individual's 561 This average is based on the years 2007 to 2011, incl uding 2008 when it was applied only 11 times.

(Mandatory minimum cases are a recent exception.)566 Although this sentencing scheme has been upheld by the Supreme Court,567 it raises due process concerns particularly in the context of the terr orism adjustment, where the potential for government abuse\u2014making inflammatory suggestions of a terrorism connection, invoking secrecy to explain evidentiary ga ps\u2014is too high, and th e cost of a vastly lengthened sentence is too great. For example, Abdelhaleem Ashqar was senten ced to about 11 years (135 months) for obstruction of justice and criminal contempt , after he refused to testify before a grand jury (see section IV). These offenses usually carry sentences of five years or less, but after the trial and during the se ntencing stage the prosecution asserted Ashqar had \"engaged in nume rous violations of federal law\"\u2014offenses that it had not charged or convicted h im on\u2014\"all in the service of a terrorist organization.\" 568 It asserted that Ashqar's refusal to testify before a grand jury was likewise \"in the service\" of a terrorist organization, althou gh this question was never put to a jury. 569 To punish defendants for conduct that was not alleged or proven at trial deprives them of the opportunity to fully develop th e facts and evidence necessary to refute accusations of terrorist connection or affi liation. Moreover, it creates perverse incentives for the government, which can ch arge lesser conduct that is easier to establish at trial, and then invoke infla mmatory allegations of terrorist connection at the sentencing stage. 570 566 However, in 2013, the Supreme Court held that in mandatory minimum cases, any fact that increases a mandatory minimum is an \"element\" of the crime that must be submitted to the jury. See Alleyne v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 2151 (2013). 567 In Booker v. US, the Supreme Court held that mandatory sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional where they imposed punishment for conduct without proof to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the Court's remedy was not to bar the use of non-proven conduct; rather, it was to make the guidelines advisory. See Booker v. United States, 543 U.S. 220, 243-44 (2005). See also, United States v. Battle, 499 F.3d 315, 322-23 (4th Cir. 2007) (\"When applying the Guidelines in an advisory manner, the district court can make factual findings using the preponderance of the evidence standard.\"). 568 Government's Memorandum In Response to Defendant As hqar's Objection to PSR and Sentencing Position Memorandum at 22, United States v.

Accordingly, the terrorism adjustment may apply as much to viol ent offenses\u2014such as using weapons of mass destruction and missile systems design ed to destroy aircraft\u2014as it does to non-violent offenses such as engaging in financial transactions with a country supporting international terrorism. Indeed, between 2 006 and 2011, 46 of the terrorism adjustments applie d were for material support to a foreign terrorist organization, according to information pu blicly available on the US Sentencing Commission website. favorable to defendants); James P.

Prior to 1994, the Sentencing Guidelines did not include an enhancement for conduct relating to terrorism offenses. Instead, the Guidelines included a policy statement that provided: \"If the defendant committed the offense in furtherance of a terroristic action, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range.\" See USSC, \"1994 Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual,\" November 1, http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines- manual/1994-federal-sentencing- guidelines-manual (accessed June 26, 2014), \u00a7 5K2.15. 572 See USSC, \"Appendix C (Volume I) - the Guidelines Manual,\" http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guideli nes-manual/2011/manual-pdf /Appendix_C_Vol_I.pdf, amendment 539; Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. p. 104-132, sec. 730 (\" The United States Sentencing Commission shall forthwith, in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 21(a) of the Sentencing Act of 1987, as though the authority under that section had not expired, amend the sentencing guidelines so that the chapter 3 adjustment relating to international terrorism only applies to Federal crimes of terrorism, as defined in section 2332b(g) of title 18, United States Code.\"); 18 U.S.C.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 128 In the Holy Land Foundation case, Shukri Abu Baker was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support an d providing material support (see sections III and V)\u2014 charges that each carry a statutory maximu m of 15 years. Yet Baker was sentenced to 65 years in prison based on a terrorism adjustment.573 The government did not allege that the Holy Land Foundation or Ba ker was involved in violent activity of any kind, or that Baker or the organization ev er provided money dire ctly to a terrorist organization. Instead, the alle gations were that by contri buting to charitable work in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, the Holy Land Foundation helped Hamas gain supporters among the civilian popu lation. Though Baker had no criminal history whatsoever, his sentence was based on a criminal history level equal to that of someone who had been convicted of second-degree murder.574 After Sabri Benkahla was acquitted of ch arges that he had attended a terrorist training camp and fired weapons there, he was questioned by the FBI and subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury on the same matter. The government then launched a second prosecution, char ging that Benkahla had lied to the FBI and a grand jury by denying his personal involvement and knowledge of acquaintances' involvement in training ca mps. After a second trial, Benkahla was convicted of obstructing justice on account of false declarations to a grand jury and of making false statements to the FBI. Th ough the judge reasoned that Benkahla's false declarations \"neither directly 'inv olved' nor were 'intended to promote' a federal crime of terrorism,\" he applied the terrorism adjustment, reasoning that the false declarations had actually obstructed the FBI's investigation of a terrorism crime. 575 Without the adjustment, Benkahla faced a sentence of two and three- quarters to three and a half years (33 to 41 months). With it, he faced a sentence of about 17 to 22 years (210 to 262 mo nths)\u2014the same or worse sentence as 573 United States v. Abu Baker, No. 3:04-CR-0240-P-2 (N.D. Tex. May 29, 2009). 574 The base offense level for second- degree murder is 38. The base offense level for providing material support to a fo reign terrorist organization is 26 and with the terrorism enhancement, becomes 38. Instead of starting in a potential range of 63 to 78 months, the terrorism enhancement automatically placed him within a base range (not taking in to account another form of upward departure) of 235 to 293 months. Ibid., p. 394 (Sentencing Table). 575 The judge speculated that Benkahla \"may have been motiva ted out of a desire not to be seen as involved with illegal activities\" or \"have been concerned ab out potential hardship he might cause others.\" United States v. Benkahla, 501 F.Supp.2d 748, (E.D. Va. 2007), aff'd , 500 F.3d 300 (4th Cir. 2008). 129 JULY 2014 defendants who committed \"more severe, viol ent offenses,\" like the kind of which Benkahla was acquitted in his first trial.576 Judges have the discretion to \"depar t downward\" from sentences that the Guidelines recommend, but even where they exercise their discretion, the terrorism adjustment drives up the length of senten ces significantly. In Benkahla's case, the judge concluded the li kelihood he would commit anot her crime was \"infinitesimal,\" and he sentenced Benkahla to 10 years. Ye t this was still almost seven years more than Benkahla would have faced without the terrorism adjustment.577 Lengthy Sentences in Informant Cases In some of the cases we reviewed involving informants, defendants received particularly harsh sentences based on elements of the crimes that informants suggested. The Newburgh Four case (see section II) is perhaps the most egregious example. The informant in the case introduced the idea of attacking Stewart Air Force Base with a Stinger missile and pr ovided the fake missile to the defendants. As District Judge Colleen McMahon explained: There is no way that these four defendants would have dreamed up the idea of shooting a Stinger missile at an airplane or anything else; there is certainly no way they coul d have acquired a Stinger missile, operative or inert, unless the government provided them one. 578 Without the Stinger missile, the govern ment could still have sought life imprisonment for the defendants based on other aspects of the case; however, the men would have been eligible for a judge's discretionary reduction in sentence length. The Stinger missile element enabled the government to use a mandatory minimum sentence to ensure that if convicted, the defendants would receive at 576 Ibid. 577 Ibid. 578 Decision on Sentencing Entrapment/Manipulation, Unit ed States v. Cromitie, No. 7:09-cr-0558-CM-1 (S.D.N.Y July 8, 2011), aff'd , 727 F.3d 194 (2d Cir. 2013). ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 130 least 25 years.579 The judge concluded that she had no discretion to sentence the defendants to anything less, though she expressed concern that \"the only reason the Government introduced the missile elem ent into this case was to prohibit me from sentencing the defendants to less time than that.\"580 The terrorism adjustment can result in individuals charged with conspiracy and attempts receiving the same sentence s imposed for actual commission of murder.581 This outcome is of particular concern especially where the defendants did not propose the conduct that served as the basis for the te rrorism adjustment, as in the case of the three Duka brothers, who were sentenced to life imprisonment in the Fort Dix Five case (see section II ), based on a fake plot negotiated in conversations held in Arabic between one of the informants and the co-defendant Mohammed Shnewer; the Duka brothers, who spoke English and Albanian alone and did not understand Arabic, were not included in any discussions about a plot. 582 The Dukas were convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit murder and three counts of illegal possession of fire arms. Conspiracy to murder, without the terrorism adjustment, carrie s a sentence ranging between 12 \u00be years to 24 \u00bd years (135 months to 293 months), depend ing on the defendant's criminal history, but with the terrorism adjustment the gu idelines recommend the same sentence that first-degree (premeditated) murder carries: life imprisonment.583 The Duka brothers were in their 20s at the time of their sentence; without the adjustment, they would have been middle-aged men at th e time of their release, while with it they will spend perhaps as much as 60 years in prison, and die there. 579 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332g(c)(1). 580 Ibid. 581 Since 2006, courts have applied the terrorism adjustme nt to 28 attempt or conspiracy to murder cases, compared to just eight cases of first-degree murder, compared according to statistics we calculated based on information publicly available on the US Sentencing Commission website. See USSC Research and Federal Sentencing Statistics, http://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/index.cfm (accessed June 28, 2014). 582 The Arabic-speaking informant, Mahmoud Omar, testified at trial that two of the brothers \"have nothing to do with the matter,\" that is, that they had no knowledge of any plot.

Due to the terrorism adjustment, the Duka brothers' criminal history category levels were raised to the highest criminal history category level and the offense level was raised 12 leve ls, to the highest level of 43, the same base offense level as first degree murder.

Imprisonment and Treatment US prisons held 475 people indicted on or convicted of terr orism or terrorism- related offenses as of October 2013, acco rding to the government response to our FOIA request.584 Some are held in prisons under harsh conditions that include prolonged solitary confinem ent and severe restrictions on their communication with family and others. Some restrictions are imposed pursuant to Special Administrative Measures (SAMs), which apply to certain prisoners\u2014not only terrorism detainees\u2014on the grounds that they are necessary to protect national security or prevent disclosure of classified material (as previously noted, these condit ions may also be imposed pretrial, raising concerns over fair trial rights). Other prisoners were placed in Communication Management Units (CMUs), which monitor prison ers 24 hours a day. We reviewed the treatment and conditions of 35 defendants and prisoners in terrorism cases, 9 of whom were not involved in the ma in cases we focused on for this report (for a list, see Appendix - B). While the Bureau of Prisons denied 16 out of 20 requests we made to meet with pris oners, we were able to communicate with 12 incarcerated men by phone, letters, or email. In several of these cases, the Bureau of Prisons did not inform the detainee of the basis for imposing the restrictions\u2014whether it was based on an assessment of the severity of the crime, the security of the facility or of the detainee, or for other reasons. Accordingly, it was impossibl e to independently assess whether the restrictions were disproportionate to the government's objective. In many cases, this secrecy also stymied prisoners' ability to learn about the basis for their treatment, or what steps they could take to end their solitary confinement or restrictions on their communications with family. 584 Bureau of Prisons documents obtained from Freedom of Information Act requests made by Human Rights Watch on August 24, 2012 (on file with Human Rights Watch). ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 132 Background: Tightening of Restrictions in Response to \"Prisoner Radicalization\" In the years after the September 11, 2 001 attacks, media and congressional concern over supposed \"prisoner radica lization\"\u2014the idea that prisons are a \"fertile ground\" for inmate co nversion to politicized and violent ideology related to Islam585\u2014led the Bureau of Prisons to impose significantly harsher restrictions on terrorism detainees and prisoners.586 In 2006, seeking to monitor \"100 percent\" of all terrorism inmate communications,587 the Bureau of Prisons began adopting policies and practices to restrict the \"volume, frequency, and methods\" of terrorism inmate communications,588 and it began to 585 Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller repeatedly described prisons as \"fertile ground for extremists\" in 2005 and 2006. See Robert S. Mueller III, Direct or, Federal Bureau of Investigation, statement before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC, September 19, 2012, transcript at http://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/homeland-threats-and-agency-responses (accessed July 11,2014), p. 24; Robert S Mueller III, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, speech at the City Club of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio, June 23, 2006, transcript at http://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-of-homegrown-terrorism (accessed June 27, 2014). Beginning in 2003, scholarship and government reports suggested Al-Qaeda was seeking to recruit American converts to plan terrorist attacks from prison. See, e.g., John S.

A growing literature now characterizes prisoner radicalization in hyperbolic terms\u2014as \"a threat of unknown magnitude\" and \"a problem unlike any other faced by correctional administrators today, or at any other time in history\" \u2014which the government has repeated or alluded to in defending its detention policies.

In both cases, Human Rights Watch documented harsh restrictions and conditions of confinement, all for individuals who were not charged with any crime.

Isolation for 22 hours per day or more, and for one or more days, fits the generally accepted definition of solitary confinement. 593 When it is prolonged, solitary confinement 589 See generally, US Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Evaluation and Inspections Division, \"The Federal Bureau of Prisons' Monitoring of Mail for High Risk Inmates,\" September 2006, http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/BOP/e0609/final.pdf (accessed June 27, 2014). 590 Ibid., p. 50. 591 In 2013, the Bureau of Prisons confirmed that it plans to convert Thomson Correctional Institution in Thomson, Illinois\u2014a former state facility purchased by the federa l government\u2014at least in part into a new administrative maximum. See James Ridgeway and Jean Casell a, \"Welcome to the New Federal Supermax,\" Mother Jones , February 11, 2013, http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/thompson-federal-supermax-solitary-illinois- dick-durbin (accessed June 27, 2014). 592 Solitary confinement in general has a long history, a nd Human Rights Watch has do ne extensive research on the isolated\u2014and solitary\u2014confinement of adults and juveniles. See, for example: Human Rights Watch, Growing Up Locked Down: Youth in Solitary Confinement in Jails and Prisons Across the United States (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2012), http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us1012ForUpload.pdf; Written Statement from Human Rights Watch to the Senate Committee on th e Judiciary, Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights, \"U S: Look Critically at Widespread Use of Solitary Confinement,\" June 18, 2012, http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/18/us-look-critically-widespread-use-solitary-confinement. 593 Jail and prison officials do not generally use the term \"solitary confinement\" to refer to the range of segregation and isolation practices they employ to manage inmates. They are correct in noting that conditions are not exactly like those used in the earliest facilities to employ the practice. But because the conditions and effects of various segregation practices are substantially the same, Human Rights Watch uses a single definition based on the degree of deprivation. At the sa me time, this report's focus on solitary confinement should not be read to endorse segregation and isolation practices that do not fit this definition. Any use of physical and social isolation, including those of shorte r duration, can raise serious human rights concerns. The same is true for the practice of holding two inmates in conditions that would otherwise constitute solitary confinement (Human Rights Watch and mental health professionals have ra ised serious concerns about this practice). UN Generaly Assembly, Interim report of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 134 can constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment prohibited by human rights treaties to which the US is party.594 For 23 men whose experiences we documented, the length of pretrial or post-conviction solitary confinement was measured in months or years, not weeks. 595 The mental pain and suffering caused by isolation was sometimes exacerbated by uncertainty about how long solitary would last.596 Prisoners with whom we spoke or correspo nded described their solitary confinement as resulting from decisions to put them in administrative segregation based on their security classification. Prisoners in me dium-security and lo w-security prisons experienced solitary as punishment (often called disciplinary segregation).597 Special Units for \"Terrorism \" Prisoners: ADX and CMUs The Bureau of Prisons says it places the \"most dangerous terrorists\" at the Administrative Maximum Penitentiary (ADX) in Florence, Colorado, while other so- called \"terrorist\" inmates have been tr ansferred to Communication Management torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. M\u00e9ndez, A/66/268, August 5, 2011, http://solitaryconfinement.org/uploads/SpecR apTortureAug2011.pdf (accessed June 28, 2014). 594 The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has defined solitary confined to be prolonged when it exceeds 15 days. He reported that he is \"aware of the arbitrary nature of the effort to establish a moment in time which an already harmful regime becomes prolonged and therefore unacceptably painful ... [and] concludes th at 15 days is the limit between solitary confinement and prolonged solitary co nfinement because at that point, according to the literature surveyed, some of the harmful psychological eff ects of isolation can become irreversible\" (citing Ken LLRX.com , August 10, 2010). Ibid., para. 26. 595 We documented the cases of eight individuals who sp ent at least a year in post-conviction solitary confinement, all at ADX Florence. Some of them were eventually transferred to medium or low-security facilities. See Appendix - B. We were unable to document conditions of some prisoners who are held in solitary confinement and whose cases we otherwise reviewed, in part because the Bureau of Prisons denied our visit requests. We also reviewed the cases of prisoners who experienced solitary for shorter periods, sometimes in \"holdover status\" in transit to a prison or for disciplinary reasons, but we do not include them in this analysis. 596 Studies have found that numerous adults who have no history of mental health problems develop psychological symptoms in solitary confinement. While many of those studies are open to questions about the mental health status of individuals before entering solitary confinement, there is agreement that solitary confinement can cause or exacerbate mental health problems. For a discussion, see Human Rights Watch, Growing Up Locked Down , p. 23. Many defendants we spoke to or corresponded with reported little direct emotional suffering, saying that their religious faith and practice sustained them, though some described the mental suffering of other inmates. Some scholars believe that prisoners tend to underreport or play down their mental health problems, perhaps out of belief that such confinement is an overt atte mpt by prison authorities to \"break them down\" psychologically.

Here, we describe conditions typical for prisoners in the General Population and Special Security Units, where many individuals convicted of terrorism or terrorism-related offenses are held. 603 No defense lawyers or inmates we spoke to complained of harassment by correctional staff at ADX, in contrast to reports we heard about other prisons in which inmates convicted of terrorism or terrorism-related offenses are held. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 136 prisoner remains confined this way for 22 or 23 hours a day, but is given an hour of indoor recreation, alone in a room completely bare but for a pull-up bar; or an hour of outdoor recreation, in a cement enclosure so small that he is only able to take a few steps in each direction. 604 Every time he leaves his cell for recreation, he is strip-searched.605 For most prisoners at ADX Florence, communication with other inmates is never directly face-to-face and is always mediated by bars or concrete walls\u2014or involves shouting through toilets and vents.606 Dritan Duka, who is held in soli tary confinement at ADX Florence,607 described even recreation time as dehumanizing: You can only see the sky. It's all st eel. You feel like an animal in a cage. When it's time to eat, they feed you... Actually [dogs] have more freedom than we do. ... We're in a cage all day, they shove foods in the cell. Then we got a little walk. Then they put us in another cell. I'd rather be in a zoo than over here. People walking by, looking at you like an animal in a caged exhibition. 608 Dritan said he is able to communicate wi th other prisoners on his \"range\" (prison floor and section) by screaming through doors and, during outdoor recreation, 604 See Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Motion for Su mmary Judgment, Ayyad v.

A 20 12 European Court of Human Rights ruling upheld the extradition of prisoners to the United States despite the risk of their placement at ADX, finding the isolation suffered by ADX prisoners was \"partial and relative,\" because they could communicate with each other through \"the ventilation system\" and during recreation periods.

It's like staying alone in a bathroom for three days.\"610 Human Rights Watch has previously repo rted on conditions at ADX Florence, which houses not only terrorism detainees but also leaders of violent gangs and prisoners with a history of committing violent offenses against other prisoners or corrections officers. We noted in 2001 th at inmates there could be subjected to \"years of confinement in conditions of extreme social isolation, reduced sensory stimulation, and rigorous security control.\"611 After a 2007 visit to ADX Florence, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Bureau of Prisons to express concern about serious problems, including the mental he alth impact of long-term isolation and highly limited exercise there, and repo rts of force feeding inmates on hunger strikes.612 While we have not, for this report, conducted a thorough examination of conditions at ADX Florence, the cases we examined continue to raise human rights concerns because of the degree of isolation for prisoners and the inadequate process for securing transfer out of the prison into a less restrictive facility. 609 Another prisoner, who was held at ADX for several ye ars, described screaming through sink drain pipes and wrote that in some units that have two sets of doors, prisoners would \"shout or scream on tops of their lungs...trying to get their voices across the second solid door.\" Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute email correspondence with Shah Wali Khan Amin (self-iden tified as Osama Haidar Turkistani), July 22, 2013. 610 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute and Human Rights Watch interview with Dritan Duka, July 19, 2012. 611 Letter from Kenneth Roth, Executive Director, Human Rights Watch, to Jo hn Ashcroft, US Attorney General, March 21, 2001, http://www.hrw.org/news/2001/03/20/us-attorney-general-ashcroft-urged-act-human-rights- agenda.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 138 Communication Management Units Another 77 post-conviction prisoners design ated as \"international terrorists\" or in two Comm unication Management Units (CMUs). 613 The Bureau of Prisons describes the CMUs as units for prisoners who do \"not need the security requirements at [ADX] Flor ence\" but nevertheless require \"closer monitoring.\"614 Of the first 54 prisoners transfer red to the CMUs, 39 were Muslim .615 Civil liberties groups and activists allege that the Bureau of Prisons subsequently transferred environmental and political activists convicted of terrorist offenses to the CMUs in response to media criticism that it was targeting Muslims. 616 \"Other than ADX, the CMUs ar e the most restrictive faciliti es in the fede ral system,\" a federal appeals court judge wrote in 2010. 617 The CMUs are similar to medium-security units in terms of permitting inmates to interact extensively with each other outside of their cells. However, inmates are constantly surveilled and their communication with the outside world is heavily restricted (inc luding with their families, as described below). There are cameras and listening devices positioned throughout the CMUs, and all inmate conversations are audio-re corded and monitored by the government (except for inmate conversati ons with their attorneys). 618 613 Bureau of Prisons documents obtained from Freedom of Information Act requests made by Human Rights Watch on August 24, 2012 (on file with Human Rights Watch).

In the recreation area , \"the ceiling was a chain-link fence and dome of razor wire. So there was open sky but there was razor wire and dead birds between you.\"622 Several prisoners and their families reported problems accessing medical treatment at the CMU, particular ly on weekends and holidays. 623 The CMU functions like \"a bu bble,\" as one defense lawyer explained: prisoners could move freely within the unit, but any movement outside of it was highly constrained, leading to delays in medical attention. 624 Inmates also have few opportunities for work and education in comparison to other federal inmates in medium- or low-security prisons.625 619 Terre Haute CMU is a former federal death row unit and Marion CMU was the Secure Housing Unit of a US penitentiary that closed in 2005. 620 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute interv iew with Avon Twitty, Washington, DC, September 20, 2013 (quoted); Letter from Eljvir Duka to Columbia Law Sc hool's Human Rights Institute and Human Rights Watch, November 6, 2012.

Jan. 11, 2013). In January 2013, a federal district court found that the ban violated federal law by imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise. The court found that the ban viol ated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1, by imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise by inmate John Walker Lindh, and because the government failed to establish either a co mpelling government interest or that the ban was the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.

He descri bed the email as mainly ab out \"my own story of what happened to me at the time of my arrest before my trial and the extreme hardship my family and I suffered thru it.\" 141 JULY 2014 Marion CMU, said he has continuously been denied receipt of materials his attorney sent him: audio recordings of conversations the informants in his case taped for the FBI, which were provided th rough the discovery process of his trial.629 Though they are vital to his ability to pr epare for his habeas corpus petition, the CMU returned the material to his a ttorney without allowing him access.630 Special Administrative Measures In about three dozen terrorism cases,631 the government has used Special Administrative Measures (SAMs): restrictions imposed to protect national security or prevent disclosure of classified materi al. SAMs ordinarily prohibit defendants, attorneys and their families from communic ating about the SAMs to each other\u2014or anyone else. This \"gag order\" of sorts limited our ability to document the impact of SAMs, because family members and defense lawyers were concerned that by speaking with us or providing certain details, they might inadvertently violate SAMs. Bars on communicating with journalists, which ar e often imposed through SAMs, have also resulted in an information void about the government's practices. 632 We nevertheless documented, in limited form, the experiences of six prisoners currently or formerly under SAMs. We also reviewed, in redacted form, the SAMs modification and extension orders for between 20 and 22 prisoners, which the Department of Justice provided in response to our FOIA.633 Email from Mufid Abdulqader to his attorney, May 10, 20 12 (on file with Human Righ ts Watch).

In response to our Freedom of Infromation Act request, the Bureau of Prisons identified 9 prisons where inmates under SAMs are currently held: ADX Florence, FCC Butner, Haute, Lee, FM C Devens, and FMC Carswell. 632 SAMs generally preclude prisoners from contacting the press, communicating with the press through their attorneys, or responding to report ers' inquiries.

None of the SAMs cases we reviewed involved the use of informants, wher e there was limited or no actual communication between the defendant and the alleged terrorist organizations. Severe Restrictions Imposed Through SAMs SAMs often require the imposition of extrem e physical and social isolation. In the orders we obtained through a FOIA regard ing 20 to 22 prisoners, SAMs banned at least 20 prisoners from \"making statements audible to other prisoners or sending notes\" and required them to be housed in single cells \"separated as much as possible in cellblock area from other inmates.\"642 As we described, Oussama Kassir spent one and a half years in pretrial isolation because under SAMs he was barred from ta lking with other inmates or correctional staff. 643 He was permitted \"virtu ally no recreation or exercise, and [was] never allowed to be outside or en joy natural light or air.\"644 He was also barred from purchasing food at the prison commissary to supplement his limited meals, a 641 See US Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Evaluation and Inspections Division, \"The Federal Bureau of Prisons' Monitoring of Mail for High Risk Inmates,\" report no.

All SAMs prisoners at ADX are housed in th e Special Security Unit, also known as \"H Unit.\"652 Prisoners there are held in 22- to 24-hour solitary confinement, receiving a minimum of five hours of out- of-cell recreation a week (half that of ADX General Population inmates).653 They live in cells that measure 75.5 square feet, so small that prisoners reportedly eat their meals within an arm's length from their toilet.654 During recreation, inmates pace alone in an outdoor cage, or an in door room slightly bigger than their cell, and are barred from speaking with other inmates. Compounding the isolation of solitary confinement are the SAMs bars on communication with the outside world, through letters and ph one calls. \"For the most part conditions are like those in ot her solitary units,\" Uzair Paracha, who was of Human Rights and Juan Mendez, Special Rapporteur on to rture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, February 23, 2012.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 150 Prisoners described the ban on contact visits as exacerbating the pain of solitary confinement or other restrictive conditio ns.

You want to hug and kiss them. You got to be patient. Otherwis e you'll break down like other people. ... If you're not strong this place will destroy you.675 In a phone interview, Aref told us: \"My daughter was five years old and I have never hugged or kissed her.

The CMU has some good compassionate men who tried to help me but their hands were tied up because it was the Counter Terrorism Unit in the [Bureau of Prisons] that managed my communications....all I wanted was to be able to hear the voices of my loved ones and be heard. 679 675 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute and Huma n Rights Watch interview with Dritan Duka, July 19, 2012; Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute em ail correspondence with Shain Duka, June 14, 2013. 676 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute phone in terview with Yassin Aref, Fe bruary 23, 2012.

This is in contrast to most prisoners' placements, as the Bureau of Prisons' general policy is to place prisoners within a 500-mile radius of their release residence. 681 The government's stated purpose for imposi ng these family contact restrictions is to ensure complete audio monitoring of inmate communications and detect terrorist or criminal activity. 682 Yet in practice the outcomes raised human rights concerns by escalating the degree of soci al isolation beyond what is necessary. Nor are these restrictions necessary to address concerns about prisoner radicalization expressed by Congre ss or the Department of Justice. 683 Even assuming that complete monitoring of inmate communications is a necessary and legitimate goal, the Bureau of Prisons coul d meet it by designing contact visitation rooms that permit audio monitoring, and increasing the resources it devotes to monitoring to permit more frequent and long er inmate phone calls. 680 Letter from Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee to Federa l Bureau of Prisons, c/o Director Harley Lappin, November 22, 2010 (on file with Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute). 681 \"If an inmate is placed at an institution that is more than 500 miles from his/her release residence, generally, it is due to specific security prog ramming, or population concerns.\" \"Cus tody and Care: Designations,\" Bureau of Prisons, accessed July 2, 2014, http://www.bop.gov/inmates/custody_and_care/designations.jsp. 682 See Declaration of Leslie Smith, Chief of the Counte r Terrorism Unit, Lindh v.

However, communication limitations for SAMs prisoners are due to the Department of Justice, not the Bureau of Prisons, as we describe below. Moreover, for inmates held at pretrial facilities and at Bureau of Prisons prisons, we were not able to find bureau-level policies on contact and phon e privileges, and many decisions may be made at the warden-level. Some denial of contact and phone visits o ccurs when inmates are placed in special housing units. 683 See US Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Evaluation and Inspections Division, \"The Federal Bureau of Prisons' Monitoring of Mail for High Risk Inmates,\" report no. I-2006-009 (September 2006), http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/BOP/e06 09/final.pdf (accessed July 2, 2014). ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 152 Obstacles to Challenging Prisoner Classification and Seeking Transfer to Less Restrictive Facilities Individuals whose cases we reviewed freq uently voiced a sense of helplessness and bewilderment at their indefinite so cial isolation, restrictions on their communication with family, and other cond itions. We spoke to many prisoners who had searched the labyrinth of prison admin istration for answers about the decision to impose certain restrictions on them an d their recourse. They were repeatedly blocked by prison officials at multiple levels. Challenging \"Terrorism\" Designations Designation as an \"international terrorist\" and \"domestic terror ist\" can result in prisoners' placement in special units, solitary confinement, and deprivation of contact visits, communication, and other privileges. Yet the Bureau of Prisons' own policies and statements about terrorism designations are opaque and at times conflicting. 684 A search of Bureau of Prisons manuals and directives yielded little information about terrorism desi gnations\u2014leaving prisoners and their families with minimal access to an expl anation of how to challenge designation decisions and treatment.685 684 For example, while in 2008 the director of the Bureau of Prisons told Congress that it had about 1200 \"terrorist\" inmates in custody, in November 2013, it told us there were only 475 such inmates in pre-conviction and post- conviction custody. In 2008, then-Bureau of Prisons director Harley Lappin told Congress there were \"211 international terrorists\" and a little more than 1,200 total \"[i]f you throw in the domestic terrorists.\" Asked where these \"terrorists\" were from, Lappin said, \"[y]ou know, primarily the Middle East.\" He later provided a breakdown indicating these \"international terrorists\" were citizens of 37 countries, including the United States, as well as countries as varied as Belize, Haiti and Japan. The designation as \"international\" rather than \"domestic\" terrorist does not appearto be related to an inmate's US versus foreig n citizenship. Nor does it appear to tr ack the inmate's citizenship in a country that the US considers to be a hotbed of activity by Al-Qaeda or any groups the U.S. describes as affiliated with Al- Qaeda. It is thus hard to discern the underlying basis for th ese different designations. In addition, Lappin's figure of 211 \"international terrorist inmates\" is far fewer than the Department of Justice's number of 494 individuals convicted of international terrorism or terrorist-related offenses. In February 2012, Bureau of Prisons reported to the Government Accountability Office that it had 373 inmates \"charged with or convicted of federal crimes related to terrorism\" in its custody. In November 2013, the Bureau of Prisons told us there were 332 post-conviction prisoners designated as \"international terrorism\" and 91 as \"domestic terrorism,\" while there were 52 pre-conviction prisoners so designated in their custody. See Harley G. Lappin, \"Testimony of Harley G. La ppin before House Appropri ations Subcommittee on Commerce Justice, Science and Related Agencies,\" US Congress, March 12, 2008, (on file with Human Rights Watch); US Government Accountability Office, \"Guant\u00e1namo Bay Detainees: Facilities and Factors for Consideration if Detainees Were Brought to the United States,\" report to the Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, US Sentate,GAO-13-31 (November 2012), http://www.gao.gov/pro ducts/GAO-13-31 (accessed July 2, 2014); Bureau of Prisons documents related to SAMs obtained on November 21, 2013 from Freedom of Information Act requests made by Human Rights Watch on August 24, 20 12 (on file with Human Rights Watch). 685 In 2007, the Bureau of Prisons released a \"fact sheet\" de scribing a system to classify individuals as \"terrorist inmates,\" defined broadly as \"those havi ng been convicted of, charged with, asso ciated with, or linked to terrorist 153 JULY 2014 Only due to our Freedom of Information Act request and following a court order did the Department of Justice confirm the ex istence of \"an assignment system that identifies inmates with a nexus to terrori sm\"\u2014based not just on their convictions, conduct and affiliations established at trial or while in prison, but an array of \"open source information, intelligence provided by other law enforcement agencies, [and] other information subject to validation.\" 686 The government did not describe any process for challenging the validity of information derived from these sources.687 Nor is it clear that the Bureau of Prison's designation re view processes available to prisoners under other Security Threat Group assignments (e.g. for alleged gang affiliations) are available to prisoners de signated as \"terrorists.\" To the extent prisoners are placed in solitary confinemen t and subject to other potentially abusive conditions because of their designations as \"terrorists,\" failure to provide a review process for designations raises due proc ess concerns under international human rights law. (US courts have generally failed to uphold similar du e process claims.) In some cases we reviewed, the taint of terrorism subjected prisoners to harsh measures that did not appear to plausi bly relate to any potential threat the prisoner poses. For example, Sabri Benkah la is a US citizen who was acquitted of providing material support for terrorism but later co nvicted of making false statements to a grand jury and the FBI (see above). The district judge in the case was unequivocal that \"Sabri Benkahla is no t a terrorist\" and found that Benkahla's false statements were not based on intent to promote a terrorist activity but \"out of a desire not to be seen as involved with illegal activities.\" 688 Although Benkahla activities, or belonging to organizations that planned a nd/or executed violent and de structive acts against the government and/or privately owned US corporations.

Dep't of Justice Fed. Bureau of Pris ons, 13 Civ. 7360 (HB), January 17, 2014 (on file with Human Rights Watch). 687 The Bureau of Prisons may base an initial placement decision on a prisoner's security score, which is calculated based on several factors, including the sentencing court's recommendation and the prisoner's criminal history. If the Bureau of Prisons seeks to place an individual at a higher or lower-security prison, inconsistent with his security score, it must base its decision on a \"management variable.\" The Bureau of Prison's Program Statement on inmate placement does not reference terrorism offenses or \"terrorist inmates\" at any point. However, it describes one management variable as \"Central Inmate Monitoring,\" applying to \"certain inmates who present special needs for management.\" It is possible that individuals deemed \"terrorist inmates\" are placed at prisons inconsistent with their security scores, but without further information we could not determine if this was the case. See US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, \"Program Statement: Inmate Security Designation and Custody Classification,\" September 12, 2006, http://www.bop.gov/policy/pro gstat/5100_008.pdf (accessed June 26, 2014). 688 United States v.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 154 received a terrorism enhancement (see section V) to his sentence, the judge concluded: \"His likelihood of ever committing another crime is infinitesimal.\"689 Benkahla was classified as a minimum se curity prisoner and had never been charged with a disciplinary violation when, in October 2007, he was sent to a CMU. There, he was denied any contact visits from his family and permitted only one 15- minute phone call per week .690 The American Civil Libert ies Union filed a lawsuit challenging his confinement in the CMU in June 2009, and he was transferred out of it in July 2010. The Bureau of Prisons has sometimes tran sferred prisoners to less restrictive conditions over time, suggesting that th e \"terrorist inmate\" designation does not prevent all individualized inquiry and review. Indeed, we found that nearly a quarter of prisoners convicte d of terrorism or terrorism- related offenses were held in low-security prisons, as of July 2013.691 However, in the cases we reviewed, prisoners transferred to lower-security prisons did not know the reasons for the transfer, and feared being returned to more restrictive conditions. Transferring Out of ADX After 9/11, the Bureau of Prisons tran sferred several Muslim men convicted of terrorism-related offenses from less restri ctive prisons to solitary confinement at ADX, although they did not have sign ificant disciplinary histories or any involvement in the 9/11 attacks.692 The Bureau of Prisons later changed its policies to permit prisoners to be sent to ADX if they were \"convicted of, charged with, 689 Ibid., p.759. 690 Amended Complaint, Benkahla v.

In litiga tion before the European Co urt of Human Rights, the US government reported that since the 2009 manual came into effect, it has moved an increasing percentage of prisoners to ADX's less restrictive units.

Indeed, we are aware of at least two prisoners who successfully completed the Step Down program and were transferred out of ADX, although one described irregularities in the review system. Eljvir Duka was transferred from ADX to a CMU in August 2011 after completing only two Step Down phases, and his family reported that they could not learn why he was transferred before completing the program. Shain Duka was transferred from ADX to Big Sandy USP after completing the Step Down program: he spent one year in ADX General Population, six months in ADX's J Unit, six months in K-Unit, and one year in the Delta Bravo Unit. Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute email correspondence with Shain Duka, June 14, 2013. However, defense lawyers remain concerned about the prospects for transfer out of ADX and argue that only a minority of ADX prisoners have pr ogressed through the program. ECHR , Babar Ahmad and Others v. the U.K. , \u00a7 191, 10 April 2012 (discussing testimony and evidence submitted by defense lawyer and solitary confinement expert Laura Rovner). According to the government's September 2011 response to the European Court of Human Rights, there were only 89 prisoners in the Step Down program, which is about a quarter of the population eligible for it (this excludes ADX prisoners under SAMs and in the Control Unit, who are subject to different procedures). Of those in the program, 25 were in the third and final phase\u2014forming about only 7 percent of the ADX prisoner population eligible for the program. In response to a request by the European Court of Human Rights, th e Department of Justice in September 2011 reported that there were 252 prisoners at ADX in General Population. 700 For example, before a prisoner is transferred to a Bure au of Prisons Control Unit (a type of unit for inmates believed to pose a threat to other inmates or to prison secu rity), he or she is entitled to 24-hour advance notice of the charges and the specific acts or evidence forming the basis for the transfer recommendation, a live hearing 157 JULY 2014 opportunity to contest their pl acement. Instead, within five days of transfer to a CMU, an inmate receives a \"Notice of Transfer to Communications Management Unit.\" Our review of these notices from se veral cases suggests they do not describe specific acts or evidence underlying a de signation that would pe rmit a prisoner to challenge them.701 In some cases, the notices state that \"reliable evidence\" indicates the prisoner has been involved in \"radicalization e fforts,\" but we are aware of no notices that describe the evidence.702 The Bureau of Prisons is not required to document or su bstantiate CMU designations.703 Decisions to place prisoners at the CMUs appear to bypass th e Bureau of Prisons' general designation and placement system, which by statute must include consideration of factors including the sentencing court's statements.704 According to the Bureau of Prisons, as of October 2013, 45 individuals have been released or transferred from the CMUs ba sed on a Step Down process, but it was unpredictable and ineffective in some cases. 705 Indeed, of the nearly 100 CMU detainees, the Bureau of Prisons said only four were currently in the Step Down process. 706 Whereas the Bureau of Prisons requires review of prisoners' placement with representation by a staff member, and the opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence and a written decision. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.40 (d escribing control unit programs) and \u00a7 541.43. 701 There is typically a one-page form that only includes enough space for a brief paragraph, which commonly describes the prisoner's conviction a nd underlying conduct, with an emphas is on his communication with other individuals or terrorist groups.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 158 at control units every 30 days, there is no required Bureau of Prisons review of CMU prisoners' ongoing placement.707 In October 2009, the Bureau of Prisons issued a memo requiring staff to review CMU pris oners' designation every six months. But this process does not provide prisoner s the opportunity to address specific allegations or evidence, as is possible in the reviews for control unit prisoners .708 Mohamed Shnewer, a defendant in the Fort Dix case, said he had been imprisoned at Marion CMU for four years. In an email, he described the review process: I asked how can I get out of here, I was told when my \"crime\" I was convicted [of] changes. It's the same every time, there is never a discussion, this \"review\" usually takes less than two minutes. I sign a few places, take the papers they have ready for me, then leave the room. 709 Defense lawyers who have visited the Mari on CMU told us that the men they met had no disciplinary histories, and their continued placement at the CMU was based on their terrorism convictions. \"That is only done for terrorism cases, everyone else is classified according to what they do in the prison system,\" a defense lawyer explained. 710 \"The effect of that means they can never change their security classification, because their underlying crime will remain the same\u2014so no matter how they behave, they're forever stuck.\"711 707 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.49 (providing for review by a control un it team every 30 days and by the \"Executive Panel\" every 60 to 90 days). 708 US Government Accountability Office, \"Improvements Need ed in Bureau of Prisons' Monitoring and Evaluation of Impact of Segregated Housing,\" report to Congressional Requestors, GAO-13-429 (May 2013), http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/654349.pdf (accessed July 1, 2014), p. 54; The US Government Accountability Office reviewed ten files of CMU prisoners and found that for two prisoners, the BOP \"did not include documentation that unit team staff regularly monito red the inmate's CMU status every six months.\" US Government Accountability Office, \"Improvements Needed,\" p. 58; see Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment at 31-36, Aref v.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 160 prisoners under SAMs has been transferred out of ADX Florence\u201411, as of January 14, 2011.718 We are aware that at least some pr isoners have been able to secure modification of their SA Ms without pursuing an administrative remedy. But prisoners are not given a hearing where they can contest the initial imposition of SAMs. 719 Nor do they have adequate notice of the process for securing SAMs modification and removal, nor of the co nduct that will make modification and removal more likely. After SAMs are imposed, inmates can, in th eory, challenge the restrictions through the Bureau of Prisons' Ad ministrative Remedy Program, 720 or they can seek modification of their SAMs by making a request to a Bureau of Prisons staff member721 or during a six-month Bureau of Prisons review.722 But the Bureau of Prisons has argued in litigation that it in fact has \"no authority to remove or amend any restrictions imposed\" through SAMs.723 One prisoner formerly held in solitary confinement under SAMs said: \"The wardens of ADX used to tell us that there is nothing that they can do to improve our conditions as long as the SAMs is in place. That's why the inmates in ADX were in an endless hunger strike,\" he wrote. \"[T]here 718 Defendants' Reply in Support of Motion for Summary Ju dgment at 53, Mohammed v.

Sinc e 2009, the review provides an in-person meeting with the prisoner and his unit team approximately one week following the submission of written comments by the prisoner. While this process allows for some input from the prisoner, it is inadequate because the Bureau of Prisons has limited authority to modify or remove SAMs ye t the the Bureau of Prisons is the only institution the prisoner can questions from and with which he may discuss his concerns. 723 See Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment at 54, Ayyad , No. 05-cv-02342 (D.

In August 2010, the Bureau of Prisons esta blished a process including an in-person meeting for ADX inmates unde r SAMs, which includes th e prisoner, ADX personnel and the FBI case agent assigned to the prisoner's case. 725 But the prisoner does not have an opportunity to addres s the specific allegations of the US Attorney's office requesting SAMs renewal. Prisoners are or dinarily not given an explanation of why their SAMs are being renewed that is deta iled enough for them to meaningfully contest.726 Instead, they simply receive a boilerplate letter stating their SAMs are being renewed because they \"continue to show a proclivity for violence.\"727 Under a three-stage Step Down program (d istinct from the regular ADX program), SAMs prisoners at ADX Florence can gain incrementally more out-of-cell time and phone privileges.728 We were only able to discern the parameters of this Step Down 724 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute email correspondence with Shah Wali Khan Amin (self- identified as Osama Haidar Turkistani), March 21, 2013. 725 Following the meeting with the inmate, ADX staff prepare a memorandum summarizing the discussion with the prisoner, which is then routed to ADX personnel who are in a position to provide additional input about the prisoner.

The \"Special Security Unit Pr ogram\" is the counterpart of the Step Down Program for ADX General Population inmates. According to the Bureau of Prisons, its purpose is \"to confine inmates with SAMs under close controls while providing them opportunities to demonstrate progressively responsible behavior and participate in programs in a safe, secure environmen t.\" In 2009, ADX increased these prisoners out-of-cell recreation time from five to ten hours, which is the same as non-SAMs prisoners.

Ab u Ali's SAMs were apparently modified to permit him less restrictive conditions over time: while Abu Ali was previously in 23- hour lockdown with an hour of indoor exerci se, he is now permitted at least two hours of interaction with other inmates a day, and an hour and a half of outdoor recreation. Still, his attorney told us they were not no tified of the SAMs modification and that the Step Down process was unclear, making the duration of these ameliorated conditions\u2014and the potential that Abu Ali could be put back in 23-hour isolation\u2014 unknown. \"I have no understanding of what that process is,\" the attorney told us. \"There's no handout or handbook. There's noth ing that I can point to, to say, 'This is how you can step down in the futu re.'

In units that hold prisoners designated as \"ter rorists,\" internal review systems too often fail to provide an effective check on unnecessary or prolonged solitary confinement or other restrictive conditions. This is compounded by the fact that US law imposes unfair limitations on US prisoners' ability to seek redress thro ugh litigation for abuse and dangerous conditions of confinement. 732 731 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuma n or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention against Torture), adopted December 10, 1984, G.A. res. 39/46, annex, 39 U.N.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 164 VII. Law Enforcement Relations with American Muslim Communities Since the 9/11 attacks, successive US administrations have said that they are seeking to build relationships with American Muslim community leaders and groups, as they are critical sources of in formation to prevent terrorist plots. They have also said that they seek to help build American Muslim communities' sense of cohesion and trust in law enforcement, to counter violent extremism. Many of the policies and practices we have described in this report, however, run counter to these purported goals: in some commun ities, they have generated fear of interacting with law enforcement. Community Outreach and Counte ring Violent Extremism \"If the public understands the FBI's missi on and views the FBI as cooperative and trustworthy, they are more like ly to report a crime, return a telephone call or respond positively to being approached by an FBI agent,\" FBI official Brett Hovington told Congress in March 2010, in explaining the FBI's outreach wi th American Muslim communities. 733 The FBI and other parts of the Justice Department have promoted this vision of community-law enforcement partnerships by, for example, creating local advisory boards and meeting with local community groups.734 This vision was in some ways expanded wi th the White House's adoption in August 2011 of a strategy paper on \"Cou ntering Violent Extremism\" (CVE). 735 The stated 733 \"Working with Communities to Disrupt Terror Plots,\" Brett Ho vington, Chief, Community Relations Unit, Office of Public Affairs, Federal Bureau of Investigation, statement before the House Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment, Washington, DC, March 17, 2010, transcript at http://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/working-with-commu nities-to-disrupt-terror-plots (accessed July 1, 2014). 734 One positive result is the development of culturally and religiously sensitive guidelines for the FBI's arrest practices. Moreover, several U.S. Attorneys have public ly written or spoken out against stigmatization and vilification of Muslim communities, and sometimes they have sent powerful messages of support by investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.

Activities that reinfo rce our shared sense of belonging and productive interactions betw een government and the people undercut this narrative and emphasize through our actions that we are all part of the social fabric of America. As President Obama emphasized, when discussing Muslim Americans in the context of Al-Qaeda's attempts to divide us , \"we don't differentiate between them and us. It's just us.\" 738 Fears of Surveillance and Targeting in American Muslim Communities Despite this rhetorical commitment against stigmatizing American Muslim communities, many of the investigatory and prosecution practices described in this report undermine the vision and goals of \"Countering Viole nt Extremism\" and community outreach by generating a fear among communities that law 736 Ibid. 737 Sahar F.

At some mosques, congregants were initially suspicious of us and appear ed alarmed by any ment ion of terrorism or law enforcement. Some mosque leaders to ld us that their communities had not been impacted by high-profile prosecutions and that they maintained cordial and frank relationships with law enforcement. Yet, in many mosque s, we repeatedly heard suspicions of surveillance. Some of these accounts woul d have smacked of exaggerated suspicion were it not for the undeniable reality of government surveillance policies. 739 Our research, conducted in communities perhaps most like ly to be fearful because of the publicized arrests and prosecutions of local Muslims, corroborates other reports by media and NGOs documenting fear of law enforcement.

Many people told us they believed that informants were eavesdropping on their conversations. Some expressed fear that informants were targeting Muslim youth\u2014 encouraging them to split off from the ma in congregation, form their own groups and detach themselves from mosque elders and leaders. 742 Advocates who work with Muslim communities told us that the fear of informants posing as fellow Muslims was damaging communities' sense of safety and internal cohesion. The fear exists for everyone, from mosque le aders \"to people who just go to Friday prayer,\" said Mohamed Sabur, an attorn ey at the organization Muslim Advocates who regularly speaks with mosque and co mmunity leaders in California and the Pacific Northwest region. \"[W]hether it's people approaching other people in mosques, or in gyms, or el sewhere...[it] leaves no sp ace in the Muslim community where there is trust.\"743 Investigations and prosecutions involving local religious leaders have had a chilling effect on some communities we visi ted. For example, at Masjid as-Salam in Albany, New York, the FBI raided the mosq ue in connection with the investigation of its imam, Yassin Aref (see section II). After the raid, there was \"a tremendous amount of fear and anger from the Muslim community,\" said mosque president, Dr. Shamshad Ahmad. There was a perception that the government was coming after \"religious, simple minded pe ople, and [people] thought that this was a blanket movement so people became scared.\" 744 742 Muslim leaders have also described fears about the targeting of youth in media articles. See Alejandro J. Beutel, \"Muslim Americans and U.S. Law Enforcement: Not Enemies, But Vital Partners,\" Christian Science Monitor , December 30, 2009, http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2009/1230/Muslim-Americans-and-US- law-enforcement-not-enemies-but-vital-partners (accessed June 26, 2014). 743 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute email correspondence with Mohamed Sabur, Muslim Advocates, November 8, 2012. 744 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute interview with Shamshad Ahmad, president of Masjid as-Salam, Albany, New York, June 20, 2012. In another example, at Oregon's largest mosque, Masjed As-Saber, the FBI has reportedly put at least five men affiliated with the mosque , including its longtime religious leader, on a no-fly list. \"There's this sense of nervousness...No one knows who's secretly the FBI,\" one congregant said.

They reported that this fear had, during some periods, driven them or their acquaintances to avoid expre ssing political opinions or engaging in basic religious practices such as gr oup prayer. (However, other community members said that mosque attendance was not significantly affected by possible surveillance or other practices.) 747 Some community members said that fears of surveillance and infor mant infiltration had negatively transformed the quality of the mosque\u2014from a place of spiritual sanctuary and community togetherness to a place where they had to be on their guard, watch what they said, with whom they spoke, and even how often they attended services .748 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/17/masjed-as -saber-oregon-mosque-fbi-scrutiny_n_1598520.html (accessed June 26, 2014). 745 According to \"Preventing Violent Extremism,\" \"Countering radicalization to violence is frequently best achieved by engaging and empowering individuals and groups at the local level to build resilience against violent extremism.

Charity and community groups have also reported having a harder time recruiting volunteers due to the climate of fear. 169 JULY 2014 Muslim Advocates attorney Sabur meets re gularly with Muslim communities across the country. He told us that American Musl ims are more reluctant than ever to give to charity. \"Eleven years af ter 9/11, things are engrai ned in the community. Some people go to the extent to not give to any Muslim cause. They don't want to risk being scrutinized after the fact. After all, $150 million to one organization led to a 20-year investigation.\"749 (Referring to the investigation of the Holy Land Foundation\u2014see section III). Damage to Community-L aw Enforcement Trust Some American Muslims are reluctant to engage with law enforcement because they believe it could lead to their being arbitrarily targeted\u2014either to become an informant, or to be prosecuted. As a re sult, they are wary of talking with law enforcement, which can have ramifications for their willingness to report a crime or fully cooperate in bona fide terrorism investigations. American Muslims are most likely to engage with the FBI in two settings: in FBI \"voluntary interviews\" (visits to their home s, schools, and places of work) or in their own cultural or religious spaces. FBI agents have in some cases presented their attendance at mosque or cultural even ts, or their visits to individuals' homes and schools, as \"community outreach\"\u2014fr iendly and casual\u2014but instead collected intelligence on the behavior s of law-abiding American Muslim individuals and communities. 750 This runs counter to the FBI's own policy of separating American Civil Liberties Union, Blocking Faith, Freezing Charity: Chilling Muslim Charitable Giving in the \"War on Terrorism Financing (New York: ACLU, June 2009), https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/humanrig hts/blockingfaith.pdf#page=70 (accessed June 30, 2014), p. 69; Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute phone interview with Jennifer Turner, ACLU Human Rights Program, August 22, 2012. 749 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute email correspondence with Mohamed Sabur, Muslim Advocates, November 8, 2012. 750 Multiple sources, including former and current governme nt officials, told us that when the FBI attends or organizes events under the banner of \"community outrea ch,\" it sometimes gathers information on communities that it uses as intelligence, that is, to feed into analyses of radicalization and extremism, and as potential bases for investigations into particular individuals.

Though the FBI agents presented their efforts to outsiders as part of an outreach prog ram, some of the information gathered was stored in FBI intelligence files, according to documents obtained th rough a Freedom of Information Act request by the ACLU. See ACLU, ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 170 investigation work from community outreach.751 It has the effect of tainting all FBI community partnership efforts as insincere, and fuels the percep tion that the FBI views all American Muslims as inherently suspect.752 It also drives speculation within communities that the FBI is taking advantage of their willingness to engage to perform clandestine investigations an d ultimately build prosecutions against vulnerable community members. Perhaps most damaging to community-law en forcement trust is that in parts of the country the FBI has pressured law-abiding in dividuals to become informants within their own communities\u2014that is, to provide information on fr iends and community members. While there is no recent and large-scale study of these incidents, some American Muslims have described them as involving intimidation and harassment. For example, the Minnesota chapter of th e Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) told us that since May 2012, it ha s received as many as three complaints each week from individuals the FBI alle gedly approached to act as informants, typically in the Somali-American community. Saly M. Abd Alla, civil rights director at CAIR-Minnesota, recalled a recent case in which the FBI approached a 17-year- old student and offered to get him a \"nice smartphone.\" 753 Abd Alla added that in some cases, the FBI uses coercive tactics to get in formants, for example, by threatening to stall their asylum application.

For example, some of the mistrust in the Mu slim community in Minnesota stems from a lengthy grand jury investigation into se veral Somali-American youth believed to have traveled to Somalia to fight with Al -Shabaab, a Somali militant group with ties to Al-Qaeda. 759 The case against Amina Ali and Hawa Hassan (see section IV) stemmed in part from that grand jury investigation. 754 See, e.g., Trevor Aaronson, The Terror Factory (Brooklyn, New York: Ig Publishing, 2013), p. 99-100; Samreen Hooda, \"Muslims On No-Fly List Now Suing FBI, Pressured to be Informants,\" Huffington Post , May 17, 2012, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/17/muslim-no-fly- 26, 2104); Peter Waldman, \"A Muslim's Choice: Turn U.S. Informant or Risk Losing Visa,\" Wall Street Journal , July 11, 2006, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115258258 431002991.html (accessed June 26, 2014); Shirin Sadeghi, \"U.S. Citizen Put on No-Fly List to Pressure Him Into Becoming FBI Informant,\" Truthout , June 12, 2012, http://truth- out.org/news/item/9748-placement-on-no-fly-list-as-pressure-to-become-fbi-informant-the-latest-victim (accessed June 26, 2014); Christian Farr and BJ Lutz, \"Case of Marine on No-Fly List Not Isolated: CAIR,\" NBC Chicago , March 22, 2011, http://www.nbcchicago.co m/news/local/mashal-marine-no-fly-118468714 .html (accessed June 26, 2014); \"FBI Looking at Somali Man's Intimidation Complaint,\" Associated Press , January 30, 2013, http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2013/01/30/fbi-looking-at-s omali-mans-intimidation-complaint/ (accessed June 26, 2014); Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Greater Los Angeles Area Chapter, \"The FBI's Use of Informants, Recruitment and Intimidation within Muslim Communities: Annotated Source List: News Articles and Cases Reported to CAIR,\" March 26, 2009, http://ca.cair.com/download.ph p?f=/downloads/CAIR_FBI_Abuses_Annotated_Source_List-- Articles_and_Cases.pdf (access ed June 26, 2014), p. 1. 755 See, e.g., Alejandro J.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 172 The Holy Land Foundation case included a list of 245 unindicted co-conspirators, including mainstream Muslim or ganizations such as CAIR.760 Although the list of unindicted co-conspirators was confiden tial, it was leaked to the public.761 The naming of the co-conspirators had wide-r anging consequences. The FBI, which previously worked closely with CA IR, dropped its formal association.762 In this context of distrust, some members of communities may view leaders and others who cooperate with the FBI as disconnected from their concerns. Ashraf Nubani, a Muslim lawyer based in Virginia who often speaks to national Muslim audiences at religious and cultural m eetings across the country, said some community members might see Muslim le aders \"hosting Iftar dinners\" with government guests as \"Uncle Toms\" when the FBI later holds up the arrest of a teenager as \"catching a big terrorist.\" 763 760 Government's Trial Brief, Attachment A, United States v.

One of the unindicted co-conspirators was a Canadian charity, the International Relief Fund for the Afflicted and Needy (Canada) (IRFAN-Canada). In a Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) audit of IRFAN that started in 2008, the CRA cited the HLF list of unindicted co-conspirators as a factor in questioning IRFAN-Canada's previous representation that it was not aware of any credible allegation that organizations with which it worked were connected to Hamas. See Chlo\u00e9 Fedio, \"Former charity funded terror group: federal audit,\" Toronto Star , April 15, 2011, http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/04/15/former_chari ty_funded_terror_group_federal_audit.html (accessed June 24, 2014). No criminal charges were ever brought and CRA concluded its first audit action against IRFAN-Canada in late December 2004 without adverse outcome. In 2008, CRA commenced a second audit of IRFAN-Canada which continued until 2011, with CRA alleging, among other things, that the charity redistributed funds collected for other issues and sent them to the West Bank and Gaza. In a letter to IRFAN-Canada's lawyers in 2010, CRA noted that \"court documents released during the successful 2008 conviction in the United States of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (HLF) on terrorist financing charges named IRFAN-Canada on a list of unindicted co-conspirators considered to be 'entities that are and/or were part of the Global Hamas financing mechanism.'\" See Letter from Charities Directorate, Canada Revenue Agency, to Carters Professional Corporation, December 14, 2010 (on file with Human Rights Watch). CRA considered this a factor in questioning IRFAN-Canada's previous representation that it was not aware of any credible allegation that organizations with which it worked were connected to Hamas. In 2011, IRFAN- Canada lost its charitable status. On April 29, 2014, IRFAN-Canada was declared a terrorist entity; IRFAN-Canada's appeal of the denial of its charitable status is on hold due to its recent designation.

They questioned the government's devoti on of resources to investigation and prosecution, instead of to supporting community and religious institutions to detect and address pathways to crime, fo r example, through funding counseling and social services. Some community advocates expressed frustration at the lack of government investment in community support. A few weeks after the government indicted 19-year-old Adel Daoud, who had been a st udent at a local Islamic school when undercover FBI agents began communicati ng online with him about planning a terrorist attack, we spoke with a Muslim community-based advocate in Chicago: \"These kids don't wake up one day and decide 'I'm going to blow society up,'\" she said, pointing out that they may have problems and start exploring extremist 764 As a 2013 study put it: \"[B]ecause individuals who are prominent in the American Muslim community, or perceived to be leaders, are often primary candidates for [FBI] interviews, there is also an assumption that community leaders are compromised.\" MACLC, \"Mapping Muslims: NYPD Sp ying and its American Muslims,\" March 11, 2013, http://www .law.cuny.edu/academics/clinics/immi gration/clear/Mapping-Muslims.pdf (accessed June 30, 2014), p. 29. 765 Sahar F.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 174 websites, just as they might turn to drugs. The advocate told us she had approached various government agencies about funding for social services. \"You cannot direct your attacks and assaults on this community and not invest in infrastructure for this community.\"766 Corey Saylor of CAIR echoed calls for a counseling- and social service-based approach: Many of these kids are salvageabl e when they first come to the attention of law enforcement. We could send an imam in and snap the kid back straight. That would be better than an informant walking him down the path, providing the means. I have no sympathy for someone who thinks th ey're pushing the button. But it never should have gotten there. Intervention can work. There are examples. When they're introduced to a mentor, a friend who has influence, instead of surfing arou nd on the Internet\u2014instead of violent extremists and undercover law enforcement. Some of these kids can be saved. 767 There are significant reasons to be caut ious about involving law enforcement in such interventions.768 Yet the FBI's activities cut off any possibility of such an approach and contribute to a climate of fear, undermining the efforts of other federal agencies that engage with American Muslim communities. The UK's Channel program involves local government authorities, community members and organizations from the ed ucation sector, social services, and children's and youth services, for social services-based interventions to identify and prevent \"extremism.\" It was established in 2007 as part of a larger program to 766 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute interview wi th (name withheld), Chicago, Illinois, October 10, 2013. 767 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute phone Inte rview with Corey Saylor, national legislative director for CAIR National, February 14, 2012. 768 See Arun Kundnani, Spooked!

The program has received about 2,500 cases since it was established.772 In the US, there are at least a handful of cases where the government adopted a \"soft intervention\" approach and refe rred individuals to local community partners. 773 These past cases also show the feasibility of alternatives to abusive investigation and prosecutions. Yet any approach that involves the FBI and targets individuals based on their religious belief s or political opinions raises serious concerns about respect for the freedom of expression. 774 Rights-respecting 769 United Kingdom Secretary of State for the Home Department, Prevent Strategy (London: The Stationary Office, June 2011), https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent- strategy-review.pdf (accessed July 10, 2014). 770 See House of Commons, Communites and Local Government Committee, Preventing Violent Extremism: Sixth Report of Session 2009-10 (London: The Stationary Office Limited, 2010), http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmsel ect/cmcomloc/65/65.pdf (accessed June 30, 2014). 771 The UK Association of Chief Police Officers describes Channel as using \"early interventions to protect and divert people away from the risk [of committing terrorist-related activity] they face before illegality occurs.\" \"Channel - Protecting Vulnerable People from Being Drawn Into Terrorism,\" Association of Chief Police Officers, http://www.acpo.police.uk/ACPOBusinessAreas/PREVENT/Channel. aspx (accessed June 30, 2014 ); Channel is part of a wider government strategy for preventing violent extremism kn own as Prevent. \"Protecting the UK against terrorism,\" last modified March 26, 2013 https://www.go v.uk/government/policies/protecting-the-uk-against-terrorism/supporting- pages/prevent.

One danger of th e Channel program is that community and organization partners may be pressured to provide information to the government not just about individuals who might be \"at risk\" of committing a criminal offense, but about the political and religious opinions of local communities and their members, which may be used as intelligence. The government may also use Channel to collect information from referred individuals to prosecute their friends or relatives. Furthermore, although the police purport to refer on ly serious cases to the Prevent program, referrals are based on activity, such as visiting extremist websites or making political statements, which may raise freedom of expression concerns. 773 Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute intervie w with (name withheld), February 24, 2012; Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute phone Interv iew with (name withheld), February 14, 2012. 774 Some advocates question whether the FBI would use \"soft interventions\" as a pretext to gather information on communities and particular individuals, for the ultimate purpose of prosecutions. And others have noted that in the absence of a clear direction from the Department of Justice to regularize what is now an ad-hoc practice, FBI agents would face overwhelming pressure from their colleagues and other government agencies to take the risk-averse approach of investigation (for the purpose of prosecution). ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 176 interventions could be community-driven and based on community institutions such as mosques and schools. While federal officials increasingly reco gnize the importance of developing such alternatives, the reality is that counterter rorism efforts, including surveillance and the use of informants, cause such signif icant harm to community-law enforcement trust that they may understandably deter communities from accepting any government support. Mosque and communi ty leaders may also be reluctant to engage with youth and other members they id entify as at risk of committing a crime, out of fear that they will be tainted by association and come under government scrutiny themselves. This underscores that the success of CVE depends in large part on the government limiting the use of informants and unde rcover agents and ending overbroad material support prosecutions. In addition, the government should reco gnize that focusing CVE on American Muslim communities is stigmatizing and unwarranted. Indeed, various ideologies and social dynamics\u2014not only Al-Qaeda inspired extremism\u2014 have resulted in domestic terrorism in recent years. 775 As a former US official explained, the current approach \"risks perpetuating the 'us-vers us-them' dichotomy that the White House is trying to overcome,\" because the subtex t is, \"You Muslims are a potential threat and we, the government have to co-opt you.\"776 775 See Executive Office of the President of the United States, \"Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States\" August 1, 2011, http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/empowering_local_partners.pdf (accessed June 19, 2014), p. 2. A focus on Al-Qaeda-inspired extremism and American Musl im communities finds that since 9/11, many acts of mass violence and terrorism in the United States have not been related to Al-Qaeda. One study estimates that there have been 33 terrorism-related fatalities in the United States in the 11 years since 9/11 involving Muslims; in comparison, there were 66 deaths from mass shootings by non-Muslims in 2012 alone. See Charles Kurzman, Muslim-American Terrorism: Declining Further , (Chapel Hill, North Carolina: Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security, 2013), http://kurzman .unc.edu/files/2011/06/Kurzman_Muslim- American_Terrorism_February_1_2013.pdf (accessed June 30, 2014). Another study notes that between 9/11 and 2012, more than 250 Americans have been killed in attacks by far-right individuals and groups, including white supremacists and Christian fundamentali sts, and describes a \"dramatic rise in the number of attacks and violent plots\" inspired by far-right ideologies since 2007.

ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 178 VIII. Full Recommendations To the US President Urge the attorney general, Department of Justice, and Bureau of Prisons to reform investigative, tria l and detention practices. Ensure UN special rapporteurs have full access to facilities and prisoners to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. Direct reform of \"Countering Violent Extremism\" and Community Outreach programs. o Direct all federal agencies to ensure that activity conducted as \"community outreach\" or under the auspices of \"countering violent extremism\" (CVE) is no t being used for intelligence purposes and that these programs are not exploited for intelligence collection. o Direct all federal agencies to en sure that counterterrorism and CVE programs are based on so und academic and empirical research methods, rather than discredited \"radicalization\" theories. o Direct federal agencies to supp ort community-driven and rights- respecting programs as an alternat ive to the use of informants and abusive investigations. Support social service providers and community organizations that develop programs based on needs they have identified. Do not base referrals for soft intervention on religious behavior, political opinion, or other activity protected by the right to freedom of expressi on under international law. o Reconceptualize CVE to focus on domestic terrorism of all ideological forms. 179 JULY 2014 To the US Attorney General Reform investigation authorities. o Amend the attorney general's Guidelines for Domestic FBI Operations (\"Guidelines\") to: clearly establish that decisions to initiate assessments, preliminary investigations, or investigations may not be made on the basis of religious behavior, political opinion, or other activity protected by the right to freedom of expression under international law; prohibit the recruiting and tasking of informants in assessment and preliminary investigation phases, as under previous versions of the guidelines; permit the FBI to initiate a full investigation only if it is supported by articulable facts giving rise to a reasonable indication that a violation of federal law may occur, as required under previous ve rsions of the guidelines. o With minimal redactions to protect legitimately secret information, declassify and make public key portions of the FB I's Confidential Human Source Validation Standards Manual, in order to allow more robust public oversight of informant conduct and approval procedures. Permit challenges to ma terial support charges: Permit individuals charged with material support under 18 USC \u00a7 2339B to challenge the underlying designation of the Foreign Terrorist Organization. Reform Special Administrative Me asures: Revise the regulations governing Special Administrative Measures (SAMs), 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 501.2 and \u00a7 501.3. o Establish procedures enab ling prisoners and their lawyers to directly challenge the imposition and renewal of SAMs, including resulting conditions such as solitary conf inement, through a pre-deprivation hearing that includes opportunity to review evidence justifying SAMs, submit rebuttal evidence and provide witness testimony. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 180 o Change the standard time for impos ition of SAMs from one year to 120 days, as under previous versions of the regulation. o Limit Monitoring of Attorney-Client Communications. Rescind the regulation that direct s the Bureau of Prisons to facilitate the monitoring or review of commu nications between detainees and attorneys. To the Federal Bureau of Investigation Ensure that decisions to initiate a ssessments, preliminary investigations or investigations are not made on the ba sis of religious behavior, political opinion, or other activity protected by the right to freedom of expression under international law. Revise the Domestic Investigations Oper ations Guide (DIOG) to prohibit the recruiting and tasking of informants in assessment and preliminary investigation phases. Declassify and make public key portio ns of the DIOG detailing guidance provided to FBI agents for initiating monitoring of religious and political institutions. Report to congressional committees on the deployment of informants into community or religious spaces, includin g the number of informants and the scope of their activities. Ensure that information obtained thro ugh community outreach is not used for intelligence purposes, in accord ance with existing FBI policy. Ensure that law enforcement agents do not use threats, including those involving the \"no-fly\" list, wh en recruiting informants. 181 JULY 2014 To the Department of Justice National Security Division and US Attorneys' Offices Reform material support charging practices. o When charging under the materi al support statutes, 18 USC \u00a7 2339A and B: do not charge individuals or groups for providing material support based on activity protected by the right to freedom of expression under international law; charge only individuals or groups who intended to further unlawful activity. Reform trial practices. o Review standards for introduction of evidence abou t terrorism that is not directly linked to defe ndants' conduct to ensure such evidence is not ov erly prejudicial. o Request anonymity of lay witnesses only to protect the witness from physical harm. o Request anonymity of law enforc ement witnesses only in rare circumstances when absolutely necessary to protect ongoing investigations. Ensure defense re ceives adequate information to compensate for anonymity and per mit thorough cross-examination of anonymous witnesses. o Where possible, only use as expert witnesses individuals whose identity and background can be made public. o Ensure expert witnesses have particular expertise in the precise matter at issue in each case. Reform sentencing: Adopt standards to restrict the seeking of the terrorism adjustment, particularly for cases where defendants did not intend physical harm to persons to result from their activities. Restrict use of Special Admin istrative Measures (SAMs). ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 182 o In orders imposing SAMs, provide specific justifications for imposing severe restrictions, e.g. , bars on communication with other inmates or on receipt of information, and ensure that restrictions are proportionate to the particular dangers or threats identified. o During the SAMs renewal process, provide prisoners and their lawyers the opportunity to directly petition the prosecuting US Attorney's Office that ma kes the renewal request. o Limit orders to monitor attorney-client communications to the cases in which no other means are available to protect against serious threats to national security, particularly for pretrial prisoners, and require court auth orization and notification to defense counsel. Cease use of evidence obtained without warrant or court order: Do not seek to introduce evidence against defend ants in criminal cases derived from warrantless surveillance conducted under section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. To the Bureau of Prisons End prolonged solitary confinement: Prohibit all prolonged solitary confinement and indefinite solitary confinement. Where solitary confinement is used, ensure its duration is as short as possible and for a definite term, with notice to prisoners. Ensure periodic, individualized review of prisoners' placement in solitary confinement and provide prisoners a meaningful opportunity to challenge the specific justifications and evidence un derlying their placement. Permit challenges to terrorism designations: Provide notice to prisoners of their designation as \"terrorist \" prisoners\u2014whether domestic or international\u2014and an opportunity to challenge the designation and related restriction or conditions of confinement. Improve conditions in detention. 183 JULY 2014 o Ensure that all prison facilities comply with Bureau of Prison regulations regarding min imum amount of time in recreation and that prisoners in pretrial detention are promptly notified of their rights. o End policies that prohibit all contact visits for prisoners convicted of terrorism offenses or wh o are otherwise deemed to have terrorist ties. Consistent with the Bureau of Prisons' general policy recognizing the importance of the visitation for reha bilitation, permit contact visits unless evidence establishes a specific security risk with regard to communication or contact with partic ular individuals. For inmates for whom there are specific security risks, design contact visitation rooms that permit audio and visual monitoring. o Increase phone call allowances for prisoners whose communication the Bureau of Prisons monitors, including prisoners under SAMs and at CMUs, to levels matching ot her prisoners under their security classification. o Ensure humane prison conditions , including adequate lighting, heating and cooling, and ventilatio n, including at the CMUs and in pretrial detention Spec ial Housing Units. Improve conditions at the Communi cation Management Units (CMUs). o Ensure adequate and timely acce ss to medical and mental health services. o Investigate allegations of harassmen t, intimidation, and retaliation against Muslim and Arab prisoners. o Ensure all prisoners are given adequate accommodations for religious practices, including the opportunity for group prayer for any prisoners for whom it is a religious requirement. o Permit prisoners to challenge their CMU designation through a hearing and review process, for example similar to the process afforded to prisoners placed in a control unit, including a live hearing, advance notice of charges and the acts or evidence at issue, and the right to call witnesses and present documentary evidence. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 184 o Provide due process protections for prisoners prior to CMU designation, including meaningful notice of all reasons for CMU placement, and a hearing. o Ensure meaningful and periodic review of CMU placement every 6 months and provide clear criteria for gaining tran sfer out of the CMU. Ensure the right to an effective defense. o Do not impose pretrial solitary confinement based solely on the severity of the offenses charged; ensure any imposition of pretrial solitary is imposed under meaningful judicial supervision, including of the impact on the defendant's abil ity to participate in preparation of a defense. o Do not unduly delay or arbitraril y block letters, visits and other forms of communication between prisoners and their lawyers. Reform Special Administrative Measur es: In carrying out SAMs orders, apply the least restrictive conditions of confinement for prisoners and do not impose solitary confinement if re asonable alternatives are available. Provide prisoners meaningful opport unity to challenge conditions of confinement imposed due to SAMs, in cluding prohibitions of contact visitations and receipt information. Improve procedures for transfer at Administrative Maximum in Florence, Colorado (\"ADX Florence\"). o Notify prisoners of the specific evidence and factual allegations justifying their placem ent at ADX Florence and provide detailed guidance on the Step Down pr ogram to prisoners and their lawyers. o Ensure that prisoners with clear disciplinary records and good behavior have meaningful opportunity to progress through the Step Down program and be placed in less restrictive conditions, and do not base placement de cisions exclusively on such prisoners' criminal convictions. o Allow prisoners who will not become eligible for Step Down for several years, but who have good behavioral history and who do 185 JULY 2014 not pose a specific threat to staff or other prisoners, the opportunity to have group meals, group recreation, group prayer, and group therapy so as to alleviate the most psychologically damaging and punitive aspect of placement at the ADX. To the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General Review the use of informants in terrori sm-related cases, including the FBI's oversight, the effectiveness of the rules under the Attorney General's Guidelines Regarding the FBI's Use of Confidential Human Sources and the FBI Domestic Investigations and Oper ations Guide, and the impact of national security exceptions. Review the impact of the most recent revisions to the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic Intelligence Operations, including its use of assessments and investigative techni ques that were not previously authorized, on FBI investigation prac tices, FBI-community relations, and respect for freedom of expression and association rights in American Muslim communities. Review the conditions and restriction of privileges for prisoners charged or convicted of terrorism or terrorism-rela ted offenses. To the US Sentencing Commission Conduct a study assessing whether the current system of sentence enhancements for terrorism is furthering appropriate criminal justice goals and is well-tailored to best meet those goals. Revise the Sentencing Guidelines' terrorism adjustment to apply only to federal crimes of terrorism, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g), rather than any offense that \"involved, or was intended to promote\" such a crime. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 186 To Federal Court Judges Evidence and Witnesses: o In weighing the probative value of evidence against its potential prejudicial effects, take into acco unt the context of heightened fear about terrorism. o Permit fact witnesses to testify anonymously only in cases where their personal safety may be at risk by public disclosure of their identities. o If it is necessary for an expert witness to testify anonymously\u2014and no similarly qualified expert is available\u2014en sure adequate measures are taken to permit the defense to effectively challenge their qualifications. Seek to provide specific recourse in judicial orders, ensuring that defendants under SAMs or otherwis e held in Special Housing Units maintain adequate access to counsel in order to properly prepare their defense, in line with international human rights law standards. Ensure that sentencing decisions re flect the goal of rehabilitation. Do not impose terrorism adjustments on the basis of unproven conduct; use judicial discretion to depart from the US Sentencing Guidelines where an individual was not convicted of committing a violent offense. To the US Congress Investigations: o Request that the Office of the Inspector General of the Justice Department review the impact of the most recent revisions to the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic Intelligence Operations on the FBI's practices, including its use of assessments and investigative techniques that were not previously authorized. o Hold hearings and conduct robust oversight of the FBI's activities, particularly with regard to the recruitment and tasking of informants. 187 JULY 2014 o Amend the material suppo rt statutes, 18 USC \u00a7 2339A and \u00a7 2339B, to: Include a requirement for proof of specific intent to further unlawful activity before imposing criminal liability. Remove or clarify overbr oad and impermissibly vague language in material support statute, including \"training,\" \"service,\" and \"expert advice and assistance.\" Detention: Enact legislation requiring the Bureau of Prisons and all federal agencies that operate or contract for prisons to prohibit prolonged solitary confinement and indefinite solitary confinement. Request that the Government Accountability Office review the Bureau of Prison's treatment of prisoners under Special Administrative Measures and in Communication Management Units, including the use of solitary confinement and prohibition on contact visits. Sentencing: Enact legislation directing the US Sentencing Commission to amend the Sentencing Guidelines to modify the adjustment so that it does not artificially raise the defendant's criminal history level to the highest level. Trials: Reform FISA Amendments Ac t to make clear that the Justice Department shall not introduce into as evidence in a criminal case information obtained pursuant to collection under section 702.

Quantitative Analysis of the Department of Justice Terrorism Conviction Dataset There were 494 individuals on the Justic e Department list of convictions for terrorism-related offenses between September 1, 2001 and December 31,2011, which is the most current Justice Departme nt data publicly available on terrorism- related cases. The original Justice Department PDF lists the cases by Justice Department category. Category I cases involve charged violations of federal statutes that are directly related to international terrorism (regardle ss of the offense of conviction). Category II cases involve charged violations of a variety of other statutes where the investigation involved an identified link to international terrorism. DOJ Category Number of Offenders Percentage of Offenders I 225 46% II 269 54% Total 494 100% Number of Convictions and Offenses Involved Among the 494 offenders, there were 917 separate convictions.783 The majority of offenders on the DOJ list were only convicted of a single offense. However, 22 percent of those on the list were convicted of three or more offenses. The 917 convictions included 140 unique offens es. The two most frequent offenses, \"Providing Material Support\" and \"Conspirac y,\" account for more than 1 in 4 of the DOJ convictions. 783 This analysis does not consider the number of counts of each offense for each conviction. For example, if an individual was convicted of 2 counts of Conspiracy, the Co nspiracy conviction is only counted once as there was only a single conviction. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 202 Sentences for Material Su pport and Conspiracy Table: Most Frequent Convictions by Offense Offense (US Code) Number of Convictions Percent of All Convictions Providing Material Support to Designated Terrorist Organizations (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B) 111 12% Conspiracy Statements (18 U.S.C. 1001) Providing Material Support to Terrorists (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A) 57 6% 136 Other Offenses 599 65% Total 917 100% We examined sentences for those conviced of the offenses of Providing Material Support to Terrorists (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A), Providing Material Support to Designated Terrorist Organizations U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B), and Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371). Sentencing data within the dataset was complicated by the fact that individuals could be convicted of multip le offenses, and multiple counts per offense, yet have a single sentence. Additionally, the ci rcumstances regarding the crime of two people convicted of the same offense can greatly differ. Therefore, it is difficult to connect a sentence to an offense code for comparative analysis. However, exploratory analysis does provid e some worthwhile information. First, we analyzed those individuals convic ted of a single offense, negating any influence of additional offenses on sentencing. We found that: All 12 people with a single convicti on of Providing Material Support to Terrorists (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A) were given prison sentences with the average sentence of 132 months. A quarter of this group was given the maximum 15 year sentence. Nearly all (96 percent) of the 48 people convicted only of Providing Material Support to Designated Te rrorist Organizations (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B) were given prison sentences\u2014averaging 87 months. Of those, 15 percent were given the maximum 15-year sentence. 203 JULY 2014 There were 28 people convicted of Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371). Nearly 3 out 4 were given a prison sentence. Prison sentences averaged nearly 2 years for Conspiracy convictions. ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 204 We gathered information from court do cuments on whether convictions were secured through guilty pleas or through trial for 489 of the 494 defendants. Of those, 74.2 percent were secured throug h plea. In comparison, in FY 2012, 97 percent of all federal convictions were secured by plea, indicating that terrorism defendants appear to be more likely (25.8 percent) to risk trial than other federal defendants (3 percent). 784 If we examine the types of convictions for material support or conspiracy charges, the vast of majority of those who were only convicted of a single crime pled guilty. Over 94 percent of those convicted only of conspiracy, and 87 percent of those convicted only of material support, pled guilty. Those that went to trial were more likely to have faced multiple charges of conspiracy and/or material support. Those that went to trial consistently rece ived longer prison sentences than those who pled. Of people only convicted of Material Support, those convicted by trial received 57 months more pr ison time, on average, than those who pled. Those who went to trial for both Material Support and Conspiracy charges received sentences nearly three times, or nearly 18 years, lo nger, on average, than people who pled to similar charges. 785 784 United States Sentencing Commission, FY 2012 Sourcebook. 785 Though all of these indivi duals were convicted of Material Support and Conspiracy, they may also have been convicted of other charges. 205 JULY 2014 ILLUSION OF JUSTICE 206 E.

We appreciate this opportunity to elaborate on our questions and topics of concern. In our meeting you noted that the FBI, and your offices in particular, cannot provide information regarding investigation techniques and practices where they are classified or designated \"law enforceme nt sensitive,\" or where disclosure would raise privacy conc erns. Within th ese parameters, we would appreciate any information that your offices could provide to clarify and further our understanding of the issues we outline below. Where the answers to our questions are classified or designated \"law enforcement sensitive,\" we would appreciate if you would indicate so when stating tha t you are unable to respond. We have prepared the following questions to pinpoint our specific interests, although we would welcome any additional information concerning the topics we raise: 1. The Guidelines for Domestic FBI Operations promulgated in 2008 by Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey (\"Mu kasey Gui delines\") provide for \"assessments,\" an investigative stage that was not previously authorized. a. What is the FBI's view regarding the role of assessments in identifying international terrorism activity? b. The FBI released information pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request by the New York Times detailing assessments conducted through Marc h 30 , 2011.1 Approximately how many assessments has the FBI conducted since that date? How many assessments since 2008 have related to international terrorism? How many assessments conducted since 2008 have led to preliminary or full investigations related to international terrorism? c. The Domestic Investigative and Operations Guide (\"DIOG\") revised in 2011 appears to permit the FBI to use informants, under c over FBI agents and FBI nonagent employees during the assessment stage. Beyond the requirements for periodic review that are generally applicable to assessments, are there particular FBI reviews or standards that would apply to the use of confidential informants, undercover FBI agents or under cover FBI nonagent emplo y ees during assessments? 2 1 The FBI's FOIA disclosures to the New York Times are available online at http://www.documentclo ud.org/documents/238254 fbiassessment data2009 11.html (last visited Nov. 20, 2012). 2 By \"periodic review,\" we are referring to the review described at \u00a73.4.4 of the DIOG. 22. Many members of MuslimAmerican communities with whom we met expressed concern about the presence of informants with criminal backgrounds in mosques and Islamic schools. Can you comment on these concerns? What, if any, standards does the FBI apply concerning the use the informants in national security investigations generally? What standards or restri ctions does the FBI use, in particular, regarding informants' activity at mosques, other religious institutions or cult ural gatherings? a. Please elaborate on statements by thenGeneral Counsel Valerie Caproni, reported in the Associated Press, that use of informants in mosques is \"reviewed for civil liberties concerns\"?3 b. Does the FBI require evidence of a crime before an informant can be sent to a mosque, as has been reported in media?4 c. Do FBI standards generally preclude or disfavor the use of informants believed to be currently or recently engaged in criminal activity, as a general matter or under particular circumstances? 3. The DIOG states: \"No investigative activity, including assessments, may be taken solely on the basis of activities that are prote cted by the First Amendment , or on the race , ethnicity, national origin or religion of the subject, or a combination of only such factors.\"5 The DIOG refers to the responsibility of agents for assessing the impact of investigative activity on fundamental rights.6 What is the role of the Office of General Counsel in reviewing activity or conducting oversight in this regard? What standards would the General Counsel's Office apply (or advise FBI employees to apply) in determining whether investigative activity is conducted \"solely\" on the basis of First Amendment protected activity, or on the basis of the other enumerated factors? What standard s would the General Counsel's Office use (or advise FBI employees to use) for determining whether activities are protected by the First Amendment? 4. In a July 2011 letter to the New York Times, Mr. Kortan wrote: \"[T]he FBI's operations manual establishes greater overall prote ctions for privacy than th e law and Justice Department policy require, and reflect the FBI's commitment to detecting and disrupting threats while safeguarding civil rights and civil liberties.\"7 Please provide examples of where the FBI's operations manual or standards are more restrictive of FBI authority or more protective of privacy or civil liberties than the law or Justice Department policy require. We would find references to particular rules, issues or practices most responsive, but we would also find a reference to common or hypothetical scenarios to be illustrative. 5. In meetings with us , community members and religious leaders have expressed concern that FBI investigations focused on MuslimAmerican youth, particularly teenage boys or young men, involve the use of informants and are overly focused on prosecution. They question why, once the FBI identifies a particular individual who the FBI believes ha s sought information (including on the Internet) about existing terrorist activity or ideological perspectives the FBI associates with potential terrorist activity, they do not approach the individual's family or local mosque officials or take approaches that are not oriented toward prosecutio n. Can you comm ent on these concerns? What approaches does the FBI consider once it identifies a particular individual as seeking information about existing terrorist activity or ideological perspectives the FBI associates with potential terrorist activity? 6. We are familiar with FBI documents describing the \"Radicalization Process.\" Can you describe the FBI's view of the appropriate role of informants, FBI undercover agents or nonagent employees during what the FBI might term the \"indoctrination\" stage?8 Does the FBI's conception of the \"Radicalization Process\" apply to individuals outside of the context of international terrorism, i.e., in domestic terrorism? 3 See Matt Apuzzo & Adam Goldman, \"With CIA help, NYPD moves covertly in Muslim areas,\" Assoc. Press (Aug. 24, 2011). 4 Id. 5 DIOG \u00a7 5.3. 6 DIOG \u00a7 4.2. 7 Michael Kortan, \"FBI Response to Recent Editorial Regarding DIOG Revisions\" (Letter to the Editor), July 6, 2011, available at http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press releases/fbi responsetorecenteditorialregarding diogrevisions (last visited Nov. 20, 2012). 8 See, e.g., Carol Dyer et al., \"Countering Violent Islamic Extremism,\" FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, 5 (2007) available at http://www.fbi.gov/stats services/publications/law enforcement bulletin/2007 pdfs/dec07leb.pdf (last visited Nov. 20, 2012). 3Although we have provided specific questions to indicate our interests, we would greatly appreciate any information you can provide with regard to the topics raised here, including the use of informants, limitations on investigation activity due to civil liberties concerns, and the FBI's efforts to engage with communities regarding individuals identified as potential targets of prosecution. Moreover, we would be hap py to further clarify our interest or provide further information at your convenience. Thank you for your time.

Washington, D.C. 20530 February 25, 2013 Dear Ms. Monaco, Thank you for meeting with us recently regarding our project on human rights issues in federal civilian terrorism prosecutions, and for inviting us to request further information in writing regarding our specific questions and areas of interest in relation to the Department of Justice National Security Division's (NSD) role in prosecuting terrorism and terrorism-related offenses. We appreciate this opportunity to elaborate on our questions and topics of concern. As we explained in our meeting, our project is examining all aspects of federal terrorism prosecutions through the lens of international human rights law. We have prepared the following questions to pinpoint our specific interests, although we would welcome any additional information concerning the topics we raise. If you feel you are unable to answer our questions because the answers are classified, or for other reasons, we would appreciate if you would indicate so when stating that you are unable to respond. 1. Section 501.2 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to impose special administrative measures (SAMs) reasonably necessary to prevent disclosure of classified information, at the direction of the Attorney General. a. What Department of Justice divisions or offices are involved in the screening of individuals for potential SAMs, including newly indicted individuals or recently convicted individuals, and what is their division of responsibilities? b. What is the division of responsibilities between the Department of Justice NSD or other subdivisions, the Attorney General, U.S. Attorneys Offices, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Prisons in determining the SAMs restrictions set out in the origination memorandum , the modification of SAMs and the renewal of SAMs. 2. We are particularly concerned by reports that post-conviction inmates currently under SAMs are often held in 23-hour, single-cell housing without the opportunity to physically interact with other inmates . a. What factors does the Department of Justice consider in specifying, in a SAMs origination memorandum, that an inmate should not be allowed to share a cell with another inmate and that reasonable efforts should be made to prevent an inmate from communicating with any other inmates? b. Please confirm the number of individuals under post-conviction SAMs for whom the Department of Justice has directed these measures or other measures that are likely to result in periods of 23-hour single-cell housing ? 3. What, if any, role does the Department of Justice National Security Division have in providing advice or consultation for national security investigations involving the use of informants, which are conducted by the FBI or local law enforcement? What protoc ol or factors govern the NSD's involvement? In particular, does the NSD have a role in monitoring the behavior of informants involved in national security investigations? 2 Although we have provided specific questions to indicate our interests, we would greatly appreciate any information you can provide with regard to the topics raised here, including the use of informants, limitations on investigation activity due to civil liberties concerns , and the FBI's efforts to engage with communities regarding individuals identified as potential targets of prosecution. Moreover, we would be happy to further clarify our interest or provide further information at your convenience, whether in person or in writing. Thank you for your time.

Prasow Senior Counterterrorism Counsel, US Program Human Rights Watch Tarek Z. Ismail Counterterrorism & Human Rights Fellow, Human Rights Institute Columbia Law School 1 (05/23/2013) Human Rights Watch Questions to the National Security Division Question 1: Section 501.2 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to impose special administrative measures (SAMs) reasonably necessary to prevent disclosure of classified information, at the direction of the Attorney General. What Department of Justice divisions or offices are involved in the screening of individuals for potential SAMs, including newly indicted individuals or recently convicted individuals, and what is their division of responsibilities? What is the division of responsibilities between the Department of Justice NSD or other subdivisions, the Attorney General, U.S. Attorneys Offices, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Prisons in determining the SAMs restrictions set out in the origination memorandum, the modification of SAMs and the renewal of SAMs. Justice Department Response: Under Section 501.2 of Title 28 of the C FR, the Attorney General may authorize the Director of the Burea u of Prisons (BOP) to impose special administrative measures (SAMs) reasonably necessary to prevent disclosure of classified information. Special measures to prevent the disclosure of classified in formation may only be implemented upon written certification to the Attorney General by the head of a member agency of the U.S. intelligence community that the unauthorized disclosure of such information would pose a threat to national security, and that there is a danger that the inmate will disclose such information. Under this section, only the Attorney General can direct the BOP to initiate SAMs with respect to an inmate. Separately, under Section 501.3 of Title 28 of the C FR, the Attorne y General may authorize the Director of BOP to implement SAMs upon written notification to BOP that there is substantial risk that a prisoner's communications or contacts with persons (whether inside or outside a BOP facility) could result in death or serious bodily injury to persons, or substantial damage to property that would entail the risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons. While authorizati on of SAMs must be by the Attorney General, in the case of SAMs relating to the prevention of violence or terrorism (Section 501.3), the actual notificati on to the BOP of the SAMs may, at the Attorney General's discretion, be made by the head of a federal law enforcement agency, or the head of a member agency of the intelligence community. The specific procedures that must be followed whenever a federal law enforcement agency (including a U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO)) or a member of the intelligence community believe s that SAMs are necessary under Section 501.3 are spelled out in the U.S. Attorneys Manual at: http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/24mcrm.htm All requests for SAMs are processed by the Office of Enforcement Operations (OEO) in the Justice Department's Criminal Division. Consultation with the National Security Division's 2 Counterterrorism Section is recommended prior to submission of a SAMs request to OEO in a terrorism or terrorism-related case. Question 2: We are particularly concerned by reports that post-conviction inmates currently under SAMs are often held in 23-hour, single-cell housing without the opportunity to physically interact with other inmates. What factors does the Department of Justice consider in specifying, in a SAMs origination memorandum, that an inmate should not be allowed to share a cell with another inmate and that reasonable efforts should be made to prevent an inmate from communicating with any other inmates? Please confirm the number of individuals under post-conviction SAMs for whom the Department of Justice has directed these measures or other measures that are likely to result in periods of 23-hour single-cell housing? Justice Department Response : Conditions of confinement for all persons in Bureau of Prisons (BOP) custody, including whether inma tes are held in single-cell housing or segregated from the general population, are set in accord ance with various BOP policies. All decisions to house an inmate in single-cell status, regardless of the institution where they are housed, are made on a case- by-case basis to ensure the safety and security of staff and inmates, or are necessitated by the requirements of a particular SAM. All inmates in single-cell status have daily interaction with staff including correctional officers, medical and religious staff. Any additional restrictions imposed pursuant to Section 501.3 of Title 28 do not affect the implementation of BOP policies unless specifically set forth in the memorandum from the Attorney General directing the implementation of SAMs. The B OP has the authority to take any other measures with respect to an inmate subject to SAMs deemed necessary to maintain the order, safety, security and discipline of any BOP institution. As stated above, under Section 501.3 of Title 28, the Attorney General may authorize the Director of BOP to implement SAMs upon written notification to BOP that there is substantial risk that a prisoner's communications or contacts with persons (whether inside or outside a BOP facility) could r esult in death or serious bodily injury to persons, or substantial damage to property that would entail the risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons . These SAMs ordinarily may include housing the inmate in administrative detention and/or limiting certain privileges, including, but not limited to, correspondence, visiting, interviews with representatives of the news media, and use of the telephone, as is reasonably necessary to protect persons against the risk of acts of vio lence or terrorism -- while still maintaining the inmate's attorney/client privilege. As of May 16, 2013, there were a total of 55 federal inmates under SAMs -- 31 of whom were terrorism-related inmates, 16 of whom were violent-crime related inmates, and 8 of whom were national sec urity inmates (such as espionage). The number of post-conviction SAMs restricting the inmate from c ommunicating with all other inmates is not readily available. 3 Question 3: What, if any, role does the Department of Justice National Security Division have in providing advice or consultation for national security investigations involving the use of informants, which are conducted by the FBI or local law enforcement? What proto col or factors govern the NSD's involvement? In particular, does the NSD have a role in monitoring the behavior of informants involved in national security investigations? Justice Department Response: The FBI maintains direct responsibility for the vetting, supervision and monitoring of its confidential human sources pursuant to established policies and procedures. The Justice Department's National Security Division and U.S. Attorney's Offices around the country necessarily consult with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies during national security investigations that utilize FBI confidential human sources or sources from other agencies and that may result in a federal criminal prosecution. hrw.org law.columbia.edu/human-rights-institute Federal agents and police escort James Cromitie (center) from the FBI's New York headquarters on May 21, 2009. In 2011, Cromitie and three other men were sentenced to 25 years in prison for an alleged plot to bomb two synagogues in the Bronx and shoot down planes at an Air National Guard base in Newburgh, New York. \u00a9 2009 Michael Appleton/The New York TimesSince September 11, 2001, the US government has prosecuted more than 500 people for alleged terrorism-related offenses in the United States. Many prosecutions have properly targeted individuals engaged in planning or financing terrorist acts under US law. However, in other cases, the individuals seem to have been targeted by US law enforcement because of their religious or ethnic background, and many appear to have engaged in unlawful activity only after the government started investigating them. In Illusion of Justice, Human Rights Watch and Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute examine 27 federal terrorism- related prosecutions against American Muslims since 2001 that raise serious human rights concerns. While the government maintains its actions are intended to prevent future attacks, in practice US law enforcement has effectively participated in developing and furthering terrorism plots. As a judge said in one case, the government \"came up with the crime, provided the means, and removed all relevant obstacles,\" and in the process, made a terrorist out of a man \"whose buffoonery is positively Shakespearean in scope.\" Other concerns include the use of overly broad material support charges, prosecutorial tactics that may violate fair trial rights, and disproportionately harsh conditions of confinement. US counterterrorism policies call for building strong relationships with American Muslim communities. Yet many of the practices employed are alienating those communities and diverting resources from other, more effective, ways of responding to the threat of terrorism. The US government should focus its resources on a rights-respecting approach to terrorism prosecutions, one that that protects security while strengthening the government's relationship with communities most affected by abusive counterter- rorism policies.ILLUSION OF JUSTICE Human Rights Abuses in US Terrorism Prosecutions "}
