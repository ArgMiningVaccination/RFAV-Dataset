This teaches the immune system to recognize and produce antibodies against the virus. Both mRNA vaccines also include inactive ingredients, like lipids, salts and other components that keep the vaccine stable. Another vaccine authorized in the U.S. is the Janssen vaccine, also known as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which uses a harmless version of a different virus to deliver instructions to cells to trigger an immune response. The adenovirus used in the vaccine cannot Active ingredients in FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech Messenger RNA Moderna Messenger RNA Johnson & Johnson Adenovirus type 26 Novavax Coronavirus spike proteins harvested from moth cells plus an adjuvant made from tree bark\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 4 cause illness. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine contains lipids, salts and certain stabilizing agents. A fourth vaccine, made by Novavax, contains coronavirus spike proteins, which were made using moth cells. The Novavax vaccine also has an adjuvant, which boosts the immune response. None of the four vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19, and none of them contain eggs, gelatin, latex or preservatives. Below, you will find a detailed explanation of the ingredients in all four vaccines. There is also a table containing the ingredients for quick access.

VIEW TABLE OF CONTENTS\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 10 \"I've heard the vaccines can cause potentially lethal blood clots. Is that true?\" The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is available only to people aged 18 years or older \"for whom other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate\" or \"who elect to receive the [vaccine] because they would otherwise not receive a COVID-19 vaccine,\" according to the FDA. The FDA made this decision because the vaccine has resulted in very rare cases of blood clots with a low platelet count, called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. These blood clots have not been seen with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines. The occurrence of TTS, although rare, can result in severe illness requiring ICU care and sometimes even result in death. Women are likely to be at higher risk for TTS. Because the United States has enough supply of mRNA vaccines, the CDC recommends using them over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. However, having any vaccine is better than having no vaccine, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can still be used if there is another reason why you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. Please consult your doctor for further advice. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination far exceed any potential harm associated with their use, and it is strongly encouraged for your own benefit and that of your family and community.\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 11 It is important to note that the risk of death from COVID-19 is 1%, whereas the risk of death from TTS is significantly lower. FURTHER EXPLANATION COVID-19 vaccines are widely believed to be the most effective solution against the pandemic. Vaccines have been available to the American public since December 2020. There are broadly two types of vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. The first type includes the novel messenger RNA vaccines \u2014 specifically the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The other type is a conventional vector- based vaccine, known as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Health authorities pay very close attention to the safety of these vaccines. A rare adverse reaction seen in people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS), a condition that presents as blood clots with a low platelet count. It is seen in people of all genders and ages but primarily affects women. As of March 18, 2022, the FDA and CDC have identified 60 confirmed cases and nine reported deaths resulting from TTS after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had been administered. TTS is generally seen 1 to 4 weeks after vaccination. People with TTS can develop headache, leg swelling, chest pain, abdominal pain, bruising and bleeding, among other symptoms, and they may require a high level of care in the ICU. Approximately 15% to 20% percent of those who develop TTS may die. The CDC recommends that people receive mRNA vaccines instead of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because of the risk for TTS, which although rare is quite significant in terms of the severity of illness, and because mRNA vaccines have proven more effective. \u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 12 However, the risk of dying from COVID-19 is about 1%, whereas the risk of dying from a blood clot after vaccination with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is significantly lower. The risk of developing TTS is rare: 3.23 per million doses given. The rate of reported TTS deaths is 0.48 per 1 million doses of the vaccine administered. Therefore, any vaccine is better than having no vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine can still be used if mRNA vaccines are unavailable or contraindicated. Please consult your doctor for further advice.

Is that true? What happens to my protection against the virus then?\" It is true that even fully vaccinated people can get COVID-19. This is what is called a \"breakthrough infection.\" No vaccine can give us 100% protection. While this may sound concerning, breakthrough infections in vaccinated people often cause asymptomatic or mild infections. Breakthrough infections are less likely to lead to serious illness and hospitalization. The goal of immunization is to protect against serious illness, hospitalization and death. A booster dose may help decrease the frequency and severity of breakthrough infections. FURTHER EXPLANATION \"Breakthrough infections\" are infections that occur in fully immunized individuals. This is likely due to the body not mounting an adequate immune response to the virus or immunity waning over time following vaccination. No vaccine is absolutely effective in preventing infection. However, fully immunized individuals are significantly less likely to become infected, and the illness is often asymptomatic or mild. \u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 15 Immunized individuals are protected against serious illness, hospitalization and death, which is the goal of immunization. Breakthrough infections can be prevented or further reduced by the administration of a booster dose of vaccine. The chances of breakthrough infections in immunocompromised patients could be higher and their severity of illness may be greater. Therefore, immunocompromised individuals should continue to wear masks, maintain social distancing and use other precautions until advised by their doctor. Immunocompromised individuals may also require additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines. There is also emerging evidence that breakthrough infections in fully immunized individuals can generate a highly amplified robust immune response, which can be effective against emerging Rates of Covid-19 Cases by Vaccination Status April 4 - January 22, 2022 (29 U.S. jurisdictions) 3K 2K 1K 0KIncidence per 100,000 population May 2021 Jul 2021 Sep 2021 Nov 2021 Jan 2022Unvaccinated Vaccinated with at least a primary series Data source: CDC\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 16 variants as well.

VIEW TABLE OF CONTENTS\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 17 \"Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine after a natural infection? Is it safe? Is it necessary?\" Yes, people can get a vaccine after becoming infected. COVID-19 vaccinations are highly effective and safe, according to the CDC. It is common for individuals to have a natural infection and then get a vaccine. The CDC says there is no change in the timing of vaccination when a person is naturally infected. In fact, the immunity gained through vaccination is much more robust, long lasting and highly protective compared with natural infection in someone who did not get vaccinated. A reinfection after a natural infection is much more likely to lead to hospitalization if an individual is not vaccinated against COVID-19. Benefits of COVID-19 vaccination following natural infection: /arrow-right Studies show that getting a COVID-19 vaccine after you recover from COVID-19 provides added protection to your immune system. /arrow-right Vaccines are a safe way to keep you from getting and spreading COVID-19 a second time. COVID-19 vaccination also helps protect you from serious illness if you get sick again.\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 18 FURTHER EXPLANATION Vaccination after natural infection is encouraged by medical scientists and the CDC. People with COVID-19 can complete the quarantine period for the natural infection and subsequently can get immunized by any of the FDA-authorized vaccines (mRNA vaccines are favored by CDC) with no change in the vaccine schedule \u2014 meaning, they get the same number of vaccine doses that uninfected individuals get, and the timing of the doses does not differ. If a naturally infected individual was given convalescent plasma or any antibody infusion to treat COVID-19, they can be vaccinated at any time, according to the CDC. It has been shown that reinfection was much more likely \u2014 by about 5 times \u2014 in unvaccinated individuals with prior natural infection who did not get vaccinated compared with individuals who were infected and then vaccinated. Vaccination after natural infection helps stimulate high antibody levels that effectively neutralize the virus during a reinfection. That immunity is long lasting, likely effective against variants, associated with a lower risk for breakthrough infection or reinfection and results in a lower risk for hospitalization and subsequent complications. Prevention of reinfection also protects family members. Hence, vaccination is highly encouraged for people who were naturally infected. Vaccination after natural infection provides long-lasting protection.\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine REFERENCES: Abu-Raddad Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2021;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm7032e1.

Is that true?\" For most people, COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be safe. For very few patients, the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been found to cause inflammation of the heart muscle called the myocardium. However, the virus that causes COVID-19 has also been found to affect the myocardium \u2014 and much more frequently and severely than vaccines. WHAT ARE MY CHANCES OF GETTING MYOCARDITIS WITH VACCINES? The incidence of vaccine-related myocarditis is EXTREMELY LOW \u2014 one in 200,000. But the incidence of infection-related myocarditis is considerably higher than the vaccine (1,000 to 1,400 per 100,000 people). Getting vaccinated can save you from hospitalization, ICU admission and the need for a ventilator.\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 21 Myocarditis risk, put into perspective: Odds of getting struck by lighting in your lifetime: Odds of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis:1 in 15,300 1 in 200,000 HOW DO I KNOW THAT I'M EXPERIENCING MYOCARDITIS? Generally, people with myocarditis experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or a pounding heart. Myocarditis caused by COVID-19 is more dangerous because the symptoms are highly variable, ranging from fatigue and chest pain to heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, and sudden death. The risk for hospitalization is 10 times higher with myocarditis caused by COVID-19 compared with vaccine-induced myocarditis, and it is 1.8 to 5.6 times more severe than the vaccine-induced myocarditis seen in teens \u2014 a high-risk group (see Table). But if by chance you develop vaccine-induced myocarditis, you will likely experience only mild symptoms, and hospitalization will be shorter and full recovery is expected.\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 22 Breakdown of myocarditis caused by the virus vs. vaccines Infection-induced myocarditis Vaccine-induced myocarditis Incidence 1,000 to 1,400 per 100,000 people 1 in 200,000 Symptoms Highly variable, ranging from fatigue and chest pain to heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, and sudden deathMild symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fast beating (or pounding) heart Hospitalization risk 10 times higher risk for hospitalization compared with vaccine-related myocarditisRisk for hospitalization is 1 in 10 compared with an infection, and even with those low odds, the length of hospitalization is only an average of 3.9 days Severity of condition 1.8 to 5.6 times more severe than vaccine- related myocarditis seen in those at high risk* ICU admission and ventilator support May need to stay in the hospital for weeks and often in an ICU At ICU admission, 87.3% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilationA single dose of vaccine was 45% effective at preventing ICU admission, and two doses was 96% effective Mortality rate 18.5% 1.1% Recovery Patients have delayed recovery or may not fully recover at allMost people recover fully with rest Risk for heart complications2 to 6 times the risk among teen boys (ages 12 to 17 years) and 7 to 8 times the risk in young men (ages 18 to 29 years) compared with vaccine-induced myocarditis *High risk group includes those aged 12 to 17 years, following their second dose of vaccine.\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 23 The reported mortality rate for vaccine-induced myocarditis is 1.1%. But the mortality rate for COVID-19-induced myocarditis is 18.5%. Hence, the virus is more likely to cause death compared with the vaccine. The reported mortality rate for vaccine-induced myocarditis is 1.1%. But the mortality rate for COVID-19-induced myocarditis is 18.5%. Hence, the virus is more likely to cause death compared with the vaccine. \"I'd much rather have a vaccine than have this virus.\"Paul A. Volberding, MD Infectious diseases specialist Professor emeritus of medicine University of California, San Francisco COVID-19 illness can cause severe complications, long-term health problems, hospitalization and even death. This far outweighs the potential risks of having a rare adverse reaction to vaccination. I HAVE A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY. SHOULD HE GET THE VACCINE? Yes, he should most certainly get the vaccine, because teen boys (ages 12 to 17 years) had two to six times the increased risk for heart complications after infection compared with teen boys who were vaccinated. And the risk for heart complications after infection is seven to eight times higher in young men (ages 18 to 29 years). In males aged 12 to 29 years, the chance of getting vaccine-induced myocarditis is one in 14,000.\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 24 Because the risks and benefits of getting the vaccine are clear, males aged 12 to 29 years should definitely get the vaccine. HOW DO I GET TREATED FOR MYOCARDITIS? Myocarditis generally improves on its own or with treatment. Normally, people with mild myocarditis may only need rest with medication. People with severe disease may need lifelong medication. WHY DIDN'T THE TESTING OF THE COVID-19 VACCINES SHOW A RISK OF MYOCARDITIS? Tens of thousands of people participated in the clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines. Even though the studies were among the largest vaccine trials in history, they were not large enough to detect very rare complications like myocarditis that occur only a few times per million vaccinations.

VIEW TABLE OF CONTENTS\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 26 Is COVID-19 vaccination safe during pregnancy? Yes, the vaccine is safe for pregnant and breastfeeding people, and it is safe for those who are trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future. Vaccination during pregnancy can also help protect babies against COVID-19 by passing antibodies from the mother to the baby. Vaccinated mothers had lower odds of severe or critical COVID-19 compared with unvaccinated mothers (0.07% vs 0.68%, adjusted OR = 0.08, 95% CI 0.004-0.4). Key takeaways of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy: 1 2 3 Safe for mothers and newbornsMothers pass antibodies to infantsInfants retain antibodies at 6 months I'M PREGNANT BUT I'M SAFE AT HOME. WHY SHOULD I GET THE VACCINE? If you contract COVID-19, you are more likely to get sick than those who are not pregnant, and you may be at an increased risk for complications that can affect your pregnancy and the developing \u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 27 baby. You may also require hospitalization, admission to an ICU, or the use of a ventilator or special equipment to breathe. With severe COVID-19 illness, there is also a possibility of death. Additionally, there is an increased risk for delivering a preterm or stillborn infant. The baby also has an increased risk of admission to the hospital newborn care unit. I AM PLANNING TO GET PREGNANT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. WILL I HAVE FERTILITY PROBLEMS IF I RECEIVE THE VACCINE? No, COVID-19 vaccines are not associated with fertility problems in women or men. Additionally, there is no increased risk for miscarriage among pregnant people after vaccination. WILL I GET COVID-19 BECAUSE OF THE SHOT? No, the COVID-19 vaccines cannot cause COVID-19. None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain a live virus. I AM DUE IN 2 WEEKS. IF I RECEIVE THE VACCINE, CAN I HAVE BLEEDING ISSUES DUE TO THE VACCINE? No, COVID-19 vaccines are not associated with an increased risk for pregnancy complications, including excessive maternal blood loss after birth, preterm birth and stillbirth. \u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 28 WILL MY BABY BE AFFECTED BY THE COVID-19 VACCINE? WILL MY BABY DEVELOP CONGENITAL ANOMALIES DUE TO THE VACCINATION? There are no safety concerns for babies born to people vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccination during pregnancy reduces the risk for preterm birth and stillbirth and also protects the baby by passing COVID-19 antibodies to the baby. WHICH COVID-19 VACCINE SHOULD PREGNANT PEOPLE RECEIVE? You can choose to get either a messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech) or a Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. I AM BREASTFEEDING CURRENTL Y. SHOULD I RECEIVE THE COVID-19 VACCINE? Yes, breastfeeding mothers should receive the vaccine. There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful to the breastfeeding mother or the infant. I AM GETTING THE VACCINE NEXT WEEK. SHOULD I STOP BREASTFEEDING FOR A WHILE? Women should not stop breastfeeding in order to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\u00a9 Healio 2023 / Building Confidence: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion Guide 29 I HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST DOSE OF THE VACCINE, AND I RECENTL Y FOUND OUT I AM PREGNANT . WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW? If you find out that you are pregnant after being partially vaccinated (between doses), you are strongly advised to have your second dose 8 weeks after your first dose, and your booster 3 months after your second dose. I AM UNDERGOING IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF) TREATMENT . SHOULD I RECEIVE THE COVID-19 VACCINE? Yes, you can receive a COVID-19 vaccine during IVF treatment. It is also recommended to separate your vaccination dates by a few days from some treatment procedures (such as egg collection and embryo transfer in IVF) to identify any symptoms more easily \u2014 such as fever \u2014 and determine if they are related to the vaccine or the procedure.
