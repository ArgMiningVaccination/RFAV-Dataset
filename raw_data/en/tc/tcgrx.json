{"title": "Ayurgenomics in Anti-Viral Therapy: A Literature Synthesis", "author": "Shadma H Quazi; Swanand S Pathak", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "This review focuses on Ayurgenomics (AG) used in antiviral therapy. According to Ayurveda, three doshas govern Prakriti, the natural organizational structure of humans. AG is a new field in modern medicine that focuses on establishing individualized self-care. It is a modern therapeutic and preventive method that enhances a person's mental and physical well-being. Due to the threat of emerging lethal viruses and the significant role of Ayurveda in the pandemic, modern genetics studies have emerged. Prakriti, an Ayurvedic notion that AG incorporates, correlated with three doshas (phenotypes) called vata, pitta, and kapha. Each Prakriti individual had a specific balance for each dosha. To date, the most recent field of AG, which aims to characterize Prakriti types in terms of current genetics and physiology, has provided the best definition. Four databases were searched for studies on this topic using the keywords \"Ayurgenomics\" and \"Anti-Viral Therapy.\" Four articles that demonstrated a favorable approach for the application of AG were gathered for synthesis. According to this study, employing Adhatoda Vasica and Cissampelos pareira L extracts improved the viral structure of the SAR-CoV-2 virus. Further studies involving human participants are required to rule out the positive effects of AG in real-world contexts.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-02-05", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
