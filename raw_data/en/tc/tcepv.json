It will come as no surprise to you to hear that the final couple of months of our reporting period were dominated by the coronavirus pandemic response and mobilising our staff and services to meet this unprecedented situation. It has been a huge team effort and we are immensely proud of, and grateful to, all our colleagues across Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust who have played such a vital role in minimising the impact of the virus on our local communities and protecting the most vulnerable, while often being on the frontline themselves. The spontaneous outpouring of public gratitude for the NHS - including the Thursday clap for carers - was truly amazing and well deserved recognition for the health service's key workers a t a most challenging time. At the time of writing we are beginning to see beyond the crisis response and to restore more services for patients, which is heartening. Up until February 2020 we were focused on our routine \"business as usual\" objectives of providing the best possible community health services to patients in Derby and Derbyshire, and had celebrated the organisation's rating of outstanding overall by the Care Quality Commission in September 2019. This report, produced in line with the NHS' statutory reporting requirements, shows our progress for the whole of 2019/20, including the 10 months before the pandemic overshadowed life for all of us. We are pleased to be able to share it with you as a record of a challenging but successful year at Derbys hire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust. Tracy Allen Prem Singh Chief Executive Chairman Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 7 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Performance report Overview The purpose of the overview is to give the user a short summary that provides them with sufficient information to understand the organisation, its purpose, the key risks to the achievement of its objectives and how it has performed during the year. A brief history and statutory background of the organisation Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust is one of the largest providers of specialist community health services in the country , providing in the region of 4,000 patient contacts each day and serving a population of over one million people in Derbyshire and Derby . We have operated as a standalone NHS organisation since April 2011 and we became a fully -fledged foundation trust on 1 November 2014. During 2019/20: We were rated outstanding overall by the Care Quality Commission following a well-led inspection in September 2019. More details in the Directors report under the heading Ensuring services are well led We remained compliant with all our financial obligations We maintain ed our place in segment 1 of NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework , achieving the highest level of autonomy for our performance. A statement Tracy Allen, chief executive, providing her perspective on the performance of the trust over the year Last year I opened this statement reflecting on one of the most difficult years on record for the NHS. 2019/20 has matched it and of course ended with the global Covid -19 pandemic posing an enormous challenge for the NHS and our society as a whole. We ended the year playing our part in the national NHS response to the pandemic, adapting quickly to the new clinical issues and challenges it posed for us locally in Derbyshire. We temporarily stopped some of our non- critical services while adapting others, in line with a nationally -determined prioritisation framework. Our brilliant a nd flexible colleagues volunteered to work in new and unfamiliar areas, using their skills and experience in different ways to support our most pressured services. We Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 8 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 significantly increased our cleaning, driving and personal protective equipment (PPE) logistical capacity, and we welcomed the support of local volunteers. We very rapidly implemented new ways of working, making use of all available technology to deliver virtual patient consultations and treatment wherever it was safe and appropriate. We engag ed with colleagues in new ways and supported them to connect with each another remotely, given the unprecedented 'Stay home, Protect the NHS, Save lives' and social distancing guidance from the Government. We bolstered our staff welfare and wellbeing offer , doing all we could to look after our front-line colleagues so they could focus on delivering expert patient care. Our corporate services were equipped to deliver their essential support functions from home. Indeed, each and every one of us at Team DCHS played a vital role, maintaining our essential services while doing all we could to keep ourselves, our families and our communities safe and well. A colleague of mine coined the phrase 'physical distancing' as opposed to social distancing. This really str uck a chord with me at a time when the number of people falling ill continued to rise and our loved ones, neighbours and work colleagues were affected. The phrase highlighted the importance of maintaining social connection for our collective emotional well being during an unparalleled period in our lives. 2019/20 was a big year for us in many other ways too. Ordinarily I would have opened this update with the wonderful news that, following a summer 2019 inspection, the Care Quality Commission rated DCHS as Outstanding overall. We showed our credentials then - and we continue to do so today. You can read more about the inspection in the directors' report in this document . We also met all of our financial performance obligations and commitments while consistently performing well against targets across the board. Our 'segment one' provider status was maintained, allowing us maximum autonomy and the lowest level of oversight from regulators. The financial and contracting climate we're now operating it is very different to previous years, with nationally -agreed contracts rather than locally - agreed frameworks between commissioners and providers. We've progressed our major capital estate projects in the towns of Belper, Bakewell and Buxton, with the aim of securing state -of-the-art healthcare facilities for future generations. We continued to have a strong focus on quality improvement, with our clinical assessment and accreditation scheme going from strength to strength with many more teams achieving and retaining their 'Quality Always gold' accreditation. More than 80% of staff received their flu vaccination this year, and through a 'jab for a jab' partnership with Unicef we also managed to sponsor more than 10,000 life- saving vaccines in the developing world. We are proud that 97.8% of our patients would recommend our services to their friends and family. The annual staff survey results were published once again in February, with 62.4% of the trust taking the time to reflect on life at DCHS. 85.5% of those colleagues said Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 9 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 they would recommend our care to their friends and family (national average 78.3%), while 65.3% would recommend DCHS as a place to work (national average 59.4%). Overall we scored better than the previous year in nine of the eleven measures and rema ined the same in the other two. I was particularly pleased to see great improvements in areas where we has really focused our efforts, such as staff wellbeing and bullying and harassment. We are fully committed to continuing to improve the experience of ev eryone working for DCHS. I'm writing this statement as we move beyond the first so- called 'peak' of the Covid - 19 pandemic, and begin to look ahead to our recovery and restoration plans as part of the next phase. We are by no means 'back to normal'; the thr eat of Covid -19 remains very real and promises to be with us for many months and possibly years to come. Instead we are looking at a 'new normal', learning from our response and using it as an opportunity to reset some of our thinking on the delivery of care and services for local people. This important work is being done jointly with our partners as part of a coordinated Derbyshire health and social care system response. Collectively, as part of 'Joined Up Care Derbyshire', we are focused on building on the transformation and innovation colleagues have led, recognising the long term impact of Covid- 19 on our communities, increasing health inequalities and the need to reshape and refocus our plans and priorities to address these challenges with the people we serve. I am incredibly proud of what my colleagues have achieved in 2019/20 and have responded to Covid- 19, but I am not at all surprised. What each and every one of them delivers every day for the people of Derby and Derbyshire is nothing short of amazing. They truly are the embodiment of the 'DCHS Way' and their energy, compassion and commitment will ensure that we are able to play a major role in restoring, recovering and re- setting the NHS locally and supporting the great communities we're part of with the challenges ahead. Signed Tracy Allen Chief Executive A statement on the purpose and activities of the organisation Our purpose is to provide community health services to a patient population of over one million people in Derbyshire and Derby. These services are organised and managed across three di visions: integrated community services, planned care & Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 10 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 specialist services, and health, wellbeing and inclusion. Details of the services we provided are included on our website: www.dchs.nhs.uk . We employ around 4,200 staff, caring for patients in 11 community hospitals and more than 30 health centres, as well as in clinics, GP practices, schools, care homes and, increasingly, in people's own homes. Brief description of the business model and environment Health and social care organisations in Derbyshire have been working closely together for some time, to improve care and services for people and make them as efficient and effective as possible . We are fully aligned to this business model and environment, developing services which promote a system -level approach as part of Joined Up Care Derbyshire's sustainability and transformation partnership. You can find more details here: https://joinedupcarederbyshire.co.uk/ Objectives and strategies In May 2019 we refreshed our organisational strategy, known as our Quadruple Aim , to: improve the health of the population enhance the experience and outcomes of the patient improve staff experience reduce the per capita cost of care for the benefit of communities. This has followed on from work on our clinical strategy, first developed in 2016, which developed the ' Triple Aim' as a vision of : 'simultaneously improving the health of the population, enhancing the experience and outcomes of the patient, and reducing th e per capita cost of care for the benefit of communities'. Since then there have been significant changes at both national and local level, including: The publication of the NHS Long Term Plan in January 2019 which sets out the priorities for healthcare ov er the next 10 years along with the implementation of Primary Care Networks and the move towards Integrated Care Systems and regulation at a system level Changes to our portfolio of services Development of clinical supporting and enabling strategies including frailty, people, leadership and management, informatics The development of the Quality Conversations approaches and the creation of the Quality Improvement Faculty. Development of closer system working and the adoption of the 'Triple Aim' approach wi thin the Joined Up Care Derbyshire Clinical Strategy. Community services are at the heart of the local and national long term plans for the NHS. Here at D erbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust we have a role to play in supporting the delivery of the majority of Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 11 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 priority areas identified within the NHS Long Term Plan, either directly or indirectly, working with our partners in the health and social care system locally. It therefore seemed timely to revisit and refresh our organisation's overarching clinical strategy, reflecting on these challenges and the important roles all colleagues play in continuing to transform the care we deliver. Good progress had been made in delivering our Triple Aim and we know these achievements, including our journey to becoming an 'Outstanding' organisation has been directly dependent upon our workforce and we wanted to recognise this contribution within our strategy. Our refreshed strategy has been developed with the input of colleagues across the organisation. Engagement sessions held across the county provided the opportunity to talk to colleagues, to hear their views and understand what really matters to them. Our refreshed strategy has been developed to reflect our commitment to all our col leagues as we focus on improving the experience of work, including improving our approach to the way we support colleagues experiencing change and ensuring that all colleagues feel motivated, valued and able to influence the hi gh quality care and services they deliver as we shape our future together. This is now our Quadruple Aim. Our operational planning for 2019/20 detailed our approach to delivering year one our refreshed Clinical Strategy. Financial performance Despite the current financial difficulties facing the NHS and economy as a whole, we have ultimately performed well during 2019/20. We made a net surplus of \u00a34,033m which was in exces s of our original plan of \u00a33.878 m by \u00a30. 155m. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, we incurred additional revenue costs in relation to its operational response during March 2020. In line with the national commitment, these costs were fully reimbursed to us and therefore did not impact on our financial performance in 2019/20. The table below details the Trust's key areas of financial performance for the year : 2019/20 Performance \u00a3'000 plan \u00a3'000 achieved Surplus 3,154 3,309 tax, depreciation and amortisation 10,776 10,624 Cash balance at period end payment practice code 95.0% 97.6% Our Quadruple Aim 'Simultaneously improving the health of the population, enhancing the experience and outcomes of the patient, reducing the per capita cost of care for the benefit of communities and improving staff experience' Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 12 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Target is to pay 95% of all non -NHS creditors within 30 days of the receipt of goods or a valid invoice (whichever is later) unless other payment terms have been agreed. EBITDA is a way of representing how much of our operating income exceeds our operat ing costs. Our EBITDA for 2019/20 was \u00a310. 624m which equates to 5.6%. This measure demonstrates sound financial health and the efficient use of our resources. The next table details our financial performance and over-achievement on the control total set by NHS Improvement. \u00a3'000s Surplus for the year 3,309 Less gains on transfers by absorption -125 Less impact of donated income -141 Add back impairments charged to I&E 990 Adjusted Surplus for the year 4,033 Control Total 3,878 Performance Against Control Total 155 The year -end surplus figure includes Provider Sustainability Fund (PSF) of \u00a32,046m. This is funding that is given to Trusts who agree to their control total and deliver on financial performance. In 2019/20 the Trust had a control total of a surplus of \u00a31,832m excluding PSF. Removing the impact of PSF funding from the Trust's reported surplus demonstrates that the Trust has over -performed against its control total by \u00a30.15m as shown in the table below. \u00a3'000s Adjusted Surplus for the year 4,033 Less PSF funding -2,046 Adjusted Surplus for the year excluding PSF 1,987 Control Total exc luding PSF 1,832 Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 13 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Performance Against Control Total excluding PSF 155 Capital expenditure Our capital expenditure for 2019/20 was \u00a36.8m against a capital plan of \u00a38.4m . The \u00a31.6m we did not utilise on expected capital spending related to deferment of Bakewell, Belper, Buxton and Walton site development s. The most significant schemes we undertook were the purchase of Belper Clinic and continued investment in our IM&T infrastructure. The table summarises our capital expenditure for 2019/20.

A total of \u00a34.2m of the \u00a35.6m are recurrent savings. The savi ngs were required to deliver a 1.14% national efficiency requirement for commissioners and to cover local cost pressures . A summary of our ma in savings delivered during 2019/20 is shown below: Service Area \u00a3m Corporate and e state 2.92 Health, wellbeing & i nclusion 1.17 Planned care and o utpatients 0.44 Integrated community based s ervice s 0.77 Other 0.28 Total 5.58 Key opportunities and risks Future financial performance As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, temporary funding arrangements have been introduced for NHS organisations, initially for a four month period up until the end of July 2020. The Board of Directors has approved an interim financial plan in response to this which sets out to deliver a revenue surplus of \u00a32.23m supported by a requirement to deliver efficiency savings of \u00a35.1m. Successful delivery of this plan will achieve the maximum Use of Resources rating of 1 against which we will be assessed as an NHS foundation trust. Covid -19 response and digital transformation The Covid -19 pandemic accelerated a number of changes, including digital solutions, we had already planned. As we move to reinstate as many services as possible, we continue to support new ways of working, to ensure they are Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 15 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 appropriate, effective and offer the safest alternative to staff and patients in line with the aspirations we had already set out for the coming year. In response to the pandemic, command centres were quickly set up to manage staff and resources like personal protective equipment (PPE ) and to support teams to work in different ways. These command centres themselves then had to work 'differently' and quickly took advantage of technology like Microsoft Teams to undertake remote meetings and support staff. Our health and wellbeing team set up support and counselling sessions by phone and online and new communication channels were created so staff could get up- to-date information easily as the situation changed. Additionally the transformation team facilitated operational teams to support each other using online and mobile apps. Our IT and procurement teams reacted swiftly to make sure we had access to laptops, headsets and phones for staff working remotely and a team of drivers was set up to move equipment and PPE around. Our services hav e started using online virtual consulting software wherever they can - led by what's needed by the patient or family. We are also redesigning referral processes and remote training for staff and for patients who undertake courses and attend education groups with us. The transformation team used their project management skills to manage increasing ward capacity and the associated resource requirements (equipment and staffing) to provide extra capacity. Another project that was supported was to implement the Covid -19 hospital discharge guidance at pace to be responsive and support flow to maintain capacity. Ongoing work is being undertaken to identify which measures are most effective and able to be sustained after the pandemic. Virtual visits/triage will be further explored for therapy services within integrated community services. Other changes over the last year include: Supporting our integrated community s ervice s to deliver a rapid r esponse workforce Review of clinical documentation to ensure recording and retrieving information is simple Supported the out -of-hours provider (D HU Health Care ) to transition onto SystmOne TPP, our core electronic patient record, improving efficiency and effectiveness of treatment in and out of hours Reduced the burden on general practice by undertaking wound dressings in our local clinics - we'll be adding 3D technology to this service soon The trial of body worn cameras in Derby community t eams is underway to reduce aggressive behaviour against staff The creation of a singl e point o f access to improve access for our families and other professionals in to our c hildren's services Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 16 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 The development and use of \"I'm on my way\" technology so that young families know when to expect us The implementation of an anonymous text service for children and young families to get in contact with us in June 2020 Exploring the use of robotic process automation to speed up triage processes The trial of voice recognition to support clinicians in musculoskeletal services to improve the patient pathway. Managing strategic risks Strategic risks are determined in line with the Trust Board and managed through our Board Assurance Framework, which is presented to the Quality Committees, Audit and Assurance Committee and the Board on a quarterly basis. By the end of 2019/20 the three main strategic risks on the Board Assurance Framework and our actions in relation to those risks were: A risk of national and local workforce supply shortages resulting in staff being unable to provide high quality, safe and effective care. Our workforce plan, outlined in the Staff Report section of this annual rep ort, gives details of how we have been addressing this in terms of being an employer of choice and aligning our offer to staff with the changing needs of local health care provision, and maps out future priorities and how we are taking action on those duri ng 2020/21. A risk to the financial stability of the organisation due to not meeting the future Sustainable Quality Improvement Programme and the potential loss of service contracts or decommissioning of services. We have a robust plan to achieve our financial obligations again in 2020/21, as we have in all previous years, while remaining responsive to emerging factors in the wider environment and across the health system. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, t emporary funding arrangements have been introduced for NHS organisations, initially for a four month period up until the end of July 2020. More details about this are included under the Future Financial Performance heading in this chapter. A risk that leaders may be unable to deliver the behavioural and competency aspirations contained within our Leadership Development Strategy due to the organisational and system -wide pressures. During 2019/20 we have further enhanced and embedded our leadership work t o equip our workforce to lead internally and across the system. We continue, through our workforce priorities for 2020/21, to strengthen and support good, compassionate and diverse leadership at all levels - managerial and clinical - to meet the complex pr actical, financial and cultural demands of the NHS Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 17 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Long Term Plan. More details are provided in the Staff Report section of this annual report. Brexit On the 31 January 2020 the UK officially left the European Union, beginning a period of transition until 31 December 2020. The NHS continues to prepare for any changes coming out of the Government's negotiations with the EU and will continue to monitor any associated risks, such as to supply chains or recruitment. We are managing these risks through our organisational business continuity plan to address any emerging uncertainties and to ensure that disruption to our patients and other stakeholders is kept to a minimum in relation to supply of goods, employment opportunities or retention of staff from overseas . We followed national guidance from the Department of Health and Social Care, preparing us for all eventualities. Operational plan for 2020/21 On 17 March 2020, Sir Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive, and Amanda Pritchard, NHS chief o perating officer, wrote to all NHS providers detail ing the important and urgent actions the NH S needed to take in response to Covid- 19 pandemic . These actions included measures to: 1. Free-up the maximum possible inpatient and critical care capacity 2. Prepare for, and respond to, the anticipated large numbers of Covid- 19 patients in need of respiratory support 3. Support staff and maximise their availability 4. Play our part in the wider population measures newly announced by Government 5. Stress -test operational readiness 6. Remove routine burdens, as to facilitate the above. Within this the measures included the decision to suspend the operational planning process for 2020/21. At the time these measures were introduced, the DCHS Operational Plan for 2020/21 was well developed as we continued to work to support the priorities within the NHS Long Term Plan and supporting our Joined Up Care Derbyshire partners. The world, and the N HS as we know it, all looks very different now and sadly coronavirus look s set to be us for some time to come. However, the ambitions identified within the NHS Long Term Plan i n January 2019, and within our clinical strategy still hold true. Throughout 20 20/21 we will move from reaction, through to restoration and recovery. As part of this journey we will take this opportunity to 'lock in' the beneficial changes that we and our partners have been able to deliver, such as enhanced system Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 18 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 working, and flexible and remote working , including the rapid increase in delivering consultations digitally. We will continue to adapt to this new world, supporting the people we care for and those close to them across all our services, ensuring that they continue to recei ve the care they need in a timely and safe way. We will work closely with our colleagues across the organisation, listening to and supporting them. We will continue to ensure that our colleagues within D erbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust have the equipment they need and that their wellbeing is our top priority. Before the impact of the Covid- 19 pandemic was felt, we had already identified a range of improvement programmes of work with clear outcomes that are aligned to our Quadruple Aim, i ncluding: Refreshing the DCHS Way - the way we do things around here - and making it right for the current and future environment People first - embedding a personalised leadership culture will support our leaders to have the confidence to do th e right thing for our people and to challenge the culture of the organisation through behaviour, not just process Clinical, professional and operational l eadership - reviewing our structures and roles to support leadership in an integrated system and a culture of shared governance and leadership System working across boundaries - ensuring we unders tand the system organisational groupings and that we are able to cont ribute effectively to the improvement of high quality healthc are delivery in Derbyshire and Derby Data and information - Advancing the use of data to drive improvement and intelligent decision -making - ensuring all data and information we receive, generate, require and report is value adding to the purpose of continuous quality improvement, relevant assurance and delivering the Quadruple Aim Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 19 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 From governance for assurance to governance for improvement and empowerment - ensuring quality assurance and qualit y improvement drive us forward and manage and mitigate our risks . As a Joined Up Care Derbyshire partner we remain committed to ensuring that we work together to improve population health outcomes for the people and communities we serve as we work to del iver our collective vision to enable people to have the best start in life, to stay well, age well and die well. Our work in 2020/21 will be different from previous years as we respond to the very unusual, challenging and changing circumstances we are all facing. However, our ambitions and priorities remain consistent with those of our strategy : improving the health of the population, enhancing experience and outcomes, reducing the per capita cost of care and improving the experience of work for everyone working within our trust at this challenging time , as we recognise the hard work and sacrifices people are making to ensuring D erbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust and the NHS remains 'open for business'. Service developments Musculoskeletal clinical assessment and treatment service The musculoskeletal (MSK) clinical assessment and treatment service provides a specialist clinical review of referrals for MSK conditions and supports improved health outcomes. Patients were often being referred to acute hospital outpatients (secondary care) despite evidence suggesting some could be more appropriately cared for in the community. The service is delivered by highly skilled advanced physiotherapy practitioners who can assess and treat a range of conditions, and ensure there are no delays where secondary care intervention is the best option. We've made good progress this year - comparing April to July 2019 to the comparable period the previous year: A reduction of 42% in the number of routine consultant outpatient appointments referred by GPs Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 20 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 A reduction of 40.8% in the number of outpatient procedures carried out A reduction of 22.9% in the number of injections carried out in secondary care A reduction of 22.9% in the number of day case procedures undertaken A reduction of 15% in the number of el ective procedures. Derbyshire wound care service People living longer with ever more complex long -term health problems, has resulted in an increase in the volume of chronic leg ulcers. A network of wound care hubs was established at sites across the count y to meet the increasing demand while delivering high quality outcomes for patients, including improved healing time. Formerly provided in general practice, this service is now run by specialist wound care nurses using our award- winning 'Time to Heal' prin ciples, improving both healing rates and patient experience. Wounds have a significant impact, both on the quality of life of those who have them as well as the health care system. The service operates seven days a week in clinically -appropriate settings, a number of which have been recently refurbished. Transport support is also available for patients who aren't able to make their own way to one of the hubs. Rapid response community nursing service We can report that our new rapid response community nursing service, initially piloted in Swadlincote and Derby, has now been rolled out across Derbyshire. As a listening organisation, we agreed to pilot the new model after the idea was initially suggested by our colleagues in community nursing. The aim was to improve caseload management and general day -to-day planning for 'core' (non- urgent) patients and build clinical capacity for those patients requiring urgent care, or a 'rapid response'. Colleagues have been through a significant training and development programme and have welcomed this new way of working. Integration project in Derby receives national recognition A partnership project with social care staff to support patients in Derby was recognised at the prestigious HSJ Awards in November, as finalists in the health and local government partnership award. Judges said that the project, known as the 'Derby City Road to Integration', was chosen \"based on its ambition, visionary spirit and the demonstrabl y positive impact that this has had on patient experiences within the health and social care sector.\" Teams work in partnership to support patients identified as needing a range of therapy, home assessments and adaptations to maintain their independence and mobility at home or help them return home from hospital. Most of the patients cared for in this way are elderly. One Derby resident in her eighties said \"the physiotherapy was wonderful. I was having the therapy three times a day and it got me going. Now I'm back home and I'm slow but I can cope, and that's the main thing.\" Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 21 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 New facilities for integrated care We are leading service redevelopments in Belper, Buxton and Bakewell which give us huge opportunities as part of service redesign and investment in new facilities aligned to Joined Up Care Derbyshire's strategic aims of greater integration of care. In Belper, r evised plans for a \u00a310 million pound investment in Belper's community health services were unveiled in December 2019. Brand new state- of-the-art health facilities are to be built on the site of the current Belper Clinic, on part of the Babingt on Hospital site on Derby Road. Original plans were set to build on Derwent Street in the centre of town, but this was changed to build a larger building on the site of the existing Belper Clinic. We conducted a public engagement programme of events and other communications activity to ensure local people were well informed of the news. The revised scheme honours all the promises made to local people in the engagement process of 2018 to develop services fit for the 21st century in a sustainable way and in line with the ambitions set out in Joined Up Care Derbyshire to replace out -dated facilities at Babington Hospital. Full background information can be accessed on our website here: https://www.dchs.nhs.uk/home/our - services/service_development In Buxton, the outl ine business case for a proposed new health and community public services hub was nearing completion as the Covid- 19 pandemic hit. The outline business case is a vital step in a project of this scale, in evaluating the benefits and costs for the scheme. We purchased the chosen plot, a 3.5 acre site at the former Buxton Water plant, in January 2018 and outline planning consent for the community hub has already been granted by High Peak Borough Council. The next step will be to share the outline business cas e with the senior teams of all 11 organisations - from across the public, charitable and health sectors - which are currently considering the proposed new development. There is no central government funding for the building costs of the project which will require all the eventually confirmed organisations to contribute towards the costs. In Bakewell, we have purchased a plot which formed part of the Newholme Hospital site and we are working with E ast Midlands Ambulance Service partners to combine the site w e have purchased with the current ambulance s tation site to develop new state -of-the-art health facilities and ambulance service accommodation. Earl y designs have been drafted and by the end of 2019/20 we were working with Peak District National Park planning department prior to formerly submitting a full planning application. Capital funding of \u00a38.58m has been provisionally secured by way of Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 22 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 government STP wave 4 capital funding, pending the submission and approval of a full business case for the scheme. T he business case will be completed and submitted once we are clear regarding the planning requirements and the final design and cost schedule. In Langwith, the new \u00a31.1 million Langwith Medical Centre opened on 12 August 2019. It replaced an outdated surgery building with a much larger state- of-the-art facility which can accommodate a wider range of GP practice and primary care services for patients , so securing the provision of locally based services into the future . A summary of performance to the extent not already covered Performance against CQUINs 2019/20 A total of 1.25 % of our patient care income in 2019/20 was conditional on achieving the nationally and locally set CQUIN measures (Commissioning for Quality and Innovation) , as agreed between us and Derby and Derbyshire Clinical Commissioning Group. During 2019/20 we had four CQUINs, three set at a national level and one was agreed locally with the CCG: Flu vaccination of frontline staff Alcohol and tobacco screening and brief advice Three high impact actions to prevent inpatient falls Using personalised g oals in the treatment of patients within wound clinics (local) . The total contract value relating to these for 2019/20 was \u00a31,703,606 and an 80% financial outturn was agreed as part of the block contract for our Trust. A number of risk assessments were undertaken in relat ion to the achievement of CQUINs throughout 2019/20 and it was anticipated that some of the targets would be difficult to achieve fully due to the significant clinical pathwa y development required; this included the challenge of developing the necessary electronic patient record functionality to enable robust data reporting. However, as a result of continued focus we were able to progress significant ly against the milestones . Due to the impact of the Covid- 19 pandemic, all national and local CQUIN work was paused on 17 March 2020; this halted a number of audit activities being undertaken to collect quarter four data for some of the CQUIN indicators. Further national guidance published on 23 March 2020 advised all Trusts to base the final position for CQUINs on the data available and this has therefore been taken from the quarter three position. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 23 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 The 2019/ 20 flu campaign 'Spread Love Not Flu' was launched which involved sponsoring U NICEF to vaccinate three children for every member of staff who had the flu immunisation. In addition improvements were put in place as to the way s in which staff provided consent, and to the process of booking vaccinations. As a result we achieved 80.7% of frontline staff being vaccinated against the national target of 80% which was a significant improvement over previous years. Performance against the alcohol and t obacco CQ UIN saw achievement across all three indicators throughout the year, with s taff undertaking screening of inpatient for alcohol and tobacco use, and providing brief advice and onward referral where appropriate. Performance against the prevention of f alls CQUIN improved continually throughout the year, with inpatient clinical teams introducing the measuring and recording of blood pressure , taken when patients were both lying and standing, as standard practice on admission to inpatient wards. The introduction of changes to SystmOne enabled advanced care practitioners and pharmac ists to record rationale against specific medications which can lead to an increased risk of falls. Our specialist f alls team also supported pathway and patient record changes which help patients receive a mobility assessment and provision of a mobility ai d within 24 hours of admission to the ward. In line with the wider national focus on personalisation, colleagues in our wound care clinics w ere supported to discuss, and record personalised goals with patients within SystmOne, in relat ion to their wound care and treatment. A detailed review of the clinical care provided was undertaken and shared with clinic staff to support improved compliance with wound assessments. Clinical accreditation A clinical care assessment accreditation system , known as Quality Always, was first introduced in late 2014 and the process is supported by the DCHS Quality Assurance Framework, which consists of self -assessment and peer review, leadership development, insight visits, external inspection and triangulation visits. The aim is to ensure clinical care received by all our p atients is of high quality regardless of where or when they are treated. It involves continuous monitoring of standards for clinical teams to attai n and then retain gold standard and is well embedded across the organisation to ensure our patient care is of a consistent and high standard. Financial statements Our primary financial statements and supporting notes to the accounts are provided at appendix 1. Our external auditors, PwC, have provided an opinion on the accounts. Our annual report and accounts cover the 12 month period from the 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. Our accounts have been prepared in accordance with Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 24 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 directions given by the Department of Health and NHS Improvement. They are also prepared to comply with International Financial Reporting S tandards (IFRS) and are designed to present a true and fair view of our financial activities. A copy of the full annual report and accounts can be obtained from the Director of Finance and Strategy at Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation T rust Headquarters, Ash Green Learning Disability Centre, Ashgate Road, Ashgate, Chesterfield, Derbyshire S42 7JE. are: PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) Donington Way East Midlands DE74 2UZ. The total fees f or external auditors for 2019/20 accounts were \u00a355,000 (plus VAT) in respect of the completion of the statutory audit work, made up of: PwC (appointed auditors) \u00a355,000 (plus VAT) Due to the coronavirus pandemic, t here is no requirement for a foundation trust to prepare a quality report and include it in its annual report for 2019/20. Additionally, there is no requirement for a foundation trust to commission external assurance on its quality report for 2019/20. The Audit and A ssurance Committee provides the Board with an independent and objective view of arrangements for internal control within our Trust and to ensure the internal audit service complies with mandatory auditing standards, including the review of all fundamental financial systems. The Governance Sub- Committee of the Council of Governors received regular updates in respect of the work of PwC. The Group also met with PwC in August 2019 which allowed PwC to report on the cycle of audit work and for the governors to ask questions on points of clarification. Appointment process for external auditor The appointment of our external auditors is a matter that requires the approval of the Council of Governors. As a foundation trust, the Council of Governors is responsible for appointing auditors. The Audit and Assurance Committee is responsible for making a recommendation to the Council of Governors. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 25 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 A process for the appointment of auditors was carried out during 2015/16. In December 2014, the Council of Governors approv ed a proposal to go out to tender for our external auditors for 2015/16 onwards. Subsequently, the Council of Governors confirmed at their meeting on 9 September 2015 that they were content with the recommendations arising from the process to appoint PwC as our external auditors for an initial three year term from September 2015 with the option of two one-year extensions . The Audit and Assurance Committee recommended the optional extension for a further two years and the recommendation was accepted and appr oved by the Council of Governors at its meeting on 8 May 2018. As PwC's appointment is coming to an end, the Trust has successfully appointed new external auditors with effect from October 2020. The Audit and Assurance Committee review and monitor the ex ternal auditor's independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements. Charitable funds The Trust Board acts as corporate trustee for our charitable trust, which is a charity registered with the Charity Commission under number 1053329. These charitable funds have resulted from fundraising activities and donations received over many years by our respective organisations, and are used to purchase equipment and other services in accordance with the purpose for which the funds were either raised or donated. The charity also has a general purpose fund which is used more widely for the benefit of patients and staff. Following HM Treasury's ruling IAS27, that consolidated and separate financial statements should apply to all NHS bodies for accounting periods from 1 April 2013, we undertook an assessment against the two key criteria of materiality and control. As a result of this assessment we concluded that it was not necessary to consolidate the accounts of the charity with those of the NHS body. The financial activities of the charity for the 2019 /20 financial year will continue to be reported within a separate annual report and accounts for the funds held on tr ust. This report is published on the Charity Commission website. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 26 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Investments We made no investments through joint ventures or subsidiary companies and no other financial investments were made. No financial assistance was given by us. Working capital and liquidity Our cash position is maximised through efficient working practices regarding the day-to-day management of our working capital. We have appropriate governance in place to monitor performance in key areas and additional metrics are embedded int o the routine reporting to the Quality Business Committee which is chaired by a non - executive director. We ended 2019/20 with a healthy cas h balance of \u00a335.1m which equates to 71 days' worth of operating expenditure. We have continued to inves t surplus cash in 2019/20 in the National Loans Fund to generate a modest return on investment. Accounting policies We have detailed accounting policies approved by our Audit and Assurance Committee which comply with the accounting requirements of the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual and International Financial Reporting Standards for NHS foundation trust accounts. Our accounting policies are detailed in the full set of financial accounts. Insurance cover We have insurance cover through the NHS Litigation Authority to cover the risk of legal action against our directors and officers. We also have insurance cover for public and products liability to cover income generating activities. Going c oncern Derbyshire Community Health Service NHS Foundation Trust's accounts have been prepared on the basis that we run the Trust as a 'going concern'. This means that our assets and liabilities reflect the ongoing nature of our activities. Because risks and uncertainties change over time as an organisation develops and as its operating environment changes, the directors consider a detailed assessment of the evidence supporting our assertion that we are a going concern in the supporting evidence of our accounts submissions each year. Due to the Covid- 19 pandemic, revised financial arrangements for NHS contracting and payment will apply for part of the year 2020/21. The arrangements for the remainder of the year are yet to be confirmed but it remains the case that the Government has issued a mandate to NHS England for the c ontinued provision of services in England. CCGs will be provided with sufficient funding for the year and therefore the NHS providers can continue to expect funding to flow where services are expected to continue. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 27 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Therefore, after making enquiries, the dir ectors have a reasonable expectation that the NHS foundation trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 'going concern' basis in preparing the accounts.

Ensuring services are well led In 2019 the the Care Quality Commission (CQC) conducted their Well -Led inspection of the Trust and rated the Trust as Outstanding. This rating is fantastic, and well deserved, recognition of the commitment, energy and effort that everyone within DCHS puts into their r ole on a day to day basis. As Professor Baker, the Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said in his summary: \"An Outstanding rating is the result of a tremendous amount of hard work and commitment\" and I count myself very privileged to work alongside so many coll eagues that I see demonstrating that effort and dedication every day. The CQC has recognised the amazing improvement that our Integrated Sexual Health Services Team has delivered in the last couple of years, moving their rating as a service from Requires Improvement to Outstanding. They have continued to rate the whole trust as Outstanding for Caring, and have improved the trust's overall rating for Well Led from Good to Outstanding. The full report is available on our website: www.dchs.nhs.uk . Register of interests for directors and governors All directors and governors are required to comply with the Trust's code of conduct and declare any interests that may result in a potential conflic t of interest in their role as a director or governor of the Trust. For the purpose of meeting annual report guidance, we report that our chairman Prem Singh has no significant external interests, and his interests are included in the register. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 30 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 The register of interests is maintained and available to the public at the following address: Chief Executive's Department, Babington Hospital, Derby Road, Belper, Derbyshire, DE56 1WH and a copy is also published on our Trust 's website at the following link http://www.dchs.nhs.uk/home/about/freedom -of-information1/foi - publication- scheme . Cost allocation and charging requirements We have complied with the cost allocation and charging requirements set out in HM Treasury and Office of Public Sector informati on guidance. Political and charitable donations We did not make any political or charitable donations from our exchequer or charitable funds during 201 9/20. Prompt payment practice code Our T rust is a signatory to the prompt payment code and committed to paying our suppliers within clearly defined terms. We also commit to ensuring there is a proper process for dealing with any inv oices that are in dispute.

NHS Oversight Framework NHS England and NHS Improvement's Oversight Framework provides the framework for overseeing providers and providing pote ntial support needs. The framework looks at five themes: Quality of care Finance and use of resources Operational performance Strategic change Leadership and improvement capability (well led). Based on information from these themes, providers ar e segmented from 1 to 4, where 4 reflects providers receiving the most support, and 1 reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will only be in segment 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 31 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 This segmentation information is the T rust's position at 31 March 2020. Current segmentation information for NHS trusts and foundation trusts is published on the NHS Improvement website. The finance and use of resources theme is based on scoring in five measures from 1 to 4, where 1 reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding into the NHS Oversight Framework, the segmentation of the T rust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score here.

In our learning disabilities Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 32 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 service we continued to secu re ways to contain agency spend. We talk about staffing in more detail in the Staff Report chapter of this annual report. Income disclosures During the year ending 31 March 2020, our Trust generated income of \u00a3196 m for the provision of services, principally to the people of Derbyshire. Of that total, \u00a3176.8 m income was for patient care activities, as shown in note three of the accounts. The Trust complied with Section 43(2A) of the NHS Act 2006 (as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2012) which requires that the income from the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England must be greater than its income from the prov ision of goods and services for any other services. In addition to clinica l income, our T rust generated other operating income of \u00a318.9 as shown in note four of the accounts. This income related to recharges to other bodies for staff and supplies provided to them, research and developme nt, education and training and many other services that supported healthcare services being provided. This has not impacted on our delivery of services . Disclosure of information to auditors So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit i nformation of which the auditors are unaware, and the directors have taken all of the steps that they ought to have taken as directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that informati on. Tracy Allen Chief Executive 10 June 2020 Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 33 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Annual statement on remuneration 2019/20 This report contains details of how the remuneration of senior managers is determined. A 'senior manager' is defined as 'those persons in senior positions having authority or responsibility for directing or controlling the major activities of the Trust. The Trust deems this to be the executive and non- executive members of the Board of Direct ors. As chair of the Remuneration and Term of Service Committee I have reviewed the definition of 'senior manager' and can confirm that this covers the members of the Trust Board only. I also confirm that the remuneration report complies with: Section 420 to 422 of the Companies Act 2006 Regulation 11 parts 3 and 5 of schedule 8 of the large and medium -sized companies and groups regulations 2008 Parts 2 and 4 of schedule 8 of the regulations as adopted by NHS Improvement in this manual Elements of the NHS Foundation Trust code of governance. Major decisions on senior managers' remuneration There were no major decisions on senior managers' remuneration made by the Remuneration and terms of Service Committee in 2019/20. Substantial changes to senior managers' remuneration during the year and the context for these There were no substantial changes to senior managers' remuneration during 2019/20. Prem Singh Chairman 10 June 2020 Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 34 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Senior managers' remuneration policy Future policy table - executive directors Components: A pay point that is benchmarked against similar roles in similar sized NHS organisations Cost of living pay rises that are in line with other groups of staff in the NHS. In respect of Agenda for Change staff, in line with national agreements, the assumption is one of progression unless an individual is subject to performance measures. Component How this operates How this supports the Trust's short and long term strategic objectives Maximum that can be paid Framework used to assess performance and performance measures that apply Provisions for recovery or withholding of payments Annual flat - rate salary, taxable benefits and pension benefits reviewed regularly with reference to the wider NHS directors pay and the pay award to other NHS staff in any given year (applies to all executive directors with no specific differences for This is set out below under the section headed 'Remuneration policy'. It enables executive directors to take a balanced view between short and long term objectives which are based on key items determined by the Annual Plan Remunerat i on is based on flat rate salary, benefits in kind and pension related benefits Performance review is in place. Remuneration is based on flat-rate salary, it is not performance related and measures do not therefore apply Provision is made for termination of the contract without notice in certain circumstances. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 35 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 individual directors). Notes on future policy table No new components of the remuneration pack age have been introduced in 2019/20 nor have any changes been made to existing components. The differences between the policy on senior managers' remuneration and the general policy on employees' remuneration are set out below under the section headed 'Remuneration policy'. Senior managers are classed as executive directors, excluding associate directors. NHS pay for employees is set nationally within Agenda For Change. Pay for executive directors, who are classed as our senior managers, are set locally following national guidance, through our Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee. The chief executive was paid \u00a3139,956 pro- rata \u00a3155,507 during 2019/20 (2018/19: \u00a3139,009 pro- rata \u00a3154,445). We are satisfied that this remuneration is reasonable having undertaken benchmarking work, both in terms of salaries of chief executive officers of small to medium -sized trusts and gender equality. The salary paid was approved by both NHS Improvement and the Treasury. The remuneration of the medical director is directly attributable to his executive director role. He has no clinical duties. Non-executive directors Component Additional fees Other remuneration Annual flat -rate non pensionable fee, with a higher rate pay able for the chair of the Trust. The total monetary amount of these fees was \u00a3145,000 in 2019/20 (\u00a3131,400 in 2018/19) Not applicable - flat rate fees Not applicable Use of external advisors Our remuneration and term of service committee has not used external advisors to provide advice or services on remuneration matters. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 36 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Service contracts for senior managers The service contract for the chief executive and executive directors is the contract of employment. This is substantive and continues until the director retires; otherwise, the notice period for termination by the Trust is six months and for termination by the director, three months. The contract does not provide for any other payments for loss of office, but does provide for compensation for early retirement and redundancy in accordance with the provisions in section 16 of the Agenda for Change: NHS terms and conditions of service handbook. Our Trust's approach to executive directors' remuneration is to ensure that the Trust can attract, motivate and retain the high calibre executives it needs through paying a market remuneration package, taking account of o ur financial condition and providing value for money for tax payers. The Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee is responsible for ensuring that the remuneration packages that are paid to the executive directors and associate directors is in line with boardroom pay in the NHS, and reflects the performance of the organisation and the individual. The exact remuneration package is determined by the committee based on market position to comparable trusts and our Trust's performance and the individual's c ontribution. The process for reviewing executive remuneration is as follows: Recruiting executive directors For new appointments we will undertake a market review of salaries with comparable organisations from data available, both nationally and locally Before determining the salary we will take into account the salary paid to the previous incumbent and to parity with other executive directors For appointments with a salary level of over \u00a3150,000 we will follow the requirements to seek Treasury approval. The Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee determines the remuneration of the executive directors with the aim of attracting and retaining high calibre directors who will ensure the continued success of the Trust in providing the highest quality patient care. Employees are not consulted. Salary levels are reviewed regularly with reference to the wider NHS directors' pay and the pay award to other NHS staff in any given year. All non -medical employees at the Trust including senior managers are rem unerated in accordance with the nationally agreed NHS pay structure, Agenda for Change. Medical staff are remunerated in accordance with the national terms and conditions of service for doctors and dentists. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 37 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Non-executive directors The service contract fo r non- executive directors is not an employment contract. Our constitution regarding the non- executive term of office is compliant with the NHS code of governance. In the case of re- appointment of non- executive directors, the chairperson should confirm to the governors that following formal performance evaluation, the performance of the individual proposed for re- appointment continues to be effective and to demonstrate commitment to the role. Any term beyond six years (eg. two three- year terms) for a non- executive director is subject to particularly rigorous review, and takes into account the need for progressive refreshing of the board. Non- executive directors may, in exceptional circumstances, serve longer than six years (eg. two three- year terms following authorisation of the NHS foundation trust) but this should be subject to annual re- appointment. The notice period for termination is one month on either side and the contract does not provide for any other payments for loss of office. The Council of Gov ernors dete rmines the pay and terms of office of our chair and non-executive directors, on recommendation of the Trust's Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

The Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee The Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee is chaired by Trust chairman Prem Singh, and comprises non- executive directors. The committee has delegated responsibility to determine the remuneration, allowances and other terms and conditions of the execu tive directors and to oversee any new executive director appointments during the year. The committee met on five occasions during the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. The membership and attendance at the committee is detailed in the table below. Attendance at Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee 30 May 2019 25 July 2019 24 Oct 2019 19 Dec 2019 27 Feb 2020 Prem Singh Chairman Kaye Burnett Non-executive director \u00d7 Kay Fawcett Non-executive director \u00d7 Richard Harcourt Associate non - executive director \u00d7 Joy Hollister Non-executive director \u00d7 \u00d7 Julie Houlder Non-executive director \u00d7 Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 39 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Attendance at Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee 30 May 2019 25 July 2019 24 Oct 2019 19 Dec 2019 27 Feb 2020 Ian Lichfield Non-executive director \u00d7 James Reilly Non-executive director \u00d7 The Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee receives support from the chief executive and executive directors to assist the committee in their considerations of any matters. During 2019/20 we made two new executive appointments for our medical director and for our associate director of corporate g overnance due to the retirement of the previous post -holders. We engaged with NHS Leadership Academy to handle the recruitment process. They undertook a search for candidates on our behalf and we also adverti sed in the Health Service Journal. Both posts then had an interview panel and a stakeholder panel. For both post s we conducted the long listing and short listing ourselves in January 2019 and August 2019 respectively Use of external advisors on remunerati on Our Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee has not used external advisors to provide advice or services on remuneration matters. Remuneration policy The Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee determines the remuneration of the executive directors, with the aim of attracting and retaining high calibre directors who will ensure the continued success of the Trust in providing the highest quality patient care. Remuneration for executive directors, who are voting members of the Board, consists of a salary plus pension contributions. Salary levels are reviewed regularly with reference to the wider NHS directors' pay and the pay award to other NHS staff in any given year. No director is involved in, or votes in, any matter pertaining to their own remuneration. Performance is assessed through the annual appraisal process in line with our Trust's policies. The appraisal of all the executive directors is carried out by the chief Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 40 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 executive. All the executive directors have a six month notice period wr itten into their contracts. A summary of the appraisal for the chief executive and other executive directors is presented to the Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee on an annual basis. The only non- cash element of remuneration is the pension- related benefit which accrues under the NHS Pension Scheme. Contributions are made by both the employee and the employer under the rules of the scheme which are applicable to all NHS staff in the scheme. We do not make termination payments to executive directors in excess of contractual obligations. There have been no such payments during 2019/20. Non-executive directors, including the chairman, do not hold service contracts and are appointed for between three to four years. Non- executive directors do not receiv e pensionable remuneration.

There are no additional benefits that will become receivable by directors in the event that the senior manager retires early. There are no senior managers who have rights under more than one type of pension. The value of pension benefits accrued during the year is calculated as the real increase in pension multiplied by 20, less the contributions made by the individual. The real increase excludes increases due to inflation or any increase or decrease due to a transfer of pension rights. This value derived does not represent an amount that will be received by the individual. It is a calculation that is intended to provide an estimation of the benefit being a member of the pension scheme could provide.

No lump sum will be shown for senior managers who only have membership in the 2015 scheme. Cash equivalent transfer value A cash equivalent transfer value (CETV) is the actuarially assessed capital value of the pension scheme benefits accrued by a member at a particular point in time. The benefits valued are the member's accrue d benefits and any contingent spouse's pension payable from the scheme. A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme or arrangement to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme or arrangement when the member leaves a scheme and chooses to transfer the benefits accrued in their former scheme. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership of the pension scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which disclosur e applies. The CETV figures and the other pension details include the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to the NHS pension scheme. They also include any additional pension benefit accrued to the member as a result of purchasing additional years of pension service in the scheme at their own cost. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 47 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Real increase in CETV This reflect s the increase in CETV effectively funded by the employer. It does not include the increase in accrual pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee (including the value of any benefits transferred from another scheme or arrangement) and use s common market valuation factors for the start and end of the period. Information subject to audit Fair pay multiples Reporting bodies are required to disclose the relationship between the highest paid director and the median remuneration of the organisation's workforce. The banded remuneration of the highest paid director at the Trust during 2019/20 was \u00a3155k -160k (2018/19 \u00a315 0-155k); this was 6.2 times mor e than the median pay of \u00a325,171 (2018/19 6.1 times or \u00a326,275). The Trust is required to calculate the fair pay multiple based on all staff in post as at the end of March 2020 on an annualised basis. Where staff are employed on a part - time basis, their salary is calculated as if they were in the Trust's full -time employment. This is to ensure that the actual salary cost of part -time staff does not distort the overall median pay value. On this basi s in 2019/20 no employee received remuneration in excess of the highest paid director . Total remuneration includes salary, non- consolidated performance pay and benefits in kind. It does not include severance payments, employer pension contributions or the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions. During 2019/20, there are no significant changes on either side of the ratio. Tracy Allen Chief Executive 10 June 2020 Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 48 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Staff report We employ nearly 4,200 substantive staff, making us one of the largest specialist community health services in the country, serving a widespread local patient population in both urban and rural parts of Derbyshire. We are committed to staffing our clinical areas with our substantive staff wherever possible, as we firmly believe this is the best way to deliver high quality care. However, in addition to our substantive workforce, we have a well -established internal bank, meaning that we have over 1,3 00 committed bank workers supporting us to deliver high quality patient care and ensuring our agency usage is kept to a minimum. This year our agency spend is 1.49% of our total pay bill. Historically, we have performed well in this area and we have consistently contained spend on agency staffing below the target set. However, during 2019/20 there have been a number of specific challenges: Complex patient admissions in learning disability services that are supported by agency staff GP locum spend due to vacancies Medical locum c over within the learning disability service Agency spending on the wards, particularly in the south of the county, due to high patient acuity alongside sickness absence and vacancies. Measures that have been put in place to reduce this include further recr uitment to responsive workforce, established reviews and eRoster support meetings. Agency spend is above the NHSI ceiling of \u00a31.36m, spend for 2019/20 at year end was \u00a31.936m (42.5% above the plan). Staff turnover has risen slightly to 9.55% for 2019/20, which is lower than the local East Midlands NHS turnover which stands at 10.60% (based on most current NHS Digital data from November 2019. Analysis of the reasons why staff have left us has not highlighted any trends or causes for concern. Currently our v acancy rate is 4.93%. All of this assures us that Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust has a largely stable workforce which can only serve to support us in providing the very best care to our patients.

During 2019/20 this included: A Diversity Recruitment Group, championed by our director of people and organisational effectiveness, undertake an audit on our job descriptions and person specifications to ensure they are clear, ask for appropriate qualifications etc, to reduce bias Continued promotion of opportunities for flexible working, shared parental leave, career progression, promotion and leadership development opportunities Gap analysis of 'what works - good practice and evidenced based actions' - as recommended by the Government Equalities Office to ensure we are implementing effective initiatives within our workforce: https://gender -pay- gap.service.gov.uk/ Attendance Our average absence rate for 2019/20 is 4.96%, which is slightly higher than the previous year (2018/19 , 4.89%). The top three reasons for absence remain: stress/anxiety, musculoskeletal conditions and g astrointestinal problems. Staff wellbeing is a central focus for our leadership teams as we know that when our staff are well, patient outcomes are better. It should be noted that the Covid- 19 pandemic has increased absence figures from mid-March 2020 onwards, increasing in March by 1% from the previous mont h. The impact has been to increase the overall absence for the year 2019/20 slightly , however , we need to be aware that at the time of writing (May 2020) absence is anticipated to be significantly more over the next couple of months. Our wellbeing focus will be adapted accordingly to specific requirements. The workforce plan Our workforce plan is based on a strong commitment to strengthen our position within the system and particularly within the Primary Care Networks. Ensuring we Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 52 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 have the right workforc e means that we will have flexible, well -trained, highly motivated, diverse and responsive multi -disciplinary teams. We will also have teams that can be mobilised quickly to meet urgent and planned changes across our system: targeting the right skills, in the right place, at the right time, for the benefit of our patients. Our workforce planning process aligns to the developing governance of the Derbyshire system as we move to a 'system by default' operational model and prepare to become an Integrated Care System (ICS) by April 2021. Our role is to provide a skilled community workforce to support the development of the 15 Primary Care Networks (PCNs) and four Integrated Care Partnerships. We recognise the important contribution that the voluntary and community sector make in the delivery of care and the promotion of social value; for this reason we will continue to work with our partners in these areas. The plan has been developed in collaboration with our health and social care partners, including engageme nt with private, independent and voluntary providers. We recognise their contribution to developing a sustainable workforce, developing services in partnership with them and working to explore new opportunities for them to make a difference to the wellbeing of our patients. This partnership will strengthen as services are developed to support Joined Up Care Derb yshire, including the development of Primary Care Networks (PCNs). Our three year workforce plan establishes how we will provide the right workforce, in the right place, delivering the right care for the population of Derbyshire. It also outlines how we will deliver the objectives of the NHS Long Term Plan, and the interim People Plan, to ensure that we can achieve the ambitious improvements we want to see for our patients. The plan establishes how we will overcome the challenges we face in terms of our workforce, including staff shortages, against a backdrop of a growing demand for our services. Our services are seeing an increase in patients with higher levels of complexity and acuity, requiring the need to ensure that our clinical colleagues are supported with the competencies and the capacity to deliver safe and effective care. In order to achieve this transformation, we must support and equip o ur workforce to deliver this different model of care. Key workforce achievements for 2019/20 Developed new workforce roles to meet emerging care models, including nursing associate Increased the number of advanced clinical practitioner roles, to support the integrated model of community care Worked collaboratively to develop an integrated support worker apprenticeship role across health and social care We continue to be recognised for the quality of practice placements provided for pre -registration students across clinical disciplines. We are committed to Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 53 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 providing a learning environment that supports and enables our workforce to attain the right skills, competence and professional capabilities to deliver excellent care in a challenging and changing envi ronment. We will continue to build upon the good work and seek to increase our placement opp ortunities over the coming year Successful Return to Practice project working in partnership with Derbyshire system colleagues, which has resulted in returnees obtaining permanent positions with us Enhanced the available learning and development funds so as to implement innovative training solutions to meet the strategic needs of the organisation Continued to develop apprenticeship opportunities that assist in the development of new workforce models to meet the government's public sector target of 2.3% Enhanced the use of technology to deliver learning and development, including online training materials, bespoke e -learning, interactive distance learning, e.g. via Web Ex, Skype, podcasts and access to virtual library services Further enhanced and embedded our leadership work to equip our workforce to lead internally and across the system Increased awareness amongst our workforce of the principles of using a public healt h approach to the delivery of care and to create capacity and capability to allow them to fully engage with this approach by embedding health coaching and other public health approaches Ensured a continuous supply of a high calibre workforce which is able to work flexibly across the organisation and provide seven- day services . We will continue to assess the current skills and competency of our staff, and map to future service requirements at 'place' level so as to provide relevant learning and development o pportunities Worked with Health Education England and with higher education institutes to increase the range of pre- registration training available for local people, including part time/flexible routes into registered professions. Our aspirations and key workforce pr iorities for 2020 onwards are: To be the employer of choice that attracts a diverse and talented workforce To provide an engaging and supportive culture. To achieve this, we will: Support current staff to balance their home and work commitments - more flexible rostering that supports services and individuals Ensure we have enough people to match the services needed, people with the right skills and experience, so that our colleagues have the time and expertise they need to care for patients s afely and effectively Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 54 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Ensure our people have rewarding jobs, work in a positive culture, with opportunities to develop their skills and have support to manage the complex and sometimes stressful nature of delivering healthcare Strengthen and support good, compassionate and diverse leadership at all levels - managerial and clinical - to meet the complex practical, financial and cultural demands of the NHS Long Term Plan Further embed a health coaching approach across the organisation, to support our colleagues and patients and to expand the public health knowledge and skills to ensure we help the people we serve to stay healthier for longer Meet the strategic needs of the Joined U p Care Derbyshire sustainability and transformation plan priorities by ensuring that recruitment is targeted in key areas , including : learning disabilities, urgent care, expanding multidisciplinary roles and teams, improving resilience in general practice and ensuring equitable provision across a seven- day period. To be t he best employer for supporting career development we need to secure the future talent pipeline and provide stability with a varied and rewarding career. The challenge is substantial . However , there are real opportunities to make improvements. Research shows that more people want to train to join the NHS than are currently in education or training. Many of those leaving the NHS would remain if they were offered improved development opportunit ies and more control over their working lives. Therefore, this is an area of great potential for our organisation. To achieve this, we will: Provide flexible and accessible support for continuing professional development (CPD) Develop and support new rol es and inter -disciplinary credentialing programmes which will enable more workforce flexibility across an individual's NHS career and between individual staff groups Ensure our colleagues have the skills and competencies to respond to changes in how and where we deliver care, reflecting the changes in acuity and dependency of our patients Ensure established staffing numbers per team and service, match the patient and care demand Secure investment to increase the number of advanced clinical practitioners described in this plan, including senior medical resources necessary to provide adequate clinical supervision for advanced practice and non- medical prescribing Develop a cohesive workforce plan to ensure that as truly integ rated teams develop within the primary care n etworks across places in Derbyshire, the benefits of advanced practice are recognised and valued for the contribution Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 55 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 they make to patient care, maintaining people's health and promoting self - management Further develop \"grow our own\" initiatives, such as apprenticeships and work experience schemes Develop our offer for career development and support for individuals developing their careers in the roles described in this paper as it is clear that remuneration is not the only factor in retaining these valuable colleagues. To be t he best provider of healthcare education and training we need to provide excellent practice placements, supervision and preceptorship and continuing development opportunities. We want to be renowned for ensuring all our staf f are educated, developed and trained to achieve the highest standards of leadership and patient care. We value the importance of education and training, to develop our own workforce, to support the delivery of high quality care on a sustainable basis, and to play a part in the wider training of the future NHS workforce. Significant education and training also supports the creation of a learning culture so that the organisation keeps itself up- to-date with academic and research developments, informing innovation and improvements in care and delivery to benefit patients and staff. We are committed to developing a culture of lifelong learning and establishing our Trust as a learning organisation. To achieve this, we will: Develop our education and training programmes to maximise the use of money available for training and become a leader in this field Establish a local system for education that is developed and maintained for the current and future workforce Offer excellent practice placements, supervision, preceptorship, apprenticeships and continuing development opportunities while constantly evaluating to make improvements Achieve the Skills for Health quality mark that demonstrates we meet the unique health sector quality framework for learning and training and that we meet the high standards expected by health care employers Work with education providers and Health Education England to understand future training requirements. There are two underlying principles which need to be reflected in all elements of our workforce plan. Firstly, we are committed to integration of services working with our Derbyshire partners on this agenda and are currently supporting the redesign of integrated care system s in Primary Care Networks and place settings. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 56 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Secondly, we have a significant challenge to ensure financial stability. We need to achieve recurrent sustainable quality improvement plans so there is demand that our future workforce is leaner and more efficient whilst still providing the same or improved quality and safety outcomes. Workforce productivity is a key factor to deliver ing this, but we also need to ensure we have adequate staffing levels in services to deliver the care we aspire to provide. Working within the confines of those two underlying principles, we will deliver the aspirations set out in the section above by: 1. Doing things differently : we will make a significant difference to our ability to recruit and retain staff by making us an employer of choice by: Widening participation to support a \"grow our own\" workforce Supporting career development and developing new roles into our organisation; including a new on- the-job apprenticeship route to include a registered nurse, nursing associate, clinical associate psychologist, occupational therapist, and physiotherapist, podiatrist and speech and language therapist Being the best provider of education and training for our workforce by maximising the training and education resources available to us through effective economies of scale Increasing the number of clinical placements we provide for students by 25% in year 1, with the expectation this will increase further in the next three years. Currently we provide 142 placements. This will increase to 189 initiall y Maximising our workforce supply which will include working with Health Education England on return to practic e Creating new roles and career development opportunities for our workforce, taking them from support roles through to advanced practice Expanding our offer of development opportunities to all registered practitioners who are eligible to progress to advanc ed practitioner and independent prescriber status Increasing our flexible contracts to meet the needs of a multi -generational workforce Improving our workforce age profile. Our workforce is ageing and the total number of our under -25 workforce is 3.7%. We will increase the number of our staff who are under 25- years -old by 5% per year in the next three years. Currently we have a total of 164 under -25s; this will increase to 172 in 2020, 181 in 2021,191 in 2022 and 201 in 2023 Ensuring we bring people together to deliver our vision for a personal, fair and diverse workforce, where everyone counts and the values of the NHS Constitution are brought to life. We will be an inclusive workplace, ensuring equality across the organisation, working on promoting workf orce equality, and working to support inclusive healthcare. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 57 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 2. Developing our workforce : we will continue to increase our workforce by training and recruiting more professionals, including offering an excellent clinical placement for undergraduate nurses i n the community setting and offer more routes into the NHS including apprenticeships. We will explore the possibilities of training medical students, student allied health professionals and training a wider range of registered staff in our new training hubs. We will also make our organisation a better place to work, so we retain our workforce and feel able to make better use of their skills and experience for patients. We will provide access to funding for training and education and increase access to suitable training programmes. We are supporting 41 apprenticeships in 2019 and this will increase to 105 by 2020. We will develop a continuing professional development offer for our workforce and develop a visible flexible career pathway. We believe that ever yone has the ability to be a leader and we will support development in this area. 3. Delivering on the vision of the NHS Long Term Plan: we will transform our workforce by developing a different skill mix across our services, new types of roles and different ways of working to deliver the new service model for community and primary care services. While activities are already progressing well at scale and pace in some parts of our service, the introduction of new roles including nursing associates, advanced clinical practitioners and colleagues working at advance practice level will need to accelerate further. We will grow our workforce with a different skill mix and new ways of working to provide holistic care that meets the biopsychosocial needs of our population and helps support them to stay well. We will promote the concepts of trusted assessments and multidisciplinary working. We will grow our advanced clinical practitioner workforce from 17.53 whole time equivalents (WTE) in 2019 aiming to employ 50.6 WTE by 2023. We will review existing roles to ensure they remain appropriate for the future and we will work in partnership with our Pr imary Care Networks to develop an integrated workforce. 4. Offering career development and upskilling opportunities: for our workforce to enable us to make the best use of their talents, with core underpinning training including Quality Conversations. In turn we will support our workforce through high quality appraisal and personal development programmes. We will request more support from Health Education England to ensure we invest sufficiently in continuing professional development. We know this is an important factor in enabling us to recruit and retain our staff. It will also enable us to change our skill mix to that of the required future service model. 5. Developing our services and workforce modelling: to ensure we support more collaboration between Primary Care Networks and community services, to increase the services provided jointly and increase the focus on NHS organisations working with their local partners as 'Integrated Care Systems'. To plan and deliver services which meet the needs of the p opulation. A programme of workforce modelling is taking shape that will identify what the workforce should look like in a Primary Care Network and Place setting based on population health and demographic. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 58 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 6. Making better use of data and digital technolog y: We have already enhanced our learning programmes to include a range of digital technology. We aspire to develop digital skills across all staff groups. We will make it easy for our colleagues to record their personal learning achievements and to share learning from incidents with a \"person centred\" environment that utilises digital media to share best practice within the permissions of information governance. We will ensure teams have the relevant business information data to manage and plan their tea ms effectively. 7. Being an inclusive employer: Our vision is to be an exemplar of good equalities practice. We are committed to advancing equality of opportunity and working productively with key stakeholders across the protected characteristics. We plan to attract, recruit and retain a wide range of colleagues from all sections of society to work in a positive, inclusive and nurturing environment. We also want to deliver, with dignity and respect, inclusive and accessible services that meet our patients' individual needs. The proportion of Black Minority Ethnic (BME) colleagues employed within the organisation was 4.18% in 2018/19; an increase from 3.82% in the previous year. However, the Derbyshire BME population represent 6.7% of Derbyshire's total popu lation as per the Office of National Statistics. We will increase our BME profile to reflect that of the local population through targeted recruitment and retention programmes. Currently we have 184 people from BME backgrounds and this will need to increase to 295 if we are to represent that of the local population. Supporting staff wellbeing Following the launch of the Staff Wellbeing Strategy in 2018/19 the focus for 2019/20 has been on implementation across the three key areas of : Prevention Resilience Support. During Covid -19 the wellbeing team has scaled up the wellbeing support for staff and developed alternative methods of delivery. Along with the existing offer a central website hub was developed as a one stop shop for wellbeing information, a 24/7 phoneline launched and clinical psychologist capacity made available. Wobble rooms were set up, creating safe spaces for staff to take a moment and refresh. Calm kits have been created to facilitate the same for our community and remote workers. A virtual support menu has also been launched with Schwartz rounds, parent peer support, carers groups, diet clubs and exercise classes all available via video conferencing. During the year we achieved our highest ever staff flu vaccination rate, reaching 80.7%, beating the previous best of 68.5%. This also meant we sponsored over 9000 life- saving vaccinations across the third worl d via our 'jab for a jab' UNICEF partnership. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 59 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 The launch of a Derbyshire- wide system wellbeing group has been aimed at developing the Der byshire system staff wellbeing offer, increasing best practice and reducing inequity. The completion of further research projects from Sheffield University Business School with DCHS staff includ ed post-graduate projects exploring factors impacting staff e ngagement and the impact of staff self -compassion on absence and a PHD project looking at ageing workforce. We launched the Women's Health Project which is a dedicated role looking at understanding the key factors affecting women's health at work and launching interventions to make DCHS a best practice employer for women. We revised the stress policy to take a new approach based around wellness action plans to encourage a positive relationship between staff and line managers in matters relating to stress and mental health. An improv ed staff wellbeing planner now offer s 12 months of training bookable in advance, a wellbeing conference, new information sessions relating to finances, relationships and caring responsibilities and a broader range of wellbeing champion activities. The launch of the Thrive mental health app, has provided mindfulness, breathing, relaxation and cognitive behaviour therapy exercises via employees' phones. This was nominated for an award for technology use in staff wellbeing at the InsideOut staff wellbeing awards. The mediation service was relaunched with 15 new accredited mediators able to provide mediation support which has dramatically increased our capacity. The Resolve service has supported over 10% of the workforce to access counselling, and an average ti me to appointment of less than two working weeks. Of the staff accessing Resolve support 85% said it helped them not to take time off sick. These elements, along with the day to day offer of bespoke team sessions, coaching and manager support, has seen DCHS increase the NHS Staff S urvey wellbeing score, which takes us further beyond the average for similar trusts than in previous years. The goal for 2020/21 is to become the best community trust for staff wellbeing. Freedom to Speak Up The Freedom to Speak up agenda has continued to develop during the year. A change of Freedom to Speak Up Guardian in September 2019 was the opportunity to have defined hours dedicated to the role. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 60 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Promotional material has been updated and the Guardian has undertaken a series of site and service visits to publicise the role and support staff to have the confidence to raise concerns through the variety of routes available. This is reflected in the year on year increase of reported concerns throug h the Freedom to Speak up Guardian and the positive feedback from staff using the process. Themes and learning are shared with Trust Board and the Audit and Assurance Committee, as well as wider within the organisation, to ensure improvements are made. A safe and healthy workplace No-one should be injured or suffer ill health as a result of their work. In 2019/20 we have seen a slight increase in the overall number of injuries from incidents at work (454 from 411) but also in the number of the more serious injuries (20 from 16) reportable under RIDDOR (the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013). We launched a new Health and Safety strategy during the year, focusing our efforts on a number of key topic areas. These inc lude leadership development, learning from incidents, providing the best information and guidance, and everyone playing our part. We have worked in detail on violence and aggression, slips and trips, and lifting/handling injuries, which account for many of the injuries suffered by colleagues. Our work on violence and aggression has reinforced the message that it is not acceptable, recognising that our services need different solutions. We have provided additional support for managers and colleagues to address behaviour through our Aggressive and Violent Behaviour towards Staff Policy, as well as to services where patients' behaviours that challenge are as a result of illness. We know that we have more work to do and are committed to improving our colleagues' experience further in 2020/21. We have seen a significant reduction in injuries from household animals, from 14 injuries in 2018/19 down to 1 injury in 2019/20. This follows a campaign to raise awareness amongst teams and asking patients to keep the ir pets secured during clinical home visits. We have been working hard to ensure the safety of our colleagues during the Covid- 19 pandemic, and this will continue to have a significant impact on how we work in the future. Our plans for 2020/21 will focus on how we protect the safety of our colleagues whilst adapting our ways of working and ensuring that we continue to improve our approach to managing existing risks. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 61 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Essential training We run a programme of essential training for staff and monitor and report on compliance in all areas as part of our commitment to safety and good practice. The figures below show our attempts to maintain our 96% target on training compliance. Due to the Covid- 19 emergency response, we continue to work on a four mont h extension on all training in line with national recommendations. However, all our essential training is accessible via e- learning and reminders are being sent regularly to all staff via the communications team encouraging completion of essential e- learni ng packages. A lot of focus will be directed at improving fire training and appraisal compliance and managers are being encouraged to take advantage of the newly introduced technology and trial new ways of working. Training programmes Compliance 31 March 2019 Compliance 31 March 2020 % DCHS target Essential learning 96% 97.90% 96% Disability Confident Leader We are the holders of a Disability Confident Leader award, first awarded to us during 2017/18 by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), in recognition of our commitment to ensuring our policies give fair consideration to disabled applicants, promote the continued employment of disabled employees or those who become disabled during their time with us and offer career progression/training for disabled employees. We are also continuing to undertake further work with the D WP in sharing our work on attaining l eader status which will be used across the UK to help other organisat ions who are looking to become l eaders . We have taken part in an NHS Employers webinar to promote this work . Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 62 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Engaging with our staff We actively encourag e staff to get involved in what's happening across the organisation, to be able to express their views and play an active role in how the culture of the organisation develops - and we also want to be able to thank people. We have a number of established ways in which we provide information to staff on matters of concern to them as employees and also to encourage involvement by individuals in our performance. We have a strong staff representation on our Council of Governors involved in making decisions af fecting our workforce and the services we provide. A quarterly Staff Forum brings together staff representatives with executives to discuss matters of interest and concern, on topics chosen by staff. Each month we meet with staff partnership/union colleagues in a formal sub - committee of the Trust Board. The aim is to provide assurance that we routinely engage, consult and involve staff in the management of change. Team Talks and Exec Huddles offer an informal drop- in opportunity for staff to find out mor e about what's planned and raise any questions face- to-face with an executive. Leadership Forums are quarterly three- hour sessions for people managers to discuss the latest developments with executives, and then share with their teams. In additional to th ese ongoing organisation- wide engagement/information sharing opportunities, we also organise briefing sessions for groups of staff at their places of work to ensure their views can be taken into account on specific developments likely to affect them. We have a strong culture of appraisals, training, learning, development and raising concerns which are all designed to promote our approach to staff engagement. We also hold topic specific engagement events and also arrange for these to be held at locations ac ross the patch. During the Covid- 19 response, members of the engagement and organisational development team temporarily changed their roles to support the wider team, sourcing donations for the staff welfare work stream and support ing wider staff wellbein g. We also developed alternative ways to reward and recognise our colleagues during this difficult time. A virtual version of our DCHS Thank you, Time and Tea parties was launched, where all colleagues due to attend a tea party (whether that be for their long service award, a specific TTT nomination or teams who have retained their gold Quality Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 63 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Always a ward), were instead posted out their certificates/badges and a treat sourced from a Derbyshire based company and featured on our social media channels #DCHS virtualTTT. Working with the c hairman, we also launched the DCHS Donations Draw - whereby Derbyshire- based companies kindly offered to provide donations towards a monthly prize draw. Colleagues were in with a chance of winning anything from a bottle of wine, an afternoon tea, attraction tickets, subscriptions, to an overnight stay in a hotel when the pandemic is over. Saying thank you We think it is important to celebrate the achievements of individuals and teams whose dedication and commitment shines through, including those who devote decades of their working life to the NHS and to our organisation. Now into its second year, #DCHSTTT - thank you, time and tea party - reward and recognition scheme continues. Hosted by the Board, in 2019, we held nine parties to celebrate and thank staff by inviting them to take some time out and enjoy tea and cakes with colleagues and friends. Nominees are a combination of staff who had been nominated, staff who were receiving their long service awards and teams who had retained their gold Quality Always accreditation. We held again our 'Seasonal Stars' festive initiative leading up to Christmas. This feel good campaign began in 2018 and is sponsored in part by Thorntons. In 2019, we recognised over 200 colleagues. Where we were able to, they were featured on our social media channels throughout December. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 64 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 The Extra Mile Awards have become an established event in our calendar. In 2019, we held our sixth awards ceremony that seeks to recognise those who inspire others and deliver beyond expectations. We received a record breaking number of nominations this year, with over 400! NHS Staff Survey 2019 The 2019 NHS Staff Survey was conducted between Monday 23 September and Friday 29 November 2019. In total, 2,586 DCHS employees completed the survey giving a response rate of 62.4%, compare d with our response rate of 61% in 2018. The annual NHS Staff Survey provides us with valuable feedback on how individuals feel about the NHS and our organisation in particular as a place to work. The results are widely shared and discussed through all our established staff engagement channels, including Team Talks, Exec Huddles, Leadership Forums and Staff Forum, to ensure staff at all levels have the opportunity to feed into the conversation about what the results tell us. From 2018 onwards, the results from questions are grouped to give scores in ten indicators. The indicator scores are based on a score out of 10 for certain questions with the indicator score being the average of those. Scores for each indicator together with that of the survey benchmarking group Community Trusts are presented below. 2019/20 2018/19 2017/18 Trust Bench - marking group Trust Bench - marking group Trust Bench - marking group Equality, diversity & inclusion 9.5 9.4 9.4 9.3 9.4 9.4 Health & wellbeing 6.3 6.0 6.2 5.9 6.3 6.3 Immediate 7.2 7.2 7 7 7 7 Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 65 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 managers Morale 6.5 6.3 6.3 6.2 N/A N/A Quality of appraisals 5.8 5.8 5.6 5.6 5.7 5.7 Quality of care 7.7 7.4 7.6 7.3 7.6 7.6 Safe environment - bullying & harassment 8.6 8.4 8.5 8.4 8.6 8.6 Safe environment - violence 9.6 9.7 9.6 9.7 9.6 9.6 Safety culture 7.2 7.0 7.1 7 7 7 Staff engagement 7.3 7.2 7.2 7.1 7.2 7.2 Team working 6.9 7.0 6.9 6.9 6.9 6.8 Full survey results are also shared on our intranet site, My DCHS and via our all staff weekly email, the Weekly Download. All these channels help to feed into the detailed action plan to address areas where the survey shows we need to improve. Using the findings from the NHS Staff Survey 2018, we focus ed on the following areas during 2019: 1. Leading for improvement 2. Employee wellbeing 3. Appraisals 4. Development opportunities 5. Bullying and harassment 6. Raising concerns 7. Health and safety of employees. Progress on detailed action plans of our targets to improve staff satisfaction in each of these key areas is reported bi -monthly to our Staff Health, Wellbeing, Safety and Engagement Group and Quality People Committee. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 66 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Upon publication and analysis of the 2019 NHS Staff Survey results, it has been approved that we are to focus on the following themes for improvement during 2020: Health and wellbeing Quality of appraisals Safe environment - violence and aggression Team working. We are addressing these four areas as follows: Health and wellbeing Increase the visibility of the staff wellbeing offer: staff wellbeing services are gold standard, however awareness and subsequent access to them can be patchy across our services. We will launch pathways for musculoskeletal and mental health that will help us tackle the most common causes of sickness absence, ensure staff know what is available and when they might require it, whilst also increasing a sense of organisational support for staf f. 'Cause of the cause' factors: we continue to implement the staff wellbeing 2020 planner which places a specific focus on the causes of staff wellbeing issues such as finances, relationships and caring responsibilities, utilising training, resources and support s ervices to increase awareness and reduce stigma around these topics whilst linking staff with support they may require. Implement the women's health project: Following staff feedback we have recruited a fulltime role focusing on women's health, including menopause, fertility and maternity. This project is currently gathering data from staff before trialling interventions. Embed staff wellbeing within DCHS ways of working: we are looking into multiple ways of embedding staff wellbeing within regular practi ces and decision- making of DCHS. This could take the form of a wellbeing section within Quality Always reviews, a staff wellbeing checklist to be applied at decision- making committees or specific sections within appraisals or 1- 1s focused on wellbeing. Implement the stress policy: The new DCHS stress policy provides clear guidance that all staff should have a wellness action plan completed with their manager and that all managers should complete the HSE stress risk assessment for their teams. This will hig hlight specific issues at an early stage. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 67 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Develop a 'comfortable with conflict' culture and increase use of mediation: We have increased our pool of accredited mediators to make mediation more widely available and to provide coaching for managers about how to manage conflict as it arises. This will link with our courageous conversations training. Link to wider leadership development: Feedback shows that staff wellbeing is impacted by the quality of the line manager relationship. Prioritising the development of our leaders and managers, ensuring appraisals are effective and promoting a compassionate application of our people policies will all have a large impact on our staff wellbeing performance. Quality of appraisals Appraisal paperwork: We are refreshing the language of our appraisal paperwork to ensure it reflects person- centred leadership at all levels. Business intelligence: We are able to drill down to see where compliance/training levels are lower to understand what action needs to be taken. Train ing: We are looking at offering additional new bitesize training sessions for appraisers and at alternative ways of delivery through Webinars/Skype/eLearning etc. to get the most out of appraisal. Safe environment - violence and aggression Reporting: The key message is that colleagues should report all incidents (via Datix), so that managers can appropriately support/follow up, and to help us understand the full scale of the issue, and provide additional support where it's needed. Policy: We have recently reviewed the policy on violence and aggression against staff and we are producing further supporting guidance. Communication and promotion: A leaflet has been produced to support community colleagues to have conversations with patients ar ound appropriate behaviour, as well as other ways of ensuring a safe environment for us to work in. It's important that we continue to send the message that we will challenge unacceptable behaviour towards our staff. Learning disability/older people's mental health focus: We are working with colleagues in these areas of care- giving to identify lessons learnt and see what further support we can provide. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 68 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Team working 'Organisational effectiveness offer': A team support referral form has been successful and w e are now developing a more specific offer around what the organisational effectiveness team can support teams with, eg development/away days, additional wellbeing support or bespoke training sessions. Team support packs: The launch of an electronic team support pack filled with helpful ideas and resources to support leaders engaging with their teams. Leadership development: We are prioritising the development of our leaders and managers, ensuring our programmes and masterclasses are fit for purpose, appr aisals are effective and promote a compassionate application of our people policies. Pulse Check Pulse Checks were launched in 2013. This was later linked with our Staff Friends and Family Test. The positive impact high staff engagement can have on other key performance indicators - such as attendance, patient safety and productivity - is recognised and well researched. It also shows l eaders how well they are engaging with their teams to deliver the results we need, primarily around quality care for our patients. We changed the way we run the Pulse Check in 2019/2020. To enable more time to analyse the results and to act on them, the d ecision was taken to only have one full census and two samples. We encourage all our staff to complete the nine- question Pulse Check (that shouldn't take any longer than five minutes to complete) to test the mood and wellbeing of employees and teams. This helps us pinpoint where and how we need to give extra support and intervention on a rolling basis to maintain staff morale. The overall engagement score for quarter 1 in 2019/2020: Q1 April to June: 77% This was an increase of 2% from the previous Pulse Check. In recent Pulse Checks these are the responses we received to the following Staff Friends and Family Test questions: How likely are you to recommend Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust to friends and family if they needed care or treatment? Q1 April to June 2019: 91% This was an increase of 1% from the previous Pulse Check Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 69 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 How likely are you to recommend Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust to friends and family as a place to work? Q1 April to June 2019: 72% This was an increase of 3% from the previous Pulse Check Trade union r egulations We support and value the work of our trade union and professional organisation representatives, promoting a climate of active co- operation between representatives, leadership teams and staff at all levels to achieve real service improvement, best patient care and our desire to be an employer of choice. As an organisation we recognise that outstanding practic e requires an engaged and valued workforce, and we continue to seek to enhance and maintain these excellent employee relations through early involvement, engagement and intelligence sharing with our trad e union partners . This has been particularly true with our Covid- 19 pandemic response work. In line with the Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017 we have published details o f facilities time carried out by our trade union representatives during the 2019/20 year on our website www.dchs.nhs.uk . This covers duties carried out for trade unions or as union learning representatives in relation to our Trust and staff. Number of employees who were relevant union officials during the relevant period Full-time equivalent employee number 14 12.23 Percentage of time union officials spent on facility time Number of employees 0% 3 1-50% 8 51-99% 3 100% 0 Percentage of pay bill spent on facility time Total cost of facility time \u00a371,009.49 Total cost of pay bill \u00a3129,697,415.27 Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 70 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Percentage of the total pay bill spent on facility time, calculated as: Total cost of facility time divided by total pay bill x 100 0.05% Paid trade union ac tivities Time spent on paid trade union activities as a percentage of total paid facility time hours calculated as: Total hours spent on paid trade union activities by relevant union officials during the relevant period divided by total paid facility time hours x 100 5% Defence Employer Recognition Scheme - gold award In August 2019 we attained gold standard in the Ministry of Defence 's Employer Recognition Scheme. It recognises that our organisational values are aligned with the Armed Forces Covenant and that as gold holders the Ministry of Defence is satisfied we have demonstrated: we are an exemplar within our NHS sector, advocating support for defence people issues to partner organisations, suppliers and customers support for Reservists on mobilisations and that we provide at least 10 days' additional leave for training, fully paid, to Reservist employees forces -friendly credentials in our recruiting and staff selection our workforce is aware of positive policies towards defence people issues . Counter fraud/anti -bribery activities We support staff to be able to raise any concerns they may have with a dedicated local counter fraud specialist advice service from KPMG. We have developed a comprehensive counter fraud work plan in accordance with guidance received from NHS Protect. We also have a counter fraud policy approved by the Board of Directors. Anyone suspecting fraudulent activities within our services can report their suspicions to our local counter fraud specialist by telephoning the confidential hotline on: 0800 028 4060.

Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 78 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Members of the Board have regularly attended Council of Governors meetings to develop an understanding of the views of governors and members. Governors are able to share the views of their constituent members at these meetings. Members and governors are actively encouraged to attend the monthly public Trust Board meetings to influence discussion and raise awareness of constituents' views. Other feedback channels and engagement opportunities for our members and governors are routinely publicised via our regular membership communications, for example, sharing opinion on corporate publications. Trust Board The Trust Board leads by undertaking three key roles: Formulating strategy Ensuring accountability by holding the organisation to account for the delivery of the strategy and through seeking assurance that systems of control are robust and reliable Shaping a positive culture for the Board and the organisation. A number of sub -committees, and some individual of ficers, have delegated powers. These are detailed in our scheme of delegation. The scheme of delegation also includes a statement on the roles and respo nsibilities of the Council of Governors. Membership of the Trust Board is balanced, complete and appropriate. We are confident that all the non- executive directors are independent in character and there are no relationships or circumstances which are lik ely to affect or could appear to affect their judgement. The Board of Directors is not aware of any relevant audit information that has been withheld from our auditors, and they take all the necessary steps to make themselves aware of relevant information and to ensure that this is passed to the external auditors where appropriate. Our Board of Directors considers that the annual r eport and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and that it provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and stakeholders to assess our performance, business model and strategy. The directors' responsibility for preparing the annual report and accounts is outlined in the Accountability Report and Annual Governance Statement.

Contacting the Council of Governors Members and the public can contact the Council of Governors via email: DCHST.Governors@nhs.net Council of Governors meetings During the regular meetings the governors are updated on the performance of our Trust. Members of the public can attend and information about these meetings is available on our website: http://www .dchs.nhs.uk/home/about/governors Governor groups There are four informal governor sub- groups of the Council of Governors. The groups support governors to be involved in key areas of our organisation's work and to meet with the executives and non- execut ives that lead that work. Governors report back to the full council meetings regarding the work of each of the groups. The strategy group contributed to the review of the strategic and operational plans, oversaw our winter planning arrangements, received updates on commissioning, contracting and capital developments. The quality group focused on activities to maintain quality and service. This included feedback from the Care Quality Commission, a deeper understanding of the work of the Quality Service Committee, reviewing patient experience reports, receiving presentations from clinical services, and receiving updates on coroner's inquests. The governance group activities included reviewing amendments t o the constitution, the Council of Governors' self -assessment process including Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 85 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 agreeing the areas to be explored and the subsequent responses, reviewing and suggesting amendments to the engagement policy and external auditor plans. The group also observed non-executive directors during B oard meetings and sub -committees and fed back to other governors in respect of their performance in holding the Trust Board to account. The engagement group discussed how to build clear engagement with members, public and patients and provided feedback regarding communications with the membership; agreed the contents and format of the membership leaflet and reviewed the NHS Staff Survey results to discuss the best way to communicate and engage with staff. Governors were also involved and gained insight into many different activities across the organisation. Some of these were: Participation in insight visits to our wards and community teams Involvement in important internal groups such as the clinical effectiveness group and patient engagement and experience group Participation in PLACE (patient led assessments of the care environment) Attendance at meetings and workshops regarding the system transformation programmes for integrated services in north and south Derbyshire Providing a governor perspective for our initiatives and events.

These views are then communicated and shared with the Board of Directors They canvass the opinion of members via: The Council of Governors email address which is publicised to welcome feedback and comments Articles in My Community newspaper for public members Local health groups and associations, charities, parish councils, social groups, church activities and school governing bodies Involvement in our Staff Forum .

Council of Governors meetings have a regular agenda ite m to support and promote their 'holding to account' role whereby each of the non -executive directors, in turn, presents the work of the sub committees which they chair and answer any questions that may arise. We have an engagement policy for the Council of Governors around their work with the Trust Board, in compliance wit h the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, which provides the process by which the council can raise concerns related to the overall wellbeing of the organisation, if the need arises.

The relevant responsibilities of the accounting officer, including thei r responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which they are answerable, and for the keeping of proper accounts, are set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum issued by NHS Improvement.

To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . Tracy Allen Chief Executive 10 June 2020 Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 104 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 ANNUAL GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 1st APRIL 2019 - 31st MARCH 2020 ORGANISATION NAME: DERBYSHIRE COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES NHS FOUNDATION TRUST 1. Scope of responsibility 1.1 As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS Foundation Trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assi gned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS Foundation Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trus t Accounting Officer Memorandum. 2. The purpose of the system of internal control 2.1 The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an on- going process designed to: identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the organisation's policies, aims and objectives of Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. 2.2 The system of in ternal control has been in place in Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. 3. Capacity to handle risk 3.1 The Board has the ultimate responsibility for risk management and the review and approval of high risk treatment options. The Trust's risk management framework encompasses a Risk Management Policy which describes DCHS' approach to risk management including the processes, roles and responsibilities which underpin it. 3.2 The Trust has an effective Board, with an appropriate balance of skills and experience and with constructive challenge from the Non- Executive Directors. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 105 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 There is an induction and development programme in place for Boa rd members and a formal and rigorous evaluation of Board effectiveness has been undertaken. 3.3 The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for the management of risk by the Trust. The Director of Quality / Chief Nurse is responsible for the risk manag ement strategy and policy. The Executive Team exercise lead responsibility for specific types of risk. 3.4 The Quality Services Committee takes the lead Committee role for ensuring the risk register is robust. The Committee undertakes quarterly reviews of the full risk register. 3.5 The Audit and Assurance Committee takes the lead role in ensuring the risk management control system is robust. The Audit and Assurance Committee reviews the Board Assurance Framework at each meeting to ensure risks to the achievement of strategic objectives are being effectively managed. 3.6 The Audit and Assurance Committee annually reviews attendance at Trust committees, and will report any concerns around quoracy through to the Board for action 3.7 The role of each Execut ive Director is to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place for the: Identification and assessment of risks and hazards. Elimination or reduction of risk to an acceptable level. Compliance with internal policies and procedures, and statutory and external requirements. Integration and implementation of functional risk management systems and development of the assurance framework. 3.8 These responsibilities are managed operationally through corporate managers supporting the Executive Directors and w orking with designated lead managers within Operational Divisions. 3.9 The Trust has a Risk Management Strategy in place. The objectives in the strategy are regularly reviewed during the year to ensure that risk is fully embedded in the day to day managem ent of the organisation and conforms to best practice. The Strategy defines risk and identifies individual and collective responsibility for risk management within the organisation. It also sets out the Trust's approach to the identification, assessment, scoring, treatment and monitoring of risk. 3.10 Staff are equipped to manage risk in a variety of ways and at different levels of strategic and operational functioning. These include: Formal in -house training for staff as a whole in dealing with specific everyday risk, e.g. fire safety, health and safety, moving and handling, infection control, information governance and security. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 106 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Training and induction in incident investigation, including documentation, root cause analysis, steps to prevent or m inimise recurrence and reporting requirements. Developing shared understanding of broader business, financial, environmental and clinical risks through collegiate clinical, professional and managerial groups. Use of a reporting database to support risk management, Datix, which is recognised as best in class 3.11 The organisation's key strategic risks are identified in the Board Assurance Framework, which is reported to the Board of Directors quarterly. These risks are categorised as Quality Service, Qualit y People, Quality Business and Governance risks. The appropriate Committee reviews these risks on a quarterly basis to ensure the risk assessment is current, and to ensure risks are removed when closed, and added when new risks emerge. 4. The risk and control framework 4.1 The system of internal control is based upon an on- going risk management process designed to identify the principal risks to the achievement of the organisation's objectives; to evaluate the nature and extent of those risks; and to ma nage them efficiently, effectively and economically 4.2 The key elements of the Risk Management Strategy are that: Risk is a key organisational responsibility. All staff must accept the management of risks as one of their fundamental duties. Every member of staff must be committed to identifying and reducing risk The management of risk is best achieved through an environment of honesty and openness, where mistakes and untoward incidents are identified quickly and dealt with in a positive and responsive way and lessons learnt are communicated throughout the organisation and best practice adopted. 4.3 The tools used to identify, evaluate and control risks are those outlined in ISO 31000 using the 5x5 matrix for consequence and likelihood. The use of this tool ensures consistency of risk assessment across the organisation. 4.4 Risks that are assessed as low indicate management by routine procedures. Moderate risks require specific management responsibility and action. High risks require senior management attention. Extreme risks require immediate action, including informing the Board of Directors. 4.5 The key ways in which risk management is embedded in the activity of the organisation is through ensuring staff are aware of their responsibilities and accountabilities as set out in the risk management strategy. Assurances on how effectively the Risk Management System is working is through inspections - such as, environmental, infection control, security, workplace and fire safety - and through the health and safety and clinical governance activities Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 107 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 4.6 This is supported through the Trust's induction programme, training updates and individual training as a result of needs assessments. The Trust has introduced a performance management framework which includes the effective management of risk as a key element. The organisation undertakes Equality and Quality Impact Assessments on all functions it carries out to ensure that service delivery and employment practices comply with legal requirements. 4.7 The Trus t involves key stakeholders in the management of risks through formal meetings, discussions and engagement. This includes: Patients and their carers. The general public through consultations. Council of Governors Trust Membership Staff Partnership Commit tee Staff Forum Trust Management Executive Frontline Care Council Mental Health Act Committee (MHAC) Health and Safety Committee (HSC) Operations Senior Management Team Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) Primary Care Networks Local Health Providers Local Authorities (LAs) Improvement and Scrutiny Committee (ISC) Health and Wellbeing Boards Joined Up Care Derbyshire Care Quality Commission (CQC) NHS England NHS Improvement Healthwatch 4.8 The Trust has developed an integrated Assurance Framework to ensur e that there are proper internal and independent assurances given on the soundness and effectiveness of the system and on the processes in place for meeting its objectives and delivering appropriate outcomes. The Assurance Framework is structured across Qu ality, People, Business and Governance risks. The Governance section addresses key risks to compliance with the NHS Foundation Trust license condition 4 (FT Governance). 4.9 The Board of Directors determines the strategic objectives of the Trust. Achiev ement of these strategic objectives is performance managed through the Board Committee structure. Strategic risks, which threaten the achievement of strategic objectives, are identified and key controls put in Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 108 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 place to manage these risks. The Board is pr ovided with reports to enable it to monitor the effectiveness of each element of the Assurance Framework. 4.10 The mitigation of strategic risks have been included as a key element of the operational plan to ensure our risk management processes and operat ional planning is aligned and that we are focussing our resources on the right things. 4.11 The Board of Directors has considered the key controls that are in place to identify risks, and has assessed whether these controls are adequate. Where gaps in control s have been identified, action plans have been put in place to address the weaknesses. 4.12 The Board of Directors has mapped out how assurances relate to strategic objectives, and identified where gaps exist. Action plans are in place to ensure further assurance is given in these areas. The Trust uses external bodies to provide assurance, where available, and targets the internal audit and clinical audit programmes at specific areas to provide assurance. 4.13 The recommendations from internal audit reports are tracked by the Audit and Assurance Committee to ensure prompt implementation. During the year there was one high risk recommendation identified. This related to a review of staff communications which identified a disparity between the composition of the staff list on the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) and the Subscribers list used by communications to send emails to Trust employees. The Communications team are completing a business case to procure a new mailing system which is compatible with ESR. 4.14 The T rust ensures a strong relationship between the assurance framework and risk register. The two documents are cross referenced, with the assurance framework including strategic risks, and the risk register operational risks. 4.15 Sections of the assurance framework have been assigned to the Board and its Committees to ensure that there is clear oversight of all areas. Where lack of assurance, or gaps in control are identified, these are escalated to the Board of Directors. The Audit and Assurance Committee is resp onsible for maintaining the overview of the framework. 4.16 The Board of Directors uses the assurance framework to provide assurance when signing declarations to third parties. 4.17 The Quality Service Committee has responsibility for reviewing assurances over cli nical quality. The Board Committees have responsibilities for ensuring assurance is obtained routinely on compliance with CQC registration requirements. The Audit and Assurance Committee maintains an overview of compliance. 4.18 The Quality People Commit tee provides oversight and scrutiny of the Trust's Workforce Plan. This is supported by the Strategic Workforce Group, who ensure that the Workforce Plan matches the needs of individual Divisions and services and develops as the operating environment flex es and changes. The Trust has developed a Responsive Workforce Staffing model to ensure that Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 109 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 we have the right staff to undertake high quality patient care.

This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments in to the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. 4.24 The Foundation Trust has undertaken risk assessments and has a sustainable development management plan in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The Trust ensures that its obligati ons under the Climate Change Act and the Adaption Reporting requirements are complied with. 4.25 The Trust has a Major Incident and Business Continuity Plan. This document has been reviewed in- year to reflect the latest guidance from NHS England and the learning from incidents, training and exercises. The Quality Business Committee receives assurance reports on progress with the plan. 4.26 The Foundation Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. 4.27 The Trust has published on its website an up to date register of interests, including gifts and hospitality, for decision making staff (as defined by the Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 110 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Trust with reference to the guidance) within the past 12 months, as required by the \"Managing Conflict s of Interest in the NHS\" guidance 4.28 For the financial year 2019/20, PwC are the Trust's external auditors and KPMG are the internal auditors and providers of Counter Fraud services. 4.29 The Trust has a Director responsible for Security Management and has access to a Local Security Management Advisor. The Quality Business Committee receives an assurance report with progress against the plan. 4.30 There have been 2 serious clinical incidents in year that were classed as a Never Event. The first i n June 2019 related to a patient receiving dental restoration under inhalation sedation and local anaesthetic which was completed without apparent event. Following the procedure, the dental nurse noticed that the back of the \"slow hand piece\" was missing. An investigation showed that a small piece of the equipment (approx. 5mm) had been swallowed. No patient harm was caused. A full root cause analysis of this incident has been completed, and lessons learnt. Duty of candour was followed. The second was in August 2019. A patient had nail surgery undertaken under local anaesthetic on both great toes. The agreed plan on record was to remove nail sections and phenolise the nail bed of the fibular sulcus of both great toes. The patient actually had nai l sections removed from both tibial and fibular sulcus areas of both big toe nails. The patient had sections of nail removed from both sides but this was not agreed the agreed surgical plan as indicated in the patient record. No patient harm was caused. A full root cause analysis of this incident has been completed, and lessons learnt. Duty of candour was followed. 5 Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources 5.1 The Trust uses a range of key performance indicators (KPIs) which include non-financial measures, to manage the day to day business. This approach helps to provide a comprehensive and balanced view of performance. 5.2 During the year, the Board of Direct ors has received regular reports providing information on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources. The reports provide detail on the financial and clinical performance of the Trust during the previous period and highlight any areas through benchmarking or a traffic light system where there are concerns around economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources. The reports, supplied by general and service managers of the Trust, show the integrated financial, risk and perf ormance management which support efficient and effective decision making by the Board of Directors. 5.3 Internal audit has reviewed the systems and processes in place during the year and has published reports detailing the required actions within specific Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 111 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 areas to ensure economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources is maintained. The internal audit reports provided to the Audit and Assurance Committee throughout the year gave an assessment of assurance in these areas 5.4 The Board of Directors has also received assurances on the use of resources from agencies outside the Trust, including NHS Improvement. The Board of Directors self -assess on a quarterly basis and NHS Improvement score this assessment using its Financial and Governance Risk Ratings. An overall segmentation rating is then provided for each Trust. 6 Information governance 6.1 The Trust has systems and processes in place to govern access to confidential data and to ensure certain standards are followed when data and inform ation is in transit. Any new system or process needs to meet these standards as does any hardware (e.g. computers or software). All system developments whether new or existing need to follow a process and be signed off by the Information Management and T echnology (IM&T) Strategy Group to ensure they meet the required criteria and that hardware and software is compatible. 6.2 The Trust monitors its information governance risks through the Information Governance Group. Incidents and risks are managed in accordance with Trust policy and serious risks are escalated through either IM&T Strategy Group or more urgent ones through the Executive Team, Quality Services Committee and Board of Directors. 6.3 The Caldicott Guardian (Medical Director) and the Senior Information Risk Owner (Chief Information and Transformation Officer) advise the Board around information and data security risks. 6.4 During the financial year, the Trust had no data security breaches at Level 2, which required reporting to the Information Commissioner. 6.5 Where Level 2 incidents do occur, these would be reviewed through the Information Governance Group so that learning can be shared and actioned. 7 Data Quality and Governance 7.1 The Trust has assigned the Chief Information Officer as the Board Director responsible for data quality and governance 7.2 The Trust receives assurance on data quality through the data quality kitemark to indicate the robustness of service and organisational data. The kitemark assesses service line data against the following six categories before an overall score is provided: audit, timeliness, sign off, relevance, Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 112 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 completeness and source. External assessment of data quality is via performance metrics against national quality standards. 7.3 To ensure that there are appropriate controls in place to ensure the accuracy of data, the Trust has a data quality improvement plan in place. Key indicators, such as elective waiting time data, are reviewed through management and audit resource. Progress with improving data quali ty is reported through the Informatics Strategy Group and then through to the Audit and Assurance Committee. 8. Review of effectiveness 8.1 As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS Foundation Trust who have responsibility for the development and mainte nance of the internal control framework. I have drawn upon performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, audit and assurance committee, quality service committee, quality people committee and quality business committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. 8.2 Executive Directors within the organisation who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the system of internal control provide me with assurance. The Assurance Framework itself provides me with evidence that the effectiveness of controls that manage the risks to the organisation achieving its principal objectives have been reviewed. My review is also informed by major sources of assurance detailed below. 8.3 I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board of Directors, the Audit and Assurance Committee, the Quality Service Committee, the Quality People Committee and the Quality Business Committee. A plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. 8.4 The processes that have been applied in maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal contr ol include the roles of the following: The Head of Internal Audit provides me with an opinion on the overall arrangements for gaining assurance through the Assurance Framework and on the controls reviewed as part of the internal audit work. The Head of Internal Audit Opinion for 1 st April 2019 to 31st March 2020 is as follows: Significant assurance with minor improvement opportunities can be given on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Trust's framework of governance, risk management and control Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 113 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 The As surance Framework itself provides me with evidence that the effectiveness of controls that manage the risks to the organisation achieving its strategic objectives have been reviewed. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection of our services in July 2019, which resulted in an overall rating of \"Outstanding\", and their rating of \"Outstanding \" for Well Led, provides me with assurance over our clinical and corporate governance systems and quality of care of the services provided An independent review of leadership and governance across the Trust by Deloitte in 2018/19, using the Well Led Framework, provides me with assurance that it is effective. In particular, Deloitte noted the following areas of good practice, which were also noted in the CQC review in July 2019: o Strongly embedded vision and values o A highly respected Executive Team o Positive culture o Focus on assurance and risk management The Trust's development of its Quality Assurance Framework, and Quality Always accreditation, provides me with assurance of the quality of services provided by our services Our categorisation under the Single Oversight Framework (SOF) as a Trust \"Green\" for governance and \"low risk\" for finances provides me with assurance as to our overall governance systems The work of our external auditors to review the arrangements in place for producing the financial accounts, and providing an opinion on them, provides me with assurance The work of our internal auditors in completing their risk -based targeted programme of reviews provides me with assurance on the effectiveness of controls. The work of our clinical audit team provides me with assurances of the effectiveness of controls in clinical areas The quarterly governance returns to the Audit and Assurance Committee provide me with assurance that the trust met the requirements of its License conditions Our Staff Survey results provides me with assurance that our staff feel supported and involved in the work of the Trust, and triangulates with the findings of the Care Quality Commiss ion Well Led Review earlier in the year. The Audit and Assurance Committee provides the Board with an independent and objective view of arrangements for internal control within the Trust and to ensure the Internal Audit service complies with mandatory auditing standards, including the review of all fundamental financial systems. The Trust undertook an internal audit against the information governance toolkit, which provided evidence to support the Trust's view that it was compliant with the standards. The T rust continues to take action to ensure the standards of information governance are improved further in line with best practice. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 114 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 The Board of Directors has identified the strategic risks facing the organisation during the period and has monitored the cont rols in place and the assurances available to ensure that these risks are being appropriately managed. 9. Significant Control Issues 9.1 During the year, there have been no significant control issues from business as usual. 9.2 However, in March 2020, the Trust e nacted its business continuity plan with other partners to respond to the Covid 19 Pandemic. This event has caused the Trust to change its normal operational arrangements. The pandemic has required the Trust to redirect resources to focus upon critical ser vices to support the health and social care system response. 9.3 The Trust has established a Gold and Silver Command structure that links into local structures feeding the Local Resilience Forum to ensure a coordinated public sector response is provided. The Board has approved a revised Corporate Governance Framework to support and oversee the response. The Trust has followed the national prioritisation tool for community services to inform our Service Delivery Plan for the pandemic. 10. Conclusion 10.1 My review c onfirms that Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust has a generally sound system of risk management and internal control that supports the achievement of its policies, aims and objectives. 10.2 The Trust will continue to use the assurance fr amework to assure the Board of Directors and others that the Trust's key controls to manage strategic risks are being assessed and continuously improved Where areas of concern are identified, action plans have been put in place to close the gap in control or assurance. Signed (on behalf of the Board of Directors) Chief Executive Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 115 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Independent Auditors' Report to the Council of Governors of Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust Report on the audit of the financial statements Opinion In our opini on, Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust's (\"the Trust\") financial statements (the \"financial statements\"): give a true and fair view of the state of the Trust's affairs as at 31 March 2020 and of the Trust's income and expenditure and cash flows for the year then ended; and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2019/20. We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual R eport and A ccounts 2019/20 (the \"Annual Report\"), which comprise: the Statement of F inancial Position as at 31 March 2020 ; the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended ; the table of adjusted financial performance (control total basis); the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended 31 March 2020 ; the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended ; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the National Health Service Act 2006, the Code o f Audit Practice and relevant guidance issued by the National Audit Office on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General (the \"Code of Audit Practice\"), International Standards on Auditing (UK) (\"ISAs (UK)\") and applicable law. Our responsibilities unde r ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Indep endence We remained independent of the Trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. Our audit approach Context The Trust provides community healthcare services across Derbyshire. It is predominantly funded by local Clinical Commissioning Groups (\"CCGs\") and NHS England. Our audit for the year ended 31 March 2020 was planned and executed having regard to the fact that the Trust's operations and financial stability were largely unchanged in natu re from the previous year. In light of this , our approach to the audit, in terms of scoping and key audit matters , was largely unchanged apart from the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic . Additional associated risks identified relating to expenditure classification and cut -off as a result of the pandemic , resulted in the inclusi on of COVID -19 as a key audit matter. Our audit also involved forming a conclusion on the arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources (the \"3 Es\"), in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 116 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Overview Overall materiality: \u00a3 3.783 million (2019: \u00a33.792 million ) which represents 2 % of total revenue (operating income from patient care activities plus other operating income) . Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environ ment, including internal control. The Trust does not have any subsidiaries and is structured as a single reporting unit and so the whole Trust was subject to a full audit scope. All work was performed by a single audit team who assessed the risk of materia l misstatement, taking into account the nature, likelihood and potential magnitude of any misstatement and determined the extent of testing required over each balance in the financial statements. Our key audit matters were: Risk of fraud in the recognition of revenue and expenditure; Valuation of property, plant and equipment; and Impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular , we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant account ing estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and the conclusion on the arrangements for securing economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the use of resourc es, and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; a nd directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and , in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Risk of fraud in the recognition of revenue and expenditure See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors' disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements and estimates relating to the recognition of income and expenditure and notes 3 -6 for further information. We focussed on this area because there is a heightened risk as: The Trust reported exceeding its control total of a \u00a33.878 million surplus with an outturn of a \u00a34.034 We read the accounting polic ies for revenue and expenditure recognition and found them to be consistent with the requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2019/20 and IFRS 15 . We noted no issues in this respect. Income from Activities For a sample of healthcare income, we agreed the income received during the year to a signed contract with the counterparty. For a sample of income recognised in relation to under / over performance against contract, we agreed these to contract variations that were signed by the relevant counterparty and the Trust. No issues were Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 117 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 million surplus (before additional Provider Sustainability Funding). Given the pressure to deliver the control total there is an incentive to increase reported income. Elements of income which may be subject to manipulation are healthcare income derived from cost and volume contracts and year -end agreements for under/over performance on block contracts. There is an incentive not to recognise expenditure in 2019/20 relating to the current year, to improve the financial result. Expenditure relating to judgemental estimates, including provisions and accruals could be under -estimated in order to improve reported performance. Give n these incentives, we focussed our work on the elements of income and expenditure that are most susceptible to manipulation, being: healthcare income derived from cost and volume contracts and year -end healthcare income settlements with commissioners; items of expenditure where the value is dependent upon estimates, in particular the completeness of provisions and accruals; and non-standard journal transactions; and unrecorded expenditure and liabilities. identified from the work performed. We used the Agreement of Balances report provided by NHS Improvement to auditors to identify any differences between the Trust's income, expenditure, receiva bles and payables balances , and those reported by other NHS organisations. We investigated all disputed amounts over \u00a30.3 million and checked that the Trust's position agreed to underlying audited accounting records . We read correspondence with the counter parties, and then considered the impact, if any, that the remaining disputed amounts would have on the Trust's financial statements and determined that there was no material impact. We tested a sample of remaining clinical income and other income by tracin g the transaction to invoices or other correspondence and cash receipt (if not received , we agreed these to the trade receivables ledger). We used our knowledge and experience in the sector to determine whether revenue was recognised in the correct period. Items of other revenue included education and training, Provider Sustainability Funding and CCG pass through costs. We tested a sample of income transactions recognised around year end (March and April 2020) and confirmed that income had been recognised i n line with the Trust's accounting policies and in the correct accounting period by agreeing transactions to the supporting invoice and cash receipts. No issues were identified from the work performed. Provisions We obtained an understanding of the movemen t for each category of expenditure provision and performed testing by agreeing a sample to supporting evidence, confirming the accuracy of the provision calculations and that the Trust had a constructive obligation at 31 March 2020. We considered the compl eteness of provisions by testing cash payments made after the year end and assessing the completeness of lower value provisions. No issues were identified from the work performed. Expenditure Accruals We targeted a sample of the highest value accruals which related to holiday pay, pharmacy costs and travel expenses and agreed these to the supporting evidence available. Where invoices had not been received at the time of our audit, we obtained details of how the accrual had been calculated and confirmed the accuracy of the calculation. We also obtained the information that had been us ed to form the estimate in order to substantiate the accrual. To assess the completeness of accruals , we considered a sample of current year accruals compared to prior year accruals to determine if any balances had been omitted. We performed an analysis of non -pay expenditure throughout the year and post year -end in order to identify any inconsistencies in trends which could indicate an understatement in 2019/20. In addition, we tested a sample of non -pay expenditure transactions recognised post year end to ensure they had been recognised in the correct period. No issues were identified from the work performed. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 118 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Manipulation of journal postings to the general ledger Our journals work was carried out using a risk -based approach across the general ledger us ed by the Trust. We used data analysis techniques to identify the journals that had higher risk characteristics. We tested a sample of journal transactions that had been recognised in both income and expenditure , focussin g in particular on those that : were raised by senior members of the finance team; and used unusual account combinations. We agreed the journal entries to supporting documentation, for example invoices and cash transactions. Our testing found that they were supported by appropriate documenta tion and that the income and expenditure was recognised in the appropriate accounting period. Valuation of property, plant and equipment See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors' disclosures of the related accounting policies for Property, Plant and Equipment and notes 14 -16 for further information. We focussed on this area because Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) represents the largest asset balance in the Trust's Statement of Financial Position and the valuation of land and buildings r equires significant levels of judgement and technical expertise in choosing appropriate assumptions. Therefore, our work has focused on whether the methodology, assumptions and underlying data used to determine the value of PPE were appropriate and correct ly applied. Following a full revaluation of PPE undertaken in 2017/18, in 2018/19 and 2019/20 the Trust has applied indices as the basis of updating the valuation of its land and buildings. In 2019/20 , the Trust has also engaged an external expert to provi de a revised 2017/18 valuation for a new Buxton asset which incorporates services provided by Buxton Health Centre , acquired in 2018/19. Our specific areas of focus were: the accuracy and completeness of detailed information on assets used as the input dat a for each valuation; the appropriateness of the Trust's assumptions underlying the classification of properties; the basis of revaluation, assumptions and underlying data; and the accounting transactions resulting from this valuation , and whether they were accurately recorded in the financial statements. We assessed the assumptions and the estimates used in the valuation and considered the reasonableness of these using our valuation experts . We have also considered the professional capabilities of the Trus t's external valuer who provided the indices for the Trust to apply . We checked the accuracy and completeness of the detailing land and building records being used as the basis of valuation. We checked that the valuation information has been correctly input into the revaluation calculations and, consequently, that the accounting treatment has been recorded appropriately in the Trust's financial statements. We inspected the repairs and maintenance expense codes to confirm that there had been no significant alterations to the existing value and use of assets , and to address the risk that capital expenditure had not been misclassified as repairs and maintenance spend. No issues were identi fied from the work performed. The indices used by the Trust are designed to be applied to either residential or commercial buildings, rather than premises used for healthcare. Where the distinction between industrial and residential properties was unclear, the Trust chose to apply an average of these indices. We requested that the Trust include additional disclosure in note 1 in the financial statements in respect of this judgement. We identified that the indices had been applied to the depreciated replacem ent cost of the building assets , a simplistic method of valuation , rather than being applied to the gross replacement cost and then adjusted for the remaining useful life and asset condition to arrive at the current year depreciated replacement costs. O ur valuation experts estimated a n alternative percentage increase should have been applied to the Trust's valuation of its land and buildings, had the indices been applied correctly. T his estimated increase would not materially impact on the valuation of land and building s, and t he Trust chose not to adjust its valuation to reflect th e estimated increase that should have been applied. We held meetings with the Trust's valuer to understand the potential impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the Trust's valuation. Our own valuation expert was also in attendance at this meeting . Due to the uncertainty created by the COVID -19 pandemic regarding the valuation of the Trust's land and buildings, the Trust has disclosed a material uncertainty on property valuation in note 1 of its financial statements and we agree with this view. This explain s that there is material valuation uncertainty in relation to the valuation of properties of included in the Statement of Financial Position as at 31 Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 119 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 March 2020. The Trust's valuers engaged by management have included a material valuation uncertainty clause in their report. This clause highlights that less certainty, and consequently a higher degree of caution, should be attached to the valuation as a result o f the COVID -19 pandemic . COVID -19 - Trust and 3 Es During the course of the audit, both management and the audit team considered the impact that the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic has had on the activities, suppliers and wider economy of the Trust and its financial statements. Management's assessment is that the impact on 2019/20 outturn was not significant , as operations only significantly changed in scope during the last three weeks of the financial year 2019/20 . The Trust received financial support from NHS Improvement in relation to additional COVID -19 costs incurred during 2019/20. Due to the significance of the pandemic, the financial statements have recognised the impact as a significant narrative disclosure and a non -adjusting post balance sheet event in the financial statements. As a result of this, we determined that the impact of COVID -19 should be a key audit matter. We performed the following procedures to address the impact that the COVID -19 pandemic had on the financial statements: Performed additional sample testing of non-pay expenditure transactions posted after 31 Ma rch 2020 to address the heightened risk that transactions may have been posted to the wrong period. Performed sample testing on items recognised as COVID -19 related costs to ensure the classification as reimbursable , was appropriate . Evaluated and challen ged management's assessment of the COVID -19 pandemic impact on valuations, going concern and value for money . Assessed th at disclosures on going concern, material valuation uncertainty and post balance sheet events made by management in the financial statements appropriately address the impact of COVID -19. Held regular discussions with the Director of Finance & Strategy and the Deputy Director of Finance to understand the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the financial governance of the Trust. We concluded that management's assessment of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the financial statements and the arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources was r easonable as disclosed on page 11 0 of the Annual Repo rt. Financial sustainability, delivery of cost savings and agency spend - 3 Es The Trust 's has recognised a risk on its Board Assurance Framework in respect of the financial stability of the organisation and its ability to deliver against future Sustainable Quality Improvement Programmes (SQIP) over the next two years. In previous years, the Trust's has perform ed well in delivering its cost savings plans, but the health economy faces ongoing financial challenge, and the deteriorating financial health of other NHS bodies in Derbyshire could impact the Trust's future contractual obligations, including service cuts. The Trust also recognised early in 2019/20 that it was likely to exceed its agency staff spend ceiling of \u00a31.36m. With the added challenge of delivering the conditions to secure access to Provider Sustainability Funding from the Department of Health and Social Care, this was an area of focus for our audit in relation to our conclusion on economy, efficiency and effectiveness. In response to the identified risk, the following specific procedures were performed: Understood the 2019/20 financial outturn position and the Trust's performance against its 2019/20 cost savings target; Read the Trust's 2020/21 budget and SQIP plans . Understood the Trust's medium -term financial strategy and the sensitivities around this . Understood the wider Derbyshire healthcare environment and the current commitments which the Trust has made to support the 'Joined Up Care' initiative. Understood the underlying causes of increased agency staff usage and reviewed plans to reduce dependency on agency employees . Tested the completeness of agency costs by analysing monthly trends and testing other categories of non -pay expenditure to ensure appropriate cla ssification. Based on our risk assessment and work performed, we have summarised the following outcomes from our V alue for Money assessment: The Trust is in a relatively strong financial position given it has exceeded its control total in 2019/20 and has r eported a Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 120 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 surplus. The Trust has also exceeded its planned cost savings target in 2019/20, although there is an over - reliance on non -recurrent schemes compared with the budgeted position. The latest CQC inspection of services in July 2019 , resulted in an overall rating of 'Outstanding', and a rating of 'Outstanding' for Well Led. The NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework has continually rated the Trust in the highest category as '1' in all areas. The Trust's outturn on agency expendi ture was above the ceiling cap , however , this was less than 50% above this threshold and therefore ha d no impact on the Trust's Use of Resource score of 1. From our audit work performed , we have not identified any significant impact of the COVID -19 pandem ic on the Trust's financial governance relating to the 2019/20 financial year. Additional COVID -19 costs incurred by the Trust in 2019/20 were also immaterial. The outlook for 2020/21 has become more uncertain as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. The Tru st produced an updated financial plan which takes into account the key circumstances arising from the pandemic and forecasts a continued surplus with sufficient cash resources . Whilst the Derbyshire healthcare environment remains financially challenging, and funding plans for 2020/21 are unclear as 2020/21 income contracts are not yet signed , the Trust anticipates block funding arrangements will continue to be r eceive d up until October 2020. F urther guidance on the impact to potential risk sharing agreements is expected in the coming months. We determined that there were no further key audit matters to communicate in our report relating to the financial statements of the Trust or the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in its use of resources . How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial st atements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Trust, the accounting processes and controls, and the environment in which the Trust operates. In establishing our overall approach , we assessed the risks of material misstatement, taking into account the nature, likelihood and potential magnitude of any misstatement. Following this assessment, we applied professional judgement to determine the extent of testing required over each balance in the financial statements. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust prepares individual Trust financial statements. Books and records for the Trust are retained by the finance team based at Walton Hospital . We focused our work on the key audit matters described above. We performed our audit of the financial information from Walton Hospital and remotely as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 121 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and exten t of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall materiality \u00a33.783 million (2019: \u00a33.792 million) How we determined it 2% of total revenue (operating income from patient care activities plus other operating income) (2019: 2% of total revenue) Rationale for benchmark applied Consistent with last year, we have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, in the absence of indicators that an alternative benchmark would be appropriate. We a greed with the Audit and Assurance Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u00a3189,000 (2019: \u00a3190,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the followi ng matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you , where: the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Trust's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statemen ts are authorised for issue. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, acc ordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. With respect to the Performance Report and the Accountability R eport , we also considered whether the disclosures required by the NHS Foundation Trus t Annual Reporting Manual 2019/20 have been included. Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) and the Code of Audit Practice require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below. Performance Report and Accountability Report In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Performance Report and Accountability Report for t he year ended 31 March 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the NHS Foun dation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2019/20. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 122 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Trust and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Performance Report or Accountability Report . In addition, the parts of the Remuneration and Staff reports to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the N HS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2019/20. Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Accountability Report set out on page 28, the dir ectors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2019/20, and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsi ble for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Trust or to cease operations, or h ave no realistic alternative but to do so. The Trust is also responsible for putting in place proper arrangements to secure economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources. Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a hi gh level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report. We are required under Schedule 10 (1) of the National Health Service Act 2006 to satisfy ourselves that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securi ng economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources and to report to you where we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that it has done so. We are not required to consider, nor have we considered, whether all aspects of the Trust's arrangem ents for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources are operating effectively. We have undertaken our work in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice, having regard to the criterion determined by the Comptroller and Auditor General as to whether the Trust has proper arrangements to ensure it took properly informed decisions and deployed resources to achieve planned and sustainable outcomes for taxpayers and local people. We planned our work in accordance with the Code of Audi t Practice. Based on our risk assessment, we undertook such work as we considered necessary.

Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust 123 Annual report and accounts 2019/20 Other required reporting Arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources Under the Code of Audit Practice , we are required to report, by exception, if we conclude we are not satisfied that the Trust has put in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2020. Key audi t matters relating to this reporting requirement are set out in the Key audit matters table above and identified as relating to the 3 Es conclusion. We determined that there were no matters to report as a result of this requirement. Other matters on which we report by exception We are required to report to you if: The statement given by the directors on page 78, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators, and other stakeholders to assess the Trust's performance, business model, and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Trust acquired in the course of performing our audit. The section of the Annual report on page 76, as required by provision C.3.9 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. The Annual Governance Statement does not meet the disclosure requirements set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2019/20 or is misleading or inconsistent with our knowledge acquired in the course of performing our audit. We have not considered whether the Annual Governance Statement addresses all risks and controls or that risk s are satisfactorily addressed by internal controls. We have referred a matter to Monitor under Schedule 10 (6) of the National Health Service Act 2006 because we had reason to believe that the Trust, or a director or officer of the Trust, was about to mak e, or had made, a decision which involved or would involve the incurring of expenditure that was unlawful, or was about to take, or had taken a course of action which, if followed to its conclusion, would be unlawful and likely to cause a loss or deficienc y. We have issued a report in the public interest under Schedule 10 (3) of the National Health Service Act 2006. We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this respon sibility. Certificate We certify that we have completed the audit of the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 5 of Part 2 to the National Health Service Act 2006 and the Code of Audit Practice.
