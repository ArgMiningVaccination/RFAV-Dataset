He is the President-Elect for the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery. Dr. Ojemann's clinical focus is on the surgical treatment of epilepsy and tumors near eloquent cortex along with general pediatric neurosurgery. After 10 years as head of the Division of Neurosurgery, he became Surgeon-in-Chief in 2019 and focuses on building strong teams to provide care to children in our community with the most complex medical conditions. - Related Resources - - - - When we found out that our child would need brain surgery to help with his epilepsy, as parents, were completely terrified. Although every surgeon at Seattle children's is very qualified, Dr. Ojemann was the hero that we begged to perform our sons surgery. It was initially very intimidating to meet with him as this is the man that we must trust and take our son into surgery. My first experience with Dr. Ojemann was \"this is a man who is here to help and is very good at his perfected skill\". He was very detailed in his surgery plan and spoke with us as though our son was the only patient he had. When surgery time came, I wanted to just take my son home, Dr. Ojemann assured me that he would take excellent care of our precious son and that this surgery is what he needs. I can't say that I was excited for surgery but I can say at that time I felt pure relief that Dr. Ojemann was the man to help my son. I can't put into words what this man has done for my son and our family, but I can hope that anyone who reads this will understand that this man has been a hero to our family. We can't thank him enough for the time and work that he put into our son. If you ever find yourself in need of a neurosurgeon, you would be crazy to lol any further than Dr. Ojemann. He is a true blessing for children. - Dr. Ojemann operated on my son's spinal cord when he was 14 months old. In the months leading up to the surgery, at various pre-operation appointments, Dr. Ojemann was always kind and compassionate. He was calm and gracious with his time, listening and validating the many concerns of two anxious parents. He is very matter of fact in his delivery, and provided us with concrete facts, statistics, and analogies that left us feeling understood and prepared going into surgery, rather than confused. The same goes for post op, where he met with us briefly and explained the procedural outcomes, and recovery in a comforting, compassionate way. We are grateful for his wisdom and expertise. - Monday November 19,2007 was finally the last day of my epilepsy thanks to this amazing doctor. I thank god so much for finding this doctor to do my brain surgery. I am bilingual in spanish. He took the time to explain to me the process on how they wouldn't wake me up to speak spanish . I am 32 years old and i can say after my surgery i feel perfect. I am finally able to brush my hair. - Dr. Ojemann operated on my 5 year old son in October 2015 and removed a recurrence of an ependymoma brain tumor that had grown from the 4th ventricle and partially attached itself to the brain stem. The doctor which had performed the original operation back in 2012 declined to operate because of the delicate nature and tumor location. His brain surgery was performed on a Tuesday with my son feeling well enough to leave only two days later. There was no morbidity from the surgery. I am thankful to this man and his stellar team for saving my sons life! - Our daughter was diagnosed with a tumor in her right temporal lobe, adjacent to her basal ganglia. Surgery was the only course of action that made sense, and at the time we did not know if the tumor would be benign, or malignant. We were referred locally to Dr. Ojemann, but having just moved to Seattle, we didn't know a lot about the capabilities for this specialty in the region. My wife had worked in the health care field on the East Coast for years, so she was able to connect us with the leading neurosurgeons in the world at Johns Hopkins, and we were able to see others neurosurgeons in San Francisco. At the end of the day, we went with Dr. Ojemann, as he was well respected by these other neurosurgeons, and he was very accommodating with our endless questions and nation-wide search. For the surgery, Dr. Ojemann did an exceptional job. He showed very good judgment in going after enough of the tumor/normal tissue zone to remove the bad stuff, but not so much that he risked cutting into the basal ganglia. His bedside manner was also exceptional. We are very happy with our choice of having had the procedure done by Dr. Ojemann at Seattle Children's and we are very happy to know that we weren't \"settling\" for a surgeon who happened to be near us. It is our impression that Dr. Ojemann is one of the best in the country, if not the world. He certainly delivered for our little girl, and for that we always remain grateful for his skill, demeanor, and compassion. Brian and Anna - DR.Jeffrey Ojemann is a great man not much more to say other than thank you sir - In 2006 our daughter had an MRI that indicated a mass in her brain. We met with Dr. Ojemann and, at first, I was intimidated. He is initially a rather serious guy and being a rather scared parent (and having never met a neurosurgeon), I thought he was a bit distant. But, after seeing Dr. Ojemann repeatedly over the years, my initial impressions couldn't have been more incorrect. Dr. Ojemann saved our daughter's life. He performed a very dangerous, complicated brain biopsy that resulted not only in her diagnosis, but also halted a life-threatening issue. Dr. Ojemann was kind, compassionate, thoughtful, realistic and transparent. We feel an overwhelming sense of appreciation for what Dr. Ojemann did for us. Our daughter is now a healthy 17 year old and applying for college. This would not be possible without the professional skills and commitment of Dr. Ojemann. - Dr. Jeffrey Ojemann and his Neurosurgery team; Dr. Luke Tomycz, Dr. Robert Oxford, Dr. Sean McEvoy and Dr. Wally Krengel in the Orthopedic dept. are the most amazing set of doctors I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Not only did they diagnose my 12 month old son with a difficult syndrome to find; Klippel-Feil Syndrome which is a rare cervical bone disorder, they were able to operate and save him from being a quadriplegic with a breathing tube. Now he will have the ability to be a healthy kid that can walk, talk, play sports, dance; whatever he decides he wants to do!! My husband and I can't thank these doctors enough and will consider them an integral part of our family! Not only were our doctors awesome the nurses in the ICU and on the surgical floor made our experience at Children's the best it could have possibly been. Thank you! - I will make this short and sweet: Dr. Jeffrey Ojemann has been absolutely wonderful to my son and my family throughout a very long ordeal. I have felt cared for, listened to and respected by Dr. Ojemann every step of the way. His skill is unsurpassed, his humanity and humility are beyond reproach, and his gentle caring demeanor is a blessing. We feel so fortunate to have Seattle Children's so close and to have found Dr. Ojemann. Thank you is all I can say and it will never be enough. - Dr. Ojemann is an amazing pediatric neurosurgeon - competent, qualified, and caring. He performed the brain surgery on our son that has changed his life forever. Our son went from being profoundly delayed as 11 month old with a future of continual neurological regression to an almost normally-developing 2 1/2 year old who has normal language skills, normal social skills, and mostly normal gross motor skills. His fine motor skills are still delayed, but his is making rapid advancements in that domain also. Even though Dr. Ojemann told us it might be too late to effect a change, and that the seizure activity had spread, Dr. Ojemann still felt that it was important and necessary for our baby to have surgery as soon as possible. He made it a priority for our son to have surgery as quickly as possible, and cautioned us not to wait, but to act immediately. While it was difficult to hand our baby over to the doctors for surgery, we knew that Dr. Ojemann would take good care of him, and we knew that Dr. Ojemann would be as careful with our baby as he would if it were his own child. There are always risks with brain surgery, but the neurosurgery team is so excellent at Seattle Children's, that your child will be safe and well cared-for, and in this way, surgical risks are minimized. I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Ojemann. He is a top-notch neurosurgeon who is humble enough to be willing to refer you to other neurosurgeons if need be. Every day when we look at our son, and how incredible his progress has been, we are reminded of Dr. Ojemann, are grateful to him, and thankful to God for placing him in our lives. By the pure grace of God, Drs. Ojemann, Novotny, and Senato were instrumental in giving our son the chance to walk, talk, climb, explore, and develop normally. Thank you, God for Seattle Children's, and for these amazing, incredible, and wonderful doctors! We praise God for the blessing of their intelligence, their skill, their competence, and knowledge. We also thank them for their understanding, their compassion, and their ability to relate to parents' concerns. Without Dr. Ojemann, our son would have lived a very different life. We are constantly awed and amazed by the miracle of our son's continued healing and progress, and we thank God for this incredible miracle. Dr. Ojemann told us that some parents opt to forgo this surgery because of its risks and the possibility that it might not be successful or only minimally successful, but I would encourage parents to take the leap of faith and have the surgery, and have confidence that Dr. Ojemann will give your child the best possible outcome. Thank you, Dr. Ojemann, for your care and concern for our son! - While I would never want any other family to have an experience that would lead them to Dr. Ojemann, if you find yourself in need of a caring and knowledgeable neuro surgeon, he is the one you want. He took the time to answer all of our questions, big and small. Our daughter's surgery went well and she recovered quickly. He even took the time to stay late so that we would know the results of the post op MRI. We are so thankful to have our daughter in the care of such a great doctor. Thank you doesn't say enough. - Dr. Ojemann operated on my daughter in 05 and then in 10 when she had a second tumor. He is now treating her for the third tumor... we are so blessed to have such a kind, compassionate and capable doctor in our own back yard so to speak. We have become aware of all the patients that fly here from all around the world to be treated by Dr. Ojemann and we certainly understand why. We have always been treated with respect, compassion and the same comfort that others have explained. I cannot stress enough how reassuring it is to have the undivided attention and straight forward answers Dr. Ojemann delivers. A sense of calm in an otherwise senseless storm of terror when you first become aware of your child's condition. He addresses my daughter and her concerns. even when she was 6 which pulls her into the mix and empowers her to take charge of her own outcome, that is priceless. If I had to say who my favorite person in the wold is.......... Jeffery Ojemann.... the man who has saved my daughters life and continues to care for her in the most positive way possible. - Our 7-year old son is under the care of Dr. Ojemann. He is very professional and friendly to patients and family. Of course technically we believe he is also one of the top doctors in the field. We are very comfotable and confident with Dr. Ojemann's care of our son. We are very grateful to him and Seattle Children's! - Our son started having seizures when he was 6 months old. After a MRI showed a small mass in his right front lobe we were introduced to Dr Ojemann to explore surgical options. Dr. Ojemann took his time with us, somehow he makes you feel as if you are his only patient. He answered all of our questions and explained the procedure in a clear easy to understand manner. Dr Ojemann operated on our 3 yr old son in September 2010. We are happy to say the surgery was a great success and recovery for our son was a breeze! We feel so blessed to be touched by such an angel...Thank you, we are forever grateful. - Dr. Ojemann has operated on my son a total of 5 times. (2, 2-part brain surgeries, and one VNS implant). He has ALWAYS taken the time to sit down and explain every proceedure, and the risks and benefits of everything we've done. He has respected our decisions and answered all of our questions with openness and honesty. He is the kind of doctor that treats you like you are the only patient he has when he is with you. The surgeries themselves always went smoothly, and he kept us updated throughout everything. We felt like our son was in very very capable hands throughout his surgeries and recoveries. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2021 Seattle Magazine 2022 Seattle Met's 2020 Top Doctors Seattle Met Magazine 2020 Seattle Top Doctor - 2019 Seattle Magazine 2019 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2018 Seattle Magazine 2018 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2017 Seattle Magazine 2017 SEATTLE MAGAZINE TOP DOCTOR - 2016 Seattle Magazine 2016 Seattles Top Doctor 2016 Seattle Met Magazine 2016 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2015 Seattle Met Magazine 2015 SEATTLE MAGAZINE TOP DOCTOR - 2015 Seattle Magazine 2015 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2014 Seattle Metropolitan Magazine 2014 SEATTLE MAGAZINE TOP DOCTOR - 2014 Seattle Magazine 2014 Seattle's Top Doc Seattle Met Magazine 2013 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2013 Seattle Magazine 2013 U.S. News Top Doctor U.S. News and World Report 2012 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2012 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2012 Seattle Magazine 2012 Top Doctor 2021 Seattle Magazine - Other Publications - Guler S, Dannhauer M, Roig-Solvas B, Gkogkidis A, Macleod R, Ball T, Ojemann JG, Brooks DHComputationally optimized ECoG stimulation with local safety constraints. 29427847 NeuroImage, 2018 Feb 7 : 17335-48 - Weaver Novotny EJ, Olson JD, TJ, Ojemann JGElectrocorticography and the early maturation of high-frequency suppression within the default mode network. 29192865 Journal of neurosurgery.
