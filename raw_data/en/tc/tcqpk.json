blocking vaccines Total Measures individual -level impact of vaccination program Overall Measures population -level impact of vaccination programStudy endpoints Study endpoints should be selected to support the broader intended use of the vaccine Typically a single primary endpoint and up to 3 or 4 secondary endpoints are defined in a study protocol The ideal primary endpoint should directly measure the disease -related outcome of public health interest The most common primary endpoint is clinical disease with laboratory confirmation as public health interest is in lessening disease There are examples of vaccines that have been shown to prevent disease but not infection, including rubella, mumps, measles, and polio Alternative endpoints or considered under certain circumstancesStudy endpoints -description Endpoint Description Clinical disease with laboratory confirmationLaboratory assays used to confirm infection (e.g. PCR) or confirm seroconversion (e.g. ELISA) Most reliable, especially if symptoms are non - specific May have reduced sensitivity if pathogen is only detectable for a limited period of time Clinical disease without laboratory confirmationPathogen should have a highly distinct clinical syndrome May be necessary in settings with limited laboratory infrastructure Studies should consider using laboratory confirmation on a validation subsetStudy endpoints -description Endpoint Description Infection Limited value because infection alone is rarely the outcome of public health interest Useful for diseases with long latent periods May serve as a replacement endpoint (e.g. Zika congenital syndrome) Can increase event rate for diseases with high asymptomatic rate May be difficult to measure unless there is a test of seroconversion that can distinguish between natural -and vaccine -induced immunity Disease severity or complication of interestEndpoint may be rare and make powering the study difficult Rates of severe disease may be confounded by changes in patient care over timeStudy endpoint -examples Disease Endpoint Reference Dengue Virologically confirmed symptomatic disease, regardless of the severity of illness or infecting serotypeVillar et al. 2015 NEJM HIV Laboratory -confirmed neoplasia, or cervical cancerSchiller et al. 2012 VaccineStudy analysis period We only observe illness (symptom) onset times Time of infection is typically unknown The difference between these two events is known as the incubation period Events occurring immediately after vaccination may be attributable to infections that occurred before vaccination Vaccines are also not immediately protective A period of immune ramp -up is required to reach peak efficacy Including these early events in the primary analysis can bias efficacy towards the null Further discussion in Dean et al. 2018 Annals of Applied StatisticsIntention -to-treat or per protocol Intention -to-treat (ITT) Includes all participants regardless of protocol violations (e.g. failure to receive all doses of the vaccine) Includes cases immediately from time of randomization/vaccination Per protocol Includes only participants receiving all doses per protocol Includes only cases with symptom onset occurring after the last dose, plus an additional delay period reflecting the incubation and immune ramp -up periods Modified intention -to-treat Originally intended to refer to ITT analysis in which individuals determined to already be infected at baseline are excludedRandomized trialsClinical trial phases Vaccine effect Description Phase 1 Typically 30 -100 healthy human volunteers Study different doses and/or vaccine schedules Primarily focus on safety/tolerability Preliminary assessment of immunogenicity Phase 2 Larger and more targeted population Safety and immunogenicity data Limited data on efficacy Phase 3 Typically thousands of participants Establish field efficacy Establish safety Phase 4 Post -licensure surveillance Detect rare adverse eventsComparator arm Placebo Active control -licensed vaccine for some other geographically relevant indication that does not affect the probability of the study endpoint Delayed vaccination Another vaccine candidate (non -inferiority) Other vaccine candidate should have established efficacy Non -inferiority trial estimates relative vaccine efficacyIndividually randomized trials - overview Individuals within the same population(s) are randomized to receive either vaccine or control Because large sample sizes are typically required due to low disease incidence, most are multi -center trials Individually randomized trials achieve the best overall balance of measured and unmeasured confoundersIndividually randomized trials - analysis The analysis is handled with a standard comparison of two independent groups using proportions, rates, or time to event methods For multi -site trials, individuals within sites may have similar outcomes, so the analysis should account for within -site correlation Adjusting for site improves precision because there may be significant variability in disease incidence across sites Options include regression with site as a fixed effect or shared random effect, a stratified analysis, or a conditional regression model treating site as a nuisance variable The primary analysis estimates the direct effect of vaccinationVac NonvacNonvacOverall Direct Indirect TotalIntervention Population: Two large individually -randomized multi -center Phase 3 trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a recombinant, live -attenuated, tetravalent candidate dengue vaccine (CYD -TDV) One trial was conducted at twelve centers in five Asian Pacific countries (Capeding et al. 2014), and the other trial was conducted at twenty -two centers in five Latin American countries (Villar et al. 2015). Healthy children were individually randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive three doses of vaccine or placebo at 0, 6, and 12 months Participants were followed using active surveillance for 25 months following the first dose The primary endpoint was symptomatic, virologically -confirmed dengue occurring between months 13 and 25 measured per protocolDengue vaccine trial Estimated that 20,875 children needed to identify 57 cases of virologically confirmed dengue To achieve power of 90% or more to show vaccine efficacy of more than 25% (lower boundary of confidence interval more than 25%) Assume a true vaccine efficacy of 70% after three injections One-sided alpha level of 2.5% Dropout rate of 20% Disease incidence of 0.64% Conducted modified per protocol analysis, starting 28 days after the third injection in all participants who received three doses, regardless of protocol deviations Calculated vaccine efficacy as 1 -incidence rate ratioParallel cluster randomized trials -overview Clusters of individuals are randomized as a unit to vaccine or control Parallel means that clusters are randomized to one arm and this allocation does not change during the study Clusters should be well -defined, stable, self -contained, and non - overlapping Movement or transmission between clusters is referred to as contamination Choices for clusters include communities, villages, households, worksites, schools, medical centers/hospitalsParallel cluster randomized trials -design Outcomes within individuals are expected to be correlated This is referred to as intracluster or intraclass correlation , and it is measured by intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) =Variance between clusters Variance withinclusters+Variance between clusters When the ICC is high, it is especially important to sample more, smaller clusters rather than sampling few, larger clusters The design effect quantifies how much larger a cluster randomized trial must be as compared to a comparable individually randomized trial Let be the number of participants per cluster =1+1 It is necessary to estimate ICC from previous studiesParallel cluster randomized trials -design Cluster randomized trials are more subject to baseline imbalance because there are fewer randomized units Trialists may consider stratified randomization or matching using cluster -level covariates to reduce the chance of severe imbalance Common covariates include cluster size and geographic area The number of stratification/matching factors should be limited as they add model complexity and reduce model degrees of freedom For matched designs, there is a further risk of unmatched clustersParallel cluster randomized trials -analysis Trial analysis can be conducted at the cluster level, treating each cluster as the unit of analysis More commonly, analysis is conducted at the individual level adjusting for correlation between individuals within the same cluster Mixed effects model with a cluster -level random effect Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a robust variance estimator Adjusting for cluster decreases precision but is necessary to maintain type 1 error The primary analysis returns an estimate of total vaccine effectiveness Indirect and overall vaccine effectiveness are also observable if data on other cluster members is collectedVaccinated participantsUnvaccinated non-participantsUnvaccinated participantsUnvaccinated non-participantsVaccinated clusters Unvaccinated clusters Overall vaccine effectiveness Total vaccine effectiveness Indirect vaccine effectivenessTyphoid vaccine trial The efficacy of a single dose of the Vi polysaccharide typhoid vaccine was evaluated in a Phase 4 parallel cluster randomized trial in slum - dwelling residents of Kolkata, India The study area encompassing most of two wards in Eastern Kolkata was partitioned into 80 contiguous geographic clusters Clusters were divided into eight strata according to ward, the number of residents who were 18 years of age or younger (<200 vs. 200), and the number of residents who were older than 18 years (<500 vs. 500) Stratified randomization was used to allocate clusters to receive the Vi typhoid vaccine or hepatitis A vaccine Cluster members 2 years of age or older were targeted for vaccinationTyphoid vaccine trial Vaccine coverage in clusters was about 60% The endpoint of interest was laboratory -confirmed typhoid fever The primary outcome was total vaccine effectiveness The secondary outcomes were indirect and overall vaccine protection Cox proportional hazards models were fit to individual data, and standard errors were adjusted using a robust variance estimator A set of analyses adjusting for the stratifying variables and other key - individual -level covariates were also conductedStepped wedge cluster randomized trials -overview All clusters commence the trial in the control arm The intervention is then introduced gradually at regular intervals until it is in place in all clusters The order of roll -out is randomized to support principled inference Stepped wedge designs are sometimes also referred to as one -way crossover trials or phased implementation designs This design is adopted in settings where there is already considerable evidence that the vaccine will have a beneficial effect If the vaccine cannot be delivered simultaneously in a large area, either for logistical reasons or insufficient supply, random selection is a fair way to determine the order of roll -outStepped wedge cluster randomized trials -design It is necessary to specify: The size of the clusters The number of clusters receiving the intervention per step The number of steps The length of time between successive crossover points (step length) The rollout period (baseline data collection before first crossover) Like parallel cluster randomized trials, the sample size must be inflated by the trial design effect Simulation studies may be worthwhile for estimating power because of the complexity of designing stepped wedge trialsStepped wedge cluster randomized trials -analysis A standard two -arm comparison is not possible because clusters change allocation over time A simple before vs. after approach cannot be adopted because of secular time trends The analysis either takes a horizontal or vertical approach In the horizontal approach, time trends are explicitly modeled Susceptible to model misspecification In the vertical approach, time is conditioned out as a nuisance Comparisons are only made within time steps This approach does not use all available data (e.g. periods when everyone is unvaccinated and when everyone is vaccinated) Same estimands as parallel cluster randomized trialsHepatitis B vaccine study The Gambia Hepatitis Intervention Study evaluated the long -term effects of infant hepatitis B vaccination on preventing chronic liver disease and liver cancer Seventeen vaccination teams were each assigned a portion of 104 vaccine delivery points that were visited at least once every two weeks to conduct routine immunizations Every 10 -12 weeks, a new vaccination team was instructed to introduce hepatitis B vaccine, with teams selected in randomized order After a four -year period, all delivery points included hepatitis B in routine vaccinationHepatitis B vaccine study The statistical analysis used a vertical approach, dividing time into three month time periods and comparing outcomes for vaccinated and unvaccinated children As the primary endpoints were long -term endpoints (chronic liver disease and liver cancer), over 20 years of follow -up have been conducted so far, and the trial is ongoingTwo-stage randomization designs -overview Clusters are first randomized to some fixed level of vaccine coverage (e.g. low = 20% or high = 80%) Individuals are then randomized within each cluster based on the coverage level determined in the first stage This design is also referred to as two -step randomization, split designs -analysis It is one of the only designs to support estimation of both direct and indirect vaccine effects For detecting major effects, two -stage designs are less powerful than individually randomized and parallel cluster randomized trials Standard designs offer a sharper contrast between trial arms This design is complex, and it has not been used for vaccine trials in practiceTrials with multiple vaccine candidates -overview Trials may be designed to include multiple experimental vaccines and a pooled control arm The same trial infrastructure is used and so may require fewer resources than multiple, independent two -arm trials This design facilitates direct comparison between the candidates This approach works best when the vaccines have similar target populationsTrials with multiple vaccine candidates -extensions Trials could include adaptive strategies to drop poorly performing candidates More common in Phase 2 trials Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may be formally combined into Phase 2/3 trials These are also known as seamless Phase 2/3, \"discovery into confirmatory\", or \"combined -phase\" trials Phase 2: safety and immunogenicity data in a limited and focused study population; may include a preliminary assessment of efficacy Phase 3: large trial to collect data on safety and vaccine efficacy Analysis of the Phase 2 trial provides a clear \"GO\" or \"NO GO\" decision for how to proceed to the next phase, following a decision -making strategy defined in the protocolTrials with multiple vaccine candidates -extensions Phase 2/3 trials can be inferentially or operationally seamless Inferentially seamless: data from the Phase 2 portion contribute to the Phase 3 analysis Operationally seamless: data from each portion are analyzed separately A natural application of this approach is to evaluate multiple vaccine candidates in Phase 2, with only the most promising being advanced to Phase 3 Gilbert et al. (JID 2011) described a Phase 2b design strategy for simultaneously evaluating multiple prime -boost HIV vaccine regimens against a shared placebo group The design uses sequential monitoring to drop vaccines with evidence of poor safety or efficacy The trial design has not yet been implemented in the fieldEffectiveness trials -overview Vaccine efficacy can be distinguished from vaccine effectiveness Vaccine efficacy = the intrinsic vaccine effect measured in an idealized setting Vaccine effectiveness = vaccine effect measured in a real world setting Vaccine effectiveness trials are population -specific trials that focus on estimating the public health impact of the vaccine under non -idealized settings E.g. difficulty maintaining a cold chain Results are not generalizable but could support country -specific licensure and provide useful information to local policy makersRotavirus vaccine trial 142 villages in Matlab, Bangladesh were cluster -randomized (1:1) to two doses of human rotavirus vaccine at 6 and 10 weeks of age or control Surveillance was conducted to identify children less than 2 years of age presenting with acute laboratory -confirmed rotavirus diarrhea during the trial period Overall effectiveness of the vaccine program was measured by comparing the incidence rate of disease among all children age -eligible for vaccination in villages where vaccine was introduced compared to villages were vaccine was not introduced Total effectiveness among vaccinees and indirect effectiveness were also evaluatedRotavirus vaccine trial Sample size For the primary objective, assumed an overall effectiveness of 50% For a comparable individually randomized trial, 77 outcomes among all age - eligible infants would have been required to ensure that the study had a minimum power of 80% to rule out a lower bound of the two -sided 95% CI of zero Estimated intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.02 With an average of 65 children younger than 2 years in each cluster, the design effect was 3.48 Total number of outcomes required is 268 Assuming a 3.5% cumulative incidence in control villages during the study period, a total sample size of 10,210 infants (5,105) in each group was estimatedCoverage was 73.7% in villages randomized to vaccineFor the estimation of total vaccine effectiveness, an intention -to-treat like approach was used that disregarded actual receipt of vaccine An analysis was also conducted \"According to Protocol\" (ATP) Case -control studies - overview Case -control studies are conducted by enrolling disease cases and comparable disease -free controls and comparing vaccination status Disease Nodisease Total Vax Unvax Disease Nodisease Vax Unvax Total Cohort study Case -control study = Case -control studies -design Studies can be prospectively integrated into a surveillance program, enrolling cases and controls over time Studies can be entirely retrospective, using diagnostic or electronic health records Cases should be detected using a highly specific test or case definition Inclusion of false positives biases vaccine effectiveness towards the null, especially if the false positive rate varies over time or placeCase -control studies -design Validity of inference depends heavily on the quality of the controls Controls should Have the same risk of exposure to the target pathogen as the cases Be similarly susceptible to the disease before vaccination Be recruited independently of vaccination status Have the same access to medical care and vaccination Healthy community controls are often selected from the same source populations A good rule of thumb for selecting a control is that if a control developed the disease of interest, he or she would become a case in the studyCase -control studies -design Cases and control may be matched for key confounders linked to both vaccination and disease E.g. age, gender, socioeconomic status, geography For rare outcomes, multiple controls may be matched to a single case The case -control design does not work well if only a small proportion of the source population is vaccinated because vaccination rates will be low among both cases and control By the same logic, challenging if vaccine coverage is very high Case -control designs are especially useful when the outcome is rare because the population analyzed is enriched with cases Much more cost -effective than a large, prospective cohortCholera vaccine study Between April and June 2012, a reactive cholera vaccination campaign was implemented in Haiti with an inactivated bivalent whole -cell vaccine Investigators conducted a case -control study to evaluate vaccine effectiveness Study included residents of Bocozel or Grand Saline who were eligible for the vaccination campaign (e.g. age 12 months, not pregnant) Cases had acute watery diarrhea, sought treatment at one of three participating cholera treatment units, and were culture -positive for cholera Community health workers were trained to refer acute cases to treatment units, and these cases were asked to participate in the studyCholera vaccine study For each case, four controls who did not seek treatment for watery diarrhea were selected Matched for location of residence, enrolment time (within 2 weeks of case), and age (1 -4 years, 5 -15 years, and >15 years) Individuals who reported receipt of at least one dose of the vaccine were asked to produce their vaccine card as verification Vaccine registries were used to verify vaccination status for individuals who reported vaccination but could not produce a vaccine card Analyzed data by conditional logistic regression, adjusting for matching factors To assess potential bias, they conducted a parallel analysis of vaccine effectiveness on non -cholera diarrheaTest-negative studies It is difficult to control for confounding due to differential access to care and health -seeking behavior in case -control studies In test -negative studies, controls are selected form the pool of people who are tested for the pathogen of interest but test negative By restricting the study population to individuals meeting the clinical case definition who receive testing, controls are expected to have similar health -seeking behavior Direct vaccine effectiveness is estimated as one minus the odds ratio of vaccination for positive -testing cases versus negative -testing controlsTest-negative studies A central assumption is that vaccination does not confer cross - protection to other diseases with similar symptoms A highly specific test is required to reduce bias in estimated vaccine efficacy Test-negative designs can be easily embedded into existing surveillance programsFlu vaccine study The US annually evaluated effectiveness of vaccines for preventing medically attended acute respiratory illness caused by influenza Patients with acute respiratory illness of 7 days duration were enrolled at participating ambulatory care facilities in five communities Washington, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas Influenza infection was confirmed by RT -PCR Receipt of influenza vaccine was defined based on medical records or immunization registries Vaccine effectiveness was calculated from a logistic regression model for vaccination, with and without adjustment for key covariates Network center, age, sex, race/ethnicity, high -risk health status, self -rated health status, number of days between illness onset and specimen collection, calendar timeThank you "}
