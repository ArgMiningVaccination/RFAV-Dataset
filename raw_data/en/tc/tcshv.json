Trial of Essiac to Ascertain Its Effect in Women with Breast Cancer (TEA-BC) SUZANNA M. ZICK, N.D., M.P.H.,1ANANDA Ph.D.5 ABSTRACT Background: Breast cancer is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and medical expenditures among women in Canada. Essiac (Resperin Canada Limited, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada), a blend of at least four herbs (bur-dock root [ Arctium lappa ], sheep sorrel [ Rumex acetosella ], and the inner bark of slippery elm [ Ulmus fulva or U. rubra ]), has become one of the more popular herbal remedies for breast- cancer treatment, secondary prevention, improving quality of life, and controlling negative side-effects of con-ventional breast-cancer treatment. Objectives: Our primary objective was to determine the difference in health-related quality of life (HR- QOL), as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast Cancer Version, between womenwho are new Essiac users (since breast cancer diagnosis) and those who have never used Essiac. Secondaryendpoints included differences in depression, anxiety, fatigue, rate of adverse events, and prevalence of com-plications or benefits associated with Essiac during standard breast-cancer treatment. Additionally, we describedthe pattern of use of Essiac in this cohort of women. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study in 510 women, randomly chosen from the Ontario Can- cer Tumour Registry, with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer in 2003. Results: With the exception changes in a Physical well-being subscale and a relationship with doctor sub- scale, Essiac did not have a significant effect on HR-QOL or mood states. Even for Physical well-being andrelationship with doctor, Essiac seemed to have a negative effect, with Essiac users doing worse than the non-Essiac users. This might be attributed to the fact that the group of users comprised younger women with moreadvanced stages of breast cancer, and both of these subgroups of patients have been shown to be at a signifi-cantly increased risk for negative mood states and/or a decreased sense of well-being. The women were takinglow doses (total daily dose 43.6 /H1100630.8 mL) of Essiac that corresponded to the label directions found on most Essiac products. Friends were the most common source of information, and most women were taking Essiacto boost their immune systems or increase their chances of survival. Only 2 women reported minor adverseevents, whereas numerous women reported beneficial effects of Essiac. Conclusions: Essiac does not appear to improve HR-QOL or mood states. Future studies are needed to de- termine whether other clinical outcomes, such as cancer reoccurrence, are affected by Essiac. 9711Integrative Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. 2Center for Statistical Consulting and Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. 3Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. 4Orchard Lake, MI. 5Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. INTRODUCTION The importance of breast cancer in women as a public health problem is well-recognized worldwide.1,2In Canadian women, breast cancer is the most common neo-plasm, with a lifetime risk calculated as 1 in 9. 3As a result of mammographic screening, early detection of disease, andimproved therapies, the rate of breast cancer-mortality issteadily declining in Canada. 3Nonetheless, in 2005, it is es- timated that 21,600 women were diagnosed and 5300women died of this disease. 3Furthermore, Ontario had the highest incidence of breast cancer cases in Canada, with8200 of the 21,600 new cases in 2005. 3 Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) is becoming an increasingly important endpoint for assessing treatment andmanagement in breast cancer. 4,5Conventional endpoints for evaluating cancer treatments include disease-free survivaltime, tumor response, and overall survival. Over time, how-ever, it has become evident that these endpoints alone arenot adequate to make informed decisions about treatmentoptions for breast cancer. Measurements of HR-QOL arerecognized as comprising a more complete assessment ofpatients' physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well-be-ing. 5,6Additionally, HR-QOL measures may provide prog- nostic information independent of other parameters such asdisease severity, 6,7and some scales have been found to be significantly associated with patients' survival.4Further- more, HR-QOL scales help to measure the effects of theseverity as well as the duration of toxic side effects fromtreatment (e.g., neuropathy) augmenting information re-ceived from conventional toxicity scales. 6 There have been numerous recent surveys of comple- mentary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among pa-tients with breast cancer in the United States, Britain, andCanada. 8-13Survey results among patients with breast can- cer find that prevalence of CAM use ranges from 16.5% to84%. 8-13In a study examining the prevalence of CAM use among Ontario women with breast cancer, 67% of thewomen surveyed used some form of alternative therapies.Of these women, almost 15% used Essiac (ResperinCanada Limited, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada), an herbal rem-edy, which was the second most commonly used naturalhealth product after green tea ( Camellia sinensis ) (17.3%). 8 Moreover, in the United States, a survey of Flor-Essence\u00ae (an Essiac formula, Flora Manufacturing and Distributing, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada) users found that, of5051 respondents, 22% had breast cancer. 14,15An estimate of annual U.S. Essiac sales exceeded $8 million in 2001.14 An international study conducted by the Canadian CancerSociety's Cancer Information Services (CIS) to identify theinformation needs of those who called CIS requesting in-formation on CAM found that, of the 109 callers, the ma-jority were women (80%), most of their questions concernedthe safety and/or effectiveness of natural health products,and breast cancer was the most common type of cancerqueried (22%). Of these queries, the top CAM topics mostoften about were 714X ( N/H1100517) and Essiac that more cancer-specific in-formation on Essiac use in breast cancer is needed. 16 Essiac has been used in Canada for more than 70 years.17 The recipe for Essiac is said to have been given to a nurse,Rene Caisse, by 1 of her patients who reportedly learned ofthe mixture from an Ojibwa healer and claimed it cured herbreast cancer. Beginning in the 1920s, Caisse administeredEssiac to hundreds of patients with cancer for more than 40years. 17 The original Essiac recipe contained Ulmus fulva or U. rubra ). Caisse administered one of the herbs by injection and the others as a tea. By 1938,however, concerns about the use of Essiac led to an inves-tigation by the Cancer Commission. 17Evidence of 1 report of death and 1 report of toxicity after Essiac tea injec-tions 18,19led to the practice of injecting Essiac herbs being deemed unsafe because of a potential for systemic toxicity.Between 1959 and 1978, Caisse worked in collaborationwith an American physician, Charles Brusch, M.D., adding four additional herbs to the original ( Laminaria digitata ). This new mixture did not require injection and could thus be used at home. Essiac became available to con-sumers in both the 4- and 8-herb varieties in the 1990s. To-day, more than 40 different Essiac formulas are availablethroughout North America, Australia, and the United King-dom. 14 Despite the widespread use of and interest in Essiac among women with breast cancer, there are no publishedclinical trials and very little animal or in vitro work, most of which is also unpublished. Available Essiac research isdifficult to assess because of a lack of information aboutmethodology, differences in Essiac formulations studied,and variance in the experimental animal models in in vivo studies. Anecdotal reports indicate that Essiac may be ofbenefit in the treatment of cancer, but such reports are lim-ited by their subjective and qualitative nature. Much of theresearch conducted is thus restricted by poor design, smallsample size, lack of control, unclear product stability and/orconsistency, and lack of physician cooperation. Given thelimitations to date, a well-designed, population-based studyon the effects of Essiac is warranted. The primary objective of our study was to determine the difference in HR-QOL as assessed by the Functional As-sessment of Cancer Therapy Breast Cancer Version (FACT-B) between women who are new Essiac users since breastcancer diagnosis and those who have never used Essiac. Sec-ondarily, the study was designed to determine the effect ofEssiac in women with a primary diagnosis of breast cancerwho are new Essiac users since breast cancer diagnosis com-pared to women who have never used Essiac on the fol-lowing secondary endpoints:ZICK ET AL. 972 1. Depression, anxiety, and fatigue as measured by the Pro- file of Mood Syndromes (POMS) 2. Prevalence of complications during standard breast can- cer treatment (chemotherapy radiation, surgery, and hor-monal therapy) as determined by self-report 3. Prevalence of any adverse events (e.g., rash, stomach up- set) occurring after standard therapy as determined byself-report. The third objective was to describe Essiac use in women with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer including: 1. Brand used 2. Duration and continuity of use (e.g., used for 3 years but stopped for 1 month during treatment) 3. Frequency and schedule of use (e.g., 1 cup, three times per day) 4. Method of preparation (if applicable)5. When use was initiated and stopped 6. Adverse effects associated with use. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective study design examining the ef- fect of Essiac on women with breast cancer. Women whowere 18 years or older, had been diagnosed with primarybreast cancer (positive pathology report) between 2001 and2003, and able to read and write in English, were eligibleto participate in the study. Any woman who had been diag-nosed with any type of cancer prior to a diagnosis of breastcancer or who had previously used Essiac was excludedfrom the study. The sample was a computer-generated random selection from the Ontario Cancer Registry of those women diagnosedwith primary breast cancer in 2003 ( N/H110052541), subject to the requirements and protocols of the Registry. We attemptedto obtain permission to contact each patient and confirma-tion of current mailing address from her oncologist follow-ing the Registry's protocol. Oncologists who did not respondto a letter requesting permission to contact their patients re-ceived up to three follow-up telephone calls. In total, we re-ceived responses regarding 1453 patients (57.2%) and per-mission to contact 952 patients (37.5%); however, mailing addresses were only available for 877 (34.5%) (Fig. 1). A modified Dillman 20protocol was used to survey the random sample of patients with breast cancer selected fromthe Ontario Cancer Registry. A cover letter, questionnaire,and stamped, self-addressed return envelope were mailed toeach woman in the entire sample ( N/H11005877). Failure to re- spond to the original and two follow-up mailings was con-sidered a refusal to participate in the study. The survey instruments Each woman received a packet that contained 5 surveys including (1) the FACT-B,21which is a 44-item self-ad- ministered, 5-point Likert scale for evaluating functional im-pairment and the perceived effect of that impairment onquality of life; (2) POMS, 22which is a measure of patient distress; (3) Yale Social Support Index (YALE),23which is used to assess the amount and quality of social contact andsupport; (4) Patterns and Use of Essiac, which measureswhether a study participant has used Essiac, which brand,timeline, amount, and adverse effects; and (5) Prevalence ofUse of Complementary/Alternative Therapies, which isbased on a survey developed by Yates et al. 24and modified to be relevant to Canadians.25At the end of the prevalence survey, participants were also asked about any conventionalmedical treatments for their breast cancer, stage of diseaseat diagnosis, current disease state, and demographic data. Statistical analysis Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of Essiac users and non-Essiac users were compared using an inde-pendent samples t-test and a chi-square test, for continuous and categoric variables, respectively. For categoric mea-surements, the chi-square test was replaced by Fisher's ex-act test, whenever the observed percentage in any cross-classified category fell below 10. Frequencies, percentages,and means were calculated to describe the pattern of Essiacuse, who recommended Essiac, and reasons for Essiac use. Summary score for each subscale of FACT-B and POMS was constructed by first computing an itemwise average bydividing the total score by the number of items responded andthen multiplying this average by the total number of items inthe subscale. The scores for individuals who responded to lessthan 75% of the items were considered to be missing. Also,although each subscale has both positively and negativelyframed items, for ease of comparison and interpretation, wereverse coded all positively framed questions, so that a higheraverage score for any scale signified a worse state. For continuous variables (FACT-B, POMS), initial ex- ploratory analysis was carried out using independent sam-ples t-tests comparing women who used Essiac to nonusers.Subsequently, the subscales of FACT-B and POMS wereused as continuous outcomes in a multiple-regression frame-work. For these models, Essiac use (yes/no) was entered intothe equation as an independent variable simultaneouslyESSIAC AND BREAST CANCER 973 No MD Response: 1088 Response from MD: 1088 Ontario Cancer Registry: Denied: 224 Deceased: 73 MD Not Seeing Patient: 204 Permission Received: 952 Address Unknown: 75 Surveys Sent: 877 FIG. 1. Derivation of the sample. along with age, marital status, income, educational status, stage of disease, months since diagnosis, and number of in-dividuals in self-reported social network as reported by theYALE questionnaire to determine their effects on moodstates and HR-QOL. The variables entered into the regres-sion models were chosen primarily because of the generalconsensus among researchers in this area about their poten-tial effects on mood states or HR-QOL outcomes. In all themultiple regression models with FACT-B and POMS sub-scales as outcomes, the residuals demonstrated substantialdeparture from normality, thereby rendering the linear modelan improper fit. We conducted systematic analyses withtransformed models using Box-Cox family of power trans-formations, 26and found that a square-root transformation of the outcomes worked well in linearizing the relationship. Allthe regression results we present in this article are thus forthe square-root transformed models. We found it difficult to treat the FACT-B subscale \"re- lationship with doctor\" as a continuous outcome. This wasprimarily because the subscale is based only on two ques-tions, with many respondents answering 0 to both questions(/H1102250%). Thus we treated this single variable in a logistic regression framework (score /H110050 or positive) with the same predictors as described above. Data were input into SPSS Windows version 12 (SPSS, Chicago, IL), then manipulated and analyzed using bothSPSS and SAS version 9.1. (SAS Institute Inc, Cary NC).A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statisti- cally significant. The study was designed to have 80% power to detect a treatment difference of 7 points in FACT-G, based on pub-lished standard deviations of 13.9-15.9 in similar popula-tions with a mean of 67-91, 27assuming a two-sided /H9251level of 0.05. This design required n/H11005120 per treatment group. RESULTS A total of 541 of surveys were returned. Sixteen (16) fam- ilies contacted us to inform us that the respondents had died,and 57 envelopes were returned marked \"address unknown.\"Thus, our final response rate was 63% (541/(877 /H1100216)). Of the 541 surveys, 31 were deemed to be ineligible, primarilybecause the respondents' dates of diagnosis were before2003, leaving 510 eligible participants. A total of 41 re-spondents (8%) reported using Essiac, of which 32 (6.2%)reported using Essiac for treating their breast cancer. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics We present the sociodemographic and clinical character- istics of women in the study by Essiac use in Table 1.Women who used Essiac were significantly younger (55 ver-sus 62; p/H110050.005) and more likely to be married ( p/H110050.04). In addition, Essiac users were diagnosed with breast cancerat a later stage ( p/H110050.03) and were more likely to have re- ceived chemotherapy ( p/H110050.001). There were no significant differences in ethnicity, educational level, total annualhousehold income, rates of estrogen or progesterone posi-tive cancers, or other-breast cancer treatment options (e.g.,surgery) between women who used Essiac and nonusers. Reasons and patterns of Essiac Women listed a variety of reasons for using Essiac. The three most common reasons for taking Essiac were \"to boostmy immune a re- currence of cancer\" ( N/H1100519/63%). Most women had a friend who recommended to them ( N/H1100513/42%). ( N/H110056/19%) recommend Essiac to them. Only 1 woman decided to takeEssiac from information obtained from the media. Two thirds of the women using Essiac for breast cancer purchased an Essiac product. Although there are more than40 brands available commercially in Ontario, the majorityof women purchased the Essiac ( N/H1100518/75%) brand, which contains the 4-herb blend, with only a few women purchas-ing Flor-Essence ( N/H110054/17%), which contains the 8-herb blend, or other miscellaneous brands ( N/H110053/13%). A quar- ter of the women bought multiple brands of Essiac products(N/H110056/26%). A third of women either made the Essiac tea themselves ( N/H110051/3%) or had someone else make it for them ( N/H110059/31%) (e.g., a family member or nurse). The majority of women took Essiac either once or twice per day ( N/H1100526/93%), with a very small minority taking it three times per day ( N/H110052/7%). The average daily dose of Essiac was 43.6 ( /H1100630.8) and ranged from 12 to 114 mL per day. The mean length of Essiac use was 11.1 ( /H110068.9) months, but ranged anywhere from 1 to 28 months. Adverse events and interactions with breast cancer treatment Only two women reported having adverse effect from tak- ing Essiac, and both of these were complaints of nausea andan unpleasant aftertaste. No women reported that Essiac in-terfered with their breast-cancer treatment. In contrast, 6women reported experiencing positive interactions betweenEssiac and their treatment for breast cancer. Positive inter-actions reported included a decrease in negative side-effects,increased effectiveness, decreased fatigue, and diminishednausea and vomiting from breast cancer treatment. In addi-tion, women also perceived that Essiac allowed them to taketheir treatments in a timely fashion and that Essiac supportedtheir immune systems during treatments. Quality of life and mood states We found that Essiac users and nonusers were significantly different with respect to the FACT-B physical well-beingZICK ET AL. 974 scale, both in the unadjusted analysis (Table 2; pvalue /H11005 0.02) and in the adjusted analysis (Table 2; pvalue /H110050.02). Women who used Essiac reported worse physical well-beingthan the nonusers. We obtained a similar result for the rela-tionship with doctor subscale. In a logistic regression analy-sis, the Essiac user group was found to be marginally worsewith respect to patient-doctor relationship than the nonuserswith an ratio FACT-B sub-scales, no statistically significant difference was obtained be-tween the users and nonusers. In all cases, however, womenwho used Essiac consistently had higher scores, indicatingmore severe symptoms than nonusers.Table 3 indicates the association of other potential con- founders with FACT-B. Age turned out to have significantassociations with physical and emotional well-being, witholder women appearing to cope better than the younger ones.Stage of cancer also had significant associations with thesetwo outcomes, with patients diagnosed with more advancedstage faring worse. Income level has a significant associa-tion with social well-being only. For all subscales, however,the women in the lower-income groups scored higher(worse) on average. The variable \"number of supports\" hadthe strongest association with the FACT-B scale because itwas negatively associated with all the subscales, indicatinga large impact of social support on the HR-QOL.

STD, standard deviation. marital status, and months since diagnosis had no signifi- cant association with any of the subscales. We also found no significant difference in either unad- justed or adjusted analyses for any of the six subscales ofthe POMS between women who used Essiac and womenwho had never used Essiac (Table 4). In general, Essiac usersalso had higher mean scores on four of the POMS subscalesindicating more \"mood\" disturbances, such as anxiety. Table5 shows the effect of various covariates on POMS. Of these,age seemed to have a significant association with most ofthe subscales considered. For example, older women ap-peared to be significantly less anxious, depressed, confused,angry, and fatigued compared to the younger ones on aver-age. As for the FACT-B QOL scales, number of people inwomen's support network also has a large positive impacton the mood states. Both education level and stage of dis-ease have mild impact on the mood states, each being sig-nificantly associated with one of the scales. On the otherhand, income level seems to have a modest impact, withwomen at a lower income category generally at a worse stateof mood than their wealthier counterparts. Once again, sim-ilar to the FACT-B QOL measures, marital status andmonths since diagnosis had no association with the mood states. DISCUSSION We found that 8.1% of Ontario women with breast can- cer take Essiac and, of these women, approximately 75%use Essiac for breast cancer. It is unknown why the 25% ofwomen who were not using Essiac specifically for theirbreast cancer were using the product. The overall percent-age of Essiac users is similar (8.1% vs. 9%) to a previoussurvey conducted by Boon 8in a cohort of women drawn from the Ontario Cancer Registry and diagnosed with breastcancer in 1994 or 1995. In addition, the majority of womenusing Essiac in our study bought either Essiac or Flor-Essence brands and appeared to be taking doses recom-mended on Essiac or Flor-Essence labels. Our study indicated that the doses, frequencies, and brands of Essiac used by the women in this study did nothave any effect on either disease-specific quality of life, asmeasured by the FACT-B, or various mood states includingZICK ET AL. 976 TABLE 2.

This was despite the finding that Es- siac users were significantly worse than regarding physicalwell-being compared to nonusers. We propose that Essiacuse is just a marker of physical distress and not its cause.Instead our data appear to indicate that younger women withmore advanced disease and lacking in a sufficient socialsupport network are more likely to have the worst physicalwell-being and, thus, more likely to try unconventional ther-apies. These findings are not dissimilar to other surveys inwomen with breast cancer in which women with more se-vere disease 13,28-30and younger age8,9,31-34used more CAM therapies. These results are in contrast to those of anunpublished 1977 report of a Phase II clinical study that de-termined that, although Essiac did not offer clinical benefitto patients with cancer in terms of either survival or tumorregression, there were significant subjective improvementsin symptom control and well-being. 17,18,*Also, in 1997, an abstract based on the Meeting Program Proceedings of theAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology identifying 59 pa- tients who had taken Essiac in a retrospective review of 360patients with breast, prostate, or gastrointestinal (GI) can-cer. According to the subjective reports of these patients,30% of patients on Essiac believed that it helped their qual-ity of life. 18There are several possible explanations for the differences in our study findings. First, the women in ourstudy may have been taking doses that were much lower(around 1/4cup per tea daily) than in other studies, and these low doses may have been insufficient to produce a physio-logic effect. Second, the manner in which quality of life wasassessed between the studies was different, with both of theother studies using self-reports and not validated quality-of-life scales. In our study, Essiac's lack of effect on quality of life and mood states may be a true finding, but Essiac could havepositive effects on tumor growth and reoccurrence measuresthat our study was not designed to detect. There is limitedevidence from animal and in vitro studies showing antipro- liferative effects of Essiac in cancer cell lines, although mostof the evidence shows no effect.

Essiac: A treatment for cancer: Report of patients presented to The Royal Cancer Commission of Ontario (Canada).Unpublished report; 1938. generation after receiving Essiac. However, all observations confirming tumor necrosis and cellular degradation in themice were narrative and not documented in terms of histo-logic parameters. 35A recent in vitro study using Essiac and Flor-Essence teas on human tumor cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-468, Jurkat, and HL60 cells) demonstrated that both Es-siac and Flor-Essence herbal teas demonstrated antiprolif-erative and differentiation-inducing properties in vitro only at high concentrations (1/10 and 1/100 dilutions) that are un-likely to be obtained at doses being consumed by humans. 36 In contrast, 6 immunotherapy and 2 chemotherapy tests on2 dried and 1 liquid sample of Essiac provided by Ms. Caisseto the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York,NY (MSKCC) showed no in vivo activity. 37Researchers ad- mit, however, that the negative results might have beencaused by the use of an inappropriate animal system and dif-ficulties encountered in the preparation, administration, andstability of Essiac. 37Furthermore, in another set of 17 stud- ies conducted by MSKCC testing Resperin, a four-herbEssiac blend, in animal leukemia and solid tumor test sys-tems showed no antitumor activity. 37In a similar fashion, the National Cancer Institute tested a liquid Essiac samplein 1983 and found no antitumor activity in the mouse lym-phocytic leukemia P388 tumor system. 37 With more encouraging results, several human studies have noted an improvement in tumor growth after individ-uals took Essiac tea. In a study conducted by an Israeli mar-keter, 20% showed tumor regression and 5% healed com-pletely. This study, however, was not subjected topeer-review. 38In a 1938 unpublished report, Caisse docu- mented the progress of 24 cancer patients taking Essiac. Allpatients experienced either complete or partial \"cure,\" but itis unclear how these outcomes were measured. In 1939, 49 of Caisse's patients gave testimonials to the Canadian Can-cer Commission on Caisse's behalf. Of the eight patientswhose diagnoses were confirmed, the commission con-cluded that only two of the four recoveries could be attrib-uted to Essiac. 39In contrast, a Phase II clinical study deter- mined that Essiac did not offer clinical benefit to cancerpatients in terms of either survival or tumor regression. 17,18,* In the early 1980s, the Canadian Department of NationalHealth and Welfare reviewed data from 86 patient historiessubmitted from 74 of 150 physicians supervising the care ofpatients on Essiac between 1978 and 1982. 40Essiac was shown to have no benefit in 47 patients, 17 patients died, 8were not evaluable based on the information provided, 1demonstrated subjective improvement, 5 required feweranalgesics, 4 had objective responses, and 4 remained sta-ble with respect to disease progression. 41,42Unfortunately, because the majority of these studies are unpublished, it isdifficult to assess the true effect of Essiac on tumor growth and recurrence. The women who used Essiac in our study are similar to patients with breast cancer who have used CAM overall interms of demographic and clinical characteristics. Womenwho used Essiac were significantly younger, were diagnosedwith breast cancer at a later stage, and are more likely to re-ceive chemotherapy. Many other studies in patients withbreast cancer have found that younger age is associated withhigher prevalence of CAM use, 8,9,31-34and several other sur- veys have found significant correlations between CAM useand adjuvant chemotherapy, 8,29,31,32,34and stage of diagno- sis,13,28-30and presence of recurrence or metastasis of can- cer.32,34Women who were taking Essiac did differ from overall CAM users in terms of educational attainment. Incontrast to other surveys in women with breast can-cer, 8,9,12,29,32-34,43in which women with higher levels of ed- ucation were more likely to use CAM, we did not observeany significant difference in education between Essiac usersand nonusers. Women who were taking Essiac also stated reasons that were similar to those of women using other CAM therapiesfor breast cancer. Most women in various surveys, includ-ing ours, stated that they used CAM for some reason relatedto helping their bodies to fight cancer or to boost their im-mune systems, 8,11,30,43as well as to help improve their chance of survival or to decrease the chance of a recurrenceof their cancer and restore hope for the future. 8,11,44Essiac users also tend to get their information about Essiac fromthe same sources as women with breast cancer get their in-formation about other types of CAM: from friends and fam-ily members. 9,30 Women in our study reported only two adverse events in- volving mild GI upset and an unpleasant taste. No womenreported any negative interactions with her conventionalbreast-cancer treatment, whereas several women reportedpositive benefits including decreased side-effects during ra-diotherapy and chemotherapy that they attributed to takingEssiac concurrently with their conventional treatments. Thelack of adverse events and negative interactions with adju-vant cancer treatments in our study is confirmed by exist-ing reports in the literature concerning Essiac lack of toxi-city. Ever since evidence of 1 report of death and one reportof toxicity after Essiac tea injections 18,19in the 1930s, the practice of injecting Essiac herbs has been considered un-safe because of a potential for systemic toxicity. Instead,Ms. Caisse introduced the blend of herbs used today, orally.Preclinical and clinical evaluations of Flor-Essence, one ofthe most popular brands of Essiac tea, have assessed acuteand chronic toxicity, determining no lethal dose level inacute toxicity studies with albino mice and rats, nor any re-nal or hepatic toxicity doses in chronic toxicity tests withalbino mice, rats (doses were 10 times greater than thera-peutic dose at 15 mL/kg), and dogs (doses were five timesgreater than therapeutic dose at 7.5 mL/kg) 39Several stud-ZICK ET AL. 978 Flora Manufacturing and Distributing Files (Unpublished Data): Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the Russian Federa-tion Research & Manufacturing Association Research & Devel-opment Institute of Medical & Aromatic Plants; 1996. ies in humans have also reported no or very few adverse events.18,38When adverse events are reported, they are lim- ited to minor cases of GI upset and unpleasant taste. Con-sequently, it appears that Essiac is safe and relatively toler-able in the doses recommended and consumed in our study. Several limitations of our study need to be addressed. As with any retrospective study, recall bias is a possible limi-tation. However, the women in this study were asked to re-call no more than 2 years into the past and some as little as1 year. Consequently, we posit that only very detailed in-formation such as the exact dose of Essiac would tend to beinaccurately remembered. Another limitation of this studywas the low overall response rate and thus a low number ofEssiac users. The low response rate compared to a previoussurvey in a similar population 8was a result of sending out the survey in summer, when many women were away onholiday, and the establishment of new privacy rules to pro-tect patients. In addition, a switch from paper to electronicrecords by the Ontario Cancer registry made it very diffi-cult to contact potential study participant's primary carepractitioners or oncologists and in association with the pri-vacy laws, made clinic staff reluctant to release patient in-formation. Despite our low number of Essiac users, we were still able to determine meaningful demographic and clinical dif-ferences in these women, as well as establishing patterns ofEssiac dosing. For most of the FACT-B and POMS analy-ses, we have about 40 Essiac users and between 424 and447 nonusers available. A power calculation based on in-dependent samples t-test demonstrate that one is able to de- tect a standardized effect size of 0.46 in the standard devi-ation scale with 80% power and group sizes of 40 and 424(the smallest sizes available for any subscale analyses).Thus, we are able to detect a medium effect size even witha relatively small group of users. Although the general lackof significance in the association of Essiac use with the HR-QOL and mood states could be attributed to the group sizeof users, the data nonetheless are indicative of a worsenedstate of mind in the Essiac group. A larger sample size isunlikely to change any underlying trend in the average dif-ferences. The worse QOL or mood scores in the Essiac users group is perhaps attributable to the fact that this group consists ofyounger women on an average who are diagnosed at an ad-vanced stage of cancer, a subgroup of patients who are at aworse state of mood or sense of well-being. Choice of Es-siac being self-selected, it may be difficult to identify a di-rect effect of Essiac use, be it positive or negative, on QOLor mood states. Despite our study's limitations, this trial provides initial information that future studies can build upon. The resultsof this study suggest several future research directions. Forexample, animal models could be used to investigate thepharmacokinetics of Essiac and whether higher doses areneeded to reach significant concentrations in serum or tar-get tissues. Animal studies could also be used to investigate the effect of Essiac on tumor growth, metastasis, and reoc-currence. Researchers could also use existing large prospec-tive cohorts of women with breast cancer as another way ofinvestigating whether Essiac has an effect on tumor growth,metastasis, and reoccurrence. In addition, a case series inwomen with breast cancer using Essiac could help to pin-point why certain women claim to have such dramatic re-sults and why others do not. A case series could also helpto more clearly define meaningful outcomes that appear tobe changed by Essiac. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, Essiac does not have a significant effect on HR-QOL or mood states such as anxiety or vigor inwomen with breast cancer, although Essiac at the dosestaken appears to be safe.
