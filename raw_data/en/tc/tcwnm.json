Are you tired of the mundane and looking for better meaning in life? Or Are you looking to explore another technique of meditation? Or Something else? Whatever it is, we hope that this article helps you find what you are looking for. Let us dive in! What does spiritual or spirituality mean? As per Google dictionary, the meaning of spirituality is, \"The quality of being concerned with the human spirit or soul as opposed to material or physical things.\" [Spirituality](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/spirituality) is a wide-ranging concept and includes many perspectives. In general, it invites a sense of connection to something bigger than ourselves or connecting with your higher self or higher consciousness. It encourages a search for meaning in life and living life with a broader vision. It has a very universal appeal-something that touches all human beings. People may describe a spiritual experience as sacred or ethereal or mystical or transcendent or simply a deep sense of positive emotions, such as peace, awe, wonder, interconnectedness, contentment, gratitude, acceptance, compassion, unconditional love. These are all the real qualities of our spirit. There are many spiritual traditions across cultures around the world. Most of the traditions recommend having a spiritual guide or a guru who can facilitate your journey of spiritual enlightenment, the final goal of many of these traditional practices. What is spiritual meditation? As the name suggests, spiritual meditation is that which connects you to your spirit. It takes you beyond any limited identities and labels, to the depths of who you truly are. You, as your real Self- joy, love, and peace. With the practice of spiritual meditation, you may experience a shower of grace and bliss, a deep sense of connectedness and oneness. The need to practice spiritual meditation comes from an innate longing to see and think beyond the illusory world as it appears. Spiritual meditation can help you realize the eternal truth and meaning of life. It anchors you in the present moment where you want to be and find solace. Is there any meditation that is not spiritual?! This is such a valid question. For me, meditation is essentially a spiritual practice. Any authentic meditation practice is all about spiritual connection, be it be mantra meditation or breathing meditation, or guided spiritual meditation. If we understand [ what is meditation](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/blog/what-is-meditation-12-ways-it-can-help-you-and-how-to-begin-today) and its real meaning, it simply means connecting to your natural or higher self, the source of love, joy, bliss, peace, pure energy that you are!

There are many meditation techniques out there. It is a maze! Some are authentic, rooted in ancient scriptures, and benefits backed by modern science. While some others are too new, not tested enough, and may not deliver the promised benefits. For the sake of exploration, we may consider spiritual meditation as yet another meditation technique. But any genuine meditation technique is basically a spiritual meditation technique and it will offer spiritual benefits and will keep you going on the spiritual path. What are the spiritual benefits of meditation? Any authentic meditation practice when done over a period of time will help you with your spiritual growth and will start offering the following spiritual benefits: A more balanced and grounded sense of being A deep experience of inner stillness, peace, and contentment A personality radiating an unshakable smile, love, calmness, and serenity A heightened sense of spiritual awakening and freedom An even state of mind with less reactivity and feverishness Increased awareness and mindfulness A neutral attitude without any intense cravings or aversions to anything or anybody A sense of inner bliss that is independent of outer circumstances A strong and genuine sense of who you really are At ease and natural wherever you go, whomever you are with A strong sense of belonging and connection to all, with a willingness to care and share Well-bonded, nurturing, fulfilling relationships A feeling of abundance and security, generosity and gratitude More compassion and kindness, friendship and forgiveness An increase in creativity and out of box thinking More resilient and greater ability to handle stress and uncertainty Increased acceptance Broder vision with clarity about the purpose of life Meditate now and connect to your spirit Find a quiet place, sit easily and comfortably and get ready for a guided spiritual meditation - Journey Within! How to incorporate spiritual meditation practice in everyday life? Guided meditation is a great way to get a taste of meditation for an absolute beginner. However, it is highly recommended for daily life practice that you learn a proper personal meditation style that is easy, sustainable, and comfortable with practicing on your own. Two such meditation techniques are [SKY Breath Meditation](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/sudarshan-kriya-benefits) and [Sahaj Samadhi mantra-based meditation](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/sahaj-samadhi-meditation?utm_source=post&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=&utm_term=&utm_content=). I personally practice these two for more than a decade now and they have enhanced and deepened my spiritual journey in so many ways. What is SKY Breath Meditation and how to learn it? SKY Breath Meditation or Sudarshan Kriya makes us realize that our life is vast and infinite like the sky. In Sanskrit, 'Su' means proper or clear, 'darshan' means vision, 'kriya' means a purifying act of breathing. With the practice of Sudarshan Kriya, as you release toxins and destress, you get a clear vision of who you really are and the vastness and infinite nature of your being. SKY, a unique breathing practice, that involves several types of cyclical breathing patterns. Apart from all the spiritual benefits that are mentioned above, there is mounting [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573542/) to suggest that SKY can be a beneficial, low-risk, low-cost adjunct to the treatment of stress, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, stress-related medical illnesses, substance abuse, and rehabilitation of criminal offenders. It is easy and safe breathwork that brings you to the doorway of meditation where you effortlessly slip into a meditative state.
