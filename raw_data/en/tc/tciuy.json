How dangerous is manipulation? While [www.quackwatch.com](http://www.quackwatch.com) continually draws attention to potential problems, the research does not give much cause for alarm. Vertebral damage has been estimated at a risk of something between one in 20,000 patients and one per 1 million manipulations - in other words, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all. Metamorphic technique A practitioner uses light touch on points in the feet, head and hands called 'spinal reflexes'. The thought is that outmoded 'energy patterns' within you are bypassed, releasing 'energy' for you to create new patterns. Originated in the 60s by British naturopath and reflexologist Robert St John and developed by Gaston Saint-Pierre, who set up the Metamorphic Association in 1979. Moxabustion/moxibustion The herb burning done by TCM acupuncturists, using dried leaves from either the common attach 'moxa sticks' to the needles or place them directly on the patient's skin. Music therapy This isn't just listening to music - the therapist and client both play, sing and listen in the session. Like art therapy, it is intended for those who 'find verbal communication an inadequate form of self-expression'. Traditionally, it has concentrated on those with fairly serious problems - physical, emotional, language impairment, autism, the elderly. It's also used by people looking for insight into themselves. Naturopathy Founded in the US in 1902 by a man called Lust, naturopathy is based on the idea that the body can heal itself, 'that the cause of disease is a violation of nature's laws'. It focuses on lifestyle - fresh air, diet, water, exercise, rest and emotional balance - and the belief is that, given the chance, nature will cure all ills. Practitioners combine dietary, psychological and physical therapies. Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) A spoken-word, non-physical Californian behavioural technique which helps you 'attain goals'. It's said to be a way of overcoming bad habits by 'tapping into the cycle of negative thoughts'. Kind of Johnny Mercer's 'Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive'. Without the irony, of course. Nutritional therapy The observation 'you are what you eat' turned into a formal philosophy. Not to be confused with the science-based work and advice of properly qualified dieticians, Cam nutritional therapy starts from the basis that everyone's biochemistry is unique and therefore everyone should eat a different diet. At its most extreme, it proposes that we could, nutritionally, alter the evolution of the human race. Therapists take hair samples and test for allergies, then make diet-ary recommendations which are meant to heal you, or at least make you feel better. Much of it is fabulous good sense. The general dietary guidelines are the same as the WHO's - the pyramid of food groups with lots of carbohydrates at the bottom and a little fat at the top. Orthomolecular therapy Developed by double Nobel-prize winner Linus Pauling around the idea that if you alter the level of various substances in the body, you can improve health. The best-known thesis is that ingesting vast amounts of vitamin C will stop you catching colds and flu. There is no evidence for this - at least 16 high-quality studies show vitamin C does not prevent colds. There is evidence, however, according to [www.quackwatch.com](http://www.quackwatch.com), that the largest corporate donor to the Linus Pauling Institute has been Hoffman-La Roche, which produces most of the world's vitamin C. Osteopathy A manipulative technique developed during the American Civil War by Andrew Still, a Union doctor who realised that he could clear his own headaches by cracking his neck. Its core tenet is that anything wrong with the body can be put down to misplaced vertebrae. Treatment mixes spine cracking, massage and gentle manipulation. It works on the muscles and ligaments, while chiropractic works directly on the joints. The underlying theory concentrates on the impairment of blood supply, while chiropractic focuses on nerve endings. In practice, this makes for little difference. It's mostly used for lowerback pain but is also used by some practitioners to relieve menstrual pain, headaches, digestive disorders and breathing difficulties. It's covered by the 1993 Osteopathy Act, the first complementary therapy to be so regulated. Oxygen therapy Based on the premise that all harmful bacteria and viruses, from colds to Aids, can only survive in an anaerobic - ie low-oxygen - environment. It was developed by double Nobel-prize laureate Dr Otto Warburg, who says he's proved that cancer can't grow in a high-oxygen environment. He is against tap water, cooked vegetables and fruit and processed foods, saying that all are low in oxygen. There are two types of treatment. In one, a pint of blood is drawn, given a 300-volt charge, then put back into the client. In the other, hydrogen peroxide is injected directly into the bloodstream. Supposedly, it splits into water and oxygen when it comes into contact with the body enzyme catalase. Do not try this at home. Panchakarma An Indian detoxification involving massage purges, emetics, inhalations and oil enemas, plus purvakarma treatments. Pilates A set of exercises that concentrate on the back and abdominal muscles in a very precise, conscious way for a limited number of repetitions, using equipment. The idea is to strengthen the anatomical centre of the body and correct the posture. Developed in the first half of the 20th century by German-born Joseph Pilates and taught in New York since the 30s, it was brought to England in 1970 by Alan Herdman. Polarity therapy Healing system developed from ayurveda in the 20s by Austrian Randolph Stone. Its central tenet is a belief that the top and right side of the body have a positive charge, while the bottom and left side have a negative one. It involves a mix of various elements, including counsel- ling, cranial work, bodywork, hydrotherapy, yoga and nutrition. Pranic healing From the Sanskrit word prana, meaning 'life force'. It purports to examine the energy field sitting 4in to 5in around our bodies - something doubted by sceptics. No physical contact is involved. Purvakarma therapy Given as part of panchakarma, a traditional Indian therapy. Oils are ministered via the mouth, the rectum and the skin, or in steam baths and oil drips. Qigong Part of TCM - qi means energy, gong means practice - it combines soft, loose stretches with breathing. It's often described as a relaxing form of t'ai chi. There is also external qigong, performed as a healing therapy by qigong masters. Radionics A distant healing technique which, it is claimed, can be practised with therapist and client in different countries - ESP, in other words. The idea is that each disease produces a different 'energy vibration'. Its 'principles' were supposedly established by an early-20th century American physician, Dr Albert Abrams. Described by proponents as 'the health science of the future'. Reflexology Nerve endings in the foot are stimulated to change things in other parts of the body. Based on the work of US ear, nose and throat specialist Dr William Fitzgerald, who divided the body into 10 equal zones, each of which ends at a different point on the feet and hands. Practitioners believe that by, say, hitting the kidney spot on the foot, you get the kidneys' energy to flow freely, thereby fixing the problem. It is claimed, for example, that lactic acid can be felt as little crystals in places, and that it can treat nearly all health problems. Reiki The word itself - pronounced 'ray-key' - means 'universal life energy'. A Japanese touch therapy, it was developed - and/or rediscovered - by theology professor Dr Mikao Usui at the turn of the 20th century, from Buddhist beliefs and Sanskrit teachings - hence its full name, Usui Shiki Ryoho (the Usui System of Natural Healing). The client lies on a couch, clothed and relaxing, while the therapist's hands rest lightly on the body in a special sequence. Clients often report heat and tingling sensations. Reiki also claims to heal animals and plants. Its philosophical and spiritual basis, known as the Form, stresses the importance of existing in the present. The first reiki principle is: just for today, do not worry. Though you can train to do reiki in just four days, becoming the somewhat grandiosely named Reiki Master will take at least three years and will set you back \u00a36,000. Rescue Remedy A Bach combination of five flower essences. The claims made for it are not modest. It's said to be used to combat stage fright, to help you take exams, keep your cool in traffic jams, deal with bereavement and cope with the kids. Rolfing Using physical pressure, the rolfer and the client work together on the connective tissue of the myofascial system to create a 'better balanced' body. It centres around what is termed 'muscle memory' and is concerned with the effects of gravity on us and how we deal with it. Wearing your underwear, you start out with 10 'goals', aiming to achieve one goal per session. It was developed in 30s New York by Ida P Rolf, and organic chemist. St John's Wort The herbal alternative to antidepressants and Prozac - also known as Hypericum perforatum. The active ingredient is hypericin and it works by monoamine oxidase inhibition. A 1996 British Medical Journal study showed it to be two-and-a-half times more effective than a placebo. A 1998 review of side-effects showed it to be safer than regular antidepressants and no more dangerous than a placebo. However, research also shows that it may reduce the effectiveness of HIV medication and the contraceptive pill, make migraines worse, and interfere with asthma and bronchial medication. Anyone on antidepressants, anti-coagulants and anti-convulsants should consult a doctor before taking it. Shamanism A modern update of an old tradition. You enter an altered state of consciousness - these days, sadly, it's usually via a repetitive drumbeat than magic mushrooms. You are then led by the shamanic healer on a journey in the spirit world. There, you may encounter a 'power animal' - which could be a version of a childhood imaginary friend or a penguin, as in the film Fight Club. Shaw's technique The Alexander Technique applied to swimming. Its central tenet is that poor pool technique does more harm than benefit. Shi'zen no-hands massage An extremely relaxing deep-tissue massage done not with the hands but with the seven surfaces of the forearm, with your chest supported by a pillow. It was developed in Halifax by Gerry Pyves - to protect practitioners' own hands and fingers from RSI. 'Giving eight clients a day a regular Swedish massage destroys your hands,' said a practitioner. The word itself is Japanese for the balance of mind and body. Shiatsu Like acupuncture without the needles. A traditional Japanese development of a Chinese original, it relates everything to the five elements of the body. The therapist aims to balance the body's vital energy, or qi, using elbows, knees, feet and fingers, but rarely the palms of the hands. A Northern Ireland study of its effect on nausea caused by chemotherapy, published in June 1990, found some success. Shirodhara Warm oil poured on to your forehead as part of panchakarma. Swedish massage The kneading and pummelling massage that's familiar from a hundred movie steamroom scenes. It was developed by a 19th-century Swedish physiologist, Per Henrik Ling. T'ai chi The people in the park. An ancient Oriental 'art' of flowing movement exercises, linked to breathing and supposedly brought to China by the Buddha. The idea is that it stimulates and regulates your chi flow. A study by Emory University, Atlanta, found that regular practice of it helped elderly people to maintain their stability and balance. Tea tree oil An Australian oil which is said to be naturally antiseptic and antibacterial. It's an aboriginal thing, of course. Not just any tea tree, will do, though. It must be Melaleuca alternifolia from northeastern New South Wales. One whole tree is needed for a 25ml bottle (they do grow in about 14 months, however). Tens (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) Electro-acupuncture. Small electric pulses conducted via a small, highly portable band. A US study said it reduces nausea during chemotherapy. Thai yoga massage A combination of acupressure, gentle stretching and being placed in yoga-like positions. The therapist uses his or her hands, feet and elbows to apply pressure in flowing sequences, which is said to stimulate the sen channels - nadis in ayurveda, meridians in acupuncture. In the hospital for traditional Thai medicine in Chiang Mai, they call it 'lazy man's yoga'. Toxin 1) A poison. 2) What many Cams claim to get rid of. Scientists say there is no such thing as a toxin in the Cam sense and that there is certainly no such thing as removing toxins via detoxification of the skin, the bloodstream, the urinary tract or the colon. Just as the best definition of a weed is a plant where you don't want it to be, so a toxin is nothing more sophisticated or complicated than a substance where you don't want it to be. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Based on principles utterly foreign to Western scientific rationalists. It is dualistic, believing that everything stems from the interaction of two forces, yin and yang - the paired seed shapes in the circular logo. Yin is about quietness, darkness and femininity. Yang is about loudness, daytime and masculinity. The aim of TCM is to balance them. Also, it sees the body as arranged and controlled by qi (energy) flowing through 14 channels or meridians. Each person is given a different medicine - even for the same ailment. Medical preparations are made from a variety of plant, mineral and animal sources, some of which come from endangered species - for example, in Asia black bears have been hunted to near extension for their gall bladders. Even some sceptics concede that it achieves good results with eczema. Nonetheless, it was condemned in the House of Lords report. Tragerwork A light, gentle form of massage which involves no oil or rubbing. Instead, the client lies, in his or her underwear, on a padded table while the therapist gets into a focused state called a 'hook-up' and uses a repetitive combination of stretching, lifting, swinging, flexing and rocking movements designed to reach into the client's unconscious. There are also relaxation exercises to be done between sessions called Mentastics (mental gymnastics). A 1993 study in the American journal Spine reported that Trager could ease pain. Tuina The massage part of TCM, tuina has been around for about 2,300 years. It's pronounced 'tweenah' - tui means 'push' and na means 'grasp'. Your fully clothed body is moved around in a somewhat disorienting and occasionally painful way. It claims to achieve the same kind of results as osteopathy and chiropractic. Baby tuina was developed about 700 years ago and uses different points because, say adherents, children are different to adults. It's for the mother to use on her own baby in order to build a bond between them. Urine therapy The idea that reingesting the toxins in your own urine will 'stimulate a cleansing reaction'. Developed in the 30s by Englishman John W Armstrong. Also known as taking the piss. Vibrations Apparently found in healing crystals. Wave therapy Nothing to do with the sea but rather a portmanteau which takes in music, magnetic and light therapies - all of which have quite different histories and methodologies. Yoga Generally thought of as a set of stretching exercises done in a church hall - or a sandalwood-scented Notting Hill hangout. But that's only part of it. Yoga is an ancient physical and mental Hindu discipline. The word itself means 'bind' or 'attach'. The exercises, known as asanas, are part of hatha yoga. Sceptics say that, while part of a long Indian tradition, some yoga movements bear a striking similarity to the physical conditioning exercises taken to India by the British Army. You'll find endless types of yoga on offer - bhakti, karma, bikram, power yoga. The differences are mostly just ones of emphasis - on the balance of the physical and the mental, on the importance of breathing, on the intensity, on the spirituality, on the temperature of the room. Ashtanga and its more recent brand-name derivative, power yoga, are the most dramatically energetic. On the arch of a famous Tibetan yoga monastery is the inscription: 'A thousand monks, a thousand ways'. Zero balancing A comforting and relaxing light manipulation therapy using finger pressure and held stretches, called fulcrums, stressing the energy that is reckoned to be flowing through bones and joints. Developed in the UK in 1975 by an American, its aim is to achieve 'blending', a deliberate blurring of the boundary between the bodies of practitioner and client. It talks about 'donkey-donkey contact', a relationship of trust between therapist and client - the analogy is two donkeys walk- ing side by side along a precipitous mountain path. Often referred to as ZB - pronounced 'zee-bee', the American way - it takes its name from an early client who said at the end of a session that he felt 'zero balanced'. Zone therapy Another term for reflexology.
