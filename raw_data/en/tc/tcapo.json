(Dr.Victor Babu Koppula)INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 1INCLUSIVE EDUCATION: THE HUMAN RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE Prof. I.V.Lalitha Kumari Department of Social Work S.P.Mahila University, Tirupati Introduction: The National policy on education (NPE), 1986 and the programme of Action (1992) gives the basic policy framework for education, emphasizing on correcting the existing inequalities. It stresses on reducing dropout rates, improving learning achievements and expanding access to students who have not had an easy opportunity to be a part of the general system. The NPE (1986) envisaged some measures for integrating children with physical and mental handicap with the general community as equal partners, preparing them for their normal growth and development and enabling them to face life with courage and confidence. India has also been a signatory to international declarations like the Salamanca statement and framework for action on special needs education (1994) and the Biwako Milkenicum framework for Action (2002) and the UN Convention on the Rights of persons with disabilities, 2006 that emphasize the need for fundamental educational policy shifts to enable general schools to include children with disabilities. Inclusive education is a process of strengthening the capacity of education system to reach out to all learners and can thus be understood as a key strategy to achieve 'education to all'. It is the practice of including everyone, irrespective of talent, disability, socio-economic background in supportive mainstream school and classrooms where the needs of allINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 2students are met. By educating all children together, children with disability have opportunity to prepare for life in the community. A Brief History of inclusive education: Today it is widely accepted that education is a fundamental right of every child. Inclusive education enables the children with diverse needs to have education according to their needs and handicap. Equality of opportunities for the handicapped is a human right approved by the UN charter and it is in this context that handicapped children were assured the facilities to attain equality and to make them a part with other people. In the Indian context, it has been enshrined in our constitution that each and every child in the age group of 6-14 years has the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in the country. The children in India however do not attend to school due to some reasons like child labour, social conflict, exploitation, poverty and disability. The idea of inclusive education may be traced to several important conventions. The World Conference on education for all (Jomtien 1990), The World Conference on special needs education (Salamanca 1994), the World Conference on Mental Retardation (New Delhi 1994), the Conviction on the rights of the child (1984). Today in most countries legislations has been passed to provide education for all children with special needs and ensure equal opportunities for them to participate in all school activities Special educational needs of most of the children with disabilities can be met effectively in main stream schools. In inclusive setting the teacher plays major role in inclusive education. In inclusive education students with special needs including disabilities are educated in neighborhood schools in a regular classroomINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 3setting with their non disabled peers and are provided with supports and instructions that assure their participation with their peers by meeting their individual strengths and needs. Need for inclusive education All children have the right to learn together. Children should not be devalued or discriminated against by being excluded or sent away because of their disability or learning difficulty. Disabled adults, describing themselves as special school survivors, are demanding an end to segregation. There are no legitimate reasons to separate children for their education. Children belong together with advantages and benefits for everyone. They do not need to be protected from each other. Research shows children do better, academically and socially in integrated settings. Given commitment and support, inclusive education is a more efficient use of educational resources. Segregation teaches children to be fearful, ignorant and breeds prejudice. All children need an education that will help them develop relationships and prepare them for life in the mainstream. Only inclusion has the potential to reduce fear and build friendship, respect and understanding. Educational perspectives Inclusive education is the practice of including everyone - irrespective of talent, disability socio-economic background, or cultural origin-in supportive mainstream school and classrooms where the needs of all the students are met. By educating all children together, children with disabilities have the opportunities to prepare for life in the community, teachers improve their professional skills, and society makes the conscious decision to operate according to the social value of equality. The justification of the inclusive education can be discussed in terms ofINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 4benefits to students, teachers and society. By for the most important reasons for inclusive schooling is the social value of equality. We have to teach students by example that despite differences, we all have equal rights. In contrast to the past experiences of segregation, inclusion reinforces the practice of the idea that differences are accepted and respected. Because our society is in a critical phase of evolving from industrial to informational and from national to international, it is important that we avoid the mistakes of the past. We need schools that promote wider social acceptance, peace and cooperation. Social perspective According to stain back and stain back (1990), \"if a society supports integration of all individuals, then segregated schools and classrooms have no place in that society there is no defensible rationale, excuse, nor scientific research that can be conducted that will in the final analysis justify segregation.\" Inclusive education makes good social sense. Segregation teaches children to be fearful, ignorant and breeds prejudice. All children need an education that will help them develop relationships and prepare them for life in the mainstream. Only inclusion has the potential to reduce fear and to build friendship, respect and understanding. Economic perspective In a country like India inclusive education for children with disabilities is justified from economic perspective. This is evident from the following facts: There are an estimated 600 million persons with one form of disability or the other all over the world and 10 per cent of this number is estimated to be in India. That means we have 6 million persons withINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 5disability. A recent article by Kenneth Eklindh of UNESCO states: More than 90 per cent of disabled children in developing countries are not in school. The Salamanca statement also affirms inclusive education as cost effective in view of the following considerations. Establishment of additional special schools is expensive in terms of building cost, salaries of teachers, provision of aids and equipment, etc. as compared to including children with disabilities in their neighborhood schools where education and care of such children become the responsibility of each and every teacher. Most parents of disabled children are not able to meet the expenses of educating their children in special schools. So they are bound to keep their children in their homes depriving them of their basic right. When disabled children's are kept at homes, parents cannot leave them alone and go out for work. Children with disabilities who receive education become self-supporting members of the family in future, and not a burden for parents. The democratic ideas of Indian society can be best served and protected when diversity is highly valued and seen as the norm in all schools, when all students are viewed as active, fully participating members of the school community. Inclusive schools value diversity and children with disability are fully participating members of such schools. Benefits of Inclusive Education Inclusive education means that all students in an educational setting, regardless of their strengths or weaknesses in any area, become part of the local community. The primary reason for promoting the attendance of students with special needs in mainstream schools is toINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 6increase their learning opportunities through interaction with peers and to encourage their participation in the life of community. This uniting process has a great impact on the societal development, which is backed up by research. 1. Benefits of inclusive education for children with special educational needs: Mc Gregor and Vogelsberg (1998) list the benefits of inclusive education for children with disabilities based on a comprehensive review of research literature as follows: Children with disabilities demonstrate high levels of social interaction with non-disabled children with disabilities demonstrate high levels of social interaction with non-disabled peers in inclusive settings when compared with segregated settings. Social competence and communication skills of children with diverse abilities are improved in inclusive settings. This is believed to be closely associated with greater opportunities for social interaction with non-disabled peers. Children with disabilities in inclusive settings often have a more rigorous educational programme, resulting in improved skill acquisition and academic gains. Social acceptance of children with diverse abilities is enhanced by the frequent small-group work nature of their instruction in inclusive classrooms. Children get to see beyond the disability when working in small groups, and begin to realize that they have much in common with children with disabilities. Friendships more commonly develop between children with disabilities and those without disabilities in inclusive settings. Research has found that children in inclusive education settings have more durable networks of friends than children in segregated settings. This is especiallyINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 7true of children included to their local neighbourhood school, where they can more easily see friends outside of school hours. 2. Benefits of inclusion for children without disabilities: The research points the benefits not only for students with special needs, but for their non-disabled peers as well, most of the benefits being in social nature. The most significant benefits attributed to inclusion practices seems to be the increased diversity awareness and tolerance. Students learn to be sensitive to the needs of others and can be helpers- not superiors, but useful. Serving students with special needs, their peers obtain such features as willingness to help, which remains with them for the rest of life. Students without special needs also find that true affectionate friendships can be formed with their special needs classmates. If the students had not been included but rather set apart in a special classroom, these special relationships probably would not have been shaped. Other benefits for ordinary students are the presence of an extra aid in the classroom as well as adaptation to different learning styles. Often, even in a fully inclusive environment, a one-on-one assistance is necessary. A highly qualified assistant or special education teacher can provide a valuable resource for the non-disabled classmates. In an inclusive environment, different teaching techniques must be used in order to educate all types of learners effectively. The students without special needs can benefit from different learning styles being taken into consideration in an inclusive environment, because every student disabled or not, has his/her own style of learning. If as many various learning styles as possible are presented in the classroom due to the inclusion of special needs children, the benefits can reach every one.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 83. Benefits for teachers In spite of widespread opinion among teachers, that they need special skills to teach children with special needs, research has shown that in most cases inclusion can be successfully implemented through good, clear, accessible teaching that all students have skills and strengths and create awareness on the importance of a direct individual way of instruction. Inclusion has challenged teachers to develop more child- centered, participatory, and active teaching approaches and this benefits all students. Such educational environments bring teachers to the necessity to apply new approaches and methods, and to acquire specific technological skills. The skills improve vocational competence of a teacher. In this connection, inclusive education can act as a catalyst in educational practice, thus improving the quality of education. 4. Benefits for society Inclusion also has a great benefit for the society, as it supports the social value of equality by providing a miniature model of the democratic process. Inclusion can help overcome discrimination and break the cycle of exclusion. Discriminatory attitudes towards people with special needs persist in the society because of scare awareness and information on how to live close with such people. It is difficult to break down the attitudinal barriers, but experience has revealed that, within the right context, people can be more tolerant and helpful and gain the skills of socialization and collaboration. It seems to be the only way to uphold the civil rights of disabled people. Role of teachers in an inclusive educational setting: Inclusive education is the responsibility of everyone involved in a child's education - parents, teachers, administrators, community andINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 9government. The teacher has the responsibility for overall experiences of these children. To fulfill this responsibility the teacher should possess better awareness about the concept, nature type and educational requirements to deal children with disabilities. The role of teachers in meeting the special needs of children with disabilities vary from one disability to other. However there are certain common roles. They are as follows:- 1.Identification of the children with disabilities in the classroom. 2.Referring the identified to the experts for further examination and treatment. 3.Accepting the children with disabilities. 4.Developing positive attitude between normal children and disabled children. 5.Placing the children in the classroom in proper places so that they feel comfortable and are benefited by the classroom interaction. 6.Enabling the children with disabilities to avail the facilities provided for them under IEB scheme. 7.Removing architectural barriers wherever possible so that children with disabilities move independently. 8.Involving the children with disabilities in almost all the activities of the classroom. 9.Making suitable adaptation in the curriculum transaction so that the children with disabilities learn according to their ability. 10.Preparations of teaching aids/adaptation of teaching aids which will help the children with disabilities learn.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 1011.Parental guidance and counseling and public awareness programme through schools activities. 12.Acquiring competencies which are essential in meeting the needs of the children with disabilities. 13.Cooperating with resource teachers if resource rooms are available. 14.Collaboration with medical and physiological personnel, social workers, parents and special teachers. 15.Providing scope for cooperative learning among disabled and normal children. 16.Conducting case studies and action research related to the specific problems of children with special needs. 17.Construction of achievement and diagnostic tool 18.Adaptation in evaluation for children with special needs. 19.Nurturing the talent among children with disabilities 20.Providing remedial instruction to the children who require it. The teachers can perform the above roles only when essential competencies are developed among them. This calls for inclusive training of the teachers with adequate practical component. The following can be done to make inclusive education more effective: Practice Democracy The teachers should be given freedom to change the curriculum to suit the challenged. The freedom to change assessment procedures Readiness for change and to changeINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 11A change in the infrastructure would be needed. Then we will have to go for the change. Ramps may be needed. We have to welcome all those necessary changes in order to include the challenged into the typical or normal stream. Community involvement The challenged cannot fight this battle on their own. In order to get support from every quarter, it is necessary that the parents, siblings, neighbors, teachers and the peers be involved. So the differently abled will succeed and get the benefits from inclusive education. Ways to overcome Barriers to provide inclusive education National policy statement on inclusive education The national policy recognizes that persons with disabilities are valuable human resources for the country and seeks to create an environment that provide those equal opportunities, protection of their rights and full participation in society. The focus of the policy is prevention and rehabilitation for the disabled. Prevention of Disabilities In a large number of cases, disability is preventable; there will be a strong emphasis on prevention of disabilities. Programme for prevention of diseases, disability and the creation of awareness regarding measures to be taken for prevention of disabilities during the period of pregnancy and thereafter will be intensified and their coverage expanded. Rehabilition Measures Rehabilitation measures can be classified into three distinct groups: 1)Physical rehabilitation - which includes early detection and intervention, counseling & medical interventions and provision ofINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 12aids & appliances. It will also include the development of rehabilitation professionals. 2)Educational Rehabilitation including vocational education and 3)Economic rehabilitation for a dignified life in society. The freedom to reduce the units to be covered or raise the level of a particular subject, in short there should be a flexi curriculum and assessment procedure. Inclusion of students with disabilities without support or appropriate education may not be beneficial. Waldon (1997) cautioned that a responsible inclusion requires sufficient support and resources. In many instances mainstream institutions face the barriers arisen since students with special needs have been included there. Overcoming of barriers and providing for inclusive education for students with a wide range of special needs-physical, cultural and educational should be facilitated. Provide a legal framework for successful development of inclusive education at national and regional levels, Provide the means of access to information which are required to meet special educational needs, including ICTs and assistive technologies, Organize the training of teachers and staff in order to instruct them in modern pedagological methods and ways to use new hardware and software required to enhance the effectiveness of education, Modify the curriculum appropriately;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 13Raise awareness of teachers, schools/institute staff, parents and peers regarding a change in culture and their attitude toward students with special needs to be educated with in the communities, Involve parents in the development of inclusive education; Create physical access to school and in buildings, including transport and suitable interior design. Conclusion: Inclusion is a holistic vision. Inclusive education must respond to all pupils as individuals, recognizing individuality as something to be appreciated and respected. Inclusive education responding to social needs will thus have positive returns for all pupils. All children of the world, with their individual strengths and weaknesses, with their hopes and expectations, have the right to a certain type of children. Therefore, it is the school system of a country that must be adjusted to meet the needs of all its children. The attitude that 'inclusive education is not an alternative but an inevitability, if the dream of providing basic education to all children is to ever become a reality needs to be cultivated among all concerned professionals, grassroots workers, teachers and community members, especially in rural and remote areas. Inclusive education is a Human Right issue. The greatest barrier to inclusive is the attitude of teachers, parents and authoritarians. By avoiding the negative attitude towards it, the dream of inclusive education policy \"every one can learn\" came into existence.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 14References school, Geneva:UNDP 2.Katharine Giftard -Lindsay, Inclusive education in India: Interpretation, Implementation, and issues, CREATE PATHWAYS TO ACCESS research monagrath No 15, 2007. 3.Lokanadha Reddy.G, R.Kamar, A.Kusuma, (2007), \"Education of Children with special needs\", Discovery publishing House, New Delhi. 4.Neena Dash, (2006), \"Inclusive Education for children with special need\", Nice printing press, New Delhi. 5.Udavri-Solner, A., & Thousand, J.(1995).

Arun Kumar Associate Professor Dept. of Human Resource Management Andhra University , Visakhapatnam An organization is a social arrangement to distribute tasks for a collective goal. The word itself is derived from the Greek word organon, itself derived from the better-known word ergon - as we know 'organ' and it means a compartment for a particular job. Change management is a structured approach to shifting or transitioning individuals, teams, and organizations from a current state to a desired future state. It is an organizational process aimed at empowering employees to accept and embrace changes in their current business environment The above saying depicts the essence of imagination that gives a way to change context in individual and organizational development. Even knowledge is divine but everlasting changes are source of wide imaginations. Many human resources professionals take Change Orientation as a challenging task in and play a dual responsibility of career development and organizational development. They even recognize that performance measurement is critical to an organization's ability to be successful in an increasingly competitive and changing business environment. To understand change management as we know it today, you need to consider two converging and predominant fields of thought: an engineer's approach to improving business performance and a psycho legists' approach.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 16Change management is a required competency in business today. The shift in the core values of employees to empowerment, ownership, and accountability has created a work force that will embrace change as long as they are part of the process. With the introduction of today's new business values, employee resistance should be expected. Change is for the better view for the depending on where you it. \"Change \" is: to make different in some particular, to make radically different, to give a different position, course, or direction to, to replace with another, to make a shift from one to another, to exchange for an equivalent sum or comparable item, to undergo a modification, to undergo transformation, transition or substitution \"Manage\" is defined as: to handle or direct with a degree of skill or address, to treat with care, to exercise executive, administrative and supervisory direction. The systematic management of new business model integration into an organization and the ability to adapt this change into the organization so that the transformation enhances the organizational relationships with all its constituents .According to John .P . Kotter \"Change management is the process, tools and techniques to manage the people-side of business change to achieve the required business outcome and to realize that business change effectively within the social infrastructure of the workplace.\" Change management defines adopting corporate strategies, structures, procedures and technologies to deal with changes in external conditions and the business environment. The reason for such a broad definition of change management is that it's a comprehensive term used to describe change at both the individual and organizational level. And also the term change management is used to describe The task of managing change, An area of professional practice, a body of knowledge consisting of models, methods, techniques, and other tool sand a control mechanismINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 17consisting of requirements, standards, processes and procedures.

Terms used in change management. Planning for Change Assign all potential changes a risk level prior to scheduling the change. Document at least three risk levels with corresponding change planning requirements. Identify risk levels for software and hardware upgrades, topology changes, routing changes, configuration changes, and new deployments. Assign higher risk levels to non-standard add, move, or change types of activity. The high-risk change process you document needs to include lab validation, vendor review, peer review, and detailed configuration and design documentation. Managing Change: Change management is the process that approves and schedules the change to ensure the correct level of notification and minimal user impact.

Hold periodic change review meetings to be attended by system administration, application development, network operations, and facilities groups, as well as general users. Document change input requirements, including change owner, business impact, risk level, reason for change, success factors, back out plan, and testing requirements. Document change output requirements, including updates to DNS, network map, template, IP addressing, circuit management, and network management. FACTORS OF CHANGE: In the last two decades there has been a change in organizations for some very good, mutually supporting reasons and the one need to find ways of managing, suited to specific, strategic circumstances.

This has become the change management model known as 'John Kotter - 8 Critical Steps': Kotter also identifies corresponding possible pitfalls for each stage that can derail the change project all-together. Following are the eight critical success factors of the John P Kotter change management model for leading change, and the eight major errors identified in the change management article that can halt a change project, or even destroy any positive change management plans and changes made thus far.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 21Kurt Lewins three step model is a significant part of change management strategies for managing change in the workplace in the 21st century. It is also a fantastic change management model for understanding the basic concepts of a straight-forward change management process. Lewin's Three Step Change Model Phases are: Unfreeze : Reducing the forces that are striving to maintain the status quo, and dismantling the current mind set. Usually by presenting a provocative problem or event to get people to recognize the need for change and to search for new solutions. Transition : Developing new behaviors, values, and attitudes, sometimes through organizational structure and process changes and development techniques. There may be a period of some confusion as we move from the old ways of doing things to the new. Freeze : The final stage of crystallizing and the adaptation of ownership of the new 'as is'. The organization may revert to former ways of doing things at this point unless the changes are reinforced through freezing. The ADKAR model of change is a practical answer to effective change management for individuals and organizations.. ADKAR emphasizes that successful organizational change occurs only when each person is able to transition successfully. It makes sense then that this model, developed by Jeff Hiatt, CEO of Prosci Change Management, and first published in 2003, focuses on 5 actions and outcomes necessary for Successful individual change, and therefore successful organizational change. The ADKAR consists of five steps: AWARENESS : the need for change understanding why change is necessary is the first key aspect of successful change. This step explainsINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 22the reasoning and thought that underlies a required change. Planned communication is essential. When this step is successfully completed the individual employee will fully understand why change is necessary. DESIRE: In this step the individual is able to reach a point where they make a personal decision to support the change and participate in the change. Naturally a desire to support and be part of the change can only happen after full awareness of the need for change is established. Building desire is partly achieved by addressing incentives for the individual and creating a desire to be a part of the change. KNOWLEDGE: The third building block of the model, providing knowledge about the change, can be achieved through normal training and education methods. Other methods of transferring knowledge, such as coaching, forums and mentoring, are equally useful, so don't limit this process to formal training. Two types of knowledge need to be addressed: knowledge on how to change (what to do during the transition) and knowledge on how to perform once the change is implemented. ABILITY : In the ADKAR model Ability is the difference between theory and practice. Once knowledge on how to change is in place (theory) the practice, or actual performance of the individual, needs to be supported. This can take some time and can be achieved through practice, coaching and feedback. REINFORCEMENT : This final stage of the model is an essential component in which efforts to sustain the change are emphasized. Ensuring that changes stay in place and that individuals do not revert to old ways can be achieved through positive feedback, rewards, recognition, measuring performance and taking corrective actions.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 23TECHNUQUES OF CHANGE MANGEMENT : Organizational change is a complex, uncertain and difficult process that requires careful planning and thoughtful analysis. The theoretical perspectives on organizational change deals with the essentials for practitioners to be equipped it appropriate theoretical insights before introducing any form of change. CONTINGENCY PERSPECTIVE : Contingency perspective focuses on structural change. Structure refers to the way in which an organization breaks down complex tasks into similar jobs. POPULATION ECOLOGY PERSPECTIVE: Population ecology perspective refers to limits of change and resistance to change. It insists that individual organizations cannot adapt to changing environments for variety of reasons. They are Organizational leaders may have incomplete information Organizational assets may be specific current task Political resistance Legal and financial barriers Change occurs, therefore, not at the organizational level but at the population level. RESOURCE DEPENDENCE PERSPECTIVE : Resource dependence perspective examines strategic change. It is based on simple premise that organizations need to acquire resources from the environment in order to survive and this perspective, deals with internal and external strategies. Internal strategies, Domain choice, Recruitment, Environmental scanning, Buffering, Smoothing, Rationing, Geographical dispersion. External strategies, Advertising, Contracting, Co-opting, Coalescing and Lobbying. INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVES: Institutional perspective looks at learning and change through imitation, professionalization and compliance. It is a essence of norms and values, also refers as symbolic elements, as more important than markets and competitors in shaping an organizationsINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 24strategy and structure. This perspective argues that organizations come to resemble one another over a period of time due processes termed as the following Organizations adapt certain structural features due to pressures from the state, other organizations or the society at large called as Coercive isomorphism . The measure may take the form of legislation or regulatory requirements. Organizations may also imitate one another such state of change is called mimetic isomorphism . It also refers to the process by which organizations change to become similar to other organizations through imitation. The state may further reinforce the power of the professional bodies this is called as normative isomorphism . the organizations influence professional managers employs specialists in the areas of production, manufacturing, finance, human resource and marketing.

K. Gandhi is known as the greatest teacher of mankind for all times to come - \"a prophet of its spiritual regeneration.\" As a political thinker and social reformer his contributions towards the domain of education is not any way less. We all believe that one of the most valuable legacies that he has left to posterity is his educational systems crystallized in the Basic Scheme of Education and in his diverse addresses. What is the value of this education? In order to realize the value of basic education, it is necessary to understand the theory behind it, the philosophy that inspired it. One very important thing is that M. K. Gandhi was not an academic philosopher. His theory or philosophy that he gave to the world was the result of his own daily living and his own experiences, since he was an experimenter all his life. Thus, to have a true perspective of Gandhi's philosophy of education we should have a clear understanding of his philosophy of life. In this paper I have not tried to give a detail account of his philosophy of life. Here I have just tried to discuss, how Gandhi's philosophy of education is relevant in the context of India. Life is full of suffering and ignorance is the root cause of it. The philosophy of Gautama Buddha has established this truth of our life long before. Only through the right knowledge we can root out our ignorance and accordingly our suffering. So, the whole process of education should be formulated in suchINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 27a balanced manner so that it can able to be rooted out our ignorance. This is the view of MK Gandhi. By education, Gandhi means an all round drawing out of the best in the child and man - body, mind and spirit. Here the 'best' is nothing else but the inner voice or truth. Education which draws out the best or truth consist the development of the mind and body with a corresponding awakening of the soul. The system of basic education proposed by Gandhi leads to the development of the mind, body and soul whereas the ordinary system of education cares only for the mind.1 Objective and Methodology: The aim of this research paper is to analyze the Gandhi's thoughts on education in the perspective of globalization. Here, I am trying to confine the relevance of M.K. Gandhi in the context of present education system of India. I have followed both analytic and descriptive methods. Gandhi's philosophy of education: Gandhi' philosophy of education comprises all essential elements which any good or adequate philosophy of education should possess. He advocates the concept of value education, which is based on morality. According to Gandhi moral and ethical knowledge is the first point of any good philosophy of education. Any education system that lacks moral and ethical knowledge cannot be termed as good. The underlying meaning behind this thought is that, without morality or ethical knowledge no student in the real sense can be considered to be healthy-both mentally and physically. A person, who lacks the knowledge of morality, who does not differentiate between right and wrong, who has no control on himself, cannot be called educated in the true sense. For Gandhi morality and righteousness should always be considered as an essential part of an education, so that every student would be able to gain in terms of knowledgeINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 28and spirituality. Every student should gain education under the strict regimen of high morals, self-control and right thinking. On the other hand, they would also be expected to provide service to the society in general. This implies their respect towards society and social traditions and constant awareness towards their duties and responsibilities. Mahatma Gandhi advocated the introduction of religious education, to strengthen the moral foundations of a student. He believed that religious education brings the values of forbearance, tolerance and reverence in one's character. Gandhi writs in the 'Young India' of 6th of December 1923, \"A curriculum of religious instructions should include a study of the tenets of faiths other than one's own. For this purpose the students should be trained to cultivate the habit of understanding and appreciating the doctrine of various great religions of the world in a spirit of reverence and broad minded tolerance.\"2 Gandhi also suggested some guidelines for teachers. For him it is the duty of a teacher to develop high morals and strong character of their students. If teacher fails to do so, it implies that they are insincere in their noble profession and departed from their social and national responsibilities. A teacher should lay an example, to be followed, before society and students. This becomes possible when a teacher himself leads a life of high standards of morality and strong character. Thus it is the foremost duty of students, as well as of teachers to make it certain that moral and ethical knowledge continues to be the integral part of education process. By doing so, they can contribute in the development of value education. Another important aspect of Gandhi's philosophy of education is the basic (Buniyadi) education. Gandhi used the word 'Buniyadi' during the 3rd and 4th decade of 20th century, which meant the knowledge orINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 29education that could help rural people in promotion of village handicrafts. The ultimate purpose behind his attempt was to make young men and women self- reliant in the economic field. In the modern perspective also it has well- worthy. It is similar of today's job- oriented education. According to Gandhi every student should prepare for technical knowledge from the primary level of their education. It is the milestone of Gandhi's philosophy of education. Gandhi's basic idea was to make education self supporting through craft, agriculture and other productive work there by by-passing potentially the need for government funding support.3 Gandhi believed that unless and until education makes a young man and women self-reliant, it has no value. In the Harijan on September 11, 1937, Gandhi remarked: \"Education ought to be for them (the people) a kind of insurance against unemployment. The child at the end of 14 years - after he had finished his 7 years - is to be discharged as an earning unit.....\"4 It is to be remembered here that Gandhi never wanted the child to be a mere bread - earner. He wanted him to learn while he earns and to earn while he learns. Relevance of Gandhi's views in Indian context: Education was recognized as a source of illumination, which provided correct lead in the various spheres of life. According to the contemporary thinking, education was the 'third eye' of man, which gave him insight into all affairs and taught him how to act.5 If we see from the perspective of Indian education system, definitely we can say that Gandhi's philosophy of education has a great relevance. In India when a child starts his formal education, he enters at primary level and step by step, at an age of twenty or twenty two, he has completed his graduation or post-graduation from colleges or university. And after that he should definitely have a clear direction for their future. No doubt he should have toward his future goal. He should be full of self - confidence and side by side, he should be self -INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 30dependent and capable of tackle unavoidable problems. He must not be worried for a suitable job. But the reality that we see is that the today's generation is directionless. They lack a direction to begin his carrier, and then what could be the use of their education. What is the use of the degree for him that he has in hand? Consequently most of youths are diverted and a feeling of helplessness and dejection prevailing on them. According to a survey, there are millions of men and women who, even after completing their studies at graduation, post - graduation and doctorate levels, fail to seek an employment of their choice. Is it not a failure of our social and educational systems? Even after spending the golden years of one's life in attaining higher education, our youth generations are not self - dependent. As such how would they be able to get rid of their day to day problems and how would they contribute to their society and the nation? Therefore it is a challenge not only before the youths of this country but also before the educationists, scholars and those in the government? After independence of Indian, the Department of Education under the Ministry of Human Resource Development was set up. At that time the mission was the quantitative spread of education. Literacy was the ultimate goal of education, because of which unemployment still a burning problem of education. To tackle these problematic challenges M K Gandhi's views on education can be great support. Gandhi feels the need of result oriented education for India. He said that every child has some specific inherent qualities. It should be a duty of a good teacher to identify his students' potentials at the primary levels. A student should gain education according to curriculum and moral guidance and as such improve his physical strength. After completing studies to a certain level, a student must be provided facilities, in addition to general, moral and physical education, to gain technical education in accordance with the special traitINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 31that has already been identified in his personality by his teacher. After completion his study up to graduate level with this technical knowledge, he would have a direction. As such he would able to be a self- sufficient either by his technical skills or by academic skills. In this way, at least his education would be result oriented education. Thus in Gandhi philosophy of education, more emphasis was given to that education which makes us self-sufficient. He has a dream, if every people become self-sufficient in India; there would be no property and accordingly all social maladies would be rooted out. Gandhi used the term 'Swaraj' not simply in the sense that we are all independent from British. He also supposed to use it in the sense that we all have to be self- sufficient to realize the actual meaning of the term 'Swaraj.' If we look in to the present scenario of India, then it becomes clear that after the 65 years of independent we are still not able to be self- sufficient. Lots of educated peoples are still unemployed, they are becoming directionless. Government of India has been launching lots of projects to minimize these burning problems of India. But, can these projects really able to reduce unemployment problems? This is a very big question before all of us. India has lots of human resources. But because of proper management systems it has been becoming useless till now. Who is responsible for this? If we look in to the deep, then we see that the whole system of our education is responsible for this. Draw backs of India's education system has been an issue well debated over in the past. But still our education system fails to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Another important aspect of India's education system is that it fails to make man human beings in the true sense. Because, we the educated people mostly are the responsible for many inhuman activities now a days. We may have lots of university degrees, but until and unless we are not able to be morally sound, these degrees are meaningless. So we need such type ofINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 32education which can able to make ourselves morally sound. Here Gandhi's philosophy of education can lead us a way. How can say that our education system is right, where teacher himself is involved in the rap case of his student? Jawaharlal Nehru in one of his speech said that status of a society depend how the women are treated in that society. Now we may ask ourselves, what is the status of our society, where women feel insecure after 6/7 pm in his city/ village? Literacy rate of India has been increasing from last few years. But are we really become educated? Does education means simply taking degrees? Conclusion If we look in to the Gandhi's philosophy of education in the light of contemporary needs of our country it becomes clear that his educational philosophy which underlies the basic scheme of education have certain important shortcomings and limitations. One most important shortcoming is that his scheme is opposed to the machine-age civilization which exploits the poor and the weak. It is feared that such attitude may make us ignore the rapid mechanical and technological advances that India is making and may , thus hinder industrial progress. Besides this there are other limitations also. They are- neglect of English, neglect of physical education and the play activities of children according to developmental needs, absence of modern techniques of evaluation of children's education etc. Despite some of the shortcomings Gandhi's philosophy of education is still relevant. Because his philosophy of education lies in the fact that education should necessarily be helpful in employment and it foundations should be laid on morality. As the demand of time we may apply Gandhi's educational philosophy. His views on value education and result oriented education are unique; these are not only important but also worth applying not only in India but also rest of the world.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V Education: Problems , New 4Harijan, 11-09-1937, CPS, (2004), 1st edition, Modern Indian Education: Policies, Progress and Problems , New Delhi: Kanishka Publishers, p.3.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY ISSN 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 34ISSUES IN ELT ENVIRONMENT IN MADRASSAS Md. Madni Ashraf Research Scholar Department Urdu University of Delhi, New Delhi 1. Introduction. The objective of this paper is to view the ELT scenario in the select religious institutions called madarsas. Majority of the Muslim population in India live in lower-middle socio-economic strata. The community as a whole had not been able to get access education as other communities in India. Children attend madarsas for education, since it is free and for all. In such schools, main focus is on Islamic teachings. Some other subjects like, Hindi, English, and Computers are also taught. The level of teaching and learning leaves much scope of improvement. In such schools, English education is imparted from level two . Actual goals of teaching English are to develop a basic efficiency of the learners. There is no literature available on ELT in madarsas, in Indian context and thus the researchers felt it imperative to study the situation of English language teaching and analyze the actual ELT scenario. Since, English is a global language and it is also a language of opportunities, thus the findings of the study will help the stake holders plan ELT in madarsas The initial issues to be when the investigation started were: Study literature on ELT in India in general and in madarsas in particular.

What is the pedagogy adopted by English language teachers? What are the factors that affect English teaching - learning? 2. Brief about madarsas. Madrassas were started by Sufias in the time of Muslim rulers in Indian subcontinent. Their main purpose was to spread religious awareness and education among the masses. It attracted large number of learners, even the non-muslims used to come to such institutions which were secularism in their nature. Since that period to the present stage, many changes have taken place in the ways madarsas are run, which at present is not in the preview of this study. Madarsas are of two types - Self financed called NIZAMIA and other being government-aided called AALIA. The later is run respective state madarsas boards and the earlier one is run by a committee headed by NAZIM. Syllabus - The two bodies decide their own syllabus, with major focus on religious education. Modern education, like Science, Maths, Social sciences etal., is seldom considered important. Hindi and English though are taught in the madarsas due to the understandable important of the two. Focus though is only to attain basic level in both subjects. Schooling- System in Madrassas: In madarsas, schooling years constitute of 9 + Primary level years. Entry level is at age 3-4 years. Below is explained level of schooling in Madrassas. level- MAKTUB (2-4 years) Secondary level- DARUL years). this stage actual learning starts (edadia-aalim).INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 36 Higher level- JAMIA. Till the end (fazil; 9 yrs) IFTA is part of JAMIA and is a 2 years course that research on religious issues. 3. Literature review . In India, after independence, various commissions and groups stressed the need for the rationalization of ELT . The Radhakrishan commission (1948) recommended, \"English should be studied in high schools and in the universities in order that we might keep ourselves in touch with the living stream of ever growing knowledge.\" The Kunzru Committee (1955) stressed the importance of the use of specific methods in English language teaching and the study of linguistics as the essential for ensuring adequate proficiency in English at the university stage. According to the recommendation of the official Language Commission (1956), \"English should be taught as \"a language of comprehension rather than as a literary language so as to develop in the students learning it a faculty of comprehending writings in the English language, more specifically those relating to the subject matter of their specialized fields of study.\" Kothari commission (1964) emphasized the role of English as a library language. The Study group 1 of UGC (1965) report has recommended a program for teaching of English and comprehension be given more attention than expression. This group notes better comprehension of written materials in English as a skill as essential at the postgraduate level. TheINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 37group recommended that there should be distinction between English language and English literature and the students should have choice to choose between the two. Central advisory board of education in India proposed three language policies in Indian school system (1957). National policy on education (1968) formalized it further. Hindi, English and mother tongue were to be taught in the schools in India. Subsequently first language commenced in class 1 with second language being taught at class 4 and the third language was taught from class 6. Since then, English has grown in stature and status. It has helped to maintain the integrity of India by linking people from different states of India. Also, it has become a language of opportunity in education and employment. Not much is available in literature in terms of ELT in madarsas. This somewhat reflect aloofness and also neglect of the national policy makers towards ELT in madarsas. ELT has taken a flight in other non- muslim schools. They are benefitting the most from advancements in the global world due to their access to English language. Sachar Committee Report (2006) stated poor situation of language education in madrasas india. According to the report 4% muslims go to such schools and these schools are mostly the only option available to them due to absence of any good government school. 4. Current study. In the study, main participants were teachers and students. The findings were based on responses and observations collected from them during the field work done in the most of April-May 2012. The sample sizeINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 38of the study was though not large enough to be considered a representative study. 5. Methodology . It is an exploratory study. Initial idea to work on the stated topic arose when it was felt that the muslims in madarsas are generally found wanting in English language, a fact that I can attest of, since I happen to be from a madarsas in UP state of India. Once the central ideas of the study were decided, a field work conducted in Madrassas (12) in 4 states in India; Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Delhi. Data was collected by way of questionnaires designed for participants in the study i.e. students, teachers, and parents. Medium of questionnaire was English which had to be changed into Urdu since the participants were not able to comprehend the questions asked in English. The study also involved informal interviews and observations. 5.1 Site. Madrasas visited were mostly in lower- income localities wherein options of other schools were limited. Madarsas provide free education with lodging and boarding prompting parents to send their children here. Most madrasas had permanent building with spacious and clean classrooms. Learners sit on floor. Classes run for 6 hours daily. Rote method is followed by teachers in the classroom and focus is on memorizing topics. Progress of the learners is evaluated every 6 months. 5.2 Teachers . Number of teachers participating in the study was 24, selected from 12 schools. Teachers are usually not properly trained to teach English language and are appointed contractually. None of the interviewed teachers was graduate or trained to become a teacher. All they had was 9 years madarsas schooling. Even after joining the madarsas, there is no in- service or special English teacher training for them. They follow translation and grammar teaching method while teaching English. Only basic grammarINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 39and basic understanding of functional English is aimed. Medium of instruction in the classroom is Urdu. 5.3 Variables of Language stereotype test. Following variables were set for teaches to elicit information on motivation and attitude towards English i. English speakers are at greater advantage than speakers of any other language ii. People will judge me by the level of my understanding of English language iii. English education will help me advance professionally iv. Objective of the text book is followed while teaching in the classroom v. The present syllabi is able to enhance communicative ability of learners vi. Prescribed syllabi is adequate to improve basic language skills (reading, speaking, writing, listening) vii. Communicative language teaching is the best approach for your students. Job satisfaction/ working environment (variables) viii. There are enough opportunities of professional enhancements in teaching ix. Promotion criterion is satisfactory x. There is enough support from school administrationINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 406. Discussion. Teachers feel knowing English is advantageous the level of one's English knowledge is an indicator of his abilities. It is also advantageous in professional development. They are eager to go and look for some other opportunities that will help them advance professionally. Text books are designed to develop basic understanding of the learners. It was inadequate to develop overall language skills of an individual. Thus it was reported to help them develop limited abilities which surely was way low than the national education policy for other schools in India. There is no way that learners can compete with the rest of the students when then come to main stream after completing madarsas education. Teachers, in general, did not know about teaching methods. They were in no position to deliberate over the question of 'best teaching approach.' When quizzed for level of motivation for teaching, it was found that teachers do not have any chances of professional or monetary growth. They join as teacher and serve at this position their entire life, with no increase in salary too. Administrative interference is understandably negligible wherein the English language teacher teaches the subject in ways that he knows best. With no proper laid down curricula or pedagogy though, it is difficult to expect the learners to gain much at the end of madarsas education. No wonder they are found poorly equipped to compete with learns from non-madarsas background. Below is tabulated data of the results of the study. Variables selected were 10. Numbers of participants were 24, with 2 from 1 school each.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 41 7. Students. (Variables) SES of family, proficiency of learners. 7.1 Discussion . Number of students in the study was 120, selected from 12 schools located in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar. All the participants were boys, since the researchers visited boys madarsas only. Selection of participants was done randomly, with 10 participants from each madarsas. All the participants were aged 9-22 years. 7.1.1 SES . Informal interview was done to know socio economic status of the family of participants. Office records were also accessed to gather information on SES. It was found that most of the students were from lower economic strata. They could not send their children to good schools so they had to send them to madarsas which provided them free education. Also, religious factors too played an important role in sending them to madarsas. Most of the parents were illiterate to ill-educated (i.e. below 8).INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 42Among them, there was no hope or expectations from government since they had not received schools or teachers in a long time where they could go or send their children for good education. 7.1.2 Proficiency . A specially designed test was administered on learners so as to know their knowledge and proficiency of English language. The test level was set after going through the text books prescribed to them and some questions were added keeping in mind expected proficiency level of a beginners' English learner. 7.2 Results . Most of the learners performed poorly in the tests. None could answer questions on basic grammatical rules. English was considered difficult subject. They did not enjoy reading English lessons. Their basic language skills, reading, speaking, listening and writing were poor. English was not used in any of the domains of language use i.e. home, classrooms, and peers. In the classroom, Urdu was medium of instruction. Learners were hesitant and not interest to go and ask question in the English classes. 8. Recommendations. The study identified the issues in English language classrooms in madarsas. It was found that teachers are not well trained or educated to teach the language. Learners too were not much aware or interested to learn English since they were not exposed to language use domains of the language thus may not be aware of the role and importance of the language. Parents were from lower SES, with no or low education level. They did not have many portions about the choice of schools for their children. Usually madarsas are last resource of education for them, especially with limited economic Resources to access mainstream educational institutions. According to Sachar Committee Report 1996, \"Government needs to provide good quality, subsidized 'mainstream' education and create an adequate infrastructure for education. The stateINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 43must also fulfill its obligation to provide affordable high quality school education to the masses through the formal education system. Apart from the role Madarsas have played in providing religious education one needs to recognize their contribution towards the education of Muslims in the country. Very often one finds that Madarsas have indeed provided schooling to Muslim children where the State has failed them. Many children go to Madarsas and thereby acquire some level of literacy/education when there is no school in the neighborhood. This effort needs to be recognized. This could be done by establishing 'equivalence' to Madarsas certificates for subsequent admission into government schools and universities. For this purpose, equivalence between the two systems of education will need to be established at different levels.\" References 1.Agnihotri, R.K. 1995.

However, the estimated number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in India has declined drastically in recent years-from 5.5 million in 2005 to below 2.5 million in 2007. This new figures are supported by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS (According to the United Nations 2011 AIDS report) . Infection rates soared throughout the 1990s, and today the epidemic affects all sectors of Indian society, not just the groups - such as sex workers and truck drivers with which it was originally associated. In a country where poverty, illiteracy and poor health are rampant, the spread of HIV presents a daunting challenge. In much of the world, HIV/AIDS has for a long time been seen as a problem that affects men, specifically gay men, and as a result of this preconception, the harm that it does to women around the world has been largely overlooked. Y et today nearly half of all adults living with HIV around the world are women. Around 76% of women living with HIV are in sub- Saharan Africa. Among young people living with HIV in this region, three in every four are female. AIDS is the leading cause of death among men and women aged 25 to 44 in India. Most HIV+ women have been infected with HIV through heterosexual sex. Physically, women are more susceptible than men to HIV infection through heterosexual sex, and this fact alone means that special attention must be paid to protecting them if they areINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 46not to be disproportionately affected by the epidemic. Information drawn from different studies shows that during heterosexual sex, women are about twice as likely to become infected with HIV from men as men are from women. This is a major reason why women have caught up so rapidly with men when it comes to figures for the numbers of HIV+ people. This trend clearly indicates from the data of CC&SCs in Nellore, that the teenage girls and women accounts more than half of new HIV infections reported in 2005 to 2010. Further the alarming fact about HIV and women which seize the attention is the number of women living with HIV has increased by ten percent while the number of men infected has increased seven percent from 2000 to 2004.It may be the vulnerabilities such as: Women are especially susceptible to heterosexual transmission physically because the mucosal lining of the vagina offers a large surface area to be exposed to HIV-infected seminal fluid. Prevailing gender inequities in many cultures women are not free to refuse sex or to insist on safer sex using condoms. In addition, women have less access to employment and education in developing countries. Often, the sex trade is one of the few options for women trying to earn money and support themselves and their children. Current estimates : In 2006 UNAIDS estimated that there were 5.6 million people living with HIV in India, which indicated that there were more people with HIV in India than in any other country in the world. In 2007, following the first survey of HIV among the general population, UNAIDS and NACO agreed on a new estimate - between 2 million and 3.1 million people living with HIV . In 2008 the figure was estimated to be 2.31 million. In 2009 it was estimated that 2.4 million people were living with HIV in India, which equates to a prevalence of 0.3%. While this may seem low, because India's population is so large, it is third in the world in terms of greatest number of people living with HIV . With a population of around aINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 47billion, a mere 0.1% increase in HIV prevalence would increase the estimated number of people living with HIV by over half a million. Map of India showing the worst affected states . The vast size of India makes it difficult to examine the effects of HIV on the country as a whole. The majority of states within India have a higher population than most African countries, so a more detailed picture of the crisis can be gained by looking at each state individually. The HIV prevalence data for most states is established through testing pregnant women at antenatal clinics. While this means that the data are only directly relevant to sexually active women, they still provide a reasonable indication as to the overall HIV prevalence of each area. The following states have recorded the highest levels of HIV prevalence at antenatal and sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) clinics over recent years. Andhra Pradesh Andhra Pradesh in the southeast of the country has a total population of around 76 million, of whom 6 million live in or around theINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 48city of Hyderabad. The HIV prevalence at antenatal clinics was 1% in 2007. This figure is smaller than the reported 1.26% in 2006, but remains the highest out of all states. HIV prevalence at STD clinics was very high at 17% in 2007. Among high-risk groups, HIV prevalence was highest among men who have sex with men (MSM) (17%), followed by female sex workers (9.7%) and IDUs (3.7%).Top of Form Impact of HIV/AIDS The HIV rate in India is growing by leaps and bounds. Over the years, there has been growing concern about the HIV epidemic in India and its impact on individuals, families and society as a whole. It has been argued that the impact of epidemic so far has not been serious enough to make any significant dent in the socio-economic and demographic scenario of the country. Various estimates of AIDS related to mortality however seem to suggest that the situation is more serious than what meets the eye. This paper attempts to examine the impact of HIV/AIDS and also problems associated with the infection. Demographic impact: HIV/AIDS will have a serious impact on children, both directly and indirectly. Some children of infected mothers will be infected with HIV and will die of AIDS. Socio-economic impact : The social burden of HIV/AIDS tends to fall disproportionately on already vulnerable groups, contributing to the erosion of the family and social cohesion. In countries where heterosexual contact is the fastest increasing transmission mode, women and children are becoming more vulnerable, both as AIDS survivors and AIDS casualties. Most of the macro-economic toll of HIV/AIDS comes from the high cost of health care, which diverts resources from productive investments. The HIV/AIDS changes the life style of the individuals in the form of poor diet in terms of restricted rangeINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 49food, less preparation time, poor housing i.e. less time for repair and less access to education particularly for the girls. These are the some problems concerning impact at the household level, because households are not at all homogenous among cultures or even within them and household changes their size and constitution overtime. Impact on women When a family member is stricken by HIV/AIDS, women are most often expected to be the caregivers, in addition to assuming domestic chores and trying to earn some income outside the home. Also, when adults can no longer cope alone, girls are much more likely than boys to be taken out of school to help their family. In many countries, a widow's ability to acquire property and land rights after her HIV infected husband's death remains a major problem. Without access to the means of production, they are forced into petty theft, sex work or into dangerous and illegal work to support themselves and their family. When the women require support (who falls ill) the tendency of families to spend fewer resources on women than on men compounds the problem. Preventive Strategies for Alleviating the Socio-Demographic and Economic Impact of HIV/AIDS Comprehensive care programmes, including improved and expanded access to services, clinical care, palliative care, home-based care, referral networks for PLWHA and support for adversely affected children should be encouraged. Alternative community-based service delivery models through grass-roots mobilization, with special consideration for the role of women in providing. Prevention and treatment should be integrated through a continuum of care (for example, collaboration between national programmes, NGOs and community based organizations in India.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 50Furthermore, community standards for care and support should be formulated. Community-based home-care initiatives should be fostered to support families' coping responses; as such approaches are more effective than those of institutions in addressing the economic and psychosocial needs of AIDS-affected children and in helping communities to deal with orphans and other disadvantaged children (Hollertz, 2001). Urbanization is associated with many health problems. The rapid increase of people living in cities will be among the most important global health issues of the 21st century. Over half the world's population now lives in cities. By 2030, six out of every 10 people will be city dwellers, rising to seven out of every 10 people by 2050. In many cases, especially in the developing world, the speed of urbanization has out packed the ability of governments to build essential infrastructure. A health problem of the urban poor includes an increased risk for violence, chronic disease, and for some communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The occupants of large slums are stripped of their basic necessities of life like shelter, clean water, sanitation, health and safe environment. Policy Implications In order to save the society from the loss of HIV/AIDS, the following policy measures may be considered: Production and distribution of female condoms among the prostitutes through NGOs. To prevent the incidence of HIV infection and the need to allocate more funds for conducting awareness programmes. Cost effective care and support for the people living with AIDS. Link between poverty and AIDS need to be explored and addressed.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 51Support to innovative programmes on HIV/AIDS mitigation. Encouraging indigenous knowledge and health practices for combating HIV/ AIDS. Involving people living with HIV/AIDS in the development and appraisal of HIV/AIDS policies and programmes. Proving finance and human resources to identify all aspects of the respondents to HIV/AIDS. Coordinating resources and referral systems by the government for internal based community services. Developing HIV/AIDS policy to support non-discrimination of people along with AIDS in a confidential manner. No reduction the expenditure on HIV/AIDS in the name of disinvestment by the government. Need to formulate repaired healthcare planning for HIV/AIDS at the regional and sub-regional level. Rational allocation of public expenditure on AIDS in the high risk areas. Recognition of different types and degrees of risk for men and women workers. Review of literature V .Kumar & G.Ravi stated that the epidemiology of HIV suggests that the nature and patterns of socio-economic development themselves have an important influence on the spread and eventual impact of the disease. It could be noted that male labor migration contributes towards the breakup of stable family relationships and encourages temporaryINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 52unstable relationships in urban areas. at the same time restricted access to education and limited employment opportunities may force many young women in to temporary relationship with men in which economic support is bartered for sexual pleasure in some places (Backer1990) .In some places the impact of recession and structural adjustment programmes have contributed to diminished formal sector of employment opportunities, increased poverty that have increased the population at the risk of infection through their contribution to increased level of urbanization (Sanders and Sambo, 1991). Rao (2000) narrates that women are more vulnerable sexually and economically because of cultural expectations. Particularly young women and girls are vulnerable. For example, in many countries it is common for men to select significantly women as wives, making them culturally vulnerable to HIV infection at a younger age. Their immature cervix and relatively low vaginal mucus production presents less of a barrier to HIV , making them biologically more vulnerable to infection. In most countries sexual abuse and child prostitution also contribute to vulnerability of girls and young women to infection with HIV . As a consequence, women are increasingly becoming infected with HIV at a younger age than men and more girls and young women are becoming infected in their teens and early twenties than women in any other age group. Sharma (2006) Pointed out that the breakdown of societal structures resulting from conflict often means that women of all ages can become caretakers of family members and relatives, including orphans affected by and infected with HIV/AIDS. This can prevent girls from going to school and women from contributing to the workforce or engaging in political activities, which in turn weakens the economic and social participation of the population at a crucial time of national crisis. In suchINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 53insecure situations, when life is threatened on a daily basis and poverty is on the rise, people particularly women and may sell sex to local populations as well to peacekeepers, humanitarian, and other foreign workers as means of economic survival. This increases their exposure to HIV/AIDS. Moreover, where security is a concern and men are seen as protectors, it is unlikely that women will be able to negotiate safe sex or to leave a relationship, even if it is perceived to be risky. Methodology A careful selection of the respondents is necessary before collecting the data. Once the research universe is ready, the sample 60 was selected by using simple random sampling method. The inclusion in the sample was based on the willingness of the HIV infected persons to be a part of the study that is an informed consent was taken. The data was collected by using the interview method and suitable schedules were developed both in English and Telugu to facilitate a smooth process. The present study is based on primary and secondary sources of data. The primary data was collected by using well structured interview schedule and inferences were drawn based on the results. The secondary source of data was including collection of information from the community care and support centres and various positive net work organizations which are actively working for HIV positive people in Nellore district. Need for the Study: The researcher selected infected women for the study because of high prevalence rate of HIV infection among women is very high in Nellore (APSACS reports,2009) due to several reasons such as high prevalence of prostitution, urbanization, rapid growth of migration, lack of awareness on HIV/AIDS and so on.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 54 Objectives; 1.To study the socio-economic and demographic details of the respondents, 2.To assess the economic impact of HIV infected women, 3. To analyze the employment problems of HIV infected women at work place, 4. To suggest intervention strategies for social work practice with HIV infected women. Statement of the problem: The HIV epidemic is a women's epidemic; particularly vulnerable to infection and increasing number of women are becoming infected. It is estimated that one- third of all those thought to be infected about 2 million - are women. It is also estimated that the number of infected women may overtake the number of infected men by the mid - 90s . Women are consists an increasing proportion of all AIDS cases and often women become infected at a younger age than men. The overwhelming majority of infected young women do not know they are infected. Most young women are diagnosed during pre and post natal period. The shock of discovering their own infection status is added the fear that their baby might be Infected, guilt and grief at having brought all this about and the desolation of motherhood in these circumstances. Area of the Study: Nellore is a city located in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. It is of strategic commercial importance as it lies between the cities of Vijayawada and Chennai. It is located on the banks of the Penna River. Nellore is also famous for its productions of mica, lemon, and agricultureINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 55products such as rice and it is also famous for other temples. Based on the above background, the prevalence rate of HIV / AIDS in Nellore is also very high due to several reasons. In this connection; the researcher selected the topic aptly Impact of HIV/AIDS among urban women: An empirical study in Nellore District. Then the researcher selected community care& support center and NNP+ in Nellore Town to carry out the study by using the method of simple random sampling. In Nellore the HIV/AIDS prevalence is very high among women, those who are socially and economically poor (NNP+ reports).Hence, the researcher planned this study purposively in those slums to generate the awareness among the infected women. Research Design: A descriptive research design was utilized to obtain qualitative and quantitative data to meet the aims and objectives of research interview technique and observation methods are used while collecting data. And also to explore their awareness levels regarding the HIV/AIDS. Descriptive research design has been adopted to carry out the study on \"Impact of HIV/AIDS among urban women: An empirical study in Nellore District\" to obtain qualitative and quantitative data to meet the aims and objectives of the study. Universe: The universe of the study comprises the respondents of infected women from NNP+ organization. As they are capable of express their opinion regarding the socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS among urban women. Sampling: The researcher selected Nellore urban vicinity for the study, then the researcher collected details of the HIV/AIDS infected women familiesINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 56from the list available at NNP+ (Nellore Network of Positive People) and Community Care and Support Centre. The researcher adopted simple random sampling technique for the proposed study and selected 60 respondents randomly from the lists provided by the NNP+ and CC & SC Nellore. Tools used in the study: The basic data used in this study has been taken from the Chandrababu Nagar, Vanamthota, Stone House Peta which has been recognized as one of the three most HIV affected areas of Nellore districts (NNP+ reports). Among various reasons assumed to be responsible for the growing epidemic in Nellore one prominent reason is the rapid social and economic growth that the district has witnessed in recent years. The data for this study collected from interviews that were carried out in the households of affected by HIV/AIDS. The overall sample for the study includes 60 households. In addition, information was also collected from a number of stakeholders in order to assess their perception about the impact of AIDS and the efforts that are needed to mitigate the impact at different levels. Outreach workers and counselors involved in this study. Adequate care was taken to maintain the confidentiality at all levels of data collection. Methods of data collection: The researcher approached the NNP+ organization and staff members to collect the details of PLHAS (People Living with HIV/AIDS). Based on the details of NNP+ organization, the researcher selected Nellore urban for the study of the HIV infected women. The researcher approached ORW (Out- Reach Worker) and informed them about the purpose of the study and sought their cooperation and permission to carry out the study which was duly granted by the regional NNP+ project Director. Later, theINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 57researcher approached with the respondents and explained to them the purpose of the study and taken their consent to elicit the information according to the objectives of the study. The researcher administered well structured interview schedule to collect the information regarding socio- economic and demographic details, Problems faced by the HIV infected and affected women .The researcher used interview and observation methods and collected the data based on the interview that has been carried out in mother tongue i.e. Telugu. Major Findings The information has been elicited through well structured interview schedule participatory observation and focus group discussion was analyzed, tabulated and percentages were calculated. It is clear that a majority of the respondents are in the age group of 20-30 years and 40 percent belonged to Back ward community, most of them are illiterates living in thatched houses and 81.66 percent married belonged to Hindu religion. It is observed that 50 percent of the respondents are engaged on self employed is carving out different livelihoods to pursuit their economic needs their families income per annum Rs5000-10,000 and 88 percent of the respondents are white ration card holders and 40 percent of the respondents are house wives. When the researcher observed working conditions in field visits, 75 percent of the respondents opinioned that they are getting more employment opportunities in urban areas than rural areas. However, economic hardships are common among infected families due to their physical inability to perform work. Researchers observed Stigma and Discrimination attached to the HIV infection in work place. 10 percent of the respondents are reported theyINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 58removed from work due their infection. 50 percent of the respondents are reported that there is some difference before and after infection while sharing work and during interactions etc. whenever they feel difficult, family members need to extend their psycho-social support to these ill- fated people .50 percent are suffering from opportunistic infections frequently and used to visit the hospital receiving allopathic treatment from nearest government hospitals majority of them are feeling better after receiving treatment. Majority of the children of infected parents are remaining healthy. Summary and Conclusions The AIDS epidemic has caused adverse psycho-social and economic consequences leading to change in the family structure, and thus disturbed the capacity of the nuclear and extended family to respond to the needs of members afflicted by HIV and AIDS.A significant Households with HIV/ AIDS deaths had reported reduced savings during the reference period of negative impact on the economy of households where an active adult had died due to HIV/AIDS is clearly evident from the present comparative analysis., reduced expenditures on consumer durables, and had sold assets in order to raise or supplement income. On the social front, they had experienced discriminations and a few of them have had to send their children away to distant relatives, and withdraw children from school. Adult deaths due to HIV/AIDS has also impacted negatively on children's access both health and education. This study clearly points out towards a need of a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS which includes efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination at all levels; developing a supportive network system for women and orphans; and more specifically preparing families to provide for children in the eventuality of death of both the parents and one parent.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 59Women are, economically and biologically more vulnerable to HIV infection and AIDS. The social cultural and economic impact of the epidemic on women will be greater compared to men. AIDS created severe impact on economic status of many developing countries as it strikes people in the most productive age groups. The effects will vary according to the severity of the AIDS epidemic and the structure of the national economies. The aggravated incidence of HIV/AIDS has become a significant cause of death among women in the age between 20-40 years who live in urban areas of Nellore. Hence, it is authentically proved that AIDS is affecting the women in their productive child-bearing age i.e. between 30 -35 years. Therefore, it is felt that a study on HIV/AIDS infected women was carried out in Nellore to bring about a scientific and statistical hypothesis; awareness on income generating activities and sensitization programmes are to be organized to develop comprehensive knowledge to reduce the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS as well as the poverty among infected urban women. Recommendations & Suggestions The following suggestions were made by the researcher as a result of her study. The awareness levels of the respondents on HIV/AIDS can also be studied, where respondents are facing difficulties even to get daily labour. It is important to develop and stick to a treatment plan for the women with healthcare provider to ensure the best possibilities of outcomes from this deadly disease. It is inevitable to take proper steps to combat the Domestic violence of women due to their infection .INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 60Governmental and Non-Governmental organizations have to take proper steps to remove stigma and discrimination among these people. HIV/AIDS prevention efforts have to be undertaken by the government as well as non- government organizations to reduce the prevalence rate in affected areas. Strengthening health care services for women to reduce the vulnerability of spreading HIV/AIDS. When women do receive adequate care and treatment in a timely manner, they appear to benefit from HIV meds as much as men. HIV testing, Maternal and child health and counseling services should also be strengthened. The Government has to provide livelihood opportunities for infected women for their survival.

With increasing demands from industrial processes for higher operating pressures and higher temperature, new technologies have been developed to handle the present day specialized requirements. Multilayer Pressure Vessels have extended the art of pressure vessel construction and presented the process designer with a reliable piece of equipment useful in a wide range of operating conditions for the problems generated by the storage of hydrogen and hydrogenation processes The term pressure vessel referred to those reservoirs or containers, which are subjected to internal or external pressures. The pressure vessels are used to store fluids under pressure. The fluid being stored may undergo a change of state inside theINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 63pressure vessels as in case of steam boilers or it may combine with other reagents as in chemical plants. Pressure vessels find wide applications in thermal and nuclear power plants, process and chemical industries, in space and ocean depths, and in water, steam, gas and air supply system in industries. High Pressure vessels are used as reactors, separators and heat exchangers. They are vessel with an integral bottom and a removable top head, and are generally provided with an inlet, heating and cooling system and also an agitator system. High Pressure vessels are used for a pressure range of 15 N/mm2 to a maximum of 300 N/mm2.These are essentially thick walled cylindrical vessels, ranging in size from small tubes to several meters diameter. Both the size of the vessel and the pressure involved will dictate the type of construction used. A solid wall vessel consists of a single cylindrical shell, with closed ends. Due to high internal are governed by the ratio of diameter to wall thickness and the shell is designed as thick cylinder, if its wall thickness exceeds one-tenth of the inside diameter. A solid wall vessel is also termed as Mono Block pressure vessel. 2.0 DESIGN OF MULTILAYER HIGH PRESSURE VESSEL: Multi layer vessels are built up by wrapping a series of sheets over a core tube. The construction involves the use of several layers of material, usually for the purpose of quality control and optimum properties. Multi layer construction is used for higher Pressure. It provides inbuilt safety, utilizes material economically, no stress relief is required. For corrosive applications the inner liner is made of special material and is not considered for strength criteria. The outer load bearing shells can be made of high tensile strength materialINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 642.1 DESIGN OBJECTIVES: 1.

The multilayered pressure vessel is orthotropic in nature and cylindrical in shape. It consists of carbon fibers as the reinforcement material into a polymeric epoxy matrix. Because of the orthotropic nature of the composite materials, the finite element modeling of the pressure vessel requires the determination of nine different properties. The material properties of fiber reinforced composite depends upon the properties of both the matrix and the fibers. The angle of orientation of the fibers in the composite also plays a very important role determination of the properties and the behaviour of the composite, since the fibers have superior mechanical properties along its length. 4.2SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE ELEMENT TYPE It is very necessary to select the appropriate element type for the accurate finite element analysis of the composite pressure vessel. The finite element software, ANSYS 13.1 provides the various shell and solid element types to model layered composite materials. A solid element can be utilized to model thick layered composites but it requires that the mesh divisions in thickness directions must be the same as the number of material layers. This increases the analysis and the calculation time for these elements. While, the shell elements does not require the mesh divisions in thickness direction and the calculation as well as the analysis time for these elements is much lesser than for the solid elements. Because of this property of the shell elements we have selected SHELL 99 as the appropriate element type for the purpose of our study. SHELL 99 is a linear layered structure shell element. Very thin to moderately thick layers can be modeled withINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 67this element. It may be used for the purpose of modeling layered structures and up to 250 uniform thickness layers can be modeled by this element. It is a 3D shell element and consists of 8 - nodes, with 6 degrees of freedom at each node. Among the 8 - nodes, four nodes are the corner nodes and the remaining four are the mid-side nodes. This element allows the user to define elastic properties, layer orientation and density for each layer. 5.0 STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS RESULTS 5.1 SOLID WALL STEEL- PRESSURE VESSEL 5.2 SOLID WALL AL- PRESSURE VESSELINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 686.0 DETERMINATION OF OPTIMUM ANGLE OF FIBER ORIENTATION FROM ANALYSIS: The cylindrical composite pressure vessel is designed for various fiber orientations. The modeling is performed for the CFRP cylindrical pressure vessel for both, the hoop and the helical windings of the carbon fiber. For the hoop windings of the carbon fibers, the fibers are oriented at an angle of 0\u00b0 with the axis of the cylindrical pressure vessel. For helical windings the fibers are oriented for various fiber The Fig. shows the stacking sequence for \u00b1 35\u00b0 fiber orientation. The cylindrical composite pressure vessel is modeled for four uniform thickness layers and the number of integration points are taken as three to define the layered configuration completely. The CFRP pressure vessel is analyzed by loading it by high internal pressures. The Tsai-Wu failure criterion is utilized for the purpose of analysis. The analysis is performed for the calculation of burst pressure for the pressure vessel. The burst pressure for the pressure vessel is predicted for various fiber orientation angles of the burst pressure for each fiber orientation requires separate model formation. The burst pressures are predicted by incrementally increasing the internal pressure from the working value ofINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 6935 MPa to the value of burst pressure step by step. For every increment in the internal pressure it is required to compare the value of maximum stress obtained with value of ultimate stress for the pressure vessel by the relation given by the Eq. 1 max d\" u \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 (1) Here, max, u are the maximum stress and ultimate stress of the pressure vessel, respectively. The value of ultimate stress for the CFRP pressure vessel is 1210 Mpaher Fig. gives the stress distribution for this pressure vessel for \u00b1 25\u00b0 fiber orientation at their burst pressure. After the analysis for the deformations and stresses developed in the vessel for various fiber orientation angles, the minimum deformation and stresses are developed at \u00b1 45\u00b0 for the cylindrical composite pressure vessels. The Fig. shows the graph between the burst pressure and the different fiber orientations. Fig: graph between angle of fiber orientation (on X-axis) and deformation (on Y-axis). In the deformation graph, At \u00b1 45\u00b0 the deformations are low when compared to other orientation angles. so this is the optimized angle of fiber orientationINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 70CONCLUSIONS 1. At present multilayered vessels are being used extensively in many industries when compare to solid wall pressure vessels. Because, there is a huge difference in weight of the vessel and uniform stress distribution among the vessel wall thickness. 2. There is a percentage saving in material of 28.48% by using multilayered vessels in the place of solid walled vessel when both the vessels are manufactured with same material i.e. SA515 Grade 70 steel . 3. There is a percentage saving in material of 91.62% by using multilayered CFRP material vessels when compared to multilayered SA515 Grade 70 steel material vessels. 4. This decreases not only the overall weight of the component but also the cost of the material required to manufacture the pressure vessel. This is one of the main aspects of designer to keep the weight and cost as low as possible. 5. The Stress variation from inner side to outer side of the multilayered pressure vessel is around 12.67%, where as to that of solid wall vessel is 18.23%. This compared to that of solid wall vessel. 6. Minimization of stress concentration is another most important aspect of the designer. It also shows that the material is utilized most effectively in the fabrication of shell. 7. Owing to the advantages of the multi layered pressure vessels over the conventional single walls pressure vessels, it is concluded that multi layered pressure vessels are superior for high pressures and high temperature operating conditions.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 718. In the deformation graph, At \u00b1 45\u00b0 the deformations are low when compared to other orientation angles.The \u00b1 45\u00b0 fiber orientation angle is obtained as the optimum fiber orientation angle for the composite pressure vessel subjected to high internal pressure loading.

These banks ruled the roost, protected by regulations that did not allow free entry into the sector and to their credit, when the banking sector was opened up, they survived by adapting quickly to the new rules of the game. Many managed to post profits. For them an unexpected bonanza came from government bonds in which most were immensely invested. Ironically, the Reserve Bank of India's moves to cut aggressively the interest rates after 1999, pushed up the prices of bonds. So banks had a windfall doing almost nothing. The bond profits, like manna from heaven, improved the balance- sheets of all banks irrespective of their hub performance. However, the era of lethargic banking is soon to end. The net of rules that propped up the Indian banking industry is now being dismantled rapidly. A Paradigm shift of Banking: You would no longer see bank account holders in India waiting in long queues at the bank teller counter to get a draft or to withdraw their own money. Gone of those days when a bank would take days to transfer cash from one branch to another. Today, things are as simple as typing an SMS or dialing for a piping hot pizza. For the Indian banking system, changeINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 74has been quite invariable for the last two decades to achieve efficiency and customer friendliness amidst rising competition. Today, banks no longer restrict themselves to traditional banking activities, but are explore newer path to increase business and capture new markets. Either as a part of reforms process, which, in a larger context is linked to the ongoing economic reforms, or in an efforts to adopt the best international banking practices, the banking industry has seen radical transformation in the areas of business portfolio restructuring, hiring strategies, domestic and overseas expansion plans, treasury portfolios and creation of a technological platform. With a strong regulatory regime pushed forward by the RBI, the new proposal include strengthening the prudential norms in line with the international best practices, improving credit delivery, planning stylish products, strengthening corporate governance practices and promoting financial inclusion, strengthening the urban co-operative banking sector while improving overall customer service. To start with, while strengthening the prudential norms, a great deal of attention was paid to tackling the vast non-performing loans that had burdened the banking system. As banks started tackling the sticky assets, their asset quality began to improve helping them to expand their credit portfolio. Notable features like the introduction to Basel II requirements and the possibility of larger freedom for foreign banks in the country have opened the way for newer ideas and innovation. Two major concerns related to corporate governance practices followed by banks. These related to concentrated ownership and quality of management that controlled the banks. Corporate governance practices were, therefore, strengthened. The other major achievement was the sharp increase in the flow of credit to the agriculture and SME sector. In a bid to bring about a vast section of the population into the banking system, theINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 75RBI launched a financial inclusion programme and banks were asked to introduce no frills accounts. According to RBI data, about 13 million no frills accounts were opened in a short span of two years. The aim is to no longer confine the banking services to just metropolitans or semi-urban areas in India. The reach has now been widened to cover the remotest regions of the country. The confidence in the urban co-operative banking segment was eroded in the early 2000s following a run on a multi-state co-operative bank. In order to restore the confidence and overcome the problem of dual control over urban co-operative banks, a mechanism of the TAFCUBs (a state-level taskforce on urban co-operative banks) was put in place. The use of technology combined with some other initiatives helped improve the customer services by banks. Branch expansion, installation and use of ATMs also helped banks expand their reach. The banking system has made efforts to be more customer-friendly by facilitating doorstep banking. With the entry of new generation private sector banks and foreign banks into the country, existing banks have introduced services such as phone banking, mobile banking and net banking. An interesting development was the setting up of credit information bureaus to obtain and share data on borrowers in a systematic manner for sound credit decisions by the banks. With a view to strengthening the legal mechanism and help credit information bureaus to collect process and share information on borrowers, the Credit Information Act was enacted in May 2005. Along with heavy investment in technology and in manpower also quite a chunk is being invested on the advertising and branding fronts. Banks like Union Bank of India Canara Bank, State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda have taken the lead in this new trend. Banks have started approaching B-schools for student placements and even public sector banks are trying to benchmarkINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 76their compensation structure against market trends. A big change in the Indian banking space in the last decade is that banking services in the country have become accessible to the customers. Alternate banking channels have gained immense popularity in the last 10 years, says Chanda Kochhar, MD and CEO, ICICI Bank. She adds that the easy availability of retail as well as the corporate loans at competitive rates has fuelled the growth of Indian banking sector . I foresee that cellular phone technology will play a very important role in lowering the cost of banking transactions in the next decade. The penetration of banking services to all parts of the country is expected to gain momentum through the usage of mobile phones, she said. Her views are echoed by Partho Mukherjee, president (credit), Axis Bank. He says, Parameters such as technological support and system enablement for better customer relationship management have changed the face of the Indian banking sector in the last 10 years. During the decade, banks have adopted a cash management approach rather than merely serving the credit needs of the consumers. Bankers also see a major change taking place in the payment mode. Public sector banks praise the RBI for making this happen. From a of prudential norms put in place by the RBI. Liberalization has strengthened the banking system to a great extent. More and more information technology-based systems have been put in place by the state-owned banks. These banks are capitalized more to face the challenges posed by foreign and private sector banks, said Renu Challu, managing director , State Bank of Hyderabad. From non-mechanized and manual operations to core banking, the banking industry has come a long way, said KR Kamath, chairman and managing director, Allahabad Bank. The new prudential norms have helped banks manage their operations efficiently. With the global financial crisis challenging the wayINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 77banks in developed countries have practiced risk management norms, Indian banks are expecting many more changes to strengthen the domestic financial system. According to a RBI road-map, India will have a competitive banking market after 2009. As one of the most attractive emerging market destinations, India will see foreign banks come in, what with more freedom to come in, grow and acquire. Therefore, it is imperative that Indian banks wake up to this reality and re-focus on their core asset \u2014 the customer. A greater focus on Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is the only way the banking industry can protect its market share and boost growth. CRM would also make Indian bankers realize that the purpose of their business is to \"create and keep a customer\" and to \"view the entire business process as consisting of a tightly integrated effort to discover, create, and satisfy customer needs.\" What is CRM and what will it deliver to the banks? CRM is, probably, one of the least clearly defined business acronyms, as there is no single definition for it. It is probably easier to say what CRM is not. Unfortunately, CRM has also become a misnomer for a range of solutions from IT vendors, each providing its own spin on the idea. CRM is variously misunderstood as a fancy sales strategy, an expensive software product, or even a new method of data collection. It is none of these. CRM is a simple philosophy that places the customer at the heart of a business organization's processes, activities and culture to improve his satisfaction of service and, in turn, maximize the profits for the organization. A successful CRM strategy aims at understanding the needs of the customer and integrating them with the organization's strategy , people, and technology and business process. Therefore, one of the best ways of launching a CRM initiative is to start with what the organizationINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 78is doing now and working out what should be done to improve its interface with its customers. While this may sound quite straightforward, for large organizations it can be a mammoth task unless a gradual step-by-step process is adopted. It does not happen simply by buying the software and installing it. For CRM to be truly effective, it requires a well-thought-out initiative involving strategy, people, technology, and processes. Above all, it requires the realization that the CRM philosophy of doing business should be adopted incrementally with an iterative approach to learn at every stage of development. Only time will tell how Indian banks embrace the CRM philosophy and take on the competition from foreign entities. Traditionally, few people changed their banks unless serious problems occurred. In the past there was, to certain extent, a committed, often inherited relationship between a customer and his/her bank. The philosophy , culture and organization of financial institutions were grounded in this assumption and reflected in their marketing policies, which were product and transaction-oriented, reactionary, focused on discrete rather than continuous activities. Today, financial institutions can no longer rely on these committed relationships or established marketing techniques to attract and retain customers. As markets break down into heterogeneous segments, a more precisely targeted marketing technique is required, which creates a dialogue with smaller groups of customers and identifies individual needs. Also, before the Internet revolution, consumers largely selected their banks based on how convenient the location of bank's branches was to their homes or offices. With the advent of new technologies in the business of bank, such as Internet banking and ATMs, now customers can freely chose any bank for their transactions. Thus, the customer base of banksINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 79has increased, and so has the choices of customers for selecting the banks. This situation coupled with the pressures of competitive and dynamic markets has contributed to the growth of CRM in the Financial Services Sector. The Concept of Customer Relationship Management: Customer Relationship Management is the establishment, development, maintenance and optimization of long-term mutually valuable relationships between consumers and the organizations. Successful customer relationship management focuses on understanding the needs and desires of the customers and is achieved by placing these needs at the heart of the business by integrating them with the organization's strategy, people, technology and business processes. Regime of regulated rates, banks have moved to an era full of freedom, thanks to a number At the heart of a perfect CRM strategy is the creation of mutual value for all the parties involved in the business process. It is about creating a sustainable competitive advantage by being the best at understanding, communicating, and delivering, and developing existing customer relationships in addition to creating and keeping new customers. So the concept of product life cycle is giving way to the concept of customer life cycle focusing on the development of products and services that anticipate the future need of the existing customers and creating additional services that extend existing customer relationships beyond transactions. CRM and Technology: CRM is an acronym for 'Customer Relationship Management'. CRM is a set of strategies, processes, metrics, organizational culture and technology solutions that enhance an organization's ability to see the differences in its customers' and prospects' behavior and needs, track newINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 80opportunities to better serve their customers and act, instantly and profitably , on those differences and opportunities. Recently CRM has taken a center stage in the business world with businesses concentrating on saving money and increasing profits by redefining internal processes and procedures. It costs a company dramatically less to retain and grow an existing client, than it does to court new ones. It is said that \"It is seven times more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep an existing one\" , therefore the value of customer information and management should never be underestimated. Customer relation management analysts say CRM is \"a buzzword that's really not so new. What's new is the technology is allowing us to do what we could do at the turn of the century with the neighborhood grocer. He had few enough customers and enough brainpower to keep track of everyone's preferences. Technology has allowed us to go back to the future to this model.\" The aim of CRM is optimize the use of technology and human resources for the business to gain insight into the behavior of costumer. Seeing the new market (CRM) emerge, the world's leading business software vendors have reinvented themselves to focus on CRM, and there has been a fierce competition for the dominance in this market. Technology is now an essential part of CRM nowadays but buying technology before defining CRM business goals, is a recipe for disaster. It is important to remember that technology used for CRM should be 'tailor made\u00b4 depending on the type of consumer base of the company and the business goals. Companies need to understand CRM in relevance to customers and customers only. Technology like call center services and software's will prove helpful only if they improve the customer services and relation, otherwise all fancy technology is useless if it fails to benefit the customer. The CRM services consist of the following major segments:INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 81Consulting services Implementation services CRM Outsourcing services Training services There are various technical components of CRM like customer information, sales, marketing trends and marketing efficacy that act in tandem to improve relationship between companies and consumers. From a technological perspective, it involves capturing customer data from across the organization and consolidating all internally and externally acquired customer-related data in a central database. This data is then analyzed and the results of the analysis are distributed via customer touch points like mobile sales force, inbound and outbound call centers, web sites, point- of-sale, email, etc., for use while dealing with customers at these very touch points. The Internet has revolutionized the way business is done and has virtually taken the enterprise information system within the reach of the customer. It can be accessed through the call centers, through the Internet and increasingly through mobile devices. It has been predicted that the total worldwide market for CRM services will grow to US$ 125.2 billion by 2004. With a vast talent pool India is fast becoming an important development base of major CRM companies. Indian companies are jumping into the CRM bandwagon to seize a chunk of the global market, both products as well as services. Call centers, catering primarily to the American and European markets are coming up in and around the metros. With the easing of infrastructure constraints, India is likely to emerge as a significant player in this segment. India even has a CRM Foundation in New Delhi, founded with the purpose of assessing and improving CRM practices. Although many Indian call centers have comeINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 82up that cater to international market, there are only a few Indian companies that have actively taken up CRM. The CRM enabled companies include Tata Telecom, TVS Electronics, HP India, Tata InfoTech, Carrier Refrigeration, Tata Teleservices, Satyam Info way, Planet M, and Epicenter Technologies among many others. Recently some of the mobile phone companies in India have started to integrate CRM services to increase the consumer satisfaction. For the big mobile operators, customer care is becoming the differentiator. Other sectors like Banking and Insurance services are also deploying CRM solutions. ICICI bank and ICICI prudential (insurance) along with several other large banking and insurance companies are adopting CRM solutions. Vendors and analysts agree that the need to acquire, retain and support customers will stimulate greater investment in CRM. Like all other IT enabled services, CRM is likely to grow at a rapid pace in India during the next few years. Need of CRM in the Banking Industry: A Relationship-based Marketing approach has the following benefits Over time, retail bank customers tend to increase their holding of the other products from across the range of financial products / services available. Long-term customers are more likely to become a referral source. The longer a relationship continues; the better a bank can understand the customer and his/her needs & preferences, and so greater the opportunity to tailor products and services and cross- sell the product / service range. Customers in long-term relationships are more comfortable with the service, the organization, methods and procedures. This helps reduce operating cost and costs arising out of customer error.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 83With increased number of banks, products and services and practically nil switching costs, customers are easily switching banks whenever they find better services and products. Banks are finding it tough to get new customers, and more importantly, retain existing customers. According to a research by Reich held and Sasser in the Harvard Business Review, 5% increase in customer retention can increase profitability by 35% in banking business, 50% in insurance and brokerage, and 125% in the consumer credit card market. Therefore, banks are now stressing on retaining customers and increasing market share. Private Banking and CRM: Private Banks have traditionally viewed themselves as exceedingly 'Customer Centric' offering what they believe to be highly personalized services to the High Net Worth Customers. However, changes in the customer behavior and accumulation of wealth are resulting in the needs of HNW customers becoming more diverse and complex in terms of the sorts of products they want, the channels through which they want to access them and the associated range of advice. The wealthier the customers, the more demanding they are - and the clients expect more and more from their banks. Competition for \"Supremely elite\" is increasing. Customer Experiences: The first step towards successfully winning, retaining and growing the profitability of private banking customers is to understand what their wants and needs are, so that the organization can be built around serving those needs. Only when an organization has done this and incorporatedINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 84this into its strategy can it start to design its value proposition and a customer experience that will enable it to achieve a differentiated competitive position in the private banking market, and more importantly, do so in an economically viable way. 1. Basic Customer Experience: There is a basic 'generic' customer experience that many private banking customers are seeking. To be a credible player in the market, a private bank must be able to deliver this 'base' experience. This represents a common set of needs that are shared by most HNW customers. Therefore, the private bank must have the capabilities required to meet these needs for the majority of its customer base. Customers, regardless of wealth levels, have similar emotional needs, which drive their need for advice and their purchase of products. Different wealth levels impose different priorities on meeting these needs and open up new avenues for doing so. Take a simple example, HNW customers can afford on it to fund their retirement, so their priorities may be associated with growing wealth, rather than preserving it, allowing them to choose a product option with aINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 85higher risk/reward ratio. If this is true, it means all HNW customers start with a basic, common set of what they want and need from a bank, which might include: Personal, long-term relationship Advice combining industry expertise and knowledge of personal circumstances High quality, consistent quality Security, privacy, confidentiality At this basic level, grouping together these core wants and needs produces a set of generic characteristics that an HNW individual seeks from an organization before he or she will even consider placing any of his or her wealth with it. Underlying these generic characteristics is a set of capabilities covering organization, process and technology, which the private bank must process to operate in the high net worth market. 2. The Segment-Specific Experience: To build this 'base' experience, private banks also need to consider the segment-specific needs of their target customers. This in itself requires a capability to identify and justify target customers and understand their needs beyond banking, to ensure that their emotional needs are met. It is here that the customer is made to feel like an individual, but it is also at this point that costs and infrastructure spiral, as customers' needs start to diverge. The segmentation process identifies groups of customers with similar wants and needs, who are seeking a similar experience from the provider. Importantly, from the organizations' viewpoint, this means that they can also be served by similar sets of capabilities. The experience at this level is made up of:INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 86 The new components are added to the experience and the 'base' experiences elements become defined in more depth, according to the specific needs of the customer segment. Once the segment experiences have been defined, the associated capabilities must again be identified. The hierarchical approach to defining customer experiences helps filter these capabilities as: - The channel preferences of each segment and associated channel experience - for example, a self-directed group of customers will use internet for transacting, information gathering and even some advice, whereas advice seekers and less financially sophisticated segments require more access to an adviser / relationship manager and a more basic experience over the Internet. The product and service preferences of that segment - for example, the more sophisticated customers are more likely toINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 87demand more complex products such as alternative investments, whilst others may prefer discretionary portfolio management. It is possible to identify experience elements that are common to more than one segment - this will carry a higher priority for development as they will benefit more customers; The segmentation exercise will provide comparative sizing's for the target segments. Capabilities required for the larger, more profitable segments take precedence over those 3. The Organization-Specific Experience: Having identified the base and segment specific elements of HNW customer experience, the final step is to identify how the experience that each organization offers its customers is distinct from other banks. Now this would mean that one has to distinctly identify the components of the experience that are not only associated with a particular bank but also be the key differentiator. This process will define: - ?Elements of the organization style and culture. ?Products and Services to be provided. In the same way, every brand is different, so is the experience. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 88Conclusion: Banking can be mysterious for consumers and how they interact with their finances can be a complex matter. The challenges faced by banks and their customers are many but the trick lies in de-mystifying complex financial relationships. Technical solutions deployed by banks today are flexible, user- friendly and meant to facilitate specific workflow and requirements in implementation processes. In order to simplify lives, banks have begun to implement end-to-end technologies through all departments with the intention of removing human error from processes. Previously existing manual environments could not have been adequate for future visions, growth plans and strategies. In this day and age, customers enjoy complete luxury in terms of customized technical solutions and banks use the same to cement long-term, mutually-beneficial relationships.

Choudhary Research Scholar Centre for International Politics Organization and Disarmament School of International Studies Jawaharlal Nehru University , New Delhi Introduction India's unique nuclear behavior has been analyzed by various models (Sagan 1996-97). The existing literature has explained it through strategic, security, domestic, symbolic and structural, perspectives. Many of the perspectives and aspects are taken in historical account of India's behavior (Perkovich 2000). But the lacunae in existing literature are that it does not explain flexibility in India's disarmament diplomacy. In this paper I would like to explain variations in India's disarmament diplomacy. The proposition I would propose is that India's stands and variation in its disarmament diplomacy has shaped according to constituted nuclear norms. Secondly, India's technological enhancement had enhanced its nuclear identities and that has helped India to converge its disarmament diplomacy with constituted norms to serve its national interest. In the sense that in conventional understanding India's disarmament policy is seen as uniform, moralistic and idealistic approach in foreign policy (Mohan 2003). Rajagopalan (2009) argued that 'India's stand against nuclear weapons emanates from a moral judgement, which is that nuclear weapons are inherently evil in character, the western approach on disarmament, on the other hand, is historically predicated upon the stability of the nuclear equation.' It is stated in various official documents that India's policies toward nuclear disarmament have notINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 91changed over the years. Addressing to the Indian Parliament on 11 September 1996, India's Foreign Minister emphasized that \"...our position for the last 40 years has been to abolish and destroy both nuclear tests and nuclear weapons...we shall sustain the glorious path laid by Gandhi and Nehru.\" If India should ever stop insisting on the total elimination of nuclear weapons, that would be a change.1 But contrary to that this paper would analyze that India has changed its language of disarmament policy at various points of time and it has changed with the change in India's nuclear identity.2 This change and transformation has taken place subtly and gradually but it is very significant to understand India's nuclear behavior in general and disarmament diplomacy as pragmatic approach. Disarmament was very pragmatic policy in the sense that it is not necessary that how well it has served India's national interest and how much leadership was serious about this policy but the matter of the fact is that 'others' have believed in the idea of disarmament (Santana 2011). India has adopted disarmament policy as its preference3 in foreign policy. Nehru has stated that India would not go for nuclear weapons irrespective of other nation's policies and choices (Varughese 2002) and India's Ministry of External Affairs advocated that highest priority in disarmament must be accorded to their elimination.4 This policy has shrunk into a strategy5 and later as tactic during CTBT negotiations and before 1998 nuclear test. After the 1998 nuclear weapon test, India did show its will to sign CTBT during Jaswant-Talbott talk (Talbott 2006). This paper attempts to explain variation in India's disarmament policy with change in India's identity of modern nation- state in various perspectives. So the variation in disarmament policy could be explained by the role of identity of Indian state. By identity of Indian state I mean thatINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 92its specific features has changed with the various stages of achievement of nuclear technology. So it is identity, which shaped the interest of India as policy of disarmament. India moved closer and closer to have possibilities of nuclear weapons, it has diverted course of its disarmament diplomacy. I will use constructivist methodology to analyze this change in shift. I have divided the period into three groups for analytical convenience on the basis of India's technological progress and fundamental nuclear decisions. The first period I would characterize is, India as newly independent postcolonial nation- state (1947-1964). The second phase I would characterize as establishment of nuclear reactors from and amendment in Atomic Energy Act 1948 to PNE of 1974. The third phase of Indian nuclear programme, which is, consider as 'half - pregnant period' (1974-1998). The forth phase in India's nuclear history and change in its disarmament policy is post 1998, but I will not discuss this in my paper. In first part of the paper, I will explain identity as unit of analysis and what it contains as an independent variable. In the second section I will explain periodically India's disarmament policy and specific characteristics of each period. My focus will be on India's disarmament diplomacy and variation. Theoretical Framework Differential dynamics in identities of nuclear \"haves\" and \"haves not\" created in-group and out-group mechanism, especially at the on setting of NPT . International nuclear negotiations are best representations of this differential dynamics in international politics. 'Identity as Variable' does not have constant value but it have some basic constitutive units. These components are constituted norms, Social Purpose, Relational Positions and Cognitive Mapping (Abdelal and Others 2006). These are the content of identity and formulates base for collective identity but identities do have contestation and it refers to the degree of agreement within a group overINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 93the content of the shared category. So identities have agreement and disagreement about their meanings and in case of India's varying nuclear identities it contains all four components and there are disagreements on the content within the group. In terms of constitutive norms India has habitualised and internalized norms even being outsider of the nuclear regimes. It has not exploited the provisions of these nuclear regimes. This socialization, at some extent makes India as \"responsible nuclear power\" as only 'state with nuclear weapon' has tag of 'responsibility'. India has been active participant of setting of all major nuclear regimes since independence. The process's, by which constitutive practices are internalized or habituated, may be manifested in three ways. First, norms may bias choice and follows \"logic of appropriateness\". Second, norms may reduce the level of consciousness in choice and called as \"Common sensible\", choice might capture this form of internalization. Third, norms may be so deeply internalized that they are acted upon completely unconsciously, out of habit (Richard and Tannenwald 1996). The purposive content of nuclear identity (emphasis added) helps to define group interests, goal and preferences. It is based on the logic and notion that 'what groups want depends on who they think they are'. The construction that pervades identity scholarship - 'who we are influences what we want - specifies a shared purpose' (Tajfel and Turner1979). The third, important component of nuclear identity (emphasis added) is relational comparisons; this defines \"the understanding of oneself in relationship to others\". So it is interpreted as what it is not, i.e., by some other identities. So relational dimension is the discursive formulations of the relations between groups of people that compose social reality; and in this case between states . The relative status of an identity compared to others;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 94and the existence or level of hostility presented by other identities. India has advocated idea of \"Others\" in its disarmament diplomacy and echoed for accommodation by restructuring existing discriminatory regimes. The idea and perception of 'others' have given advantage to India in following ways: It helped India to unite internally and to legitimate it's own actions by social reorganization forms other state. Secondly, it helped in getting 'desired purposes' and to legitimate ends of policy; it structured the debate about their national interests and enhancement of identity as well. These purposes have always relational dimension between nuclear 'haves' and 'haves not' and it was determined the context of identity. In other words, 'identity may be defined by other identities' (Hymans 2002), so Identities are not only personal and psychological but it is very much social and relational, defined by actor's interaction with relationship to others (Barnett 1999). Cognitive model is the base for all above-mentioned components of identity. So identities can strongly affect interpretation and understanding not just of the present but of the past and future as well. Abdelal (2006) argued that 'cognitive models affect not only broad worldview and temporalities but also understandings of self, group, and other'. The view of cognitive formulations, identities are worldview and a framework that allows members (states) of group to make sense of social, political, and economic conditions (Denzau and North 1994).6 For example, being Indian; Being Pakistani; And Being France. According to Brubaket, Loveman, and Stamatov: \"What cognitive perspective suggest, in short, is that race, ethnicity, and nation are not things in the world but ways of seeing the world. They are ways of understanding and identifying oneself, making sense of one's problems and predicaments, identifying one's interests, and orienting one'sINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 95action. They are ways of recognizing, identifying, and classifying other people, of construing sameness and difference, and of \"coding\" and making sense of their actions\". In the essence that nuclear identity would contain these four fundamental characteristics. So in this paper I attempt to explain that India has seen world through different way in the language of disarmament. This language has changed and reformulated through complex learning, therefore it changes the structure of identities and interests (Wendt 1992). This explains how identities affect the behavior of actors. Therefore, this framework also clarifies action of actors and casual consequences of identities. In case of nuclear negotiations it implies to inter-subjective interaction with various groups and process of negotiation. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 96Nehru Era (1947- 1964) Prime Minister Nehru has guided India's foreign policy since independence till his death in 1964. He was very much inspired by Gandhi on the issue of nuclear weapons, even through he had different position on the issue of technology as whole. Gandhi held a strong position regarding nuclear weapons that \"the moral to be legitimately drawn from the supreme tragedy of the (nuclear) bomb is that it will not be destroyed by counter- bombs, as violence can not be destroyed by counter- violence. Mankind has to get out of violence only through non- violence (Daniel 1983).\"7 Nehru held strong ground for the cause of nuclear disarmament, on many instances during international negotiations. Nehru has argued for unconditional nuclear disarmament for well- being of humanity as a whole. In his own words, he appealed to US and USSR to \"save humanity from the ultimate disaster\" by nuclear disarmament. Nehru's reaction to a U.S. nuclear test in the Bikini Atoll, he made speech to the Indian Parliament what was to become India's declared approach to nuclear weapons: \"We have maintained that nuclear (including thermonuclear) chemical and biological (bacterial) knowledge and power should not be used to forge these weapons of mass destruction. We have advocated the prohibition of such weapons, by common consent, and immediately by agreement amongst those concerned. Pending progress towards some solution, full or partial, in respect of the prohibition and elimination of these weapons of mass destruction, the Government would consider, some sort of what may be called \"standstill agreement\" in respect, at least, of these actual explosions, even if agreements aboutINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 97the discontinuance of production and stock-piling must await more substantial agreements amongst those principally concerned\" (Cited in Ghose 1997).8 Nehru's perception and worldview had affected India's nuclear diplomacy in particular and Indian foreign policy in general. Nehru till his death had direct command and control on nuclear issue. He has provided foundation to India's disarmament diplomacy in which stated that India will not develop nuclear weapons irrespective of other nations. In the essence that Nehru has adopted disarmament policy as preference rather than a strategy, but over the years it has changed to strategy as India has achieved technological base for development of nuclear weapon. Shift in 'Option' Strategy (1964-1974) In this section I will explain that how India has made a shift from Nehruvian view of disarmament and how India utilized the identity of postcolonial state with foundational technology to make favorable bargaining position and political gain in leading NPT negotiations. India was one of co-sponsor of NPT with USSR and US.9 But during the course of negotiation India has betrayal form its position.10 And that changed stand of India on NPT is guiding its nuclear policy till date with many additions in its disarmament diplomacy. The conventional explanations of India's prolonged self-restrain are based on security concern and domestic consideration (Kennedy 2011). Kennedy (2011) pointed out that India did not test the nuclear weapon in early 1960s and 1970s, when it could have done so, because India was under the implicit nuclear umbrella. First, under the US and later under the USSR. But the counter argument would be that India's purpose was very much difference for acquiring nuclear weapons and to attain that purpose India has adopted policy of self restraintINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 98and at the same time India has diluted its disarmament policy by passing 1962 act. In which a shift has made on earlier 'Option' strategy and it has played with the words in new Atomic Energy Act, which paved way to exercise the 'option' strategy for peaceful nuclear explosion. The dilution in moral high ground of India in UN Conference on Disarmament on its stand for disarmament can be seen in its new formulations. Firstly, India echoed the language of national sovereignty and identity of being postcolonial states, and vowed that each sovereign country have right to use nuclear technology for peaceful explosive purpose (Abraham 1998; 138- 39). This new formulation of sovereignty and technology, in relational terms with respect to India's disarmament policy have made first time. Secondly, India has rejected all conditions that might close off, legally or technically, Indian options with respect to 'peaceful' uses of atomic technology (Abraham 1998; 140). It has done this at this particular junction because India has got foundational nuclear technology by this time, which 'other' postcolonial still lacks and far behind India. So India was in advance condition with respect to other third world countries. This enhancement in technology, legal changes at home in new atomic energy act and insurance by Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri for Peaceful explosion (SNEP) have made new perception of India among third world countries, it has buttress India's claim of leadership, for those countries who were not yet able to speak for themselves. Secondly this shift in disarmament policy has created environment and image that the nuclear 'haves', were guilty of international neo-colonialism. So it has provide cohesiveness against NPT and India got strong support from non nuclear weapons state on the cause of disarmament, even though India had moved a step of away from it'sINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 99foundational approach of disarmament. But it was very subtle change in India's position on disarmament policy that has created a favorable bargaining position in subsequent nuclear negotiations. This position of India in NPT on the issue of nuclear disarmament with scope of peaceful nuclear explosion have served its interest which is associated to its nuclear identity in this context of negotiations, 'Half Pregnant' (1974- 1998) India could have nuclear weapons, even in 1970s or even before, but its restraint could be explained by the social purposive content of identity among the other nations. It was the motivation by the notion that \"We are not like \"Others\".\" The question which is more puzzling is that why had India conducted 1974, nuclear device test (PNE)? When the superpowers were reshaping the arms race of cold war and India has co- existed with nuclear China. The divided Pakistan was not in position to pose nuclear threat or conventional threat. The security model do attempt to explain 1974 test in terms of challenging the US presence in South Asia and recent declassified documents shows that it was very much motivated by the logic of anarchical international structure, due to emerging ties between US and China.11 But realism could not explain why after having tested in 1974 India opted not to go overtly nuclear for another 24 years (Sidhu 2004). So Sidhu has proposed organizational theory and strategic cultural theory with realism to explain India nuclear behavior. The matter of the fact is that we have to understand that how 1974 test-enhanced India's bargaining position in international negotiations and its image among pro- disarmament countries. India has motivated and echoed the enhancement of identity of postcolonial nation- state by advocating for peaceful nuclear technology. India's 1974 test practically proofs this advocacy. It has challenged nuclearINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 100'have' that India have potential even being postcolonial country to go against existing discriminatory regime. Secondly, 1974 test and prolong restraint of 24 years, demonstrates especially to Third World countries that India do not have hegemonic tendencies and serious about enhancing the identity of postcolonial countries through nuclear technology. Thirdly, India has observed long restrained after 1974 test, because it has helped India's claim of nuclear disarmament policy. This long restrained has made India's image among the member countries that India is very much concerned about nuclear disarmament. Santana (2011) stated that even though disarmament can be seen as irrational goal but as a strategy it is very much rational policy and pragmatic in the sense that it legitimizes the strategy of non- proliferation. In that matter to India's strategy of self- restrained and provided scope for technological advancement and support from other countries. So self- restrained and disarmament policy were parallel that India has followed to achieve the goal. But both policies has expended in reciprocal manner. Means nuclear 'restrained' moved toward weaponization and disarmament policy (especially Rajiv Gandhi Action Plan) has covered this weapinzation. But India's purpose was to escape from existing identity and to ensure the entry into the club of 'nuclear haves'. India has achieved it after Indo- US nuclear deal in 2008. The international politics has changed a lot as of the end of the cold war and India also went through tremendous change and many transformations has occurred, economic, political and nuclear. The prevailing explanations are embedded in structural logic (Mohan 20023). But relational content of social identity theory (SIT) can explained Pokharan II in the sense that the creation of in- group identity will tend to produce competitive behavior with out-groups, because the process of in- group identity creation by necessity requires, or leads to, the devaluationINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 101of out- groups (Abdelal, and others 2006). It means that India has tested its nuclear weapon to make its identity strong and to devalue the role of nuclear haves. Nuclear Weapons State has shown coherence during the CTBT negotiations. Whereas India has made shift in its disarmament policy in terms that India have used first time the language of Self Interest and National Security for not to sign the treaty (Ghose 1997). The out-group cohesiveness has increased that during the CTBT negotiation China has conducted nuclear test for further development and enhancement of nuclear technology and US guaranteed to Britain and France for providing the technology for subcritical technology. India has made significant shift in its disarmament policy by putting the conditionalties in various proposal to UN. Like complete disarmament, and time- bound framework, paradoxical to these proposals there is evidences of authorization of weaponization program (Sidhu 2004). The point to note from this paradoxical policy is that covert weaponization made India's position weak within the group of Third World countries on her long held ground for nuclear disarmament. So as the indefinite extension of NPT has passed in 1995, in mid of the CTBT negotiation, India felt isolated and US was at the apogee of its power (Perkovich 2000). Hence India accelerated its nuclear weapons programme from covert to overt to attain new identity. In other words, in this period India was under identity crisis, because it has lost ground and support of its disarmament diplomacy and at the same time indefinite extension of the NPT had legitimized, permanently, dichotomy of 'haves' and 'haves not'. Kenndey (2011) has called it India's 'Diplomatic Disappointments'. I would characterize it in terms of identity that in-group enhancement was weak in Indian side and US's group was more cohesive, because use of nuclear has seen by non-nuclear state and nuclear weapon state as tabooINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 102(Tannenwald 2008). But India was seems to go against the taboo by showing its will to test nuclear weapon. In short, personalization of identity has prevailed over in- group identity.12 In this situation, India have taken decision to went nuclear, first in 1995 by Prime Minister Rao, and later in 1996 by PM Vajpayee in his 13 days government it has discussed (Former President APJ Kalam, confirmed this discussion in recent interview). In the sense that it was fear which motivated for this frequency in nuclear decisions. India could not conducted nuclear test due to instability in domestic politics. It has conducted test in 1998 to mitigate existing situation of identity crisis. Hymans (2006) argued in his socio- psychological analysis that it was fear and pride ('oppositional nationalism')7, which led India to conducted its long restrained nuclear test. My argument related to psychological pressure is that it transmitted through group interactive dynamics. Therefore, identity theory and its variant do not undermine international environment, but it emphasis on variation in nature of state due to interaction under existing structure. Conclusion India has habitualised and internalized norms even being outside the nuclear regimes. It has not exploited the provisions of these nuclear regimes. This socialization made India as \"responsible nuclear power\". It was India's quest to get nuclear recognition from international community. India got it because it has respected constitutive nuclear norms, such as it did not export nuclear technology illegally, adherence to the rule of the game and India's normative stand in terms of non - aggressiveness in its nuclear policy. Vajpayee said, after Pokharan II, \"We do not want to cover our action with a veil of needless ambiguity. India is now a nuclear weapons state. WeINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 103have the capacity for a big bomb now, for which a necessary command- and-control system is also in place. Ours will never be weapons of aggression\". So India's Disarmament policy has legitimized the nuclear trajectory and paved a way to bomb. But Identity of Indian state over period of time has shrunk the disarmament approach. Proposition that I have formulated is that identity of India in terms of nuclear technology and national nuclear acts and its convergence with international constituted shaped its interest in international forums. To serve these interests India has played with semantics on the name of disarmament. Enhancement of nuclear identity lead to reversion from disarmament. The project of modernity that Indian elites has taken in hand soon after independence has completed with the birth of bomb. Disarmament policy has served very much strategic interests of India.

Actually, nobody denies that nutrition is an important factor in the life of the individual from the time of conception to the time of death. Intake of a diet adequate in quantity and quality has been recognized, since the early days of paediatrics, as a prerequisite for the optimal growth and development of the child. Nonetheless, when one moves from the individual to the community as a whole, the need for maximizing insufficient resources forces those responsible for planning andoperating development programs to question the priority of malnutrition visa -vis other problems. Berg has indicated that the central point for the planner in developing countries is to decide if malnutrition is such an important obstacle to national development as to justify rerouting resources now earmarked for other needs. In the presence of limited resources good planningdemands that each disease, each damage, must be ranked against every other need. Some specific aspects of this comparison are (1) the magnitude of the problem; (2) how vulnerable are its proximal and distal causes to the means available for its prevention and treatment; and (3) what are the implicationsof its presence and its sequel for the continuous development of the communityMrs AshaLata Vijay Dawri Principal Professor Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Nursing Navi-MumbaiIDENTIFY THE MORBIDITY STATUS IN THE RURAL COMMUNITY: A CASE STUDY OF WAVENJA VILLAGE OF NAVI MUMBAIINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 107(historical transcendence) . The intent here is to summarize our knowledge on the physical and mentalsequel of malnutrition with emphasis on how malnutrition affects the capacity of an individual to make a meaningful contribution to society. Because, either alone or more often in combination with infectious disorders, protein -calorie malnutrition constitutes one of the main causes of death anddisease in the world population , our review is restricted to this particular form of nutritional inadequacy. At the community level, protein -calorie malnutrition is a man-made disorder characteristic of the lower segments of society, particularly of the preindustrial societies, where the social system (consciously or unconsciously) creates malnourished individuals generation after generation through a series of social mechanisms among which limited access to goods and services, limited social mobility, and restricted experiential opportunities at crucial points in lifeplay major role. At the individual level, the term protein -calorie malnutrition is a generic name used in the medical literature to group the whole range of mild to severe clinical and biochemical signs present in children as a consequence of a deficient intake and/or utilization of foods of animal origin, accompanied byvariable intakes of rich carbohydrate foods. Kwashiorkor and marasmus are the names given to the two extreme clinical varieties of the syndrome. The appearance of one or another of these nutritional disorders is related to the age of the child, time of full weaning, time of introduction of food supplements to breast milk, caloric density and protein concentration of the supplementsactually given, and frequency and severity of infectious disorders during weaning. Although its incidence varies from place to place, the syndrome presents the same basic characteristics of clinical and biochemical pathology .INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 108The regional variations observed are generally associated with other concomitant nutritional deficiencies, the pattern of weaning, and the infectious pathology prevalent in the area. The interaction of the effects produced by the societal factor and the individual factor is what ultimately results in malnutrition. Taking low weight gain in early infancy as the single most characteristic sign of protein -calorie malnutrition. Scope: Malnutrition refers to the situation where there is an unbalanced diet in which some nutrients are in excess, lacking or in wrong proportion. Now, the problem is that not only infants but the adults are also suffering from malnutrition. Adult undernutrition very simply happens, \"when you are hungry, and you consistently don't get anything to eat,\" (Dr. Sen). Adult malnutrition can be measured by Body Mass Index (BMI) and a BMI below 18.5 indicates chronic under nutrition. Quoting statistics Dr. Sen showed how 37% of adult Indians, 50% of adults belonging to the Scheduled Tribes and 60% of adult Indians belonging to the Scheduled castes have a BMI below 18.5, which makes them chronically undernourished.It was a social obligation to ensure that nobody is denied of healthcare because of their inability to pay the bills. The current proposal to increase GDP spending in India for healthcare to 2.5% is a major , positive level of development for healthcare in India. Dr. Sen said India should move towards making available 'cashless' healthcare with the money coming from tax structures. Health services offered in countries like Brazil, Canada and Thailand are worth emulating he said, but ultimately the health programs we devise should be our very own suited to the Indian setting.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 109The country's financial capital (Mumbai) and the state's most industrialized city continue to hold the dubious distinction of being the city with the highest incidence of acute malnourishment cases in the state. During a recent survey in the city, 12,343 children in the 0-6 age group were found to be severely undernourished. Over 2.74 lakh children in the same age group were surveyed across the city. The incidence rate of 4.49% in Mumbai was found to be higher than anywhere else in the state. The present study confined to only adult people (above 20), because number of studies have been done and talk about malnutrition among infants/children. But none of the study talks about clinical sign of malnutrition, Morbidity, Co-morbidity status and its impact on human body. Aims of the study: The aim of the study is to gain a better understanding of morbidity and co-morbidity status and its impact on human performance. Methodology: A present study descriptive in nature. A simple random sampling was used to cover 100 families of Wavenje village of Raigarh District ( Navi- Mumbai). The study was carried out during Sept 2011 to February 2012. The area has predominantly tribal in population from the lower socio- economic status. A questionnaire was prepared in order to collect data on various aspects like demographical feature, clinical sign of malnutrition, Morbidity,co-morbidity status and frequency of use of various sources of micro nutrients. Results: The data was collected using demographic Performa and percentage was computed for describing the sample characteristics. Table 1shows that majority of the family members are adults (79%) above the age of 20 years.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 110Out of total population sample 47 per cent are educated up to primary level, 7 per cent PUC, 4 graduate and 42 per cent people are illiterate.

Majority of the families (92%) in the study group belonged to 'Hindu' by religion. 47% had education up to primary level. The source of income was salary for majority (55%) of the families followed by lands (19%) and business (17%). The family income ranged from Rs.1000 to 20,000 and majority (56%) had an income range of 1000 to 2000 per month. 52 per cent of the study group lived on daily wages. Due to high index of food inflation there present level of income is also not able to support their nutritional requirement. For the authenticity of the study or support of the study some guidelines have been used. These guideline is to present evidence and guidance related to nutrition support. In view of the problems related to studies of nutritional intervention the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) agreed to base some of the recommendations on principles derived from understanding effects of malnutrition in people. Now the problem of higher food prices may make it more difficult to achieve most Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Food price increases affect food consumption, quality of one'sdiet, access to social services, and sometimes the quality of care for infants and young children. All these factors may increase under nutrition among children (and decrease their learning capacity and survival rates), adult women (and if they are pregnant, increase their chances of maternal mortality and affect fetal growth and future outcomes), and adult men (and affect their productive capacity). In addition, under nutrition decreases the efficacy of treatments for HIV/AIDS and other major diseases. Box 1.1summarizesthe combined impact of the food price crisis and malnutrition on the MDGs.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 112Box 1.1 Impact of higher food prices and undernutrition on the MDGs As food prices increase, the purchasing power of the poor decreases, the composition of their diet worsens, and their food consumption may decrease. These changes directly affect all targets of MDG 1 on poverty, full and productive employment, and hunger. Malnutrition affects early childhood development and makes children more likely to drop out of school (MDG 2). An increase in food prices affects women and girls' consumption disproportionately (MDG 3). Undernutrition is linked directly to more than onethird of children's deaths each year (MDG 4). Pregnant women face heightened maternal mortality,through increased anemia, during a food pricecrisis (MDG 5). The adverse effects of a food crisis on the availabilityof health services and on health status bear oncountries' and individuals' abilities to combat theHIV/AIDS epidemic (MDG 6). Undernutrition weakens the immune system andcompounds the effect of diarrhea and waterbornediseases (MDG 7). Higher food prices have weakened intergovernmentalcoordination in food markets (MDG 8).

Further, co-morbidity status of wavenja villagers reveals that 4 per cent suffered from hypertension and diabetes followed by 3 per cent women complaining of menstrual problems. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 114 Clinical examination, an important practical method for assessing the nutritional status of a community was carried out and the results are shown in Table 5. The data indicated that 17% had hair changes, 15% had changes in eyes and had chapped lips, and 17% had dry scaly skin. All these signs were indicative of the fact that the people had nutritional deficiencies. Deficiencies in nutrition inflict long-term damage to both individuals and society. Compared with their better-fed peers, nutrition-deficient individuals are more likely to have infectious diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, which lead to a higher mortality rate. In addition, nutrition-deficient individuals are less productive at work. Low productivity not only gives them low pay that traps them in a vicious circle of under- nutrition, but also brings inefficiency to the society, especially in India where labor is a major input factor for economic production.These research findings also authenticate the completion of Nurkse Vicious Circle of Poverty in India. The circlestart from low productivity which is due to ill health of labour force.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 115Relation between Nutrition and Poverty Relation between Nutrition and Poverty For find out the nutritional status among wavenja people, we gathered the information related to frequent use of various sources of micro nutrients. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 116Table 6shows that 66 per cent families used milk at daily basis, which is the main source of retinal and calcium. Coriander leaves, curry leaves and tomato are rich in carotene for 62 per cent, 60 per cent and 44 per cent families respectively. The food rich in iron like shepu, mint, and fish are not included in daily diet and hence the deficiency of iron cannot be ruled out in the selected population. The data indicate that some of the best source of various micronutrients is not included frequently in the diet and some families never included it in their routine meal. One important finding is that majority of the families under study belong to Hindu community and they do not want to add fleshy products in their diet because of religious values. Conclusion and Suggestions The data is indicative of the fact that the selected community have low amounts of protective foods rich in minerals, vitamins and insufficient daily protein intake. And this was evident by the fact that many showed clinical signs of nutritional deficiencies and irregular menstrual problems. Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity followed by GIT infections, diarrhoea and fever etc. The results of the study highlight the fact that the socio economic conditions of the selected community was low with respect to the income earned by the families as majority earned Rs.1000-2000 per month. The study finding stresses the need for behavioural change to modify cooking practices and food consumption practices by providing nutrition education. The clinical signs of nutritional deficiencies and poor health status contribute to non- communicable diseases. The incidence and prevalence of morbidity prevailed not only in rural area but also in urban area. Right now this study is coincided only to rural area. Further, proposed study is planned to be conducted in urban area also.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J 2014 117References 1.Block, .

Decentralisation of power to the local units of government and management is one of the best ways of empowering people, promoting public participation and increasing efficiency (Gopinath Reddy. M, 2003: 559). When the authority and power in respect of certain activity is transferred from the state to the panchayats, the latter should have the prerogative of making 'decisions', in respect of planning and implementation of such activity. In the sphere of devolution of responsibilities to lower levels of governance, some important principles should be kept in view. In the first place, the principle of 'subsidiarity' needs to be given adequate attention. The principle of subsidiarity postulates that any function which can be performed by a lower tier, should be handled by that tier alone and not by any higher tier of PRI. Second, the state government should not unilaterally withdraw responsibilities and powers already granted to the panchayat without adequate justification and prior consultation with the latter. Third, responsibilities, authorities and powers granted to the panchayats should be extremely specific, clear and simple in order to be comprehended by the panchayats. Lastly, whenever , functions and responsibilities are transferred to the panchayats,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 119it should be ensured that the necessary funds, functionaries and freedom in decision-making also accompany such transf (Gopinath Reddy. M, 2003:1284-1285). Concept of Decentralization: The concept of decentralisation is not new to India. However, this has been a subject of intensive debate since 1970's, when the orientation and structure of development planning changed from growth to redistribution with growth. Decentralisation refers to a situation in which lower - ranking decision - units acquire all powers and responsibilities and have control over the determination of their goals and targets (Sundaram, K.V ., 1997:31). In view of this, it is now a well recognised doctrine since local resources are to be harnessed, local needs to be consulted, and local knowledge is needed. By and large, it is thought that decentralisation would improve government and administrative responsiveness to the public and increase the quality and quantity of the services it provides at the local level. Administrative responsiveness implies that, in government, the administrative machinery at a particular level has to be strong and responsive enough not only for delivering the goods to the citizens effectively but also to act to the satisfaction of all concerned (Pradeep Sahni and Vayunandan. E, 1992: 4). So wider implementation of decentralisation is essential for the success of developmental efforts. Genesis of Decentralisation: The word 'Decentralisation' has been borrowed from the Latin Word 'descendo' which means \"to march down from higher ground\" ( dspace.vidyanidhi.org.in:8080/dspace/bitstream/2009/737/5/JMI-2002-138 1.pdf on RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 120Decentralisation means transfer of planning, decision-making or administrative authority from the Central Government to its field organizations local administrative units, semi- autonomous organizations and local governments or non-governmental organizations (Joshi R.P and Narwani G.S., 2002: 132). The word 'decentralisation' is used in different constitutional systems and in different social environments. In fact, it is a word of innumerable applications. Though all of them connote a common idea, which is inherent in the word's Latin root \"away from Decentralisation is the \"Process of dividing and distributing authority and responsibility for programmes of administrative sub-units. Decentralisation typically involves re-assigning decision-making responsibilities on a geographical basis to field service operational units. It may also involve re-assignment of tasks based on subject matter specialization\" (Bandyopadhyay, 1998: 471). Historical Aspects of Decentralization: The origin of modern of modern local Self-Government in India dates back to Mayo and Rippon's resolutions in 1870 and 1882 respectively. The first draft of the Constitution of India did not recognize the importance of local-government institutions. The Indian constitution in its final form included the local self-government in the Article 40 (Para 4) in the form of the Directive Principles of State Policy which states that \"The state shall take steps to organize Gram Panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to make them function as units of self- government\". In essence, constitutional provision reflects only direction by the Union Government to the state governments (Bose B P C and Koteswara Rao M V S, 2004:136).INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 121Our country is a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic and it thus pledged to adopt a democratic way of life. Accordingly, popular governments have been formed at the Centre and in the states through directly elected representatives (Venkatarangaiya.M and Pattabhiram.M, 1969: 338-340).The democratic system of government in a country can be ensured only if there is people's participation in the governance. Therefore, the system of democratic decentralization, popularly known as Panchayati Raj, has been considered as an instrument to ensure democracy in India. Panchayati Raj system in India has evolved out of the Community Development Programme (CDP) introduced on October 2, 1952 intended to bring socio-economic development of rural masses in a democratic way. It was further supplemented by National Extension Service (1953). However, after a few years, it was realized that the programme had not delivered the desired results due to lack of people's participation in the development programmes. Keeping in view this fact, a committee on plan project was appointed under the leadership of Balwantrai Mehta in January 1957 to study community projects and suggest the appropriate organizational structure for eliciting people's participation. The committee observed that the reason for failure of CDP was lack of enthusiasm and non-participation of the people in its implementation at local level. The Committee stressed the need of democratic decentralization, popularly known as Panchayati Raj, at three levels viz. Gram Panchayat, Panchayati Samiti and Zila Parishad. The recommendations of the Committee were accepted and various states adopted the Mehta model as per local requirements. However, after mid-sixties, Panchayati Raj lost its glamour and the maladies such as inefficiency, corruption, favouritism, uncertainty, irregularity, indifferent attitude of state governments, lack of people's initiative, etc., crept in to Panchayati Raj. Besides, establishment of parallelINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 122administrative agencies, inadequacy of funds, dominance of bureaucracy, etc., have made these institutions subordinate units of government. All these weaknesses led to the appointment of Ashok Mehta Committee (1977), which recommended two-tier structure of PR, i.e., Zilla Parishad and Mandal Parishad along with other reformatory measures. However, Government of India did not accept these recommendations. The need to revamp Panchayati Raj remained alive and became an important issue of debate and discussion during the eighties. Working Group on District planning (1983), GVK Rao Committee (1985), L M Singhvi Committee (1986), Thungan Committee (1988) and Panchayati Raj Sammelans (1989) discussed and debated the problem in depth. Consequently, the Congress government introduced The Constitutional (Sixty -Fourth Amendment) Bill in 1989. However, it could not get the requisite political support in parliament. National Front government also made an attempt by introducing The Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Bill (1990), which lapsed due to dissolution of ninth Lok Sabha. It was Congress government again introduced a fresh bill in September 1991 with some modifications and got it passed in December 1992 as The Constitution (Seventy-Third Amendment) Act and later on it was ratified by the state legislatures (Shamser Singh Malik, 2002: 175- 176). The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act: The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act is an attempt to revamp PR for decentralization and rural development with a view to grant power to people at grassroot level. With the implementation of this Act, the state governments were asked to prepare new legislation or to amend their existing law absorbing the provisions of the Act within one year of itsINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 123enactment. PR being a State subject, the central government avoids interference in the jurisdiction of states. Panchayati Raj in Andhra Pradesh: As provided under the 73rd Amendment Act, most of the states have either modified their existing laws or framed new legislation & replacing old PR Acts and devolved the powers, authorities and responsibilities to function as the institutions of self-government. As a result, the Andhra Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 was enacted on 25-4-1994 as comprehensive single Act in accordance with the principles of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, replacing the earlier Acts. It witnessed the existing the three - tier structure, viz., Zilla Parishad, Mandal Parishad and Gram Panchayats. Under the new Act, PRIs are expected to perform all development functions as suggested in the 11th schedule. For doing so, proper devolution of functions and powers to local bodies is necessary. In particular, devolution of functions and powers from the regular line departments to the PRIs is a necessary prerequisite for healthy functioning of local bodies (Gopinath Reddy. M, 2003:1285). Functions of the Zilla Parishad: According to the provisions of the Act, 1994 (vide section 192 (1), the Zilla Parishad are enjoined upon to perform such functions out of the 29 items as may be entrusted to them by rules. Zilla Parishads are also responsible for securing co- ordination between all the rural local bodies in the district besides advising the government on rural government works in the district, and distribution of funds between the 3 - tires or PR (Bhargava B.S, 2002: 206,207). The important functions of the zilla parishad are examining and approving the budgets of the mandal parishads in theINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 124district, distributing the funds allotted by the governments to the mandals in the district, coordinating and consolidating the plans of mandals and preparing a district plan, execution of plans and schemes, supervising the activities of mandals and establishment and maintaining secondary vocational and industrial schools (Haragopal G, Sudarshanam G, 2000: 55). Functions of the Zilla Parishad: The functions of the Mandal Parishad include the functions listed in Schedule - II of the Act. This list includes community development , agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries, health and rural sanitation, education, social education, co-operation, cottage industries, women welfare, social welfare, emergency relief, collection of statistics, self - help programme and trusts. The other functions of the Mandal Parishads include the items listed in the Scheduled - I which specifies the functions mentioned in XIth Schedule of the Central Act, 1993. (Sarumathy.M, 2002: 246). Other areas of work include land development, irrigation, roads, electricity, education, anti - poverty programmes, women and child welfare (Haragopal G. Sudarshanam G, 2000: 55). Further, the mandals are also to supervise local statistics. Besides, the Government has power to entrust any functions as its direction. This shows that the Mandal Parishads have been entrusted with all other functions except judiciary and police (Sarumathy.M, 2002: 246, 247). The grants given by the state and central governments under various schemes, share in the land cess and other taxes, contributions given by Gram Panchayats, income from remunerative enterprises and per capita annual government grant are the important sources of a Mandal Parishad's revenue (Haragopal G, Sudarshanam G, ISSN 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 the Gram Panchayat: the Andhra Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 Gram Panchayats are entrusted with certain specific functions, which are mostly civic in nature. These functions are divided into obligatory and discretionary functions. They included 12 obligatory and 27 optional functions. Obligatory functions of Gram Panchayat: The gram panchayats have the following obligatory functions: Constructions, repairs and maintenance of buildings roads, bridges, culverts, lighting of roads and public places, construction of drains, disposal of drainage, cleaning of streets, removal of rubbish, improvement of sanitary conditions, providing public lavatories, maintaining cremation and burial grounds, prevention and remedy of epidemics, sinking and repairing of walls, preparation of compost and sale of manure, registration of births and deaths, establishment and maintenance of cattle ponds (Andhra Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, Section 45). Discretionary Functions of Gram Panchayat: The Gram panchayats have the following discretionary functions: Welfare as well development functions, such as construction and maintenance of rest houses for travelers, planting and prevention of groves and trees on the sides of the roads and public places, promotion and development of pre - primary education, elementary education, maintenance of dispensaries, laying and maintenance of parks, establishment and maintenance of libraries and reading rooms, organization of voluntary labour for community development, maintenance of maternity and child welfare centers, famine relief, maintenance of public markets, slaughter houses, implementationINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I 2014 126of land reforms (Andhra Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, Section 46). However, the number of functions that a Gram Panchayat can perform depend on its financial condition. In order to perform the numerous functions enlisted in the Act, the extent of devolution required should be adequate. Coming to the actual devolution that has taken place, it needs to the stated that the ground reality in A P is not satisfactory (Gopinath Reddy. M, 2003:1285). Devolution of Functions: Out of the 29 subjects, the Government of Andhra Pradesh transferred only 10 subjects (agriculture, fisheries, animal husbandry, education, medical & family welfare, rural water supply , rural development, back ward classes welfare, social welfare & women and child welfare) mentioned in the 11th Schedule of the Constitution to PRIs without giving substantial powers even on the transferred subjects (Eenadu, Main, Saturday, August 30, 2008: 5 and Eenadu, Main, Monday, April 12, 2010:9) Andhra In of Panchayati Raj System, only Gram Panchayats are empowered to levy taxes while the other two tiers are permitted to impose surcharge on the taxes levied by the Gram Panchayats. Mandals and Zilla Parishads have not utilized the said facility (Report of the Second SFC, 2002:110, Para 5.2.1). The compulsory taxes of Gram Panchayats are house taxes and surcharge on stamp duty. They can also collect advertisement tax, vehicle tax, entertainment tax and professional tax. In addition, they receive grants from the State Government, the zilla parishads and the mandal ISSN 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 127 By and large in Pradesh the income of Zilla Parishads and Mandal Parishads originate mainly from the grants. The contribution of non-tax revenue sources is either Zero or negligible. In AP these two tiers do get some resources from assigned tax revenues such as land cess, surcharge on stamp duty, mineral cess etc., Mandal Parishads depend predominantly on grants from the state government, which are mostly tied in nature. Another feature observed with mandal level finances is that MPs have to deposit 15 per cent of their grant exclusively for the purpose of housing programmes implemented by state housing corporations. In the case of ZPs there are four categories which constitute its revenue base: (a) revenue through non tax revenues (b) assigned duties such as land cess, mineral cess, stamp duty etc; (c) tied grants from the state and centre towards social sectors like education, drinking water supply and rural roads and (d) the grants (Gopinath Reddy. M Sreedevi. N, 2004:834). According to Rami Reddy the following is the financial position of Panchayat Samitis. On an average, a Panchayat Samiti in costal districts received about Rs. 50,000 under land cess, Rs. 20,000 under 25 paise grant, Rs. 60,000 towards its share of the surcharge on stamp-duty, while in the Rayalaseema and Telangana regions, the corresponding figures are Rs. 30,000, Rs.20,000 and Rs. 1,500. The Government met the full expenditure in respect of elementary schools, and salaries of teachers. An earlier estimate showed that the own resources of all the Panchayat Samitis, in a year, amounted to Rs. 2 crores; in addition to this, the departments provided funds to the extent of nearly Rs. 18 crores. The figures were exclusive of the grant of Rs. 160 lakhs under education cess, towards the expenditure under educational programmes. In case of Zilla Parishads, the annual income of the Zilla Parishad was between Rs. 75 lakhs to 1.5INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 128crores in the Andhra region while in the Telangana and Rayalaseema regions, it ranged from Rs. 25 lakhs to Rs. 60 lakhs. The financial position of the panchayats was so poor that during 1998-1999, the total income of nearly 20,000 panchayats was only 687.8 millions. This meagre income comprised of 200.8 millions of government grants, 71.5 millions of state taxes share, 269.3 millions of own income from taxes and fees and 25.0 millions of receipts from enterprises (Khanna, B.S, 1994:51). As Gopinath Reddy (2003:605) rightly said, \"the inadequate and unsound financial base has impaired the working of the local bodies. It is realised that any talk of the effectiveness of the local bodies in the absence of a strong financial base is no use\". The financial position of the Panchayati Raj bodies was so alarming that, income from their \"own source is only about 10 percent of their total receipts. For gram panchayats it is about 15 percent, for mandals it is about 0.5 percent and for zilla parishads it is about 5 percent\". The grants released by the state governments were not sufficient to meet the expenditure of Panchayati Raj bodies. As rightly commented by Gopinath Reddy \"the income of the State Government had gone up from Rupees 2199.02 crores to Rupees 8959.49crores while the grants released to the Panchayati Raj institutions have gone up from Rupees 663.98 crores to 2123.65 crores. However, as seen from the figures, the percentage of devolution of finances to PR institutions was 30.19 during 1987-88 but has gone down to 23.70 during 1997-98\" (Gopinath Reddy . M, 2003:606). The financial position of Gram Panchayats was so pathetic that of the 21,943 Gram Panchayats, the annual income of 390 small Gram Panchayats was only1000 or less. The annual income of 1350 GramINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 129Panchayats was from Rs. 2001 to 3000. 3,608 Gram Panchayats annual income was in the range of Rs. 3001 to 5000, and 5348 Gram Panchayats rupees earn an annual income of Rs. 5000 or less. There are fluctuations in the income of the gram panchayats years from 1996-97 to 2000-2001. The total income of the gram panchayats during 1996-97 is 39652.89 lakhs. It came down to Rs.32988.02 lakhs in the next year i.e., 1997-1998. There is however, a significant increase in their income i.e., from 32988.02 lakhs to Rs.45346.12 lakhs in 1998-1999. panchayats during 1999-2000 is Rs.50646.77 lakhs which came down to Rs.48017.51 in 2000-2001 (Report of the Second State Finance Commission, 2002:281, 282 and 112, Para, 5.7.1). The income of these Panchayats was so small that it would not be sufficient even to meet the honorarium to the Sarpanches. They were not in a position to provide even basic minimum facilities leave alone taking up developmental works (Report of the Second State Finance Commission, 2002: 142, Para 7.3.1). The total financial devolution to PRIs is low. A paltry sum of 126 crores was transferred to Gram Panchayats in 2002- 2003 out of a total fund of Rs. 284 crores for PRIs. The proportion of funds transferred to Gram Panchayats out of the total funds for PRIs has declined from nearly 60 per cent in 1999-2000 to less than 45 per cent in 2002-2003. In relative terms, grants to Gram Panchayats as proportion of total funds transferred to PRIs have declined from 37 per cent in 1999-2000 to 30 per cent in 2002-2003 (Centre for Good Governance, 2004: 9,10). Regarding the recommendations of the SFCs, A total amount of Rs.979.16 crores (i.e., 814.84 crores for panchayati raj and Rs.160.32 crores for urban bodies) per annum was recommended by the First State Finance Commission, as additional devolutions to the Rural and Urban Bodies. But the state government accepted the devolution to the extent of Rs.434.42INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 130crores only. Thus, the percentage of devolution accepted worked out to 44.37 per cent only. The amount of devolution accepted by the Government is.Rs.363.95 crores for Rural Bodies and Rs.70.47 crores per annum for Urban Bodies. This does not conform to the Seventy - Thirty ratio which the Cabinet Sub - Committee recommended (Report of the Second State Finance Commission, 2002:83, Para, 3.2.1 and 3.2.2). The First State Finance Commission recommended that 39.24 percentage of state's revenues both tax and non-tax be the entitlement to the local bodies and it may be given statutory effect by suitable enactment (Report of the First State Finance Commission, 1997 - 2000: 79 -80) . According to the action taken report of the SFC, the grant exclusively given by the state government to the local bodies is 11.09 per cent of the state revenue (Rs 1,087. 74 crore) in the year 1998-99. This amount is exclusive of salaries, pensions, establishment cost, allocations made as matching contribution to centrally sponsored schemes and central grants (Gopinath Reddy. M 2003: 1287). The Second State Finance Commission recommended that 40.92 percent of the tax and non-tax revenues of government including the share of Central taxes (Report of the Second SFC, 2002:198).The Second State Finance Commission a total additional Crores (Rs.1167.73 Crores for PRIs and Crores, (Rs.200 Crores for PRIs and to Municipalities and corporations accounting to an ignorable 17 per cent (Report of the Third State Finance Commission, 2008:25). In Andhra Pradesh during the post 73rd Constitutional Amendment Phase two SFCs were appointed and they recommended measures to devolve funds to the PRIs. But the state government has not paid anyINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 131attention to implement the recommendations of the commissions (Eenadu, Main, Friday, July 15, 2011, p. 15). In the Action Taken Report on the recommendations of the Second State Finance Commission, the Government has stated that, based on the review of the cabinet sub-committee the Government agree for devolutions to the extent of Rs.200 Crores to Panchayati Raj Institutions and Rs.100 Crores for Municipalities and Municipal Corporations towards Second State Finance Commission grants and that there is provision in the budget for 2003-2004 for the above purpose. Even the amounts accepted for devolution have not been released to the Panchayati Raj Institutions during the years 2003-04 and 2004-05 and an amount of Rs.100 Crores was short released. During the year 2005-06 also out of the amount of Rs.200 Crores released, Rs.100 Crores was diverted and paid to the A.P .Transco towards current consumption charges. In the year 2006-07, out of Rs.169.45 Crores released, an amount of Rs.91 Crores was diverted for individual sanitary latrines. Having accepted the devolution it does not appear proper to short release and divert the funds for other purposes. So, the Third State Finance Commission felt that \"the grants to the extent of short release may be released to the Panchayati Raj Institutions and not to divert the State Finance Commission grants for other purposes\" (Report of the Third State Finance Commission, Government of Pradesh, 2008: 30-31). Devolution of Functionaries: In Andhra Pradesh majority of the line departments have not been brought under the control of PR bodies. A separate 'Panchayati Raj Cadre' has not been created there is a skeletal staff and they are over burdened. (Gopinath Reddy. M, 2003: 603)INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 132For Panchayats to have the capacity to carry out their assigned functions, they would have to hire staff to be in charge of running programmes and activities. However, in Andhra Pradesh as in throughout India, Panchayats have limited powers to hire staff so they depend on state governments to depute functionaries from line departments. This practice renders PRIs weak in the sense that they have no powers to exercise control over these functionaries accountable to the panchayats. Deputed staff members are accountable only to the state government, which retains the power to hire, fire and remunerate them. This again means that PRIs have little or effective control over the people expected to carry out duties on their behalf (Gopinath Reddy M and Ram Chandra Reddy. S, 2010: The Present Position of Panchayats in Andhra Pradesh: The representatives cutting across party line who met in a convention were convinced that in the state of Andhra Pradesh, the 73rd Constitutional Amendment was not implemented in letter spirit. The newly elected members have no clue as to what to do or where to go. They felt that other states, Andhra Pradesh is nowhere in terms of making the panchayats 'institution of self government' while several southern states are way ahead and even too on the list. They demanded that all the 29 subjects along with funds and functionaries must be transferred to the panchayati raj institutions. For demarcating powers between different tires of PRIs in Andhra Pradesh, the State Government should take necessary administrative steps for making of \"activity mapping\" exercise into concrete reality based on the Principle of subsidiarity ( http://www..issin.org/ Hyderabad_Charter_of_Demand.asp retrieved on 13-04-2012). Powers and responsibilities go together. Powers with one and responsibilities with the other do not yield results. They are even conflicting.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V 2014 133In Andhra Pradesh, the nodal system is provided to be a retrograde measure. Funds are routed through the nodal officers neglecting the elected bodies. The several nominated bodies are serving parallel to the elected representatives and weakening the Panchayat System. The Sarpanches are so humiliated that they are demanding the abolition of nominated bodies. Nodal officials who are least acquainted with the villages, enjoy more powers compared to the Sarpanches who stay in their villages and fully acquainted with the problems in their area (Lakshmana Swamy. G, 2003:217-218). Many of the sarpanches said that they had lost their powers with the creation of various committees out side the panchayat system at the village level. Some of these are watershed committee, water user associations, vidya committee, anganwadi committee etc. All these committees function independently of the gram panchayats and their budgets are generally much larger than that of the gram panchayats. The critics argue that many of the committees are parallel power centres and thus, weaken the panchayats (Vinod K Jairath and Srinivasa Sajja, 2009:99). Two State Finance Commissions were appointed and they recommended measures to devolve funds to the Panchayati Raj Institutions. But the state government has not paid any attention to implement the recommendations of the commissions. The Third State Finance Commission submitted its report in 2008, but until now the State Government of Andhra Pradesh not taken any action. So, except the grants from Central Government; the PRIs did not receive any grant as prescribed by the Andhra Pradesh Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 since 2008. During the pre and post 73rd Amendment Act more or less there has been no marked difference in the status and working of PRIs in the Andhra Pradesh. Though the state government conducted elections regularly to these bodies till 2006,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 134on the pretext of non - finalization of voter roles, it did not conduct elections, which were due in July 2011. Conclusion: The enactments of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment and subsequent state-wise Panchayati Raj Acts in India have brought the significance of grass roots democratic process into limelight. While the amendment helped strengthening and systematizing PR institutions in terms of conducting regular elections, constituting state finance commissions, etc., weakened the spirit of the amendment by leaving the option of devolution of functions (29 total), functionaries and funds, as per the 11th Schedule to the states. In Andhra Pradesh it was a recognition of the fact that the PRIs had not been able to acquire the status of viable and responsive people's bodies. This was attributed to factors such as the absence of regular elections, arbitrary and prolonged supersessions, insufficient representation for weaker sections, inadequate devolution of powers and lack of financial resources.

INTRODUCTION Gupta, 2007 correctly viewed that the new world marketers are reinventing the wheel of marketing. Initially 4 Ps of marketing were proved ineffective and the new 4 As emerged. Above the line marketing using mass media was replaced by below the line marketing using sales promotion, personal selling, public relations etc. Traditional branding got replaced by sensory branding appealing to all the senses of the customer. Experimental and engagement marketing emerged as the new concepts over traditional AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action). And now it is the turn of viral marketing to be changed in the light of a new concept called big seed marketing. Viral marketing describes any strategy that encourages individuals to pass on a marketing message to others, creating the potential for exponential growth in the message's exposure and influence (Wilson, 2005). It simply means that message is spread like a virus which takes its own course without anybody's direction. Though it provides low cost marketing with maximum reach but it is risky as its success is unpredictable. Professor Duncan Watts, the great authority in the area of social networks, along with his allies has propounded the more practical approach called big seed marketing which makes viral marketing more simple and predictable (Satell, 2010; Watts et al., 2007b ).INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 1532. NEED OF THE STUDY Big seed marketing is an upcoming concept in the area of viral marketing. It can prove to be revolutionary if properly understood and practised by the marketers. Present study fulfils this need for understanding this new concept. This study will also add to the current domain of knowledge by providing the first (as far as I know) paper based study especially in India (as only 2 blogs were found to be Indian) and is believed to trigger the future empirical researches in the area. 3. OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH METHODOLOGY As big seed marketing is a new concept, the main objectives of this study remains to understand the concept of big seed marketing; how does it work; and related benefits and issues. This is a conceptual paper based mainly upon the blogs, the only available literature in the area. Content and ideas in these blogs can be trusted as these are written by marketing professionals and practitioners. These blogs are downloaded from the blog websites and are referred and quoted wherever required. 4. FEW TERMINOLOGIES TO BE UNDERSTOOD Before we proceed with the concept of big seed marketing, it is necessary to understand few terms important to explain it. These terms are essential steps leading to the whole concept of big seed marketing. 4.1 Viral Seeding Viral seeding refers to technique for launching a viral marketing campaign via social media and the blogosphere. It means finding and approaching influential web and blog editors who will find the content interesting and engaging, so much that they will share it with their visitors, their visitorsINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 154will then share it with their peers via social media and so on. (Lafler, 2013; Viralseeding.com, 2013) Successful viral marketing depends on appealing to the mindset of the social media user. They will pass on content that helps them build rapport with their online friends (Lafler, 2013). The empirical results show that the best seeding strategies can be successful up to eight times more than other seeding strategies. Seeding is important because it falls entirely under the control of the initiator and can exploit social characteristics or observable network metrics (Hinz et al., 2011). The initial distribution is sometimes called \"seeding\", and focusing on that distribution is sometimes called using a \"big seed\" (Tyler, 2011a). 4.2 Accidental Influencials Previous theories state that in a given process or system, some people matter more than others who are known as 'influencials'. They influence their local communities, who in turn influence others and the communication channel that ensues, influences the purchase decisions of the consumers. Thus, the effort of the marketers is focused on locating and invoking these influencers through which communication is transmitted, and then passed through (Gupta, 2007). However, Duncan Watts and Peter Dodds, (2007a) argued that influentials have no such effect. Indeed, they have no special role in trends at all. The success in a networked society is quite random. The whole concept is accidental of location and timing; and one cannot generalize the condition of cascade effects due to influencials. It all depends on the availability and connectedness of easily influenced people and not on the characteristics of the initiators. It is believed that network permits global cascades because it has the right concentration and configuration ofINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 155adopters. Influence does not always depend upon personal characteristics like expertise, charisma, and popularity, but also on the circumstance. For a social epidemic to occur each person so affected must influence his or her own acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs, and so on. These easily influenced people are accidental influentials as per Duncan Watts and Peter Dodds (Gupta, 2007; Thompson, 2008; Watts and Peter, 2007a) 4.3 Tipping Point/ Epidemic Threshold The idea of a tipping point has come from physics. It means a point where adding a small amount of weight to a balanced object can cause it to suddenly and completely topple. It means a turning point. A tipping point is simply an additional or incremental change that leads to a big effect. Generally the effects of reaching a tipping point are immediately evident. A tipping point may simply occur because a critical point has been reached. The term is now used in many fields. Journalists apply it to social phenomena, demographic data, and almost any change that is likely to lead to additional consequences. The term is frequently applied in epidemiology (known as epidemic threshold) which means 'gone critical' when an infectious disease reaches a point beyond any local ability to control it from spreading more widely. Here the disease spreads explosively and causes epidemic. Every infected person brings us closer to the tipping point where outbreak becomes an epidemic. The epidemic threshold / tipping point is an important concept in viral marketing. If the viral message is below threshold it will get exponential decay with negligible viral effect. If it is above the threshold, there will be exponential growth leading to viral marketing epidemic. For viral content to explosively spread, people need to share it more frequently than they forget about it. This effect is similar to a nuclear reaction gone critical. The idea of tipping points was popularised by Malcom Gladwell in his popular book, The Tipping Point - How LittleINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 156Things Can Make a Big Differenc e which referred to the same concept as epidemic threshold. Both the concepts are used interchangeably in the context of viral marketing (Rouse, 2006; Tyler, 2011b; Tyler, 2011c). 5. BIG SEED MARKETING After giving the concept of accidental influentials, advocating that the success of viral marketing campaigns is random and accidental without any role of influentials, Duncan Watts and his allies took this forward in the original paper \"Viral Marketing for the Real World\", whose summary is also published in May, 2007 issue of Harvard Business Review. Here a new concept is suggested known as big seed marketing which is a combination of viral and planned marketing and promises to be a far more effective manner of communicating desired messages than simply viral marketing (Gupta, 2007). Big seed combines old-fashioned mass media with word of mouse in a way that yields far more predictable results (A tryst with life, 2011). Viral marketing seems to be a successful marketing way with very low budget. It appears to be very easy to spread the virus and let it go viral. But Watts et al. (2007b, 2007c) tells that there are numerous unsuccessful attempts behind a single successful viral marketing campaign. Designing a campaign ensuring the success and looking for the influentials to pass along the campaign is very difficult even for experienced practitioners. So big seed marketing is suggested which combines viral marketing tools with traditional mass media and benefits from the insights of viral marketing while avoiding its serious pitfalls. Watts et al., 2007b, 2007c suggest to marketers to reach a lot of people through mass media, and then do what they can to enable consumers to pass the message along. Since one can never know which person is going to spark the fire, one should aim the adINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 157at as broad a market as possible\u2014and not waste money chasing influentials (Satell, 2010). 5.1 Working of Big Seed Marketing There is a difference between mass marketing and viral marketing. If N number of people get exposed to an ad and if p is the probability that exposure to ad will lead to favourable conversion like purchasing the product, then total number of favourable conversion will be n=pN. So a company aims either to increase N by large exposure to ad or to increase p by making message more entertaining, interesting etc. But viral marketing acts differently. The word viral obviously stems from the word virus, symbolizing the manner in which the message spreads, without the negative connotation of the word (Rodic and Elina, 2012) and therefore standard viral-marketing model is based on an analogy with the spread of infectious disease. It starts with a small seed of individuals who share the message with their friends, who further pass along the message and so on. The rate at which each starting seed infects the friend is known as the reproduction rate, R. R=Bz where B is the probability of word of mouth transmission and z is the number of people to whom message is told or forwarded. R=1 is the tipping point/ epidemic threshold. The reproduction rate is important because if R>1, then the person who gets the message first propagates it to more than one person and the chain continues leading to exponential growth. However if R<1, then any small seed will burn out itself causing the death of the campaign. To make a viral campaign successful, R needs to be above the tipping point. But problem is that it is not easy to design and predict a campaign with R>1. Even talented and experienced marketers cannot create R>1. Like a viral disease, even a viral campaign dies out if R<1.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 158But Watts et al., 2007b, 2007c points out that there is a serious flaw in the analogy between epidemiology and viral marketing because unlike viral disease, companies can take advantage of mass media to create initial large seed. If the seed is large then even if R<1, a large number of people would be infected by the viral message before the death of the campaign. Suppose an advertising firm purchases an adbuy on the web, generating N page views where p is the probability of those clicking the ad, then adbuy would yield n0 = pN conversions. If these pN have option to share the ad and they share it, they will become large seed for the campaign. If each member of this seed contacts an average of z new people with B probability of these contacts in turn to click through to the ad, then the campaign reaches a total population of n1=pN+BzpN=pN(1+R). If newly added people also forward the message and so on, total population would be n=pN(1+R0+R0R1+R0R1R2+K ) where Ri is the reproduction rate at the ith remove from the initial seed. Watts et al., 2007b, 2007c assumed R to be same at every stage for the sake of simplicity. Therefore the above expression can be expressed as n=p N(1+R^1+R^2+R^3+K)=pN/(1- R). So, even if r is 0.5 (2 people pass the message to 1), one still end up with double the initial seed (Gupta, 2007; Walter, 2007; Watts et al., 2007b, 2007c) In other words, marketers create and launch multiple viral initiatives (big seed) simultaneously thereby increasing the chance that at least one of them catches on and spreads like a virus instead of relying on the content of just one campaign to generate the desired results (Rodic and Elina, 2012).INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 1595.2 Real World Examples of Big Seed Marketing The concept of bid seed marketing is not hypothetical. There are a number of effectively implemented big-seed campaigns using open-source software called ForwardTrack, developed by Michael Frumin of the media art non profit Eyebeam. ForwardTrack is a software for tracking and mapping the circulation of forwarded message. It was to encourage people to forward messages to their friends by seeing their role in whole forwarding process as each participant in a ForwardTrack campaign can see his/her impact in terms of how many of his/her friends, friends of friends, etc. have participated, and see that impact animated on a national map. Initially it was designed to help the message go viral but none of the viral campaign with small seed exhibited the reproduction rate greater than 1. But by starting out with large mailing lists (big seed), all the campaigns reached a large population inspite of reproduction rate lesser than 1 (Eyebeam.org, 2004; Thompson, 2008; Watts et al., 2007b, 2007c). A 2004 campaign for gun control called Tom's Petition used ForwardTrack and exhibited a reproduction rate of 0.58 which means the campaign doubled the initial seed of 22,582 members. Inspired by the success of Tom's Petition, Procter & Gamble also incorporated ForwardTrack into a viral campaign to promote Tide Coldwater which is an energy-efficient alternative to regular detergents. It reached to additional 40,000 individuals inspite of low reproduction rate of 0.041 just because of initial large seed of 900,000 individuals. Another campaign which can be quoted is by Oxygen Network which used ForwardTrack to donate $1 for every participant to Hurricane Katrina relief. It exhibited the highest reproduction rate of 0.769. It reached an additional 23,544 participants beyond the initial seed of 7,064 (Watts et al., 2007b, 2007c). Burger King's subservient chicken campaign which reached millions of viewers throughINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 160website also had generated a large seed by nationwide marketing through television ads (Watts et al., 2007b, 2007c). Gupta, 2007 identified that movie marketing is also done in the manner of big seed marketing by producing an initial large seed because of creation of buzz. Others setup a social network (with regular injections of communication) or support system in the online space, to initiate a seed reaching the critical mass at the fastest speed possible. Satell, 2010 identified another example of big seed marketing. He mentioned aboutO2's Unlimtied Orgy of Fun, which combined a TV intensive brand with social media and event marketing. It was targeted at university students. They were given different challenges per week on YouTube, such as get as many people in one picture as possible. Winners were announced on a dedicated Facebook page along with prizes and ranking to the universities of winning students. At the end of the contest, O2 threw a big party for the winning university. This resulted into over 70,000 people became fans on facebook, million times watching of videos and ultimately increased sales, all in a very small budget. Satell, 2010 believes that it would not be possible if TV hadn't created a Big Seed brand in the first place. 5.3 Benefits of Using Big Seed Marketing Based upon Watts et al. (2007b, 2007c); Walter (2007), it can be said that big seed marketing shows how organizations can combine older and newer media to maximize the reach of their marketing initiatives. It provides the benefit of both the media without facing their serious pitfalls. It has revealed that companies and diseases are different and deriving the concept of viral marketing from analogy to diseases has someINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 161limitations. Unlike diseases, viral marketing can take advantage of mass media. It has provided criteria known as reproduction rate to measure, quantify and reporting the reach of marketing campaign. By using big seed, campaign can be successful even if reproduction rate is less than 1. Big seed concept is simple as well as reliable. It reduces the risk associated with viral marketing due to unpredictability of reproduction rate in advance. One can start the campaign by initial large seeds which will provide quite enough return on investment. Moreover the success does not depend on small number of influentials because it harnesses the advantage of big seed. As quoted by Watts and Jonah 2007c \"although big-seed marketing lacks the mystique of truly viral marketing, it is straightforward to implement and can reliably improve advertising yields at low cost. Equally important, because big-seed marketing harnesses the power of large numbers of ordinary people, its success does not depend on influentials or on any other special individuals; thus, managers can dispense with the probably fruitless exercise of predicting how, or through whom, contagious ideas will spread\". 5.4 Issues Involved After critical analysis, Walter, 2007 pointed out few issues related to big seed concept. Firstly Walter stated that big seed conflate two types of word of mouth strategies- influencer marketing (starting with a small seed of influentials), and viral marketing (creating interesting information to be pass along). He viewed that there exist no reason that why viral marketing cannot be started with large seed.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 162Secondly Walter, 2007 has a fear that big seed can become a conservative approach where companies may stop interacting and engaging with the stakeholders through more important means like dialogue, listening, co- innovation, etc. They will start the campaign with large seed and then just sit on the chair to see the success of the campaign. Walter, 2007 also suggested to compute reproduction rate at each level of separation from the source rather than calculating it as a final value. 6. CONCLUSION Big seed marketing fills the gap between traditional mass marketing and viral marketing. Viral marketing had declared mass media obsolete but now big seed marketing has re emphasized on the importance of mass media on the one side while on the other side it has resolved the issue of risk and unpredictability attached to viral marketing. Inspite of the issues involved, big seed marketing can be seen as a different and new approach to see viral marketing where there not only exist the benefits, but they do exist with certainty. Though one could have and must have started viral campaign with large seed but its Watts et al., 2007b, who stated about large seed for the first time. The concept was in front of everyone but only noticed first time by Watts et al. This new angle given to see viral marketing is first of its kind and worth appreciating. 7. LIMITATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Non availability of paper based research remains the biggest limitation of the current study. It is a review paper trying to analyse the concept and related developments. It has reviewed the available blogs and provided the current and updated status of knowledge in the area.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 163This review provides enough justification to conduct studies- conceptual as well as empirical to move the research forward to future arena. Using ForwardTrack, Watts et al., 2007b, 2007c has shown the success of big seed marketing but now it is others' turn to test the applicability of the concept. Marketers can achieve competitive advantage by adopting big seed marketing. There will be no risk and increased reliability that large seed will grow even if reproduction rate is below 1. Zarrella, 2007 identified that social sites like Digg, Reddit or Delicious are perfect launching pads for big seed efforts. But marketers should be open minded enough not to ignore the importance of other interactive means to engage with the stakeholders.

Ramesh Kumar Research Scholar Dept. of Human Resource Management Andhra University, Visakhapatnam INTRODUCTION Organization is made up of people and function through people, without people organization cannot exist. The resource of men, materials and machinery are collected co - ordinate and utilized through people. This resource by them- self fulfill the objectives of an organization. The need to be united into a team. It is through the combined efforts of people that material and monetary resource are effectively utilized for the attainment of common objectives, without unity human organization cannot achieve its goals. According to Urwick, L.F ., \"business houses are made broken in the long run not by market, capital, patents or equipment but by men.\" Of all the resource manpower is the only resource, which does not depreciate with the passage of time. Now days, more importance is being given to the people in the organization. This is mainly because organizations are realizing that human resource is the most important of all assets. This emphasis can also be partly attributed to the new emerging values of humanism and humanization. Moreover with increased emphasis on creativity and autonomy which people are increasingly acquiring and enjoying in the society the expectation of the people are fast changing. Hence the company is to be viewed as a complex social system and not merely as an organization concerned. According to Jucius, human resources or human factors refer to \"a whole consisting of inter- related,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 166interdependent, and interacting physiological, psychological, sociological and ethical component. \" The industrial organization is seen as performing two major functions. They are production of the products and products and creating as well as distributing satisfactions among the individual members of the organizations. Employee's relations and productivity are closely related to each other and interdependent in the organization, we find a number of individuals working together towards a common end and the collective purpose of the total organization each individual however bringing together to the working situation. Form different background of personal and social experiences, the demand of a particular employee depends not only upon his physical needs but upon his social needs as well. These social needs and sentiments associated with them vary with his early personal history and social conditioning and the needs and sentiments of people are closely associated with him both inside and outside the work. Thus the men engaged for work-in the factories have to be not kept satisfied not only with their wages but also with their conditions of work. Thus the men engaged for work in the factory have to be kept satisfied not only with their wages but also with their conditions of work. Most important of all is the relationship between employees and supervisors. In the individual organization, management is becoming increasingly aware of the significant of the psychological values, which are obtained from the job and the ways in which these values reach out to all aspects of the workers life. OBJECTIVES The present study about the cashew workers in palasa zone srikakulam district is undertaken with the following objectives, to study about the cashew nut processing industries in palasa zone srikakulam district, to identify the factors which influence seasonal employment andINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 167factors, to study the relationship between demographic factors and employment of workers. METHODOLOGY This is an empirical study based on survey method. The data were collected from both primary and secondary sources. SAMPLE DESIGN The boundary of study is palasa zone, srikakulam district. The population of this study is cashew factory in palasa zone, srikakulam.There are 185 factories in the district. From the total population 85 units are takenas sample from palasa zone Convenient sampling method was used for the selection of sample units. SAMPLE PLAN: According to the sampling plan total sample size in 300, allover palasa zone, srikakulam district, based on the sampling design shown in sampling plan, among which123 were male and 177 female workers. SATISTICAL TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS The data collected were analyzed and interpreted with the help of tables and figures. Simple analysis used for this purpose. Seasonal employment of workers in cashew processing industries. There are several aspects to the issues related to Cashew workers in development programme. Attempts have been made to assess and highlight the role that cashew workers play in development. There is no doubt that poor rural cashew workers contribute much to the nation's progress through their heavy responsibilities for assisting in agriculture and industry. Yet their contribution is ignored or taken for granted and areINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 168often exploited. Hence, an initiative should be made affecting the lives and the communities of cashew workers. ANALYSIS OF DATA: The data after collection has to be processed and analyzed in accordance with the outline laid down. The term analysis refers to the computation of certain measures long with searching for patterns of relationship that exists. Thus, \"In the process of analysis, relationships or differences supporting or conflicting with original or new hypothesis should subject to statistical tests of significant to determine with what validity data can be said to be indicate any conclusions. Gender: It describes the state of being male or female. Gender is one of the important factors influencing seasonal employment. The analyses & presentation has been show in the table 1 below Indicates that Gender-wise distribution of sample respondents. Out of the total sample respondents from palasa cashew zone, Fifty nine percent are with female category and the remaining Forty one percent are male category According to the sampling plan total sample size in 300, allover palasa zone, srikakulam. district, based on the sampling design shown in sampling plan, among which 41 percent were male and 59.0 percent were female.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 169AGE: Age is the length of time that one has existed. Age plays a significant role in job satisfaction. Hence, age -wise distribution of respondents were analyzed and presented Source: primary dataThe researcher found out that the most of the cashew workers belong to the age group between 18-30 i.e.,44.0 percentage, about 35.3percentage of workers belong to the agegroup between 31-40 and 20.7percentage of the respondents belong to the age, above 40 years. EDUCATION: Education implies the reasoning and understanding capacity of every person. It gives respect to the persons. The person who is qualified can think well than unqualified. The following table 3 explains the distribution of workers on the base of their education. Education qualification is a vital instrument in the socio-economic development of any nation and of its people. It also makes human resources a positive asset of any country in general and for an organization, which employs them, in particular. The crucial role of academics in developing human capital of required caliber, having the desired knowledge and skill needs no emphasis. Thus academic qualifications play an important role in moulding an individual into an ideal employee. In these days of specialization, selection of employees is purely done basing on the principle of 'right man in the right job'. Hence possession of required academicINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 170qualifications in relation to the job has become the need of the hour. In view of these, academic l qualifications of respondents are also ascertained through primary source. Literacy is the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning to enable an individual to achieve his or her goals, to develop his or her knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in the wider society. As per the academic qualifications of the sample respondents. It is considered imperative to carry out the opinions in this regard. The Table 4a.3 shows that Literacy -wise distribution of sample respondents. Among the total sample respondents, fifty four percent of employees are Literates, forty six percents are Illiterate s. Therefore, the above table indicates that more than fifty four percent of employees are Literates. EXPERIENCE: Experience is the knowledge or skill that has been gained through direct observation or participation in event or in particular activity. Experience helps the workers to carry out or perform their job in a proper manner. Employees with sufficiently long service in an organization develop high level of commitment and feel a sense of belongingness to the organization. They nurture the organization's culture; understand organizational goals and objectives which have either a direct or indirect relationship with employee's length of service in the enterprise. Hence,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 171an attempt is made to study the length of service. Categorizations of the respondents on the basis of the experience put in by them in selected organization are taken into consideration. The Table 4 indicates that experience-wise distribution of sample respondents. From the table it is clear that forty seven percent respondents are having below the three years experience, Twenty nine percent Three to Five years and nearly twenty four percent of respondents are having above five years experience. Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents are having below three years of experienced. MARITAL STATUS: Marital status can be divided into two: they are married status and unmarried status. Before marriage the girl lives wither parents and after marriage the girl moves into her husband's family. The Table 5 indicates that marital status-wise distribution of sample respondents. From the table it is clear that forty eight percent respondents are married, nearly thirty five percent are unmarried and seventeen percent of respondents are separated from family. Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents are married.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 172 As per the family system of the sample respondents. It is considered imperative to carry out the opinions in this regard. The Table 6 shows that family system -wide distribution of sample respondents. Among the total sample respondents, nearly seventy one percent of respondents are under joint family system, twenty nine percent are under nuclear family system . Therefore, the above table indicates that more than nearly seventy percent of respondents are under joint family system. FAMILY SIZE: The family is a universal social institution, which consists of father, mother, sister and so on. Human beings live a comfortable life. The Table.7 indicates that Family Size-wise distribution of sample respondents. From the table it is clear that sixty one percent respondents are having five to seven numbers of the family, nearly twenty one percent Two to Four numbers and eighteen percent of respondents are having above seven numbers of family. Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents are having five to seven numbers of the family.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 173 The Table 8 indicates that Type of House -wise distribution of sample respondents. From the table it is clear that nearly sixty two per- cent respondents are having rental houses, nearly thirty eight percent own houses, fifty six percent of respondents are having Pukka houses and more than forty three, more than forty three respondents are having Thatched houses . Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents are having Pukka and Rental houses. The Table 9 indicates that house amenities -wise distribution of sample respondents. From the table it is crystal clear that seventy four percent respondents are having Electricity facility, more than sixty one percent water facilities, fifty six percent of respondents are having drain- age facilities to their houses and more than fifty six respondents are not having toilets in their houses. Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents are not having toilets in their houses. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 174The Table 10 indicates that Use of firewood -wise distribution of sample respondents. The above table reveals that more than thirty four percent respondents are using cow dung as fuel for cooking, thirty percent respondents are using liquid petroleum gas, more than twenty seven per- cent of respondents are using country firewood and more than seven per- cent respondents are using Kerosene as fuel for cooking. Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents using cow dung as fuel for cooking. Table 11 - Home Appliances - wise distributions of sample respondents it is very intimating to note that the above table indicates that fifty three percent respondents are having Television, more than thirty three percent having Mixie/Grinder, more than thirty percent of respondents are having CD player, thirty percent respondents are having Furniture and more than thirteen percent respondents are having Refrigerators in their houses. Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents are having Television in their houses. The Table 12 indicates that Type of Civil supply card - wise distributions of sample respondents. From the table it is clear that eighty two percent respondents are having white card, and eighteen percent of the respondents having pink card. Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents are having white card.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 175 The Table 13 indicates that use of Hospital - wise distributions of sample respondents. From the table it is clear that more than seventy eight percent respondents are using government hospitals, and more than twenty one percent of the respondents using Private Hospital. Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents are using government hospitals. The Table 14 indicates that House hold pets - wise distributions of sample respondents. From the table it is clear that more than seventy five percent respondents are having cattle, and more than eighty seven percent of the respondents having livestock. Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents are having both cattle and livestock. The Table 15 indicates that Sources of Agriculture-wise distribution of sample respondents. The above table reveals that more than forty percent respondents are becoming Agriculture labour after the season of cashew, more than twenty seven percent respondents are fitting construction labour, more than fifteen percent of respondents are having their own agriculture, and more than sixteen percent respondents are becoming coconut labour.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 176Therefore, the above analysis shows that most of the respondents becoming Agriculture labour after the season of cashew. CONCLUSION: The analyses reveals that the individuals of the age of 18-30 years of age group is working more in number in cashew processing industries, Most of them are women workers. Majority of the workers are literates. The income of the cashew workers is low when compared to other processing industries. The study shows that after marriage also the women are working in cashew industry this is due to the burden in their family. The study indicates that there is no significant relationship between demographic factors and socio economic factors except for gender and marital status. In short, workers in cashew factory are satisfied with their job. References: 1. Basavaraj Banker and Shanker M G (2003), \"Cashew Production and Export\", Yojana, November 15, 2003. 2.

Although Mahatma Gandhi has not written any particular book on education, and Most of Gandhi's important writings on education have been compiled and edited by Bharatan Kumarappa in two books, Basic Education (1951) and Towards New Education (1953) he is no considered and educationist in the academic world, but his views published in different journals like Young India, Harijan Navajavan, and Harijan Sewak, time to time on various aspects related to education, definitely helps us to understand his concept of education. Mahatma Gandhi is of the opinion that education is a life-long process; it is for total development and all round growth of man from beginning till end. In this regard he also said, \"Education means an all round drawing out of the best in child and man- body, mind and spirit\". He considers that education is not literacy. He says, \"Literacy is neither the beginning nor the end of education. This is only a means through which man and woman can be educated. He did not favour teaching and learning of 3 R's as literacy in itself is no education. He rightly says, \"True education is that which draws out and stimulates the spiritual, intellectual and physical faculties of the children.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 179. The most significant single document in all of Gandhi's writings on education is probably the Inaugural Address that he delivered at the Wardha Conference of 1937. Gandhi was the President of the conference, which was attended by well-known educationists and ministers of 7 Provinces, and this conference was held under the auspices of the Marwari Education Society (later renamed as the Nava Bharat Vidyalaya) at Wardha on 22nd and 23rd October 1937, and the Agenda, formulated by Gandhi, in this conference contained four propositions, which may be summarized as follows: 1)\"The present system of education does not meet the requirements of the country....\" 2)\"The course of primary education should be extended at least to seven years and should include the general knowledge gained up to the matriculation standard, less English and plus a substantial vocation.\" 3)\"For the all-round development of boys and girls all training should as far as possible is given through a profit-yielding vocation.\" 4)\"Higher education should be left to private enterprise and should be to meet national requirements whether in the various industries, technical arts, belles-letters or fine arts Wardha Scheme of Education: To put his educational ideas into actual practice. Gandhiji placed, before the country, his wardha scheme of Education in 1937. It is also known as Basic Education Scheme. The term \"Basic\" has been derived from the term \"Base\" which means the foundation upon which a structure rest. Gandhiji calls his scheme of education basic for the following reason:INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 1801)His scheme of education is intimately related with the basic needs and the interest of the Indian children. 2)It gives emphasis on the innate potentialities of the children 3)Basic education is closely related to the basic occupations of the people living in the villages, irrespective of case, creed, colour, sex and religion. 4)His scheme of education is based on the ancient culture of India and meant for the common man who is considered as the backbone of our country. 5)The British system of education was artificial and unreal. in the words of Gandhiji: \"I am convinced that the present system of education is not only wasteful but positively harmful. Most of the boys are lost to the occupations to which they were born. They pick up evil habits, effect urban ways and get a smattering of something which may be anything but education\". Salient Features of Education (Wardha Scheme): The basic scheme of education has the following important features: 1) Free and compulsory Education:- Gandhiji advocated free, compulsory and universal education for all boys and girls, between the age of seven and fourteen. If the education is not free and compulsory then students who are coming from poor families remain illiterate who will be the future of India. He wanted to combine the primary with secondary education and called: it \"English less Matriculation. That was the only alternative for rural uplift and rural reconstruction. He wanted to leave higher education to private enterprise. He believed that primary education was the minimum that must be available to all. 2) The curriculum:-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 181According to Gandhiji education should be related to the environment of the child and the curriculum of the basic education should be consisted of the craft, the mother tongue of the students, social studies, Mathematics, natural science, music and drawing, and place for Hindustani:- a) The craft: Basic craft is only to be the means of education. A number of crafts such as agriculture, spinning and weaving, card board, wood and metal work, gardening, leather work etc have been suggested. His curriculum was activity centered and that the craft chosen should be a village craft and should be useful. b) Mother Tongue: Gandhiji emphasized the mother tongue to be the medium of instruction. Mother tongue would enable the children to express themselves effectively and clearly. If a student/child learns through mother tongue then he can easily learn ethical and moral values and importance of national heritage. According to him if English is to be taught as medium of instruction then it hinders the development of understanding and clarity of thoughts/ideas. so in this respect mother- tongue deserves greater attention. c) Social studies: Social studies were a combination of some subjects like History, Geography, Civics and Economics. It was introduced to enable the students to understand and appreciate their own culture and also to understand nature and function of family state and the nation and their inter- relationship. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 182 d) Mathematics : According to him mathematics helps the students to solve the numerical and geometrical problems connected with craft and community life and in teaching of mathematics emphasis were laid on practical measuring and field work. Teaching of mathematics helped the students to develop their reasoning capacities e) Natural science: General science including nature study botany, zoology, chemistry, astronomy, hygiene, physical culture and knowledge of stars should be taught. This will promote students an intelligent and appreciate outlook on nature. It forms in the students the habit of accurate observation and of testing experience by experiment. Domestic science should be added for the girl in the fourth and fifth grades. f) Drawing and Music: Drawing and music were included in the curriculum to develop creativity in boys and girls. Drawing has its importance at three levels, it develops expression skill through drawing, it touches to imaginative faculty of mind and also focuses on aesthetic sense to appreciate art at both level- artist's and interpreter's level. g) Place for Hindustani: Hindustani should be given a place for pride in curriculum construction. It should be compulsory subject. It may develop as a national language in future, because he believed that it is the combination of Hindi and Urdu.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 1833) Non-violence:- One of the aims of basic education is to prepare ideal and responsible citizen who will develop virtues like non-violence so that they are not attracted by violence and other anti-social activities. If each would try to inculcate this value then there will be peace and harmony among the citizen of India. There will not be any kind of disagreement but good understanding with each other. 4) Self-sufficiency:- Basic education should provide such training that one can realize that immediate aim- earning- after or during basic education. Earning for one's own self and satisfying one's needs. He said, \"You have to start with the conviction that looking to needs of the villages of India, our rural education ought to be made self-supporting if it is to be compulsory. Gandhiji holds that the child at the age of fourteen, after finishing seven or eight year's education, should be discharged as an earning unit. 5) Relation with Life:- According to Gandhiji, education should be related to life. The subjects taught in the school should be correlated with life as well as with other subjects. Basic education and the Teacher: The teacher has higher responsibilities. He has to develop values among the learners. The teacher should follow morality. There should not be any dark patch on his character because he is role model for many students. Gandhiji says-\"education of the heart could only be done through the living touch of the teacher.\" Education becomes effective and faithful only to the extent to which there is personal touch between the teacherINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 184and the taught. It will be very difficult to achieve character building in the absence of devotion to the teacher. He should have devotion to duty, to the students and to God. He is to play the role of a mother. An ideal teacher in Gandhiji's word is the \"mother teacher.\" He says I used the word \"mother teacher\" because the teacher must really be a mother of children. I think it would be useful to restate briefly the various facets of Gandhi's educational philosophy as outlined above, reducing them to the following cardinal postulates: 1)Education means all round development; it is best obtained through action. 2)Education has to be through a craft, not merely through books and abstractions. 3)The basis of true education is character building; an educated person should become an ideal citizen. 4)Education should be self-supporting as far as possible and also equip the pupil to better his own economic conditions. 5)Education should be based on non-violence and should work for communal harmony. 6)The medium of instruction should be the mother-tongue, not English. 7)Primary education should be free and compulsory for all children and should last for at least seven years. 8)All educational planning should be undertaken with the rural Indian masses in mind; in other words, education should not be elitist, but popular in its character.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 185Conclusion: Gandhian educational ideas, founded as they are on certain eternal principles, will not lose their fundamental relevance in the years to come. Gandhiji emphasized certain ideals, practical work and the potentiality of students in education. It is education through which we can find out the potential of the students and teach them certain ideals which will help them to be a good citizen and through practical activities students will be in a position to think practically and they will be attentive and active, this will help them to mould their character . Thus Gadhian education has been characterized as encompassing the head, the heart and the hands that means the all-around development of child. According to him education is that which draws out and stimulates the spiritual, intellectual and physical faculties of children. Thus Gandhiji's purpose of education is to raise man to a higher order through full development of the individual and the evolution of a \"new man.\" It is with these facts in mind that we should approach the relevance of Gandhi's educational ideas in the coming millennium.

Public libraries are distinct from research libraries, school libraries, and other special libraries in that their mandate is to serve the general public's information needs (rather than the needs of a particular school, institution, or research population). Public Libraries also provide free services such as preschool story times to encourage early literacy, quiet study and work areas for students and professionals, or book clubs to encourage appreciation of literature in adults. Public libraries typically allow users to take books and other materials off the premises temporarily. Definition of a Public library: Public libraries are the source of information distribution among the society and are governed by the public money and grant. UNESCO Public Library Manifesto, describes public libraries as \"a gateway to knowledge\".. Public library is an entity that is established under state enabling laws or regulators to serve a community, district, or region , and that provides at least the following: 1) an organized collection of printed or other library materials, or a combination thereof; 2) paid staff; 3) an established schedule in which servicesINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 199of the staff are available to the public; 4) the facilities necessary to support such a collection, staff, and schedule; and 5) is supported in whole or in part with public funds( CPLA Certification Review Committee) . Importance, Characteristics and Role of public libraries Public libraries are the easily approachable local centres of information, making all kinds of knowledge and information easily available to the users. Public libraries help promote literacy and enjoyment of reading. They are also places where people can go to get information, whether it's for leisure, for study or for work. Accessible to everyone, regardless of their age, race sex, religion, nationality or social status Independent of any ideological, political or religious censorship Free of charge Organised effectively and professionally to meet the needs of the local community Physically accessible to everyone. Public libraries must be seated at the heart of the communities. They help to create a sense of belongingness and should respond to the needs of the people who use them. They celebrate cultural diversity, and they help promote understanding between different cultural groups. Public libraries offer opportunities for lifelong learning. They help children and young people to develop imagination and creativity, and they give adults the opportunity to learn about their cultural heritage, and about the arts, science and technology.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 200Services public libraries offer include: Materials for borrowing include books, magazines and newspapers, DVDs and CDs for reference. Internet access Story reading and holiday programmes for children, and after school homework clubs for teenagers Reference and study facilities Local history collections. Problem of Study: Public Libraries are established in every district of Haryana. The state government of Haryana passed a legislation for the establishment of public libraries in 1989. Despite mandatory legislation for establishment and maintenance of public libraries established under the Public Library Act, 1989, the existing status of the same is not up to the mark because of its faulty implementation. Scope of the Study This paper mainly focuses on the condition of public libraries in Haryana. This paper also discusses the development of public libraries in Haryana in terms of infrastructure, funding and staff recruitment procedures & qualifications. Research Methodology For carrying out this research, secondary data has been used and is purely dependent on the authentic information available in public domain. The secondary data sources are website of higher education Haryana and school education department of Haryana. For the purpose of more insight into the research question, the direct interview technique has been adoptedINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 201by the telephonic discussion with the public librarians who are working at present. The analysis is done based the compilation of available information. Demography of Haryana Haryana state came into being on 1st November 1966. Previously it was part of Punjab. The name of the state is derived from two syllables name Hari (Green) and Ana (Home). Thus Haryana means \"A Green Hoome\". After it became an independent state, great amount of improvement was witnessed in every sector and it shares the boundaries with Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. It is spread over 44,212 square kilometer of area. Haryana consists 21 district and has 43 tourist complexes. A few to be named are Badhkal Lake, Dabchik, Jungle Babbler, Pinjore. All are named after birds. It shares its capital with Punjab and presently it is city beautiful, Chandigarh. Languages spoken in Haryana are Hindi and Punjabi.(source: http://haryanainfo.in/about/) Existing Status of Education in Haryana: Haryana is a state having 21 districts and is becoming a hub of education as per statement issued by the government of Haryana officials. There are many educational institutes like schools, colleges, universities and public libraries. The real situation of the libraries in Haryana is worst than other states. A brief data is given below:INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 202 The above table 1 shows that at school level there is no library staff appointed and in case of higher education institutions, the position is not very satisfactory. It is obvious to believe that without the library personnel how the problems of maintenance and administration can be solved.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 203 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 204The table 2 indicates that there is no building of their own in many of the public libraries as one library building is donated by HUDA, five libraries are running in rented buildings, one is running in other govt. department building, six libraries are running in its own building, two libraries details are not available from the twenty libraries as mentioned above. The area of each library is shown in column no. 3 of the table. These libraries are having a few tables and chairs and there is no proper power backup. The area of the library is also shown in the table. It is clear from the table 3 that one Sub-Div. Library is temporarily closed out of six libraries. The table shows that the sub divisional libraries are running in very small area. The Adampur sub divisional library is running only in one room. This one room is used as a stack room as well as reading room. In Hansi, there are two rooms where library is running. One library is running in rented building, one in private, two are running in Govt. building and municipal committee building. It was also found that these libraries are run by non professionals. Because government has not made any recruitment for these libraries since long. As per information received from the concerned libraries it was found that only five librariesINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 205are run by librarians in all the district libraries and sub-divisional libraries. Many district libraries are found closed during visit. Even in Narnaul district library is run by a class IV employee. This situation is same in other district libraries. The government is planning to make these libraries on the web with the help of e-granthalaya software. (Oneindia News). Therefore, it is found that infrastructure is a big issue in public libraries and surprisingly it may be concluded that how these libraries can be operationalized without any recruitment of the skilled library professionals. The condition of the public libraries is worse in Haryana Even in school, college and universities. The condition of libraries is not good at present. In the state universities libraries are also working without proper skilled staff members or we can say that most of the state university libraries are running without librarian today. Even in schools there are libraries but library staff is not recruited till date. The charge of the library has been handed over to the teachers. The day was horrible on 12th April, 2012 the Haribhumi Newspaper has published an article on libraries that libraries in Haryana are there but librarians are not available. This statement has given some facts that last 15 years librarians are not recruited in school and colleges. It was also mentioned in the article that 7000 master degree and 15000 diploma holders in library and information science are moving for jobs in Haryana state. Two universities and three polytechnic institutes in the state offer Ph. D, M.Phil, M.Lib, B.Lib and diploma courses respectively. It came to notice that 140 colleges are having at least 2-2 vacant seats in libraries. There are most of the colleges are runnibg witout librarians because the recruited librarians has been retired from the services. It was mentioned in the article that if librarian is appointed inINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 206some of the colleges on minimum remuneration in place of proper scale.(source: Ajjsamaj Newspaper, 12/04/2012) Role of government of Haryana in developing Public Libraries in Haryana The government of Haryana has started public library in Haryana after Public library legislation 1989. Public libraries in Haryana are going to be improving very soon. 25th march 2001, the finance commissioner has sanctioned a grant of Rs. 4.8 crore for upgradation of these libraries. Amount of Rs. 400000 has been sanctioned for the purchasing of books, periodicals and newspapers in each library. As stated by the finance commissioner that this amount will be raised upto 1 crore per year. Finance Commission had recommended one-time grant of Rs 4.8 crore for the upgradation of all 26 public libraries in Haryana. The commission had also recommended that the state may convert one-time grant into a corpus, invest it and use the returns for the purchase of books and periodicals every year on a sustainable development basis. There are 26 public, district and central state libraries; there is one state central library, 19 district libraries and 6 sub divisional libraries headed by the Director of Higher Education as heads the Directorate of Public Libraries. Besides, the state government, in a separate initiative to modernize and technically upgrade the public libraries, has approved a project of Rs 75 lakh to convert the District Library at Karnal into a cyber library, the first of its kind in the country in the government sector in 2001. (TheTribune , Chandigarh, March 25) Now there are 26 public libraries in Haryana today. These libraries are located at district head quarters and are having a good collection onINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 207Literature, Culture and History etc. These libraries are also having the collection of local regional history. These libraries are governed by the state government. The government releases the funds to all the public libraries for purchasing the reading material and their infrastructures. The government of Haryana has played a vital role to establish the public/ district libraries under the supervision of education department of Haryana. But after a long time the government have not taken care of these libraries. Today these libraries' condition is not hiding from any common man. The peoples are not using these libraries for their research purposes. Only few users visit the library for reading newspapers. Even today is observed that most of the district libraries have been closed due to non availability of the staff/ librarian. The collections of the libraries are going to be destroyed in the closed almirahs because of dust and carelessness. Recent government initiatives for recruiting human resources in libraries in Haryana Recently the government of Haryana has advertised 3118 posts of librarian cum manager and appointed some of them. Now again the government of Haryana has advertised the same posts for the recruitment of 1718 posts. The efforts made by the government seems to be good that the government of Haryana is very much cautious about the recruitment of the librarian. But on another side the government of Haryana is destroying this profession to mention the qualification in this advertised advertisement for the same post. The government of Haryana has mentioned the qualification for the post was M.Sc. (Computer Science) (with at least 50% Marks) Or Master in Computer Application (with at least 50% Marks) Or BE/B.Tech in Computer Science/Information Technology (with at least 50% Marks) Or BE/B.Tech in any stream with Post Graduate Diploma in Computer (with at least 50% marks in both) OrINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 208MBA and Post Graduate Diploma in Computer (with at least 50% marks in both) from recognized university. Complete Knowledge of Multimedia & Web Technology, Computer Science & Informatics Technology. 1. Desirable Qualifications:- i. Graduate Or Post Graduate in Library Science from a recognized university. ii. B.Ed. Or M.Ed. from a recognized university. iii.STET Qualified (Related to 9th to 12th). (Source: http://www.sakshieducation.com/ %28S%28zmmkgbbytimunret3td0murj% 29%29/ENGG GStory.aspx?nid=23877&cid=12&sid=85&chid=0&tid=0) This effort made by the government shows that the government is fulfilling the vacant post of the library through non library skilled personnel. It is felt that the government of Haryana is killing two professions i.e. Engineering and library Science. If the government of Haryana follows its decision about the recruitment that the condition of the libraries will be worst because all these appointment are made on contract basis. A contractual person is never responsible for any work. It means the development of library will be hampering after one year because these post are recruited only for one year on the consolidated remuneration of Rs. 20000. It was also found that the implementation of library legislation act has been implemented for the establishment of libraries in urban areas but as far as concerned with the proper staff that had been never recruited for these libraries.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 209Conclusion: There is no doubt that Government of Haryana has taken the positive steps in the development of libraries since its establishment. The government has developed 20 districts and 6 sub divisional libraries for the community. These libraries have contributed a lot of knowledge in the society. Now the literate people of the urban areas are fully aware about the libraries and its material. The public libraries are the major source of knowledge to make a good human being. The people can get the knowledge about the local culture and abroad through these libraries. The infrastructural facilities in these libraries are not very satisfactory as evidenced by the researches. The implementation of library act is found faulty. It was found that the cataloguing of the library books has not been completed till date in the public libraries. References 1. www.indianresearchjournals.com 2.

Sridhar Patnaik Associate Professor Dept. of Mechanical Engineering VITAM College of Engineering, Visakhapatnam Introduction Plate fin heat exchanger is kind of heat exchanger plan that uses plates and finned chambers to transport heat between fluids. It has been classified frequently as a compact heat exchanger to insist its comparatively high heat transfer surface region to volume ratio. The plate fin heat exchanger is broadly employed in many industries, comprising the aerospace industry for its compact size and lightweight properties, as well as in cryogenics where its capacity to moderate heat transfer with small temperature differences is utilized. Extended surface is used specially to enhance the heat transfer rate between a solid and an adjoining fluid. It is well known that the rate of heat transfer from the fin decreases with the increase of fin length and hence, the entire heat transfer surface of a fin may not be equally utilized. For this reason, there is a continuous effort by the researchers as well the designers to determine the optimum shape of fin that will maximize the rate of heat transfer for a specified fin volume or minimize the fin volume for a given heat transfer rate.

This disease can be characterised by rapid and uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells which form a tumor . Sometimes the process of proliferation of these cancer cells is arrested naturally or by chemotherapeutic agents. If the process is not arrested, it may progress until the death of the organism.Cancer cells have a character of immortality and they continue to grow invading nearby tissues and metastasizing to distant parts of the body. Metastasis is the most lethal aspect of carcinogenesis (McNutt. 1995).In 2007, cancer claimed the lives of approximately 7.8 million people in the world (Table-1). After the cancer of uterine cervix, breast cancer is the second most common cancer in Indian women. Similarly, Prostate cancer in men is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer. Recent studies show that most of the cases of cancer are due to changes in the DNA that reduces the normal control over the cell growth, development and apoptosis. These changes are more likely to be genetic or may occur in the person infected by chronic viruses. It may occur due to the exposure to carcinogenic chemicals or radiations which lead to failure of immune system to eliminate cancer cells at early stage in proliferation.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 221Types of Cancer 1.Blood Cancer a.Leukaemia: It is a type of cancer found in blood and bone marrow caused due to rapid production of abnormal white blood cells. b.Lymphoma : It affected the lymphatic system. Abnormal lymphocytes become lymphoma cell that multiply and gets collected in the lymph nodes and other tissues. c.Myeloma: In, myeloma the plasma is affected by the cancer formation 2.Skin Cancer a.Malignant Melanoma : Such type of cancer occurs in melanocytes, the pigment cells present in the skin. 3.Gastrointestinal Cancer a.Stomach Cancer: The most important factors leading to the development of stomach cancer, also called as gastric cancer are smoking, consumption of alcohol, pernicious anaemia (Yamada et al., 2009) and genetic factors. b.Liver cancer : These are the malignant tumors which grow on the surface or inside the liver. Hepatitis C (Rosen, 2011), Hepatitis B or obesity may be the cause for liver cancer. c.Esophageal cancer: It is the malignant tumor of esophagus which generally occurs in men over 50 years old. Esophageal cancer occurs exist as squamous cell carcinoma which is linked with consumption of alcohol and smoking and the other is adenocarcinoma that arise due to obesity or smoking.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 222d.Anal Cancer : This type of cancer is typically found in adults and it arises from the anus. It is squamous cell carcinoma that arises near squamocolumnar junction. In countries like United States, approximately 800-900 people die of anal cancer annually. 4.Cancer of Urinary system a.Kidney cancer : It is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the kidney. Cancer is caused by the rapid abnormal overgrowth of cells within the kidney. It occurs mainly in adults (above the age of 55 years) and is rare in children . b.Bladder cancer: Cancer usually begins in the lining of the bladder and its cells may spread into the muscular wall of the bladder. Invasive form of this cancer may spread to organs such as liver and lungs and to the lymph nodes. c.Prostate Cancer: In this, cancer begins to grow in prostate which is a gland in male reproductive system. This type of cancer affects men only. 5.Cancers in women a.Breast cancer: Breast cancer kills more women than any other form of cancer except for lung cancer. The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma which occurs in the lining of milk duct. The other type of breast cancer is lobular carcinoma that begins in the lobules of the breast. It occurs in both men and women but male breast cancer is rare. b.Ovarian cancer: Malignant ovarian lesions include primary lesions arising from the normal structures within the ovary and secondary lesions from cancers arising elsewhere in the body.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 223This is the most common cause of cancer death from gynecologictumors in various parts of the world. c.Choriocarcinoma: It results from genetic damage to germ cells. This cancer forms inside the reproductive organs. Some originates in the testes or ovaries. Others develop in the uterus after a pregnancy or miscarriage. Choriocarcinomas spreads quickly and widely. Chemotherapy is one of the major treatments used for the control of advanced stages of the malignancies (Somkumar, 2003; Madhuri and Pandey, 2006). Since many years, plants have been used for the treatment of various diseases. More than 50% of the drugs used these days have natural products as one of their ingredients; most of them have the ability to control cancer cells (Meyer and Taylor ,. 1996). They maintain the health and vitality of individuals and cure diseases without causing toxicity. In recent years, certain herbs and medicinal plants have drawn keen attention of researchers and medical practitioners primarily because of their convincing anticancer properties with negligible side effects and discomfort to patients. Medicinal plants and Herbs with Anticancer Activity a.Allium sativus Allium sativus commonly known as garlic is the most widely researched medicinal plant. Belonging to Amaryllidaceae family, it has been used as a spice, food and medicine for over 40 centuries. Garlic bulb contains more than 200 chemical compounds (Eiaz et al ., 2003). Allium sativus and dialllyl disulphide (DADS). It also contains flavonoids, vitamin A, vitamin B1 and vitamin C, potassium, phosphorous, selenium, sulphur, magnesium, calcium, sodium, ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 224iron, and trace iodine (Ranjani et al., 2012 ). It has been reported that garlic is effective in the treatment of ailments such as artheroscleosis (Warshafsky et al., 1993), coronary thrombosis(Block et al , 1986) cardiovascular diseases as it lowers the cholesterol level in the serum (Sainani et al, 1979), lowers blood pressure and several other infections. The epidemiological studies suggest that garlic contains various biologically important compounds that possess antitumor properties which are beneficial to human health.It is found that consumption of garlic reduces the risk of stomach, lung and esophageal cancers (Steinmetz et al., 1994, You et al., 1989, Dorant et al., 1996). Fleischauer et al,. 2000 conducted a meta-analysis of the epidemiological literature on the association between garlic consumption and risk of stomach, colon, head and neck, lung, breast and prostate cancers. In their analysis, they assessed consumption of raw garlic, cooked garlic or both (RC garlic). It was concluded that a high intake of RC garlic might be associated with a protective effect against stomach and colorectal cancers. Most realistic approach in prevention of Human cancer is chemoprevention. Naturally occurring sulphur containing compounds such as Garlic compounds and isothiocynates are effective chemo preventive compounds. They target metabolism of carcinogens and they possess the ability to supress the proliferation of cancer cells in culture and in vivo . Antiproliferative effect of garlic Studies suggest that allyl sulphur compounds such as allicin, ajoeneetc are important antitumorigenic agents. These compounds can alter the proliferation of neoplastic cells. Sundaram and Milner (1996) and Pinto et al. (1997) suggested that theallyl group is instrumental in bringing about the growth depression.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 225However, all allylsulfides are not equal in their ability to reduce tumor proliferation (Pinto et al. 1997, Sundaram and Milner 1993). Studies by Sundaram and Milner 1993 demonstrated that diallylsulfide, DADS and diallyltrisulfide (DATS) were far more effective in supressing the growth of neoplasms than were water-soluble allylsulfur compounds such as SAC. The effects of naturally occurring garlic derivatives and synthetic S-cysteinyl compoundson the proliferation of human prostrate carcinoma (LNCaP) cells have been studied (Pinto et al., 1997). It was found that S- allylmercaptocysteine significantly decreased LNCaP cell growth while S- allyl cysteine had a lesser effect. b. Cannabis sativa The annual herb, Cannabis sativa also known as Marijuana or Indian hemp belongs to family Cannabinaceae . Medically, it is used in the treatment of various diseases such as HIV/AIDS, insomnia, hypertension, cachexia. It has also been used in the treatment of various tumours and cancer. The active components of Marijuana, Cannabinoids, can reduce tumour growth and progression in various animal models of cancer (Velasco et al., 2012). Cannabinoids have antiemetic properties that can be useful in the treatment of cancer (Machado et al., 2008). It was clear from an experimental data that these compounds exert anti-tumour effects in various models of cancer. Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and induction of cancer cell death by apoptosis leads to the inhibition of uncontrolled cancer cell growth, impair tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by cannabinoids. Some of these effects were observed in tumor cells from different origins (Velasco et al., 2012). Cannabinoid based medicines help cancer patients in theINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 226management of pain, nausea and vomiting (Portenoy et al ., 2012). Cannabinoids in combination with paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil (anticancer agents) showed synergistic inhibitory effects on the proliferation of pancreatic(Donadelli et al., 2011) and gastric (Miyato et al., 2009) cancer cells. c. Berberine It is an isoquinoline alkaloid which belongs to the structural class of protoberberines. It is present in the roots, rhizome and stem bark of Berberisvulgaris , B. aristata and on other important medical plant species (Imanshahidi and Hosseinzadeh., 2008).In cell lines and primarily cultured cells including multiple tumor cell lines and normal cells, antiproliferation properties of berberine has been studies. Studies shows that the murine melanoma B16 cell line was more sensitive to berberine treatment than the human promonocytic U937 cells (Letasiova et al ., 2006). It was studied that Berberine displayed antibacterial and antifungal activities against Giardia lamblia, Staphylococcus aureus ( Imanshahidi and Hosseinzadeh., 2008). It also inhibits the growth of Helicobacter Pylori (Mahady et al., 2003). A recent study has shown that berberine inhibits migration and invasion of human SCC-4 tongue squamous carcinoma cells, which is mediated by the p-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38, IkK, and MMP-2 and MMP-9(Ho et al., 2009). In vivo, oral administration of berberine for 14 days significantly inhibits the spontaneous mediastinal lymph node metastasis produced by orthotopic implantation of Lewis lung carcinoma into the lung parenchyma in a dose-dependent manner, but it does not affect the tumor growth at the implantation site of the lung. Mediation of these antimetastatic propertiesINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 227arethrough the repression of AP-1 activity by suppressing the expression of u-PA (Mitani et al., 2001). It has been studies that its overexpression is correlated with lymphatic metastasis of lung cancer (Yoshino et al., 1998; Ichiki et al., 2000).Recent studies show that Berberine can induce apoptosis of human ostrosarcoma cells (Liu et al., 2009) and prostate cancer cells in a p53 dependent manner (Choi et al., 2008). Being a broad spectrum enzyme inhibitor, Berberine affects N- acetyltransferase, cyclooxygenase-2, and topoisomerase activities and gene expression. Along with the regulation of reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and nuclear factor-jB activation these actions might underlie its antiproliferativeand proapoptotic effects (Yiyi et al., 2009). d. Azadirachtaindica Azadirachtaindica commonly known as Neemis a tropical evergreen branched tree with oblique leaves belonging to family Meliaceae . It can grow upto 20ft in height(Paul and Prasad, 2011). The plant is full of pharmaceutical values. Various unique chemical compounds have been purified from this plant which is used as antiseptic, antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer agents. From the studies it was found that neem possess ability to remove cancer phenotype. Gangar et al., (2006) studied the modulatory effects of Azadirachtaindica on Benzo( )pyrere induced forestomachtumorigenesis in mice. Their results indicated that neem leaf extracts can reduce the metabolic activation of Benzo( )pyrere with decrease in the level of Benzo( )pyrere adduct formation. Neem extracts and its purified products have been studied for induction of apoptosis in the cancer cells. Kumar et al., (2006) showed that ethanolic extract of neem was capable of inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (PC-3) in a dose-dependent manner.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 228Cancer biologists have accepted bioimmunotherapy as one of the dependable therapeutic regimens against cancer. With appropriate presentation of tumor-associated region, where the role of antigen presenting cells is predominant, neem modulated active specific immunotherapy boost the hot's antitumor immune response.

Mistry Assistant Professor Institute of Forensic Science Gujarat Forensic Sciences University GandhinagarDr. M. S. Dahiya Director Institute of Forensic Science Gujarat Forensic Sciences University Gandhinagar Mr. Hitesh P . Sanghvi Assistant Director Cyber Crime Division, Directorate of Forensic Science Gandhinagar Introduction Difference between File Recovery and File Carving After referring the above topic confusion should be there in mind: If file carving could be a methodology of file recovery, then what is the distinction between file recovery and file carving? Modern operational systems do not automatically eradicate a deleted file while not prompting for the user's confirmation. Deleted files are recoverable by mistreatment some forensic programs if the deleted file's area is not overwritten by another file. A damaged file will only be recovered if its information isn't corrupted beyond a minimal degree. File recovery is completely different from file restoration, within which a computer file stored during a compressed (encoded) kind is restored to its usable (decoded) kind. So there is a distinction between the techniques. File recovery techniques make use of the filing system information and, by mistreatment this information, several files is recovered. If the data isn't correct, then it'll not work.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 235File carving works only on information on the media and it is not connected with filing system structure. File carving doesn't care concerning any file systems that is employed for storing files. In the File Allocation Table filing system for instance, when a file is deleted, the file's directory entry is modified to unallocated area. The primary character of the file name is replaced with a marker, but the file information itself is left unchanged. Until it's overwritten, the info remains present. File systems overview A filing system could be a style of information store that may be used to store, retrieve, and update a set of files. It is some way within which the files are stored and named logically for storage and retrieval.2 Windows File systems: Microsoft Windows merely uses 2 forms of files system FAT and NTFS. A) FAT , which stands for \"file allocation table,\" is the simplest filing system type. It consists of a boot sector, a file allocation table, and plain storage space to store files and folders. Lately, FAT has been extended to FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32. FAT32 is compatible with Windows-based storage devices. Windows can't a create FAT32 filing system with a size of quite 32GB. B) NTFS, or \"new technology filing system,\" started when Windows National Trust introduced in market. NTFS is the default type for file systems over 32GB. This filing system supports several file properties, as well as encryption and access control.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 236Linux/Unix File systems: Linux is open source operating system. And UNIX is AN open supply package. It absolutely was developed for testing and development and aimed to use completely different concepts for file systems. In UNIX there are kinds of file systems. A) Ext2, Ext3, Ext4: This is the native UNIX filing system. Generally, the filing system is named the foundation filing system for all UNIX distribution. Ext3 filing system is simply AN upgraded Ext2 filing system that uses transactional file write operations. Ext4 is more development of Ext3 that supports optimized file allocation information and file attributes. B) ReiserFS: This filing system is intended for storing immense quantity of little files. It has an honest capability for looking out files and it enables allocation of compact files by storing file tails or little files in conjunction with information in order to not use massive filing system blocks for this purpose. C) XFS: This filing system used in the IRIX server that springs from the SGI Company. The XFS filing system has nice performance and is wide used to store files. D) JFS: This is the filing system presently employed by newest UNIX distributions. It absolutely was developed by IBM for powerful computing systems. MacOS File systems: Apple Macintosh OS uses only the HFS+ filing system, which is AN extension of the HFS filing system. The HFS+ filing system is appliedINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 237to Apple desktop products, as well as Macintosh computers, iPhones, iPods, and Apple X Server products. This filing system, in addition to files and folders, additionally stores finder information concerning directories read, window positions, etc. Various File Carving Techniques: During digital investigations, various forms of media have to be analyzed. Relevant information is found on various storage and networking devices and in storage device. Various forms of information like emails, electronic documents, system logs, and multimedia files have to be analyzed. In case of the recovery of multimedia files that are stored either on storage devices or in storage device mistreatment the file carving approach. File carving could be a recovery technique that simply considers the contents and structures of files instead of filing system structures or different meta- data, which is employed to arrange information on storage media. The below figure summarizes the file carving word. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 238The most common general file techniques are: 1.

Manisekhar Faculty Member Dept. of HRM, AU Campus Kakinada INTRODUCTION: The word \"adjustment\" came in to popular use in psychology during the 1930's and was given strong endorsement by Lawrence Shaffer's classical book \"The Psychology of Adjustment\" which was published in 1936. In his treatment of adjustment, Shaffer emphasised the biological adaptation of the organism to its environment as the central meaning of the term (Bell, 1962). The term adjustment is often used as a synonym for accommodation and adaptation. Strictly speaking, the term denotes the results of equilibrium which may be affected by either of these processes (Monroe, 1990). It is to emphasize the individual's struggle to get along or survive in his or her social and physical environment. Insects and germs, in comparison to human beings, cannot withstand the hazards of changing conditions in the environment. Man, among the living beings, has the highest capacity to adapt to new situations. Eysenck (1975) defined adjustment as a state in which the needs of the individual on one hand and claims of society on the other hand are fully satisfied. Coleman (1969) defined adjustment as the overcome of the individual's efforts to deal with stress and meet his needs. Biologists used the term adaptation strictly for physical demands of the environment but psychologists use the term adjustment for varying conditions of social or inter-personal relations in the society. Thus, adjustment means reaction to the demands and pressure of socialINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 251environment imposed upon the individual. The demand may be external or internal to which the individual has to react. (Chauhan, 1979) (Vonhaller , 1990) explained adjustment as 'psychological survival' in much the same way as the biologist used the term adaptation to describe 'physiological survival'. Every student from the beginning of the first grade until finishing college education makes a long series of adjustment between the whole unique personality and the environment. The ardent desire of each boy or girl is to become an individual person having a healthy physique, a growing intellectual ability, a greater degree of emotional poise, an increased participation in social groups and such other characteristics enhance personality. Occasionally in the use of the term 'adjustment', the implication is that the most desirable state of adjustment is one in which the individual is perfectly happy and satisfied with all aspects of life and one in which had reached the level in all contacts with environment that would be glad to persist throughout life. The best integrated and adjusted individuals would have established some reasonable goals in line with their interests, abilities and settled down to work towards those goals seriously and steadily, without unusual tensions. This implicated that adjustment means harmony between the individual and the environment. THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTMENT: Human adjustment is a never ending process (Ruch, 1970) as it starts right from the birth of the child and continues till his death. The adjustment process is a universal sequence that can be identified in the behavior of organism from the lowest species up to man. Boring (1948) says that if a paramecium (single cell animal) meets an obstruction while swimming it will backup, turn through a small angle and swim forwardINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 252again. Ray (1992) states that the question of adjustment arises when there are certain demands or requirements that must be met or when one is confronted with problems and conflicts in various fields of life those must be resolved in some way or other. One creates a world of interpersonal relations and satisfactions that contribute to the continuous growth of personality. Odera (1995) concluded that the psychological stress may be created in an individual during the process of learning how to cope with a novel situation. Kulshresta (1979) explained that adjustment is the outcome of individual effort to deal with stress and meets his needs and the adjustment process is away in which the individual attempts to deal with stress, tensions, conflicts etc, and meet his needs in this process the individual also makes efforts to maintain harmonious relationships with the environment. Adjustment is a process by which a living organism maintains balance between its needs and the circumstances, which influence the satisfaction of these needs. It is therefore, a state of harmony between the needs, activities (Boring, 1948). An individual not only adapts biologically to different kinds of physical demands and pressures but also needs to adjust psychologically and emotionally as he has to live and lead the life in interdependence with other individuals through out his life. Lazarus (1976) states that adjustment consists of the psychological processes by means of which the individual manages to cope with various demands or pressures thus, adjustment is concerned with values one can not think of adjustment without being sensitive to the good and the bad or to the right and the wrong. ADJUSTMENT AS RELATEDNESS: Adjustment is a personal matter and makes a unique adjustment. No two people have exactly the same experiences in life, nor do they haveINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 253exactly the same capacities for meeting their experiences. Each individual stamps the role with the characteristic style of his own personality. In a general way, personal adjustment is the process by which an individual applies his resources to fulfill his personal needs and maintaining harmony with the environment. An individual has been adjusted simply because he is alive. The outer forces acted on him, required him to change and deal with whatever capacities were available to him. These forces originate in his biological needs, other people and his cultural milieu. Life is a continuous interplay of such forces many of which are created by the individuals and many of which are not, but regardless of their sources they demand responses from the environment. Shaffer (1961) defined adjustment as the process by which a living organism maintains a balance between its needs and the circumstances that influence the satisfaction of these needs. Gorlow (1968) defined it as the co-ordination of the individual needs and goal seeking behavior into smoothly functioning interaction with the environment. ADJUSTMENT IN SOCIAL ASPECT: In adjustment the two crucial factors were the individual and the environment. In the study of the individual, the considerations were the heredity and biological factors, the psychological factors and the quality of socialization given to him where as the environment includes all the social factors. Adler's (1930) view that social interest may be regarded as one of the important determinants because the individual has to adjust in a social situation. How far one is adjusted can be ascertained by one's social development and adaptability to the social environment. Social adjustment requires the development of social qualities and virtues in an individual. A significant aspect of psychological adjustment is adjustment with other people. In popular usage, it is likely to regard a person as a well adjustedINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 1(2), J 2014 254person who 'gets along' with other people. Bhatnagar (1968) says that adjustment refers to harmonious relationships between the individual and environment, whereas social integration enhances efficiency, co-ordination, co-operation and communication. In simple words, adjustment is an all inclusive term meaning relationship between an individual and his environment through which his needs are satisfied in accordance with social demands. A person is said to be adjusted when he is so related to reasonably adequate environment that he is relatively happy, efficient and has a certain degree of social feeling. Dandekar (1981) has said that a well adjusted person accepts his limitations. He does not blame others for his deficiencies. He does not runaway from challenging situations. When he meets with a conflict he tries to resolve it on sound basis. Talent (1978) says that, well adjusted people are regarded as successful in the art of living. THE CONCEPT OF MALADJUSTMENT: A maladjusted person is one who shows ineffective methods of adjustment. He meets with thwarting, failures and disappointments while seeking to satisfy his needs etc. His desires or goals are not within his reach. His behavior generally shows flight from reality. For adjustment in life, the individual has to harmonize his desires with reality. If they are not, the individual becomes maladjusted. Sometimes the individual has conflicting desires, which leads to conflicts in his mind in case the individual succeeds in resolving these conflicts, he gets adjusted in his life, and if he cannot solve he becomes maladjusted. The individual can react to a conflicting situation in many ways. Some of the reactions leads to adjustment while some other lead to maladjustment. Bhatia (1965) defined adjustment as an all inclusive term meaning relationship between anINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 255individual and his environment through which his needs are satisfied in accordance with social demands. Dosajh (1982) stated that personality maladjustment is indicated not by a single symptom but by multiple symptoms. Various types of aggressive and withdrawing behaviours or a large number of nervous habits point to the fact that the individual is maladjusted. In life now and then the individual has to make new adjustments because of changing circumstances. So in new situations the individual has shown for a while, the minor symptoms of maladjustment. Such minor symptoms, such as occasional day dreams, and defense mechanisms are considered to be normal. When these symptoms become habitual, permanent and exaggerated, the individual is considered as maladjusted. Maladjustment is meant the degree of disharmony between the individual and the hostel environment (Aggarwal, 1985). Maladjustment always results from the frustration of the needs. When the university authorities are unable to provide better situations in the hostel which can enable the students to satisfy their needs, maladjustment takes place. PERSONALITY ADJUSTMENT: A number of theorists have chosen to emphasise the function of personality in mediating the adjustment of the individual. Personality consists of the varied and yet typical efforts at adjustment that are carried out by the individual (Hall, 1978). One of the major contemporary views of personality is that it is molded by the individual's efforts to meet the demands of daily living. Thus, a personality is considered to be maladjusted when the individual is unable to adapt to the requirements of the social group of which he is a member. In short, the sum of the individual's movements as he adapts himself to the environment is personality. Thorpe (1965) stated that psychologists who favour the adjustment view considerINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 256the data of personality to be valid only to the extent that they emerge from behaviour itself. O'Connell (1974) states that the term personality, seventy years ago was regarded as mental health. The concept of an average person can be treated if he adjusts to the society. In recent times also, some psychologists defined personality as adjustment which varies from individual to individual. METHODOLOGY The present study aims to examine the differences between low Socio Economic Status (SES) of urban and rural school adolescent Students of Visakhapatnam district, regarding to their Psychological Adjustment problems. The objectives of the study, selection procedure of the sample, need of the present study and the scope for further research are given in the following sections. OBJECTIVES: To examine the differences between low SES rural and urban adolescents students Psychological Adjustment. To examine the differences (gender, Class, type of school, type of family, place of stay and number of siblings) between low SES urban and rural adolescents on Psychological adjustment. To examine the influence of personal variables (gender, class, type of school, type of family and birth order) on Psychological adjustment problems in the rural sample. SAMPLE: The sample of the present study consists of 193 students (with 101 students, i.e., 52.33% of them belonging low SES urban high school adolescents and 92 i.e., 47.66% belonging low SES rural high schoolINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 257adolescents) studying 9th and 10th classes belonging to low SES urban and rural schools situated in Visakhapatnam city and Araku Valley of Andhra Pradesh. The age range of the sample is from 13 to 16 years. NEED OF THE STUDY: We felt that there is need to conduct a study of Psychological Adjustment of Low SES urban and rural Schools adolescent students. We selected some individual variables to study Psychological adjustment among low SES urban and low SES rural Telugu medium schools adolescents to know the comparison of different individual variables. Culturally Relevant Bell Adjustment Inventory (CRBAI) Culturally Relevant Bell Adjustment Inventory (CRBAI) is an adaptation of the student form of Bell Adjustment inventory (1962). It is a 179 item inventory that covers the six major dimensions of adjustment, namely Home adjustment, Health adjustment, Submissiveness, Emotionality, Hostility and masculine-femininity. Home adjustment has the highest number of sub factors i.e. 5 and each of the remaining five adjustment dimensions has 4 sub factors. Norms are provided for each of the five adjustment dimensions and for each of the 25 factorially derived sub factors. As followed by Bell (1963), percentile norms method was used to develop norms. In this method, obtained scores based on their percentile ranks are categorised as Excellent, Good, Average, Poor and Unsatisfactory. GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE: The GHQ is a 28 item self-administered questionnaire used for the detection of psychiatric distress related to general medical illness. It requires respondent's to indicate if their current \"state\" differs from his or her usual state, thereby assessing change in characteristics and not lifelong personality characteristics. The tool has been used successfully inINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 258community settings and non-psychiatric clinical settings in many countries (Lykouras et. al.1996). The GHQ 28 is one of four versions of the GHQ. The original version of the GHQ has 60 items and the three shorter versions have 30, 28 and 12 items. The GHQ-28 yields four subscales including somatic, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression. Each subscale contains 7 items in the GHQ 28 (Goldberg & Hillier, 1979). The GHQ-28 was designed from the results of a principal component analysis based on the original GHQ. PROCEDURE: First, permission was obtained from the District Education Officer (D.E.O) to collect data from Government schools and also obtained permission from the school principals/ head master. Along with the associates who were trained to administer the Biographical information sheet, CRBAI and GHQ administered the version of these forms in their class rooms during the school hours. Students were assured of the confidentiality of their answers, while administering the checklist, first the students were asked to fill in the demographic data sheet. All the instructions were clearly explained by the administrators. The administrators read aloud the items while the students are asked to read it silently and complete them. No time limit was set for completing the checklist but usually it took 30 to 40 minutes for the students to complete the form. ANALYSIS: The results of the anlysed data are presented in the following tables. The mean scores and standard deviation are calculated by applying t-test for the dimensions of CRBAI sub scale.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V ALUE:5.16 VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 259 Table 1 reveals the mean differences \"between\" Low SES urban school adolescent students and Low SES rural school adolescent students. All the dimensions of CRBAI scale are significant at 1% level, except the Masculinity/Faminity dimension. The mean scores of the rural school adolescents are higher in Home adjustment, Health Adjustment, Submissiveness and emotional Adjustment than that of the urban School Students. An examination of descriptive statistics reveals that rural school adolescent students scored high on all these dimensions of CRBAI indicating that they are experiencing more of these characteristics than the urban school adolescent students. No significant mean difference was found on Masculinity/Faminity dimension. Low SES rural school adolescent students have more problems in relation to home adjustment, health adjustment, submissiveness, emotional adjustment and hostility. Table 2 reveals that mean scores of low SES rural school 9th class adolescent students on the dimension of Home Adjustment and Health Adjustment are higher than that of low SES urban school adolescents, which shows that differences are highly significant at 1% level. Submissiveness/INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 260Assertiveness and Emotional Adjustment are significant at 5% level. No significant mean difference was found on the dimensions of Hostility and Masculinity/Faminity. An examination of descriptive analysis shows that low SES rural school adolescent 9th class students have higher mean scores than that of low SES urban school adolescent school students, which shows that low SES rural school adolescents have lesser adjustment characteristics than that of low SES urban school adolescents. The analysis presented in Table-3 reveals that mean Scores of low SES rural school 10th class adolescent students on the dimension of Health Adjustment and Emotional Adjustment are higher than that of urban school adolescents and they are highly significant at 1% level. Submissiveness has the highest mean score. Home Adjust- ment and Hostility dimensions are significant at 5% level. No signifi- cant difference was found on Submissiveness and Masculinity/ Faminity dimensions.

The dimensions of Home adjustment, Health Adjustment, Emotional Adjustment and Hostility on CRBAI scale are highly significant at 1% level, while Submissiveness is significant at 5% level. No significant mean difference was found on the dimension of Masculinity/ Faminity. An examination of the analysis shows that adolescent students of rural schools living in nuclear family have higher scores on Home Adjustment, Emotional Adjustment, Hostility and Submissiveness than low SES urban adolescent students in nuclear family which reveals that they have less adjustment than urban school adolescents INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 263The mean scores of low SES urban and rural school adolescent students living in joint family are presented in Table 5. The dimension of Masculinity/Faminity is highly significant at 1% level. This shows that low SES urban school adolescents living in joint family have higher mean scores than Adolescents living in joint family of low SES rural school. This means adolescents living in joint family of low SES urban school have higher masculine characteristics. The mean scores of the rural school adolescents living in nuclear family on the dimensions Health Adjustment and Submissiveness are significant at 5% level. No significant difference was found on the other dimensions of the CRBAI scale. An examination of the analysis shows that rural adolescent students living in joint family have got higher mean scores of Health adjustment and Submissiveness which indicates their low adjustment. Urban school adolescents have high masculinity characteristics than the rural school adolescent students who are living in joint family. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 264Table 6 presents the mean scores of nuclear family and joint family adolescents of low SES urban schools. Masculinity/faminity on the CRBAI scale are significant at 1% level indicating that the mean score of joint family is higher than that of mean score of the nuclear family. The mean score of home adjustment in joint family is higher than that of nuclear family. These results are indicating that adolescents living in joint families have higher degree of gender maladjustment characteristics. No significant mean differences were found between nuclear family and joint family on the other dimensions of Home Adjustment, Health adjustment, Submissiveness, Emotional Adjustment and Hostility on CRBAI scale with urban school adolescents. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 265The analysis in Table 7 reveals that adolescent students having 'two or more sibling have highly significant differences on the dimensions of Health adjustment, Submissiveness and Emotional adjustment on CRBAI scale at 1% level and Home adjustment is significant at 5% level. No significant difference was found in Hostility/Friendliness and Masculinity/ Faminity on CRBAI scale. An examination of the analysis shows that high mean scores had revealed low adjustment. The adolescent students having 'two or more' siblings of rural schools have less adjustment on the dimensions of Health adjustment, Submissiveness, Emotional adjustment and Home adjustment than the urban school adolescents. CONCLUSION: Low SES Urban and Rural school adolescents have significant differences on five out of six dimensions on the Culturally Relevant Bell's Adjustment inventory. Low SES Rural school adolescent students have more home adjustment, health adjustment, submissiveness problems at higher levels when compared to the urban adolescents. Low SES rural school adolescents have significantly lesser levels of adjustment characteristics than that of low SES urban school adolescents of 9th and 10th class on the dimensions of Home Adjustment, Health Adjustment, Submissiveness and Emotional Adjustment. Low SES rural school adolescents of 10th class have significantly less adjustment than that of low SES urban school adolescents on the dimensions of Health Adjustment, Emotional adjustment and Home adjustment. Low SES Adolescent students of Rural schools living in nuclear family has significantly higher scores on Home Adjustment, Health Adjustment, Emotional Adjustment, Hostility and Submissiveness than that of Low SES urban adolescent students living in nuclear family.

The te whenua (land), te reo (language), te ao turoa (environment) and whanaungatanga (extended family) are important components in Maori culture and health that are based on principles of the Treaty of Waitangi ( Department of Health.,1985). The main causes of disparities between the Maori and Pakeha mental health and well being are socio-economic status , loss of self determination, devaluation by the larger society and can be discussed in terms of impact of racism, Maori health and Treaty of Wiatangi. Maori health is described in different ways, and in precise it can be described as health holistically, to encompass more than people's physical health. It is also interconnected with physical, spiritual and mental health. The health concept of Maori are holistic and comprehensive in nature . It is emphasized on whanau health and wellbeing rather than the health of the individual (Murchie, 1984). Tapu and Noa and the ritual of Tangi are some important cultural concepts involved around the food, exercise and illness of Maori community. Maori health model: This model is based on wellness or holistic health model and explains the health as a four-sided concept representing the four dimensions of well-being of M ori INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 268a)Te Taha Hinengaro (psychological health), b) Te Taha Wairua (spiritual health), c)Te Taha Tinana (physical health) and d)Te Taha Whanau (family health) Maori health model (Ministry of health, 2013 ) At present the health concept of Maori is contextualised within\" te whenua (land providing a sense of identity and belonging), te reo (the language of communication), te ao turoa (evironment), and whanaungatanga (extended family)\" (Durie,1988 ; Public Health Commission, 1993). According to Simon et al., (2001), the Maori practices and cultural concepts are imperative to Maori health and wellbeing where as in Pakeha community , they are undermined by dominant views on health. According to Maori perceptions, healthcare system of Pakeha can be described as a legacy of past negative interactions between Maori clients and Pakeha health professionals. They include suspicions about treatment, avoidance and resistance to interact with health professionals ( Smith,1996). Their beahviour can be interpreted by some evidence of whakamaa , inINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 269terms of culturally appropriate shame or shyness (Metge ,1986) and treated in a patronising or paternalistic way(Awatere ,1984). Major Differences in the way Maori and Pakeha conceptualized mental health and well being can be discussed in terms of impacts of racism, socio economic status, Maori health and Treaty of Wiatangi. Impacts of racism: The racism can occurs at three levels like insitutionalised, personally mediated and internalized. Institutionalized racism can be explained as \"differential access to the goods , services and opportunities of the society by race\" (Jones, 2000), like medical facilities , housing , education ,and employment etc . This Institutionalized racism is described as an association between socio economic status and race of the community. This results in the form of inherited disadvantage. Institutionalized racism is manifested in differential access to power, resources and, material conditions like environment, quality of education, which are related to the health status of the community. This Institutionalized racism after many generation lead to alienation of land from Maori community. Institutionalized racism has a close association with socio economic status of the community. The initial historical insult, structural barriers, social norms, biological determinism and unearned privilege are the important factors that led to Institutionalized racism. Personally mediated racism can be described as \"differential assumptions of the abilities, motives and intents of others by police brutality , physician disrespect, and prejudice and discrimination \"(Jones, 2000).INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 270Factors like intentional and unintentional activities, acts of commission, and acts of omission, structural barriers, and some societal norms lead to personally mediated racism. The third type is internalized racism and can be described as \"acceptance by the stigmatized races of negative messages about our own abilities and intrinsic worth\" (Jones, 2000), like sell devaluation, resignation and helplessness. According to Ministry of social development (2006), there are many evidences of differential access to the determents of health or exposures leading to difference in disease incidence in Maori to Non -Maori ( i.e Pakeha) with respect to health determinants like education, employment, income , housing , income support , and health literacy . According to Howden- Chapman and Tobias, 2000 and Shaw et al, 1999, poor nutrition, over crowdedness and substandard housing , unsafe workplaces, problem gambling and bing patterns of alcohol use are the important risk factors for disease exposure in Maori community. According to Sadler et al (2004), Maori experience longer and slower pathways through health care , low hospitalization rate ,and high death rates than Pakeha community .Maori have less access to transport or resources and find more difficulty in accessing to health care for treatment and prevention of the diseases(Ministry of health, 2006a). There are many evidence that Maori received less quality of health care like screening for and treatment of ischaemic heart disease (bramley et al 2004), pain relief during delivery and child birth (ministry of health 2006a), and the diabete screening and management (ministry of health, 2005).INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 271Harris et al., (2006b) reported from a national survey in New Zealand that there is a highest prevalence of racial discrimination (34%) among Maori and they are experiencing multiple types of discrimination than other ethnic groups like PaKeha. Harris et al (2006b) also described that Socioeconomic inequalities ,and interpersonal racial discrimination are important factors the inequality of health between Maori and PaKeha Socio economic status: Disparities in health of Maori and Pakeha communities are due to dependence of health on socio economic status , socio economic status stratification in the society ,and ethnic difference in distribution in Socio economic status. The unequal distribution of wealth and poverty by ethnicity lead to ethnic differences in health status of Maori and Pakeha communities . Socio economic status is an indication of contemporary structural factors that reflect the historical injustices. A contemporary structural factor like poverty is over represented in Maori where as wealth is over represented in Pakeha. Loss of self determination: Loss of self determination is one of the causes of Maori -Pakeha health disparities. It is observed that Maori experienced a loss of self determination, because the treaty of Waitangi is not being honoured, where Maori are not involved in decision making, acting and controlling on their own behalf ( Jones, 1999). Devaluation of Maori: Devaluation of Maori community by the larger society of New Zealand is due to Maori socio economic factors. Maori are marginalized and are not considered to be important for the growth and progress of NewINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 272Zealand. Maori contributions are not given due weightage and are not included in the plan for the nation's progress and growth ( Jones, 1999). Level of health intervention: Health strategies according to the level of health intervention like curative health services at the bottom of cliff, identifying families and their children at health risks, movement away from cliff face etc., played a very important role in Maori community development ( Jones, 1999). Treaty of Waitangi : New Zealand public is poorly educated on New Zealand's colonial history, Treaty of Waitangi and past historical grievances. The settlements provided partially redress of historical grievances. The settlements do not absolve government contemporary responsibilities in the development and social services of Maori community. The Treaty of Waitangi is not achieved between the Maori and the Crown, where decision making and control of resources by Maori have not been achieved( Jones, 1999).. Conclusion: The health concept of Maori is holistic and is more than people's physical health. It emphasizes on whanau health and wellbeing rather than the health of the individual. Institutionalized, personally mediated and internalized racism has a lot impact on differential access to power, resources and, material conditions like environment, quality of education, which are related to the health status of the Maori .The other factors include socio economic status stratification, ethnic difference in distribution and unequal distribution of wealth and poverty that influence significant differential access for health care , mental health and well being, and disparities between Maori and Pakeha communities .INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V I 1(2), Harwood D,Reid P .(2004).

Kishore Kumar Professor Dept. of Agricultural Extension College of Agriculture, VellayaniDr. R. Prakash Professor and Head Dept. of Agricultural Extension College of Agriculture, VellayaniAGRICULTURE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT VIS A VIS MOBLE APPLICATIONS AND AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION KIOSKS IN KERALA Kumari. N. A. Hinduja Post Graduate Scholar Dept. of Agricultural Extension College of Agriculture, Vellayani Introduction Agriculture knowledge management helps in creating knowledge repositories, improving knowledge access, sharing and transfer and enhancing the knowledge environment in the ruralcommunities. Knowledge sharing, exchanging and dissemination are elements in a broader theme which is knowledge management. Sources of agricultural knowledge include scientific research and indigenous knowledge. After the creation, sourcing or accumulation of knowledge, the knowledge has to be disseminated to users to support the innovation process. The application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and utilization of resources in a proper manner would help in achieving higher levels of agricultural production and productivity through the dissemination of knowledge to the farming community. The Government of India and Kerala have given due importance for application of IT initiatives like developing information touch screen kiosks and mobile messages to provide information whenever required enabling farming community to take appropriate decisions in their farming practices there by acting as a decision support system.The Kiosk software is totally touch screen driven with largeINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 276icons displaying limited but focused data supported by graphics and animations. Local language is used and has very simple and clear navigational paths. Voice and text messaging of agricultural information through computers to the end users on mobile phone is a means for the farmers to receive timely information. Materials and methods This study is conducted to analyse the utility of the information support provided to farmers through the information kiosks and mobile initiatives in Kerala and constraints and solutions as perceived by the farmers while using information kiosks and mobile messages. Three seminars were conducted; of which two are in Kollam and one in Thiruvananthapuram district. ATMA farmers of Thiruvananthapuram district and LEADS (Lead farmer centred Extension Advisory Services) farmers of Kollam district who attended the seminar were contacted for the study. 60 farmers were selected through simple random sampling. A suitable well-structured pre tested interview schedule/data is prepared and administered to the respondentgroups. Results Possession of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) by farmers: Computer , internet connection,Telephone, mobile phone, Television, Radio, Cable connection, newspaper, farm magazine are administered to the respondents and were asked to tick against the information source they possess and utilise. It can be inferred from the table 1 that all the farmers of both the districts possessed telephone, and majority of the farmers of the Thiruvananthapuram district possessed mobile phone, television, radio, cable connection, and newspaper. In comparison with Thiruvananthapuram district farmers, many of the Kollam district farmersINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 277possess computers and have more internet connectivity. Farm magazines are equally underutilised by the farmers of both districts. This indicates that farmers are utilising mass media sources to a well extent and are accessing the information and communication technology tools for getting the information Attributes of ICT as perceived by the farmers: Credibility , timeliness, reliability, relevance, retrievability , adequacy, accuracy, format clarity, up-to datedness, non-duplication, cost effectiveness and interactiveness are selected as characteristics which should be possessed by ICT (Information and Communication Technology) for adoption among farmers based on experts rating. Farmers were asked to score the following attributes in order wise from highest to least which they feel as satisfied by the agricultural information kiosk and mobile messages. It can be inferred from the table 2 that credibility was ranked first, relevance was scored second, adequacy, timeliness, accuracy, interactiveness were ranked third and reliability, explicitness as fourth attributes by the Kollam district farmers. Relevance was ranked first, credibility, format clarity and up to - datedness were ranked second, timeliness, accuracy and cost effectiveness attributes were ranked third and reliability, retrievability as fourth attribute by the Thiruvananthapuram farmers. Farmer's preference of crop for information seeking: A list of twelve extensively cultivated edible crops of chill, ginger, pepper and coconut were selected and the respondents were asked to mark the crops of their preference for obtaining the information. From the table 3 it can be inferred that bananaINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 278is the only crop which is preferred by all the farmers of two districts. Rice was the second ranked crop for obtaining information and amaranthus was the third crop of preference by the Kollam district farmers. Amaranthus, bhendi were second preferred crops and third crop is rice by the farmers of Thiruvananthapuram district. Banana and rice were the two crops preferred equally by the farmers of both the districts for seeking the information and the score also indicates that the farmer's preference for gathering information for staple food crop rice is decreasing. Bhendi crop information was only preferred by the farmers of Thiruvananthapuram district. Preference of the farmers about the information seeking area of crop cultivation: Farmers seek information on vast areas related to them. Among them Varieties of crop, crop production aspects, crop protection aspects, processing and harvest, market, weather based agro advisory services, organic farming, developmental schemes, agricultural machinery, agricultural news and export based information were selected. Farmers were asked to mark the areas which are interested to them for getting information from agricultural kiosk and mobile messages. From the table 4 it can be inferred that crop protection area is preferred by all the farmers, market and organic farming by most of the farmers, Varieties of crops, crop production, developmental schemes, export based information by few number of farmers, processing and harvest, weather advisory and agricultural machinery based information were preferred by very few farmers and agricultural news was browsed by least number of farmers of Kollam district. Crop production, market information and organic farming are the most preferred areas by all the farmers, varieties of crops, development schemes and export based information were preferred by mostINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 279of the farmers andcrop protection, processing and harvest and weather advisory by few farmers and agricultural machinery related information and agricultural news were preferred by very less number of farmers of Thiruvananthapuram district. Constraints and suggestions on agricultural information kiosk and mobile SMS by the farmers: Browsing the content provided in agricultural information Kiosk and utility of mobile SMS and their adoption differs greatly among the farmers. Constraints in accessing these information sources as perceived by the farmers and various suggestions given by the farmers to make them more accessible and convenient for browsing the information is analysed. Major constraint about the agricultural information kiosk is its accessibility. Identification symptoms of diseases and of pest photographs are not clearly visible due to low picture clarity and clumsy appearance on the screen of kiosk, touch screen sensitivity is less. Mobile messages are not regular.Suggestions of the farmers are to incorporate the information on indigenous technical knowledge and innovative cost effective technologies, market information like prices of produce, online connectivity for queries,printer facility, Yield/plant Cost of fertilizers and pesticides, Local varieties, integrated pest management, organic farming practices for each crop given in the agricultural information kiosk, more number of vegetable, fruit and plantation crops; and information specific to each area. Farmers feel that one kiosk should be placed in each panchayath. Mobile SMS should be sent in the evenings and market information should be included. The text of mobile SMS should be in local language along with the voice message which is delivered in local language.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 280Conclusion Agro advisory services rendered through different ICT tools are very useful based upon the study. It is evident from the study that the farmers had preference for information through ICT in banana and amaranthus, also the information given should be possessing elemens of credibility, relevancy, format clarity and up to - datedness. Even though these ICT applications are novel and farmer preferred, there still exists a huge digital divide in terms of users and non-users, hence adequate support schemes are to be rendered through the state department of agriculture through policy support measures.

Though bank is considered to be an ancient institution just like money. Its evolution can be traced in the functions of money lender, the gold-smiths and the merchants. A bank has been often described as an institution engaged in accepting of deposits and granting loans. It can also be described as an institution which borrows idle resources, makes funds available to. It does not refer only to a place of tending and depositing money, but looks after the financial problems of its consumers. This era is the age of specialization with the changing situation in the world economy, banking functions have broadened. Financial institutions which are shaped by the general economic structures of the country concerned vary from one country to another. Hence, a rigid classification of banks is bound to the unrealistic. The ancient Hindu scripture refers to the money - lending activities in Vedic period. They performed most of those functions which banks perform in modern times. During Ramayana and Mahabharata eras also banking had become a full-fledged business activity. In other words the development of commercial banking in ancient times was closely associated with the business of money changing. In simple words, bank refers to an institution that deals in money. This institution accepts deposits from the people and gives loans to those who are in need. Besides dealing in money,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 297bank these days perform two various other functions, such as credit creation, agency job and general service. Bank, therefore is such an institution which accepts deposits from the people, gives loans, creates credit and undertakes agency work. The past decade has seen a radical shift from viewing banks as far-removed from social and environmental impacts, to recognizing banks as the fulcrum of financing, and thus a key lever for achieving sustainability. The 2003 launch of the Equator Principles and the granting of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize to microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus cemented this link. Now, banking best practice is shifting from minimizing negative impacts to advancing positive change. An ethical bank, also known as a social, alternative, civic, or sustainable bank, is a bank concerned with the social and environmental impacts of its investments and loans. Ethical banks are part of a larger societal movement toward more social and environmental responsibility in the financial sector. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 1.To analyse the Green Banking Practices in India 2.To identify the prospects of Green Banking Practices in India RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The study is conducted on basis of secondary data and these data are collected from Annual reports of various banks, news papers, journals and articles and from various websites. GREEN BANKING - A TOOL FOR ETHICAL BANKING Green is slowly and steadily becoming the symbolic colour of eco- consciousness in the world. \"Green\" as a marketing communications platform is gaining a lot of attention. Every brand will have to becomeINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 298green to some extent because the response to climate changes is critical to the survival of future generations. The word Green Banking is very common concept in the world. The approach to green banking or sustainable banking as it is also known varies from organization to organization. Green banking as a term covers several different areas, but in general refers to how environmentally friendly your bank is, and how committed to green policies these institutions are. As green initiatives flounce across the globe, many banks are taking note of this and taking action. Green banking is like a normal bank, which considers all the social and environmental/ecological factors with an aim to protect and conserve the natural resources of the environment. It is also called as an ethical bank or a sustainable bank. They are controlled by the same authorities but with an additional and extended agenda toward taking care of the Earth's environment/habitats/resources. In the wake of the financial crisis a new Global warming is a great issue in protection of hygienic society. There is high possibility of playing significant role of Green Banking in the global warming issue. The green banking concept is evolved in western countries and now is practiced in most of the countries in the world. It indicates endorsing environment-friendly practices and reducing carbon footprint from banking activities. Green banking is not just another corporate social responsibility activity; it is all about going beyond to keep the world liveable without any significant damage. Green banking that considers all the social and environmental factors is also called ethical banking. The main objective of green Banking is to ensure the use of organizational resources in favour of the environment and society. Green banking as a concept is proactive and smart way of thinking with a vision for future sustainability of our only Spaceship earth. The purpose of theINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 299green branch is to promote, both among customers and the wider public, the opportunities for investments in clean technologies and new services that are also beneficial to the environment. The following are the Green banking coverage's- 1. Sustainable Banking 2. Ethical Banking 3. Green Mortgages 4. Green Loans 5. Green Credit Cards 6. Green Savings Account 7. Green Money Market Accounts 8. Online Banking 9. Green Financing GREEN BANKING PRACTICES IN INDIA Banks as the financing agent of the economic and developmental activities of the world could also play a crucial role in promoting overall sustainable development. It is in this respect that the concept of green banking has emerged and is recognized as an important strategy to address sustainable development concerns and creating awareness among people about environmental responsibility. Green banking has two dimensions. First, the way the banking business is being done - is it paperless or not. There is often a doubt that what big impact a monthly paper statement can have. It could be enormous. Estimates for US suggest if every household were able to switch to paperless bank billing, this would save an estimated 16,500,000 trees per year or about a 46,000 acre forest, 396,000 tonnes ofINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 300CO2 a year, and 495,000 tonnes of air pollution per year and gain almost 2,145,000 tonnes of oxygen per year. There are several guidelines from the Reserve Bank on e-banking and banks are also putting sincere efforts towards adopting paperless banking. The second dimension of green banking relates to where the bank puts its money. Green Banking entails banks to encourage environment friendly investments and give lending priority to those industries which have already turned green or are trying to go green and, thereby, help to restore the natural environment. There are no specific RBI regulations/ guidelines for banks on green banking. However , in its circular on Corporate Social Responsibility, the Reserve Bank has advised banks to familiarise themselves with the issue of Corporate Social Responsibility, a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interactions with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis. They are also required to put in place a suitable and appropriate plan of action towards helping the cause of sustainable development, with the approval of their Boards. In this context, particular attention has been drawn in the circular to the International Finance Corporation Principles on project finance and carbon trading. Further, banks /financial institutions have been advised to keep themselves abreast of the developments on an on-going basis and dovetail/modify their strategies/ plans, etc. in the light of such developments. Albeit all this is voluntary on the part of the banks, the underlying objective of the Reserve Bank is to sensitise banks on the issue so that they can help contribute to this effort by playing a more meaningful role. Climate change is a noteworthy concern for India. But while the effects of climate change are increasingly a risk to the health, economy and the environment of the country, economists are also recognizing thatINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 301there are financial rewards from controlling climate change and developing a low carbon economy. Various banks in India are undertaking the corporate entrepreneurship approach to innovate and adopt green banking strategies for sustainable development of the banks. For example, ICICI Bank India recognizes that care of the environment and the larger society in which it operates is essential both from business continuity as well as a corporate citizenship perspective. IndusInd Bank, India inaugurated Mumbai's first solar-powered ATM as part of its Green Office Project campaign 'Hum aur Hariyali'. It also unveiled a 'Green Office Manual _ A Guide to Sustainable Practices', prepared in association with the Centre for Environmental Research and Education (CERE). IndusInd's new Solar ATM has replaced the use of conventional energy for eight hours per day with eco-friendly and renewable solar energy. The energy saved will be 1980 kW hrs every year and will be accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in CO2 emissions by 1942 kgs. The uniqueness of this solar ATM is the ability to store and transmit power on demand (in case of power failure) or need (time basis). In terms of costs, the savings will be substantial, approximately Rs. 20,000 per year in case of a commercial user with grid power supply. And in areas with erratic power supply the solar will replace diesel generators and translate into savings as high as Rs. 40,200 every year .

YES Bank's community development initiatives, ABN Amro Bank's (now Royal Bank of Scotland) launching of Indian Sustainable Development Fund as also the Role played by RBI in its CSR initiatives. Moreover, several banks are putting in place policies to reduce the footprint of their electrical energy consumption by implementing energy efficiency measures such as smartINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 302lighting and replacement of inefficient appliances. Additionally, they have expressed interest in procuring energy from cleaner sources if available. The majority of banks have specific policies in place to consider the environmental issues associated with energy use, purchasing, transport, recycling and waste minimization. STRATEGIES FOR GREEN BANKING IN INDIA 1. Carbon Credit Business: Under the Kyoto Protocol, all nations must reduce green house gases emission and reduce carbon to protect our environment. These emission must be certified by Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), commonly known as carbon credit. The Indian Bank may start this business as in London the business of carbon credit is around 30 billion Euros. 2. Green Banking Financial Products : Banks can develop innovative green based products or may offer green loans on low rate of interest. As Housing and Car loan segments are the main portfolio of all banks so they can adopt green loans facility. SME loans should be provided on the basis of National Environmental Policy and its certification ISO 14000. 3. Paperless Banking : All banks should take efforts to shifting on CBS or ATM platform, also providing electronic banking products and services. So there is ample scope for banks to adopt paperless or lee-paper banking. Private and foreign banks are using electronics for their office correspondence but still in PSU banks they are using huge paper quantity. 4. Energy Consciousness : Banks should take steps to install energy efficient equipments in their office, use CFL and avoid mis-utilization of these equipments. Banks have to transform this green banking in Hardware, waste Management in office, Energy efficient TechnologyINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 303products. Banks can Donate Energy Saving Equipments to school, hospitals etc. 5. Using Mass Transportations Systems : To provide common transport for groups of officials posted at one office. 6. Green Buildings : Banks should construct green buildings to protect our environment. 7. Plantation : Banks should take steps to conduct plantation program in the rainy season to save our environment. They plant trees, grass etc at local gardens, schools or colleges and shows that banks are very careful about environment. CONCLUSION The performance of an enterprise can no longer be evaluated on the basis of economic parameters alone and it needs to be integrated with environmental performance as well. Indian banks are far behind in the implementation of green banking only some of banks have initiated towards green banking. There is more scope for all banks and they can not only save our earth but can transform the whole world towards energy conscious. For effective green banking the RBI and the Indian government should play a major role and formulate a green policy guidelines and financial incentives. References 1.Shafiaul,MD.(2013).

Madni Ashraf Research Scholar Department Urdu University of Delhi New Delhi INTRODUCTION: The Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede in 'Cultures and organizations' wrote, 'what culture covers is the commonly held traditions, values and ways of behaving of a particular community. This is useful knowledge while teaching a language classrooms and it is often included in textbooks. There is another level of understanding culture. It helps in developing cultural sensitivity and cultural skills, building cultural awareness, qualities needed to deal successfully with other cultures ,and to accept people from other cultures. This is considered as an important part of language learning skills. Therefore, it can be argued that the teaching of culture in language class could include following things: Cultural knowledge, Cultural values, Cultural behavior and cultural skills. Objective of the paper: The purpose of the study was to know about the cultural differences of Korean and Indian teaching environment. In a language learning classroom, it is paramount to have an understanding of the cultural aspects of the learner so as to maximize the teaching-learning process. It is very well documented that culture plays an important role in classrooms. The motivation to write the paper came from researchers own experience of teaching Hindi to foreigners, particularly Korean students seemed confusedINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 306hesitant to participate in discussions. We observed that their perception of teaching-learning was very different as compared to Indian system of education. The study will be helpful to learner and teachers equally, as it will allow both to understand each other and thus help in maximizing the result in the classroom . Globalization has brought us closer and we can say ,our is a global village, interpersonal reaction has increased among people around the world .This is thus the time to develop the intellectual skills that will serves the tutor as well as the student. THE STUDY Present study is based on case study that we took to as creation the cultural difference that the learner admitted to have encountered on their visit to India on a student exchange programme. Total of 20 student participated in the study, with equal no. of participants from both the sexes. The participant were aged from 17-24 yrs. They had come to India to learn Hindi .Researcher can in contact with student since the former were involved in Hindi teaching as private tutor over a period of time ,the tutor found the Korean learners seems to react differently to the classroom instruction as was expected of the learners in India . The data was collected through personal interviews which were design to elicit the answer to the research question. The result though may not be representative of the overall situation in South Korea but it has basis enough to form a generalization for further worker in the area. DISCUSSION: A comparison between Korean and Indian culture provides some clues to understand and interpret Korean student's attitudes in language class which may help eliminate some misunderstanding that the IndianINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 307language teacher may have about Korean learners. Below is listed the main point that came out of study ; Difference in perception : When compared to Indian student Korean student likely to express themselves in indirect ways, even while they try to communicate their ideas. This can be attributed to the fact that they are trained to think inclusively and express themselves indirectly so as to avoid offending other .this attests for reserve attitude of Korean that has been originated from Confucian ways of thinking, in which self-control is considered the supreme asset. Students often were found trying hard while providing specific details of the thing and events. Korean have tendency to use term like 'some' or 'any' rather than accurate and specific numbers, with reference to material of self possession. This may be attributed to the traditional Korean value in which specific enumeration of material wealth is considered vulgar and uncivilized. TEAM - WORK PERCEPTION : Among Koreans; family and society rank above the individual .one difference among Indians and Korean is the way in which they write their names; Koreans write their family names first , followed by their given name , thus given importance to the family . they substitute 'our' for 'my; instead of saying \"my teacher \", \"my house \", \"my father \", they say \"our teacher\" even when the listener is not a classmate \", \"our house \" even when talking to a stranger , and \"our father \"even when the listener is not a sibling . Likewise , they do not call people by their names . but rather by their relationship or social or family roles , thus instead of calling somebody \"Bikram \", they call them \"pritam,sfather \" or \"ram ,s friend\".INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 308Influence of Korean language into English : Koreans English language speech shows interference of their first language, e.g. the observed Korean students were found to repeating the format of Korean negative questions when communicating in English . when asked \"didn't you do it\"? they responded \"yes I didn't like it\" or \"no, I like it\". They use negative and positive element in the sentence, which is wrong in English. Korean students have confusion in use of a/an/the. Word order of Korean is different from English, so they have difficulty here also Korean use simple sentences instead of complex sentences. CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR OF KOREAN STUDENT Classroom behavior is also an indication of one ,s overall attitude . it can be guess as if the learner is interested in the lesson or not .Following is a list observed classroom behavior that can be helpful to language tutor to better understand their students. 1.Some students avoid eye contact as a sign of respect to their elders and teachers. 2.Student may frown when they concentrate, not necessarily meaning that they are unsatisfied. 3.The students' speak in low tone as sign of respect rather than a lack of confidence. 4.Students are afraid to make mistakes and do not like being ridiculed in front of their classmates. 5.Students normally look down when a teacher come to them, out of respect and not because of impoliteness or unfriendlinessINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V VOLUME 3, I SSUE 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 3096.Students reply in short phrases as they feel shy to respond . while elaborating their points, their talk repetitive or unnecessary due to lack of vocabulary and their indirect way of expressing themselves 7.They avoid initiating and volunteering as it is considered too bold or showing off, thus inappropriate. 8.Some learners giggles when embarrassed or when they are unable to understand the lesson. CONCLUSION: The above difficulties that the Korean learners were found to have in learning language are not limited to Korean rather student of any nationality experience difficulty due to language difference, culture gaps and the difference between their language ability and their overall mental conditioning. To overcome these difficulty and thus promote mutual understanding between Korean learners and their language tutor so as to allow an effective teaching learning relationship, it is important to bridge the culture gap. For this to happen, effort should be made by both language tutor and thus produce a rewarding teaching learning environment. On part of teacher he should learn how to behave in certain situations. The knowledge of culture, which is also called the fifth language skill, help to develop the mindset and techniques to adapt use of language to learn about, understand and appreciate the values, ways of doing things and unique qualities of other cultures.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ISSN : 2277-7881; I MPACT FACTOR - 2.735; IC V 1(2), J ANUARY 2014 310References 1.Cho ,Byung-Eun.9(2001).
