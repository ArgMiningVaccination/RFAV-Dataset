The purpose of this study was to evaluate antibody responses and kinetics, established association with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and adverse reactions after complete vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine. A single-center prospective case series study was conducted with 112 eligible volunteers who were institutionalized elderly and health care workers with had a negative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test prior to receiving the first dose of vaccine. At least one serological antibody test after each dose of vaccine was performed. Volunteers with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before vaccination were excluded. A chemiluminescent immunoassay anti-S1 antibody assay performed a serological evaluation. Both vaccine doses elicited positive IgG antibodies 3799.0 \u00b1 2503.0 AU/mL and 8212.0 \u00b1 4731.0 AU/mL after 20 days of the first and second doses of BNT162b2, respectively. Comirnaty\u00ae vaccine induced an immune response with antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 in 100% of participants, regardless of age (Spearman rho = 0.10, p-value = 0.312), body mass index (Spearman rho = 0.05, p-value = 0.640), blood group first dose (p-value for Kruskal-Wallis test = 0.093) and second dose (p-value for Kruskal-Wallis test = 0. 268), number of drugs (Spearman rho = 0.07, p-value = 0.490), and number of chronic diseases first dose (p-value for Kruskal-Wallis test = 0.632) and second dose (p-value for Kruskal-Wallis test = 0.510). IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were intensely elevated after the second administration of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The higher the titer of anti-peptide IgG antibodies generated after the first dose of vaccine, the higher the titer generated by the second dose of vaccine (Spearman rho = 0.86, p-value < 0.001) and the total antibody titer (Spearman rho = 0.93, p-value < 0.001). Furthermore, no serious adverse effects were reported among participants, although mild to moderate adverse effects (local or systemic) were reported after both doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, being more frequent after the first dose of the vaccine. No participants showed a positive PCR. The BNT162b2 vaccine induces a robust and rapid antibody response regardless of participant characteristics. The second dose might be especially important because of the increased immunogenicity it produces and the possible temporal distancing of the interval between doses. In general, the vaccines were well tolerated.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-07-22", "cleaned_text": "Effectiveness of Comirnaty\u00ae Vaccine and Correlates of Immunogenicity and Adverse Reactions: A Single-Center Prospective Case Series [Coronavirus: /journal/vaccines/special_issues/Coronavirus_therapeutics )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01170)]. SARS-CoV-2, with devastating consequences for the health of mankind, has transformed many things in our daily lives: it has affected the way we live our leisure time, play sports, work, and socialize [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01170)]. At least 500 million cases of COVID-19 and six million deaths because of it have been reported [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01170)]. Previously the main therapies to treat the disease have been antivirals, anti-inflammatory drugs, dexamethasone, and respiratory therapy. Currently, other therapeutic strategies, including convalescent plasma therapy, monoclonal antibodies, immunoglobulin therapy, and cell therapy, have been shown to be effective against the virus. However, there is still no specific and approved option for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and further studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of current treatment strategies [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01170)]. [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01170)]. Vaccination will add another layer of protection because it is the most effective intervention to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing herd immunity among the general population [ [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01170)]. The World Health Organization (WHO) encourages vaccination against COVID-19 to stop the COVID-19 pandemic [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01170)]. According to the R0 for the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (2.5-3.5), it would be necessary to immunize 60-70% of the world population [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01170)]. However, the appearance of more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants is changing the paradigm for achieving herd immunity. Thus, with the Delta variant (R0 = 7.5-9.5) and Lambda variant (R0 10), it would be necessary to immunize more than 80-90% of the world population [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01170), For omicron BA.4/BA.5 (R0 18) [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01170)], the threshold for herd immunity against the omicron variable at 95% of the population [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01170)]. However, these immunization thresholds 80% of the population are considered \"unattainable\" by vaccination [ [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01170)]. In many countries, vaccination campaigns do not allow such high percentages of the population to be vaccinated. Furthermore, there are people who cannot be vaccinated because they suffer from some type of health problem and others who do not want to be inoculated of their own free will. [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01170)]. These vaccines cause the immune system to act against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, generating specific antibodies. Nevertheless, in SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the S protein, vaccine immunity would be compromised [ [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01170)]. [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01170)]. The formulation of the mRNA in lipid nanoparticles allows for its entry into host cells without degradation. Expression of the genetic information by the cellular machinery produces the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is displayed on the cell surface [ [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01170)]. Detection of this antigen induces an immune response against the S antigen, including both neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity, which is the basis of protection against COVID-19. Because this vaccine does not contain the whole live virus, it cannot produce disease. Naturally, the mRNA is degraded within a few days [ [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01170)]. BTB162b2 vaccine was between 90% and 100% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, with minimal adverse events, such as fatigue, drowsiness, pain at the injection site, and mild to moderate headaches [ [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01170)]. [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01170)]. On 12 April 2022, 95 million doses of COVID vaccines were administered in Spain, which meant that 39 million people, 92.5% of the population over 12 years of age, received two doses of vaccine, of which 27 million people were administered BTB162b2 vaccine [ [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01170)]. Spain's vaccination strategy, in stage one (first available doses), prioritized: institutionalized patients and the staff in nursing homes or long-term care facilities; healthcare workers who worked on the front line and treated COVID-19 patients; and non-institutionalized major dependents [ [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01170)]. Vaccine efficacy and antibody response to first and second doses of vaccine in susceptible populations and healthcare workers are crucial for the scientific community to know. Especially because of the possibility, raised in some governments, of administering a booster dose of COIVD-19 vaccine in a situation of a vaccine shortage. Therefore, there is a need to study the efficacy of vaccines in real uncontrolled conditions, especially in a clinically vulnerable and healthcare-relevant population. In this study, we reported the antibody response in health care workers and institutionalized patients, the association established between antibody titer and sociodemographic (age, body mass index), and clinical (drug treatments, chronic conditions, blood group) characteristics after vaccination with a full schedule (two doses) of BNT162b2 vaccine. In addition, adverse reactions and the association of the kinetics of antibody-mediated immunity after the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine were evaluated. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Study Design [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01170-f001)). This study was conducted following the CARE guidelines (for CAse REports) ( [https://www.care-statement.org/](https://www.care-statement.org/)(accessed on 7 June 2022)) [ [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01170)]. The temporal information of this study is depicted in [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01170-f002)as a timeline, which allows for historical and current information of this single-center prospective case series study. 2.2. Vaccination Protocol [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01170)]. In participants with no prior evidence of COVID-19, two doses of the vaccine were administered 21 days apart by intramuscular injection (deltoid) of the non-dominant arm. 2.3. Antibody Testing [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01170)]. Antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein determination was performed at three points in the assay, the day before the start of vaccination and 20 days after receiving each of the two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay allowed for the evaluation of the immunity status of the study participants (vaccinated against COVID-19) by monitoring the antibody response in individuals and quantitatively measuring IgG antibodies against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spicule. 2.4. SARS-CoV-2 Virus Diagnosis [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01170)]. RT-PCR testing was performed at 3 time points during the study, on the days before each anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. 2.5. Assessment of BNT162b2 Vaccine-Related Adverse Reactions 2.6. Data Collection [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01170-t001)). 2.6.1. Sociodemographic and Lifestyle [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01170)], adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated with a score using the 14-item questionnaire proposed by Trichopoulou et al. [ [25](#B25-vaccines-10-01170)], and self-perception of health status was assessed employing a self-made visual analog scale adapted from Gould et al. [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-01170)]. 2.6.2. Physical Fitness [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01170)]. The risk of falling was evaluated through the \"Get Up and Go Test\", a test proposed by G\u00e1lvez Cano et al. [ [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01170)], in which the time required to get up from the chair, walk to a mark located 3 m away, turn around and sit back in the chair was considered, thus assessing the agility, balance, and resistance of the participants. When the participant's time exceeded 30 s, a fall risk was considered [ [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01170)]. 2.6.3. Clinical Characteristics 2.6.4. Vaccination 2.7. Data Management and Statistical Analysis 2.8. Ethical Considerations 3. Results 3.1. Sample and Lifestyle Characteristics [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01170)]. A total of 58.5% were non-smokers; this percentage was higher in institutionalized patients (71.2%). However, regarding healthcare workers, 39.4% were smokers. The proportion of adherent patients to the Mediterranean diet according to the Trichopoulou et al. [ [25](#B25-vaccines-10-01170)] questionnaire was 10.1 \u00b1 1.8. The total sample reported 79.4 \u00b1 16.1 of self-perceived well-being, as assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) adapted by Gould et al. [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-01170)]. There were significant differences (p = 0.019) between institutionalized patients (76.9 \u00b1 1](#vaccines-10-01170-t001)). 3.2. kg/cm2 in dominant hand and the non-dominant hand respectively. Furthermore, 32.9% of the institutionalized patients were at risk assessment for falls according to the \"Get Up and Go Test\" [ [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01170)], while 6.9% were unable to perform the test due to their disability. In healthcare workers, handgrip strength was within the appropriate values [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-01170)] for their age range (30.0 \u00b1 13.7), and none were at risk of falling ( [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01170-t001)). 3.3. Clinical Description [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01170-t001)). 3.4. Vaccination Reactions [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01170-t002)and [Table 3](#vaccines-10-01170-t003)). Significant differences (p-value < 0.05) were observed in pain at the injection site between the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine ( [Supplementary 2](#vaccines-10-01170-t002)and [Table 3](#vaccines-10-01170-t003), the systemic adverse reactions for both doses, most reported by study participants, were headache (first 28.2%/second 20.7%), muscle aches or pains (first 28.2%/second 17.9%), and fatigue or tiredness (first 22.5%/second 15.0%). None of the participants reported severe systemic adverse reactions, but for the first dose 3 patients reported serious reactions for fatigue (n = 1), fever (n = 1) and headache (n = 1) and 8 patients after the second dose, reporting fatigue (n = 2), muscle aches (n = 1), joint pains (n = 3) and headache (n = 2). No significant differences (p-value > 0.05) were observed in systemic adverse reactions between the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine ( [Supplementary Material Table S1](#app1-vaccines-10-01170)). 3.6. Antibody Level [Figure 3](#vaccines-10-01170-f003)). 3.7. Associations between Antibody Titer and Participant Characteristics 3.7.1. Age [Figure 4](#vaccines-10-01170-f004)shows the correlation between the total SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies titer (quantified 20 days after the second dose of vaccine) and the age of the study participants. The correlation coefficient between titer and age (Spearman rho = 0.10, p-value = 0.312) shows a negative association, but this relationship was of very weak intensity and not statistically significant. 3.7.2. Body Mass Index [Figure 5](#vaccines-10-01170-f005)). 3.7.3. Number of Drugs and Specific Treatments 6](#vaccines-10-01170-f006)represents the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies first dose and total SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies titer after the second dose (total antibodies\u2014antibodies generated in the first dose) stratified by blood group of the participants. The volunteers (n = 106) were represented by a colored dot according to the blood group (A = blue; B = red; AB = green; O = orange). The comparison between the four blood groups was not significant for both antibody titer after the first dose (p-value for Kruskal-Wallis test = 0.093) and antibody titer after the second dose (p-value for Kruskal-Wallis test = 0.268). The four blood groups (A, B, AB, O) of study participants did not follow a defined pattern, but there was a high degree of dispersion ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-10-01170-f006)). 3.7.5. Chronic Conditions [Figure 7](#vaccines-10-01170-f007)). 3.8. Association between the First and Second Doses of BNT162b2 Vaccine Concerning SARS-CoV-2 Anti Spike IgG Antibodies Titer in Participants [Figure fit line between SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies titer after the first dose and anti-spike IgG antibodies titer for the second dose (Spearman rho = 0.86, p-value < 0.001) which showed a very strong and positive association. Thus, the higher the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies titer created in the first dose, the higher the titer in the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Furthermore, it can be seen how most of the volunteers (points below the red line which is the fit line of a perfect correlation [r = 1]) developed a higher SARS-CoV-2 anti spike IgG antibodies titer after the second dose (total antibodies\u2014antibodies generated in the first dose) than at the first dose ( [Figure 8](#vaccines-10-01170-f008)). 3.9. Association between SARS-CoV-2 Anti Spike IgG Antibodies Titer of the First Dose and Total SARS-CoV-2 Anti Spike IgG Antibodies Titer of between SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies first SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies titer. The red-colored line corresponds to the fit line of the correlation between titers (Spearman rho = 0.93, p-value < 0.001), demonstrating a positive and very strong association. In consequence, the higher the titer of SARS-CoV-2 anti spike IgG antibodies titer created in the first dose, the higher the total SARS-CoV-2 anti spike IgG antibodies titer. 4. Discussion [30](#B30-vaccines-10-01170)]. studies [ [30](#B30-vaccines-10-01170), [31](#B31-vaccines-10-01170), [32](#B32-vaccines-10-01170), [33](#B33-vaccines-10-01170), [34](#B34-vaccines-10-01170)] reported that increasing age reduces the effectiveness of an immunization against COVID-19. Likewise, Walsh et al. [ [35](#B35-vaccines-10-01170)] showed a significantly lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies titer in adults aged 65 to 85 years than in adults aged 18 to 55 years at 21 days after administration of the first dose of the vaccine. However, this difference in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies titers, between 18-55 vs. 65-85 years, was lower after 7 days of the second dose of Vaxzevria\u00ae (AstraZeneca, [ [36](#B36-vaccines-10-01170)] and Mitsunaga et al. [ [37](#B37-vaccines-10-01170)] described that the total anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer was significantly reduced in participants >60 years after the complete vaccine regimen. Furthermore, Muller et al. [ [38](#B38-vaccines-10-01170)] showed differences between the total antibody responses generated after the first and/or second BNT162b2 vaccine, with lower frequencies of neutralizing antibodies in elderly patients (>80 years). In contrast to these earlier studies, our results ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-10-01170-f004)) showed that there was no unison variation between the total SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG antibodies and the age of the participants. These findings might indicate that there was no relationship between the total IgG titer and the age of the participants. A balanced immune response of the study participants could be a plausible explanation. The volunteers have shown a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean diet contains nutrients such as polyphenols, phytochemicals, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, zinc, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin D have shown immunostimulant effects [ [39](#B39-vaccines-10-01170)]. Specifically, vitamin D plays an essential role in immune systems [ [40](#B40-vaccines-10-01170)], and vitamin D deficiency is quite common among COVID-19 patients [ [41](#B41-vaccines-10-01170)], so vitamin D administration could reduce the risk of incidence and death from COVID-19 at appropriate doses [ [42](#B42-vaccines-10-01170)]. Vitamin D supplementation improves influenza vaccine response and immune function in elderly persons [ [43](#B43-vaccines-10-01170)]. In addition, Kashi et al. [ [44](#B44-vaccines-10-01170)] reported a positive association between plasma vitamin D levels and hepatitis B antibody titer following a complete vaccination. Similarly, Vitamin D has been used as an adjuvant in Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (tuberculosis) vaccination with moderate benefits on induced immunity [ [45](#B45-vaccines-10-01170)]. In this sense, a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet could be key to improving the immune system and vaccine response [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-01170)] because vitamin D could act by modulating vaccine-induced cytokine and inflammatory messenger responses [ [40](#B40-vaccines-10-01170)]. [47](#B47-vaccines-10-01170)]. Obesity and overweight can weaken immune responses and reduce antibody production after vaccination, such as over influenza, hepatitis B, rabies, and tetanus vaccines [ [36](#B36-vaccines-10-01170)]. However, the results for the BNT162b2 vaccine are controversial. Mitsunaga et al. [ [37](#B37-vaccines-10-01170)] reported that obese participants (BMI 30) had a lower antibody titer than compared to those of normal weight. However, Pellini et al. [ [36](#B36-vaccines-10-01170)] did not confirm these results, as in our study with overweight grade II (pre-obese) participants by SEEDO criteria [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01170)]. Minimal levels of inflammation and reasonably elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines induced by adipose tissue in overweight individuals may weaken immune responses [ [48](#B48-vaccines-10-01170)]. The anti-inflammatory action of nutrients in the Mediterranean diet, more specifically, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated (-3) fatty acids, could be responsible for the beneficial effects on immune system enhancement [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-01170)]. In this sense, -3, as adjuvants, have the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [49](#B49-vaccines-10-01170)]. [50](#B50-vaccines-10-01170)]. Inadequate response to influenza or pneumococcal vaccines was observed in groups of patients with a high prevalence of chronic diseases [ [48](#B48-vaccines-10-01170), [50](#B50-vaccines-10-01170)]. Mitsunaga et al. [ [37](#B37-vaccines-10-01170)] observed that the proportion of chronic lung diseases, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, autoimmune diseases, and cancer was significantly higher in the group of participants with lower antibody titer after two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. In addition, hypertension and/or diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] > 6.5%) were significant suppressors of antibody responses. Furthermore, a high percentage of patients with hematologic malignancies who have received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine were seronegative, and seropositive patients have moderately low titers compared to healthy subjects [ [51](#B51-vaccines-10-01170)]. Contrary to previous investigations, we demonstrated that the number of chronic conditions did not influence antibody titer after the first dose and second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. [52](#B52-vaccines-10-01170)]. Intravenous infusion of convalescent plasma therapy has been proposed as an alternative for immunization of these patients. Convalescent plasma therapy was used successfully in other viral outbreaks in the 20th century [ [53](#B53-vaccines-10-01170)]. [54](#B54-vaccines-10-01170)]. Furthermore, blood group antigens could act as pathogen receptors and take part in immune cell interactions [ [55](#B55-vaccines-10-01170)]. In addition, Rh-negative patients had a lower risk of viral infection, severe disease, and mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [56](#B56-vaccines-10-01170), [57](#B57-vaccines-10-01170)]. In the context of the above, blood group-related differences in the humoral response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine might be expected. However, no differences were observed between the blood groups for antibody titer after the first dose and second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Therefore, ABO/Rh blood group system does not support a predictive model of immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 vaccine, just as ABO/Rh screening should not be used as a triage mechanism in COVID-19 [ [58](#B58-vaccines-10-01170)]. [59](#B59-vaccines-10-01170)] demonstrated that administration of the one-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine achieved 80% immunization, but it was after the two-dose that 90% of participants reached it. Conmirnaty\u00ae or Spikevax\u00ae are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, attenuated viral RNA load, risk of febrile symptoms, and duration of illness among those who had progression of infection despite vaccination [ [59](#B59-vaccines-10-01170)]. We reported no SARS-CoV-2 infection in the study volunteers from baseline to 21 days after administration of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. In addition, we have observed that the greater the IgG response after the first dose, the greater the IgG response after the second dose, and the greater the total immunogenicity. Therefore, the humoral immune response would be substantially amplified, which is key for Comirnaty\u00ae to be effective since, in respiratory infections, a higher titer of antibodies is necessary for adequate immune protection [ [60](#B60-vaccines-10-01170)] and particularly important for the revaluation of temporal distancing of the interval between doses in some vaccination strategies of the health authorities [ [61](#B61-vaccines-10-01170)]. Liu et al. [ [62](#B62-vaccines-10-01170)] reported immune sera obtained after two doses of BNT162b2 (2-4 weeks) have elevated antibody titers against different variants B.1.617.1, B.1.618 (first identified in India), and B.1.525, being especially elevated against the Delta variant B.1.617.2 lineage. Furthermore, Wang et al. [ [63](#B63-vaccines-10-01170)] have described that 8 weeks after the second dose of Conmirnaty\u00ae or Spikevax\u00ae, volunteers showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti spike IgG and IgM and RBD binding titer. In this study, Wang et al. [ [63](#B63-vaccines-10-01170)] plasma neutralizing activity and relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B lymphocytes of vaccinated volunteers were equivalent to those of individuals who had recovered from likely SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two studies in elderly adults [ [64](#B64-vaccines-10-01170)] and in aged mice [ [65](#B65-vaccines-10-01170)] showed that granzyme B stimulation following influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) booster vaccination, respectively, would provide an enhanced immune response by reactivating granzyme B CD8 T cell activity. In this way, our results indicate that Conmirnaty\u00ae, a licensed COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, was effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with the dual vaccination regimen in institutionalized patients and healthcare workers, which are two of the social groups most in need of an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19. [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01170), [65](#B65-vaccines-10-01170), [66](#B66-vaccines-10-01170), [67](#B67-vaccines-10-01170)]. In our study, the incidence of adverse reactions was higher after the first dose than after the second dose. However, other studies [ [65](#B65-vaccines-10-01170), [66](#B66-vaccines-10-01170)] reported a higher incidence of adverse reactions observed after the second dose of mRNA-based vaccine. In contrast with Kitagawa et al. [ [68](#B68-vaccines-10-01170)] and Saita et al. [ [69](#B69-vaccines-10-01170)], we showed a significant difference in injection site pain between the first and second dose. The most frequent systemic adverse reaction reported in the literature has been fatigue [ [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01170), [65](#B65-vaccines-10-01170), [67](#B67-vaccines-10-01170), [70](#B70-vaccines-10-01170)], but in our study, it was headache and joint pain. For healthcare workers who received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines [ [71](#B71-vaccines-10-01170), [72](#B72-vaccines-10-01170)], the reported side effects were like those described in our study. Therefore, pain at the injection site was the most common local side effect; in addition, others such as headache/fatigue, muscle pain, chills, and joint pain were reported as the most common side effects [ [71](#B71-vaccines-10-01170), [72](#B72-vaccines-10-01170)], as is the case in our study. However, Klugar et al. [ [72](#B72-vaccines-10-01170)] reported at least one oral side effect, including mucosal lesions, oral paresthesia, and taste disturbance, that was not reported in our study. No severe adverse reactions were reported, but three participants after the first dose and nine after the second dose reported serious grade reactions. This could be because the volunteers lacked a record of previous COVID-19 infection, which would attenuate the incidence and intensity of side effects of vaccination [ [73](#B73-vaccines-10-01170)].
