These general terms and conditions are common across a ll HHS Operating Divisions (OPDIVs)1 and apply as indicated in the HHS GPS unless there are statutory, regulatory, or award-specific requirements to the contrary (as specified in individual Notice s of Award). The HHS awarding offices are components of the OPDIVs and Staff Di visions (hereafter \"OPDIVs\") that have grant-awarding authority. This document also is designed to be useful to those interested in the HHS grants process by providing information about that process and its associated authorities and about responsibilities. The HHS GPS is available online from the HHS home page at http://www.hhs.gov/grantsnet . HHS GPS Organization The HHS GPS has four parts and an appendix, which allow general information, application information, and other types of reference material to be separated from legally binding terms and conditions: Part I: HHS Grants Process. Part I describes the OP DIVs, their role, and the roles of other HHS organizations in HHS grants; specifies recipient and HHS staff responsibilities; out lines the grant application and review processes; and explains the various resources available to those interested in the HHS grants process. Part II: Terms and Conditions of HHS Grant Awards . Part II includes generally applicable terms and conditions. This part also specifies the terms and conditions that apply to particular type s of grants, recipien ts, and activities that differ from, supplement, or el aborate on the general terms and conditions. Part III: Points of Contact . Part III lists pertinent offices and officials with their addresses and telephone numbers. Part IV: OPDIV-Specific Information and Terms and Conditions. Part IV, which supplements Parts I, II, and III for a given OPDIV, contains any OPDIV supplementary information and OPDIV-specific terms and conditions of award. This includes statutory, regulatory, or public policy requirements that apply only to that OPDIV or its programs. OPDIV-specific terms and conditions in Part IV take precedence if they conflic t with requirements in Part II of the HHS GPS. 1 As indicated under \"Applicability,\" the National Institutes of Health (NIH) maintains its own Grants Policy Statement. While the requirements of both policy statements are equivalent, the NIH GPS addresses only research and research- related matters as well as requirements that apply only to NIH. i Appendices: The appendices include all abbrev iations and a glossary of terms used throughout the HHS GPS for ease of reference. Supersession and Applicability Supersession Applicants for HHS grants and recipients ha ve historically relied on a variety of sources for information about the grants pr ocesses and requirements of HHS and its component OPDIVs. For the recipients of grants from the OPDIVs constituting the Public Health Service (PHS), the primary source of information for recipients was the Public Health Service Grants Policy Statement . This HHS GPS supersedes in its entirety the Public Health Service Grants Policy Statement , dated April 1, 1994, and addendum, dated January 24, 1995. Applicability This policy statement applies only to HHS discretionary grant programs and only to awards to organizational entities made by OPDIVs other than the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It does not apply to awards under mandatory grant programs (e.g., entitlement programs) or to awards made directly to individuals (e.g., scholarships). In 1998 (and with subseq uent updates), NIH issued its own NIH Grants Policy Statement. Until further notice, NIH will continue to issue and maintain its own Grants Policy Statement in lieu of the HHS GPS.2 Recipients are not directly subject to the requirements of HHS Grants Policy Directives and implementing HHS Grants Administration Manuals (or any predecessor OPDIV manuals), which are internal documents guiding HHS operations. If an OPDIV implements a requirement in an internal document that does affect recipients, it will not do so by citing that do cument; rather, the requirement is placed on the recipient through explicit coverage in the NoA. Cooperative Agreements The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreem ent Act of 1977, 31 U.S.C. 6301, defines the cooperative agreemen t as an alternative assistance instrument to be used in lieu of a grant whenever substantial Federal involvement with th e recipient during performance is anticipated. The differ ence between grants and cooperative agreements is the degree of Federal progra mmatic involvement rather than the type of administrative requiremen ts imposed. Therefore, statutes, regulations, policies, and the information contained in this policy statement that are applicable to grants also apply to cooperative agreements, unle ss the award itself provides otherwise. 2 This HHS GPS is issued as a preliminary step by HHS to standardize and streamline award terms and conditions. Once there are gove rnment-wide changes under the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, 31 U.S.C. 6101 note, HHS will use this document to reflect those changes. ii iii Subrecipients and Contractors under Grants The information contained in this policy statement applies directly to the primary recipients of HHS funds. The HHS GPS in dicates in Part II whether requirements must be applied to or \"flowed down\" to subawards or contracts under grants. Recipients are responsible fo r specifying those requirem ents in subawards (which includes consortium agreements) or contracts, as applicable. Effective Date This document is effective for all new, competing continuation, and non-competing continuation HHS grant and cooperative ag reement awards with beginning dates on or after January 1, 2007. This document reflects current HHS requirements as specified in 45 CFR parts 74 and 92. The information in this document is subject to change following its issuance due to changes in statutes, regulations, or policie s adopted subsequent to its effective date. To ensure that applicants and recipients are aware of changes, recipients should refer to the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations (Titles 45 and 42). These documents are available online at http://www. gpoaccess.gov/ . Conventions Certain conventions are followed throughout this document. The term \"grant\" is used to mean both grants and cooperative agreements; however, for clarity, certain sections mention both grants and cooper ative agreements. The term \"recipient\" generally is used to refer to the organiza tion to which an OPDIV makes a grant or cooperative agreement award. However, depending on the context, the terms \"grantee\" may be used rather than \"recipie nt.\" \"HHS\" may be used in this document to refer to the entire organization or to its component organizations, or else to contrast an action by an OP DIV with an action by a recipient or other organization. A reference to Part I, II, III, or IV withou t further elaboration me ans the corresponding part of the HHS GPS. Although most of the requirements in the HHS GPS apply to the covered activities of all OPDIVs, if a requirement applies more narrowly, the exception is explicitly noted. Maintenance The Office of Grants\u2014part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Resources and Technology\u2014is responsibl e for developing and maintaining this document, which will be reissued periodically. Interim chan ges will be posted on the HHS and OPDIV Web sites (see Part I). Each change, including its applicability and effective date and the affected sections of the HHS GPS specif ied, will be described, and the necessary language to implement it as a term or condition of award will be provided. The Office of Grants welcomes comments and suggestion s for future versions of the HHS GPS.

II-122 Part III: Part I: HHS Grants Process General Information This section provides information about how HHS is organized to award and administer grants and cooperative agreemen ts. This section describes the roles of organizations within HHS with responsibilities for the HHS grants process, as well as organizations external to HHS that have a role in that process. HHS is the Federal government's principal agency for protecting the health of Americans and providing essential human serv ices, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. In support of its mission, HHS awards grants under more than 300 programs, making it the largest grant-awarding agen cy in the Federal government. HHS Grant-Awarding Operating Divisions (OPDIVs) HHS grant programs are the responsibi lity of 12 OPDIVs (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1. OPDIVs with Responsibilities for HHS Grant Programs OPDIV Mission Administration for Children and Families ACF is responsible for programs that promote the economic and social well-being of children, families and communities. Administers the State-Federal welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, providing assistance to an estimated 5 million people, including 4 million children. Administers the national child support enforcement system. Administers the Head Start program, serving more than 900,000 preschool children. Provides funds to assist low-income families in paying for child care, and supports State programs to support foster care and provide adoption assistance. Funds programs to prevent child abuse and domestic violence. http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/ Administration on Aging AoA supports a nationwide aging network, providing services to the elderly, especially to enable them to remain independent. Supports close to 240 million meals for the elderly each year, including home-delivered \"meals on wheels.\" Helps provide transportation and at-home services. Supports ombudsman services for the elderly, and provides policy leadership on aging issues. http://www.aoa.dhhs.gov Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ supports research to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. http://www.ahrq.gov Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation The ASPE is the principal advisor to the Secretary of HHS on policy development and is responsible for major activities in policy coordination, legislation development, strategic planning, policy research, evaluation, and economic analysis. http://aspe.hhs.gov/_/index.cfm I-1 Exhibit 1. OPDIVs with Responsibilities for HHS Grant Programs OPDIV Mission Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Working with States and other partners, CDC provides a system of health surveillance to monitor and prevent disease outbreaks (including bioterrorism), implement disease prevention strategies, and maintain national health statistics. Provides for immunization services, workplace safety, and environmental disease prevention. Working with the World Health Organization, CDC also guards against international disease transmission, with personnel stationed in more than 25 foreign countries. CDC helps prevent exposure to hazardous substances from waste sites on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List, and develops toxicological profiles of chemicals at these sites through the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. http://www.cdc.gov Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which provide health care to about one in every four Americans. Medicare provides health insurance for more than 41 million elderly and disabled Americans. Medicaid, a joint Federal-State program, provides health coverage for some 44 million low-income persons, including 19 million children, and nursing home coverage for low-income elderly. CMS also administers the State Children's Health Insurance Program that covers more than 4.2 million children. http://www.medicare.gov, http://www.cms.gov Food and Drug Administration FDA ensures the safety of foods and cosmetics, and the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals, biological products, and medical devices, products which represent almost 25 cents out of every dollar in U.S. consumer spending. http://www.fda.gov Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA provides access to essential health care services for people who are low-income, uninsured, or live in rural areas or urban neighborhoods where access to or availability of health care is limited. HRSA-funded health centers provide medical care to more than 13 million patients each year at more than 3,600 sites nationwide. HRSA also helps prepare the nation's health care system and providers to respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies, is responsible for the National Health Service Corps, and helps build the health care workforce through many training and education programs. HRSA administers a variety of programs to improve the health of mothers and children and serves people living with HIV/AIDS through the Ryan White CARE Act programs. HRSA also oversees the nation's organ transplantation system. http://www.hrsa.gov Indian Health Service IHS is the principal Federal health care provider and health advocate for Indian people, and its goal is to raise their health status to the highest possible level. http://www.ihs.gov National Institutes of Health NIH is the world's premier medical research organization. Its mission is to improve human health by increasing scientific knowledge related to disease and health. NIH carries out its mission through the conduct of intramural and extramural support of biomedical and behavioral research, research training, research infrastructure, and communications. NIH makes extramural awards though its Institutes and Centers. http://www.nih.gov I-2 Exhibit 1. OPDIVs with Responsibilities for HHS Grant Programs OPDIV Mission Office of Public Health and Science OPHS is located within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, who is the primary adviser to the Secretary, HHS on matters involving the nation's public health and oversees the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS). OPHS includes several offices\u2014Office of Minority Health, Office of Population Affairs, and Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. http://www.osophs.dhhs.gov/ophs/ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA works to improve the quality and availability of substance abuse prevention, addiction treatment, and mental health services. Provides funding through block grants to States to support substance abuse and mental health services, including treatment for more than 650,000 Americans with serious substance abuse problems or mental health problems. Helps improve substance abuse prevention and treatment services through the identification and dissemination of best practices. Monitors prevalence and incidence of substance abuse. http://www.samhsa.gov There are several references throughout the HHS GPS to \"PHS OPDIVs.\" Unless otherwise specified for a specific requirem ent, the PHS OPDIVs include the following: AHRQ, CDC, FDA, HRSA, IHS, OPHS, an d SAMHSA. NIH also is a PHS OPDIV; however, the requirements that apply to NIH grants are included in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. Types of HHS Financial Assistance Programs HHS financial assistance programs refl ect a breadth of programmatic activity, consistent with the mission of each OPDIV. Activities are carried out under a variety of types of grants as well as by use of cooperativ e agreements. HHS generally classifies its financial assi stance programs in two major categories of grants\u2014 discretionary and mandatory. Discretionary grants are those for which the OPDIV may exercise judgment (\"discretion\") in dete rmining the recipient and the amount of the award. Discretionary grants may be further categorized by purpose (for example, research, training, services, construction, and conference support). Generally such awards are made following a competitive pr ocess. Mandatory grants are those that an OPDIV is required to award if the recipient (usually a State) submits an acceptable plan or application and meets th e statutory and regulatory eligibility and compliance requirements for the program. Mandatory grants include block grants and entitlement grants. When an OPDIV expects to be substantially involved in carrying out the project/program, it awards a cooperative ag reement rather than a grant. Substantial involvement pertains to programmatic involvement rather than administrative oversight. These distinctions help in determining the appropriate relationship between the OPDIV and the recipient and in determining which governin g requirements apply. In general, discretionary grants are sub ject to more detailed programmatic and administrative requirements than block grants, which a fford States a significant degree of programmatic and administrative discretion within broad guidelines. However, even within discretionary grants , a range of potential requirements may I-3 apply depending on the type of recipi ent and the nature of the programmatic activity. For example, diffe rent requirements apply to university-based research grants than to community-based services grants. The applicable requirements are communicated to potential recipients as part of the funding opportunity announcement process and also are observed as part of the award and post-award administration processes. Sources of Requirements This policy statement is based on generall y applicable public laws and Executive orders, OMB circulars and the HHS implem entation of them, and HHS-specific policies and procedures applicable to discretionary grants and cooperative agreements. Among these are the regulati ons that implement OMB Circular A-102 (applicable to grants to State, local, and Indian tribal governments) and OMB Circular A-110 (applicable to grants to instit utions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations), reissued as 2 CFR part 215, and OMB circulars incorporated in them\u2014the OMB cost prin ciples and single au dit circular. These regulations are codified at 45 CFR part 74 3 (Uniform Administrative Requirements for Awards and Subawards to Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, Other Non-Profit Organizations, and Commercial Orga nizations) and 45 CFR part 92 (Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State, Local, and Tribal Governments). Th ese requirements provide the framework for the terms and conditions of OPDIV awards as specifie d in Part II and appl y generally; however, where applicable, differences based on grant purpose or type of recipient will be highlighted. In addition, gr ants are awarded and admini stered under a variety of programmatic authorities (established in statute and program regu lations) and under OPDIV and award-specific re quirements. Part II also a ddresses the relationship among these differing types of requirements . Part IV includes OPDIV requirements that differ from those in Part II of the HHS GPS. The NoA includes any requirements that are specific to that award. Roles and Responsibilities HHS, as a Federal grantor agency, is respon sible to Congress and the U.S. taxpayer for carrying out its mission cost-effectively and in compliance with applicable requirements. HHS seeks to ensure integrity and accountability in the award and administration of grants by relying on a system of checks and balances and separation of responsibilities within its own staff and by establishing a similar set of expectations for recipient organizations. The recipient's roles and responsibilities have assumed greater importance as HHS has shifted to increased reliance on systems compliance and provided greater decision-making author ity to recipients. 3 Currently, the HHS implementation of OMB Circular A-110 continues to be 45 CFR part 74 even with the publication of A-110 in Title 2 of the CFR (2 CFR part 215). I-4 The following sections highlight the major functions and areas of responsibility of Federal and recipient office s and staffs. HHS recognizes that additional staff members in a number of different organizations may be involved in grant-related activities; however, this section details only the major participants representing the Federal government and the recipient. Roles and Responsibilities of OPDIV Staff Members and Other HHS Offices The roles and responsibilities of HHS participants are as follows: Grants Management Officer. The GMO is the OPDIV official whose name appears on the NoA and is the offi cial responsible for the business management and other non-programmatic aspects of an award. These activities include, but are not limited to, evaluating grant applications for administrative content and complianc e with statutes, regulations, and guidelines; negotiating awards; prov iding consultation and technical assistance to applicants and recipients, including interpretation of grants administration policies and provisions ; and administering and closing out grants. The GMO is the focal point for receiving and acting on requests for prior approval or for changes in the terms and conditions of award. The GMO is the only official authorized to ob ligate the OPDIV to the expenditure of Federal funds or to change the fund ing, duration, or other terms and conditions of an award. OPDIVs may have one or more GMOs with responsibility for particular programs or awards. The GMO works closely with his or her counterparts at the recipient organization and wi th the designated HHS PO. Grants Management Specialist. The GMS is an OPDIV employee with assigned responsibility for the day-to-day manageme nt of a portfolio of OPDIV grants. The GMS performs many of the activities described above on behalf of the GMO and usually is the primary point of contact for the recipient when dealing with grant-related issues. Project Officer/Program Official. The PO is the OPDIV official responsible for the programmatic, scientific, and/or tec hnical aspects of assigned applications and grants. The PO's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, development of programs to meet the OPDIV mission; preparation of funding opportunity announcements; provision of programmatic technical assistance; post-award monitoring of project/program performance, including review of progress reports and making site visits; and other activities complementary to those of the GMO. The PO and the GMO work as a team in many of these activities. I-5 Review Administrator. In some OPDIVs, RAs manage application review activities for discretionary grants. Th e RA, who may be an employee of the funding OPDIV, another OPDIV that provides review services, or a contractor, reviews applications for completene ss and conformity to requirements; ensures that an adequate number of reviewers with appropriate expertise is available for application review; and assigns applications to individual reviewers. Other HHS Functions. In addition to the GMO and PO, an applicant or recipient may be required to interact with other HHS staff members or offices with respect to its organization-wide sy stems and/or individual transactions. These include the office responsible for negotiating indirect cost rates (known as \"facilities and administrative costs\" for some organizations) and research patient care rates, typically the responsible4 DCA office or NIH's DFAS; the HHS OIG; the Assistant Secretary for Resources and Technolo gy's Division of Financial Systems, Payment Integrity, and Audit Resolution; OHRP; OLAW; DPM; and ORI. Staff members in these offices generally coordinate with the GMO on grant-related matters, but they are responsible for discrete areas of specialization and are not required to channel their communications with the applicant or recipient through the GMO. Part III of this policy statement includes a list of these organi zations and contact information. Roles and Responsibilities of Recipients and Their Principals HHS grant awards generally are made to or ganizations. The organization is legally accountable for the performance of the aw ard and the expendit ure of funds. The roles and responsibilities of designated individuals at recipient organizations, who serve as agents of the re cipient, are as follows: Authorized Organizational Representative. The authorized organizational representative is the designated repr esentative of the applicant/recipient organization with authority to act on the organization's behalf in matters related to the award and administrati on of grants. In signing a grant application, this individual agrees that the organization will assume the obligations imposed by applicable Federal statutes and regulations and other terms and conditions of the award, in cluding any assurances, if a grant is awarded. These responsibilities include accountability both for the appropriate use of funds awarded and the performanc e of the grant-supported project or activities as specified in the approved application. Al though HHS requires that the recipient organization designate such an individu al, HHS does not specify the organizational location or full set of responsibilities for this individual. Principal Investigator/Program or Project Director. The PI/PD is the individual, designated by the recipient, responsi ble for the scientifi c, technical, or programmatic aspects of the grant and for day-to-day management of the project or program. The PI/PD generall y is an employee of the recipient. However, because the grant, if aw arded, is made to the recipient organization, if the PI/PD is not an employee of that organization, the organization must have a formal written agreement with the PI/PD that specifies an official relationship between the parties even if the relationship 4 The responsible DCA office generally is de termined on the basis of geographical location. I-6 does not involve a salary or other form of remuneration. If the PI/PD is not an employee of the applicant organization, the OPDIV will assess whether the arrangement will result in the organization being able to fulfill its responsibilities under the grant, if awarded. The PI/PD is a member of the recipi ent team responsible for ensuring compliance with the financial and administrative aspects of the award. This individual works closely with designated official s within the recipient organization to create and maintain ne cessary documentation, including both technical and administrati ve reports; prepare justifications; appropriately acknowledge Federal support in publications, announcements, news programs, and other media; and ensure compliance with other Federal and organizational requirements. The PI/PD is encouraged to maintain contact with the PO with respect to the scient ific, technical, or programmatic aspects of the project or program and, as applicable, the GMO concerning the business and administrative aspects of the award. Organizations receiving HHS grant funds, wh ether such funds are received directly from an OPDIV, indirectly under a contra ct, subaward, or as student assistance under a training grant, are responsible for and must adhere to all applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and policies, including income tax regulations. Questions concerning the applicability of income tax regulations to grant funds should be directed to the IRS. Organizations also are expected to be in compliance with applicable State and local laws and ordinances. Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Anyone who becomes aware of the existenc e (or apparent existence) of fraud, waste, or abuse related to HHS grants or use of grant funds should report this information to HHS. The HHS OIG provides several means, including toll-free numbers, for this purpose. The OIG hotlin e may be reached by telephone at 1-800- HHS-TIPS (1-800-447-8477) or TTY at 1- 800-377-4950; by fax at 1-800-223-8164; by e-mail at HHSTips@oig.hhs.gov ; or by mail at Office of the Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Servic es, Attn: HOTLINE, 330 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20201. Fraud, waste, and abuse includes, but is not limited to, embezzlement, misuse, or misappropriation of grant funds or property, and false statements, whether by organizations or individuals. Examples are theft of grant funds for personal use; using funds for non-grant-related purposes; theft of federally owned property or property acquired or leased under a grant; charging inflated building rental fees for a building owned by the recipient; submitting false financial reports; and submitting false fi nancial data in bids submitted to the recipient (for eventual payment under the grant). Callers are not required to give their names and, if they do, their identities are kept confidential. Contact information for the OIG and the OIG hotline also is included in Part III of this policy statement. In additi on, some OPDIVs have a designated point of contact within the OPDIV for receiving information from third parties about administrative or programmatic concerns rela ting to an application or award. These contacts may be found in Part IV or on the OPDIV's Web site. The Federal government may pursue administra tive, civil, or criminal action under a variety of statutes that relate to fraud and false statements or claims. Even if a grant is not awarded, the applicant may be subject to penalties if the information I-7 contained in or submitted as part of an application, including its certifications and assurances, is found to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent. The Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act of 1986, 31 U.S.C. 3801 et seq ., provides for the imposition by HHS of civil pena lties and assessments against people who knowingly make false, fictitious, or mislea ding claims to the Federal government for money, including money representing grants, loans, or benefits. A civil penalty of not more than $5,000 may be assessed for each such claim. If a grant is awarded and payment is made on a false or fraudulent claim, an assessment of not more than twice the amount of the claim, up to $150,000, may be made in lieu of damages. Regulations at 45 CFR part 79 specify the process for imposing civil penalties and assessments, including hear ing and appeal rights. The Criminal False Claims Act, 18 U.S. C. 287 and 1001, provides for criminal prosecution of a person who knowingly make s or presents any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements, repr esentations, or claims ag ainst the United States. Violations carry a maximum sent ence of 5 years imprisonment (or 8 years for offenses involving international or domestic terrorism) and/or a fine. The Civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729( a), provides for imposition of penalties and damages by the United States, through civil litigation, against any person who knowingly makes a false or fraudulent claim for payment, makes or uses a false record or false statement to get a false claim paid or approved, or conspires to defraud the Federal government to get a fa lse claim paid. A \"fal se claim\" is any request or demand for money or property made to the United States or to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient, if the Federal government provides or will reimburse any portion of the funds claime d. Civil penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 may be imposed for each false claim, plus dama ges of up to three times the amount of the false claim. Part II of this policy statement addresses the administrative remedies included in 45 CFR parts 74 and 92 that the Federal govern ment may use after award if a recipient deliberately withholds information, submits fraudulent information, or does not comply with applicable requirements. Thes e remedies include recovery of misspent grant funds. Paperwork Reduction Act OMB clearance is required for OPDIV \"information collections.\" An information collection occurs when iden tical questions are posed to , or identical reporting, recordkeeping, or disclosure requiremen ts are imposed on, 10 or more people, whether the collection is mandatory, voluntary, or required to obtain or retain a benefit. All application or reporting form s, whether paper or electronic, that an OPDIV requires an applicant or recipient to complete and submit must receive OMB approval before the OPDIV may collect the information. Information collection under a cooperative agreement award or a grant award, under specified conditions, also requires OMB clearance. See Part II of this policy statemen t for OMB clearance requirements under the PRA. I-8 Sources of Information about HHS Grant Processes and Programs The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance is a government-wide publication available to members of the public that can be used to obtain general information about assistance programs. It is updated tw ice a year. A listing of current entries in the CFDA is available at http://www.cfda.gov/ . HHS programs are found under the prefix 93.XXX. Grants.gov FIND is a government-wide source of information about specific funding opportunities. HHS uses detailed funding opportunity announcements to invite applications for specific funding opportuni ties. Synopses of these announcements are posted at Grants.gov FIND. The \"Applicatio n and Review Processes\" section of this policy statement provides information abou t Grants.gov FIND and the types of HHS funding opportunity announcements. HHS and its individual OPDIVs maintain a number of information resources about their grant programs and activities that can be accessed throug h their Web sites. Some are descriptive materials that enable interested parties to learn about OPDIV grant initiatives, funding opportunities, and proposed and actual policy changes. Others provide historical data. This information is updated periodically. The HHS Web site address for grant-related materials and links to OPDIVs is http://www.hhs.gov/grantsnet/ . Application and Application Review Processes This section provides an overview of the following: Funding opportunity announcements Types of entities generally eligible to receive grants Types of applications The application submission process (including application forms, application receipt points and deadlines, and use of information in applications) The objective review of applications. Several of these areas also pertain after aw ard. For example, an organization must remain eligible in order to continue to receive funding. In addition, post-award changes may invoke requirements that in this section are identified as \"application\" requirements, e.g., undertaking an activity not contemplated at the time of award that might affect a historic property. Grants.gov and Funding Opportunity Announcements It is HHS policy to maximize competition for discretionary grants to the greatest extent practicable. As such, OPDIVs pr omote the widest and earliest possible dissemination of information for potential applicants concerning the availability of competing funding opportunities. A synopsis of each new competing funding opportunity is posted at Gran ts.gov FIND. Grants.gov FIND (http://grants.gov/applicants_grant_opportunities.jsp) is a government-wide I-9 electronic site that includes, in a single place, postings of available Federal grant and other financial assistance oppo rtunities. Each synopsis includes a brief description of the funding opportunity, eligibility requirements, cost sharing or matching requirements, application deadline date, and other information that allows a potential applicant to determine whether it wants to read the funding opportunity announcement to obtain further details about the funding opportunity. All HHS funding opportunity announcements follow the standard government-wide format and must be available on the Internet. 5 Each synopsis is required to provide an electronic link to the full funding opportunity announcement. For HHS, that link may be to the OPDIV or a program Web site, the Federal Register , or the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts . An OPDIV also may choose to issue a notice in the Federal Register that indicates the availability of the funding opportunity announcement and its location (e.g., directing the reader to the OPDIV or program Web site). In addition, if the OPDIV can identify all eligible applicants, the OPDIV may send the funding opportunity announcement directly to each eligible organization (generally the business office with a copy to the PI/PD) . This may be the case if a competition is limited to a certain class or group of eligible organizations (see \"Eligibility\" below); for example, a program may be limited, by statute, to States, or a funding opportunity may be limited to incumbent recipients, based on a justified limitation of competition. Synopses/funding opportunity announcements generally will allow applicants a minimum of 30 days to prepare and submit applications. There are several types of au thorized exceptions to the requirements for use of Grants.gov FIND, Internet posting of an announcement, and/or the maximum time to prepare an application. The authorization is provided on a case-by-case basis according to an internal HHS justification process. The recognized exceptions include applications for single-source aw ards and urgent applications. A single-source application is one resulting from an OPDIV request to only one applicant. Urgent applications are ones re quired to fulfill immediate needs such as public health needs after a natural disaster. For urgent awards, which may be made on a single-source or limited-competition basis, OPDIVs are required to allow the maximum feasible time for application preparation. Because single-source (including urgent single-source) applications do not represent competitive funding opportunities, information about them is not posted at Grants.gov FIND. When an awarding office anticipates making a single-source award, the OPDIV is required to publish in the Federal Register a notice of its intent to make the award prior to or simultaneous with issuance of the award. 5 The standard government-wide format was promulgated by the Office of Federal Financial Management, OMB, on June 23, 2003 (68 FR 37370). I-10 Eligibility Authorizing legislation and governing programmatic regulations specify eligibility for individual grant programs. In general, HHS grants may be awarded to domestic public or private, non-profit or for-profit organizations.6 Eligible organizations may include State, local, and Indian tribal governments; institutions of higher education; other non-profit organizations (including faith-based, communit y-based, and tribal organizations); and hospitals. In some cases, grants also may be made to foreign or international organizations. Eligibility for a particular funding opportunity announcement is specified in the Grants.g ov FIND synopsis, with more detailed eligibility information found in the funding opportunity announcement. On the basis of a statute or regulation or a limitation, with appropriate justification, described in a funding opportunity announce ment, an OPDIV may limit eligibility to, or exclude from eligibility, classes or type s of entities. Examples are limitations on the participation of foreign entities, and programs under which only small businesses are eligible applicants. In addition to organizational eligibility, an OPDIV may include responsiveness criteria in a funding o pportunity announcement. Responsiveness criteria are objective criteria, such as po ssessing a particular certification or, if specified by the OPDIV, not exceeding a st ated page limitation. These are sometimes called \"go-no-go\" criteria. The applicant may be required to provide proof of its status by submitting documentation. For non-profit entities, ex cept where the grant program's authorizing statute sets particular limits, acceptable evidence of eligibility includes the following: A copy of a currently valid Internal Revenue Service tax exemption certificate A statement from a State taxing body , State attorney general, or other appropriate State official certifying that the applicant organization has a non- profit status A certified copy of the organization's certificate of incorporation or similar document that clearly establishes non-profit status Any of the above proof for a State or national parent organization and a statement signed by the pare nt organization that the applicant organization is a local non-profit affiliate. Any requirements, such as citizenship, affecting the eligibility of the PI/PD or others (e.g., trainees) will be specified in the funding opportunity announcement (which may provide a link or reference to another document in which th e requirements are found). For example, for career awards, the in dividual to be trained must be a citizen or a non-citizen national of the United States or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the ti me of award. A non-citizen national is a person who, although not a citizen of the United States , owes permanent allegiance to the United States. They generally are individuals born in U.S. outlying possessions (American Samoa and Swains Island) 6 Section 1611 of Title 2 of the U.S.C. prohibits non-profit entities organized under (501)(c)(4) of the Intern al Revenue Code that enga ge in lobbying activities from receiving Federal grants. I-11 on or after the date of formal acquisition of the possession, or to parents who are non-citizen nation als and have had a residence in the United States or one of its outlying possessions before the birth of that individual.7 In most cases, individuals are required to have the appropriate citizenship status when the award is made rather than when the application is submitted. For research grants, the applicant is required to determine that individuals identified as key personnel possess visas that wi ll allow them to remain in this country long enough for them to be productive on the resear ch project. Recipien t organizations are expected to have policies, consistently applied regardless of the source of funds, to address this area. If a grant is awarded and an individual's visa will not allow a long enough stay to be productive on the pro ject, the grant may be terminated. Trainees must have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time of appointment. This must be documented by the individual's possession of an alien registration receipt card I-151 or I-551. In dividuals on temporar y or student visas are not eligible to receive traini ng grant (or fellowship) support. Upon receipt of applications, the awarding office performs an initial screening for eligibility. Unless an applicant is required to submit proof of eligibility, the authorized organizational representative's signature on the application generally serves as assurance that the applicant is eligible to apply for and receive an award (e.g., a small business applying under the SBIR or STTR programs). However, an awarding office may independently verify the applicant's status. If an applicant is found to be ineligible or if the applicant or application does not meet published responsiveness criteria, the OPDIV will return the application without further review. If a grant is awarded, in the post-award phase, the OPDIV monitors changes in recipient and project status to ensure continued eligibility. 7 Title 8 Section 1101(a)(29) of the U.S.C. includes an additional criterion that is not applicable to this eligibility determination. I-12 Suspension and Debarment HHS regulations published in 45 CFR part 768 implement the government-wide debarment and suspension requirements for HHS's non-procurement transactions. \"Non-procurement transactions\" include gr ants and cooperative agreements (as well as scholarships, fellowships, and loans). Organizations or in dividuals that are suspended, debarred, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from eligibility for covered transactions by any Federal department or agency cannot, during the period of suspension, debarment, or exclusion, receive HHS grants or be paid from HHS grant funds, whether under a primary or lo wer-tier transaction. Because individuals who have been debarred, suspended, de clared ineligible or who have been voluntarily excluded from co vered transactions may not receive Federal funds for a specified period of time, charges made to HHS grants for such individuals (e.g., salary) are unallowable. Applicants are required to disclose if any of the following conditions apply to them or their principals, including PIs and other key personnel: Within the 3-year period preceding the application, they have been convicted of, or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: h fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) transaction or contract under a public transaction; h violation of a Federal or State antitrust statute; h embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification, or destruction of records; or h false statements or receipt stolen property. They are presently indicted or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State, or local) with commission of any of the offenses enumerated above. Within a 3-year period preceding the a pplication, they have had any public transaction (Federal, State, or loca l) terminated for cause or default. Disclosure of unfavorable information will not necessarily cause an OPDIV to return an application. If the applicant discloses unfavorable information, the application still may undergo objective review (see \"Objective Review of Applications\" in this section). If appropriate, the OPDIV will consider the information as part of the determination of whether to award a grant. The OPDIV also will consider any additional information or ex planation that an applicant elects to submit with the disclosed information. If an awarding office makes an award and later determines that the recipient failed to disclose relevant information, the OPDIV may void the award, terminate the award for material failure to comply with the terms and 8 Consistent with the OMB guidance on deba rment and suspension in 2 CFR part 180, the regulations at 45 CFR part 76 will be superseded, for HHS, by 2 CFR part 376. I-13 conditions of the award, or pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and debarment. In addition to reviewing any information submitted by the applicant, the GMO will determine whether the applicant is included on the Excluded Parties Listing System maintained by GSA. 9 This system is a centrally maintained government-wide database that includes the names of orga nizations and individu als that have been debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or been voluntarily excluded; the reasons for that status; and the duration of that status. A variety of \"lower-tier\" transactions also are subject to these requirements. Contracts (including individual consulta nts) under grants (where the contract requires the provision of goods or services that will equal or ex ceed $25,000) and all subawards (including consortium agreements ) also are subject to these suspension and debarment rules. A recipient is required to comply with the requirements of 45 CFR 76.300 through 76.365 as a condition of its award from HHS. The recipient must include a requirement in any covered transaction at the next lower tier to comply with those same regulatory provisions. On e of those provisions is that, before entering into a covered transaction, the reci pient or lower-tier participant must verify that the entity is not suspended or debarre d or otherwise excluded. This requirement extends to trainees under an institutional training grant before their appointment. This verification may be accomplished by checking the Excluded Parties Listing System, collecting a certification from the organization or individual, or adding a clause or condition to the covere d transaction with that entity. Delinquency on Federal Debt Any organization or individu al that is indebted to th e United States, and has a judgment lien filed against it for a debt to the United States, is ineligible to receive a Federal grant. Applicants are required to indicate in their applications if they are delinquent on any Federal debt. If the applicant discloses a delinquency, HHS may not award the grant until the debt is satisfied or satisfactory arrangements are made with the agency to which the debt is owed. In addition, once the debt is repaid or satisfactory arrangements made, an OPDIV will continue to take that delinquency into account when determining whether th e applicant would be responsible with respect to an HHS grant, if awarded. Anyone who has been judged to be in defa ult on a Federal debt and who has had a judgment lien filed against him or her should not be listed as a participant in an application for an HHS grant until the judgm ent is paid in full or is otherwise satisfied. No funds may be rebudgeted follo wing an award to pay such an individual. The OPDIV will disallow costs charged to awards that provide funds to individuals in violation of this requirement. 9 The information contained in the Excluded Parties Listing System is available in printed and electronic formats. The printed version is published monthly. Copies may be obtained by purchasing a yearly su bscription from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington , DC 20402, or by calling the Government Printing Office Inquiry and Order Desk at 202-783-3238. The electronic version can be accessed on the Internet ( http://www.epls.gov ). I-14 Lobbying Applicants for (and recipients of) Federal grants, cooperative ag reements, contracts, and loans are prohibited by 31 U.S.C. 1352, \"Limitation on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions,\" from using appropriated Federal funds to pay any pe rson for influencing or attempting to influence any officer or empl oyee of an agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress with respect to the award, extension, continuation, renewal, am endment, or modificati on of any of these instruments. These re quirements are implemented for HHS in 45 CFR part 93, which also describes types of activiti es, such as legislat ive liaison activities and professional and technical services that are not subject to this prohibition. Applicants for HHS grants with total cost s expected to exceed $100,000 are required to certify that they have not made, and will not make, such a prohibited payment; will be responsible for re porting the use of non-appropriated funds for such purposes; and will include these requirements in co nsortium agreements, other subawards, and contracts under grants that wi ll exceed $100,000 and will obtain necessary certifications from those cons ortium participants and contractors. Disclosure reporting is required after award as indicated in Part II of this policy statement. Application Process Types of Applications and Letters of Intent Under the project period system, a project may be approved for a multi-year period, but generally is funded in annual increments known as \"budget periods.\" This system provides the recipient with an indication of the OPDIV's intent to non-competitively fund the project during the ap proved project period as long as required information is submitted, funds are available, and certain criteria are met. For some types of projects, e.g., construction, an award covering multiple years is issued at the outset at the fully funded amount. HHS uses the following types of applications and requests for funding under the project period system: New Application\u2014a request for financial assistan ce for a project or activity that is not currently receiving support, which must compete for support unless justified as a single-source application. Competing Continuation Application\u2014a request for funding to renew, by one or more additional budget periods (described as a \"c ompetitive segment\"), a project period that would otherwise expire. This type of application is sometimes referred to as \"renewal.\" These applications must compete for support in the same manner as new applications. Supplemental Application\u2014a request for an increase in support in a current budget period for expansion of the scope of the approved project or program I-15 or to meet an unforeseen increase in costs. The request may specify budgetary changes required for the remain der of the project period as well as for the current budget period. Supple mental applications requesting a programmatic expansion (change in sco pe) must undergo objective review and generally are required to compete for support; requests for administrative supplements may be aw arded without objective review or competition. Revised (Amended) Application \u2014an unfunded application that the applicant has modified following objective review and has resubmitted for a subsequent review cycle. Non-Competing Continuation Application \u2014a request for funding, whether the OPDIV terms the request an application or a progress or performance report, for funding the second or subsequent budget period within an approved competitive segment. A non-competing continuation application does not compete with other app lications for support. Generally, funding opportunity announcements will invite the submission of full applications at the outset. However, an OPDIV may require or encourage submission of preliminary documents before submission of applications for initial (new) support. If pre-applications are used, they must be submitted as specified by the OPDIV in the funding opportunity announcement. Pre-applications may be required as a means of screening out, through an objective review process, th ose applications with little or no chance for Federal funding before applicants incur significant expenditures in preparing an application. OPDIVs may request submission of LOIs preliminary to submission of applications. LOIs generally are not required to include detailed information about a proposed project or application. Instead, LOIs are us ed to estimate the nu mber of applications that may be submitted. When used in this way, potential applicants are not required to submit them, and, if an LOI is submitte d, it is not binding and does not require the respondent to submit an application. Application Forms Exhibit 2 lists the application forms used by the OPDIVs. The forms vary by applicant or grant type and they may differ for non-competing continuation applications and other applications. These forms and a ssociated instructions are available electronically at the specified Web site and, as appropriate, at the Grants.gov APPLY site (http://www.grants.gov/Appl y). Questions about application forms and instructions may be directed to the OPDIV to which the application will be submitted. Exhibit 2.

Available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/forms.htm Preparing an Application Regardless of any preliminary documentat ion required or submitted, to be considered for support, an applicant must be an eligible entity and must submit a complete application that complies with OPDIV instructions. In addition to indicating the substantive information required, OPDIVs may specify page limitations or other formatting requirements, whether for ha rd-copy or electronic applications. A complete new or competing continuation application typically includes a project description, detailed budget and budget justif ication, biographical sketches of key personnel, and other information specified in the funding opportunity announcement. The funding opportunity announcement (or related application package) may provide specific instructions for completion of these forms that differ from the standard instructions for completion. 10 This form may continue to be used in accordance with OPDIV instructions until transition to use of Grants.gov is complete. I-17 In preparing an application, an applic ant should ensure that it addresses requirements specified (or incorporated by reference) in the funding opportunity announcement that relate to the pro ject or program narrative, public policy requirements, and the application budget. The same project may not be submitte d concurrently to two PHS OPDIVs, a limitation that applies to the PHS OPDIVs only. Any such applications will be returned to the applicant without review. Public Policy Requirements Public policy requirements are requirements with a broader national purpose than that of the Federal sponsoring program or award that an app licant/recipient must adhere to as a prerequisite to and/or condition of an award. Public policy requirements are established by statute, regulation, or Executive order. In some cases they relate to general activities, such as preservation of the environment, while, in other cases they are integral to the purposes of the grant-supported project, such as protecting the welfare or identity of subjects in research projects. Some public policy requirements require an indication of intent to comply with the requirement if an award is made, others require submission of specific documentation before award (sometimes in the form of a certification or assurance or an environmental assessment), and still others require a demonstration of compliance that is an integral part of the application review for technical or scientific merit (e.g., the requirement in 45 CFR 46 .111(a)(6) that, when appropriate, the research plan must make adequate provis ion for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects ). Applicants and recipients should take particular note of these requirements. If an applicant or recipient does not provide the required information or the information is incomplete or is otherwise not adequate, depending on the requirement the organization may be deemed ineligible for award, the award may be delayed, an award may be terminat ed, or other appropriate action may be taken by the OPDIV. The signature of the authorized organizati onal representative on the application indicates that the organization complies, or intends to comply, with all applicable public policy requirements specified in the funding opportunity announcement, generally by reference to an other document such as application instructions or a grants policy statement. Some requirements (human subjects assurance, civil rights assurance, environmental analysis) are in the form of separate documents that an applicant must have on file with the app licable HHS office before an award may be made. Other requirements may be sati sfied by means of \"just-in-time\" documentation submitted, at OPDIV request, by those applicants being considered for award. Part II contains general guidance to help the applicant/recipient determine which public policy requirements apply to its activities after award, including whether a requirement should be included in suba wards or contracts under the grant. Research-Related Requirements Just-in-time procedures may be used in re lation to requirements for submission of certification of IRB approval of the pr oject's proposed use of human subjects, verification of IACUC approv al of the project's proposed use of live vertebrate animals, and evidence of compliance with the requirement for education in the I-18 protection of human research participants. Applications from organizations with approved Animal Welfare Assurances will be considered incomplete if they do not contain the information concerning the use of vertebrate animals required as part of the application (see application instructions for completing the specific points that need to be addressed). In the case of appa rent or potential violation of the policy, the application may be referred back to the applicant for further IACUC review. The funding opportunity announcement will specify the timing and nature of required just-in-time submissi ons. These requirements differ from any need to describe the involvement of human subjects or animals in an application, which is reviewed by the objective reviewers. In addition, several OPDIVs have policie s concerning the inclusion of women, minorities, and children as subjects in their grant-supported research. These policies, which implement Section 492B of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 289 a-2, require that women and members of minority groups an d their subpopulations be included in OPDIV-supported research projects invo lving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects, the purpose of the research, or other circumstances. When these policies apply (as specified in the funding opportunity announcement), the applicant is required to address inclusion of these groups in the application narrative, and the applicant's plans will be assessed as part of the objective (peer) review process. Failure to comply with this policy or to adequately address use of human subjects and anim als may adversely affect the score for technical merit, which may result in the OPDIV not making an award. National Environmental Policy Act NEPA, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq ., establishes national policy goals and procedures to protect and enhance the en vironment, including protection against natural disasters. To comply with NEPA for its grant-supported activities, HHS requires the environmental aspects of construction grants (and certain non- construction projects as specified by the OPDIV) to be reviewed and evaluated before final action on the application. If the OPDIV determines that NEPA applies (or may apply), the OPDIV will address NEPA requirements in the funding opport unity announcement. If the OPDIV has not indicated in the funding opportunity announcement that NEPA applies, no environmental analysis is ne cessary, unless, in an unusual situation, the applicant anticipates a significant environmental consequence or, following receipt of an application, an OPDIV offici al indicates the need for an environmental analysis. In those cases, an environmental analysis must be provided with the application or as requested by the OPDIV. An environmental analysis me ans a written review that indicates the expected environmental effe cts resulting from the proposed action, defines the current and future implications of those effects, and lists any proposed actions or safeguards to avoid or reduce an y negative environmental effects. If NEPA applies, the application must be accomp anied by the applicant's own separately bound environmental analysis to facilitate review and evaluation for environmental concerns before approval or ot her action on the application. Public Disclosure I-19 Section 102 of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4332, and EO 11514 (March 5, 1970) provide for public comment and participation in the enviro nmental impact review process. If it is determined that there is an environmental impact, applicants are required to publicly disclose the project in a newspaper or ot her publicly available medium and to describe its environmental impact concurre nt with notification to the SPOC (see \"Intergovernmental Review under Executive Order 12372 \" in Part I). An example of a suitable disclosure statement follows: Notice is hereby given that the Uptown Community Health Center proposes to construct additional space, partially utilizing Federal funds. The proposed construction project is the addition of 2,700 square feet connected to the existing Allen Building, which is located at 5333 Main Street, Downtown, Ohio. The Uptown Community Health Center has evaluated the environmental and community impact of the proposed constr uction. There will be construction noise and increased construction traffic during the construction period. No significant permanent environmental impacts are foreseen. All building permits and zoning approvals have been obtained. In acco rdance with Exec utive Order 11514 (March 5, 1970), which implements the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, any individual or group may comment on, or request information concerning, the environmental implications of the proposed project. Communications should be addressed to the Uptown Community Health Center, and must be received by (date). The Feder al grant application may be reviewed at 5333 Main Street, during normal working hours. Preservation of Cultural and Historic Resources Under Section 106 of the National Histor ic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq ., agencies must consider the effect on histor ic properties before making a decision on whether to fund a project. Historic properties include any district, site, building, structure, or object that is listed on, or is eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places (National Register). In addition, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings. The purchase, construction, or alteration/renovation of a facility with Federal funds, whether that activity is the purpose of the project or is one activity under a grant with a broader purpose (e.g., alteration of a facility under a research project), is an \"undertaking\" as that term is defined under 36 CFR 800.16(y). However, these are not the only activities th at may result in the need to comply with Section 106. The procedures to be followed by Federal agencies in complying with Section 106 are set forth in the Council' s regulations at 36 CFR part 800. Pursuant to the regulations at 36 CFR part 800, before deciding to make an award, the OPDIV approving official for a grant-fu nded project or program must determine the project's or program's effect on historic properties in consultation with the involved State Historic Preservation Office rs, Tribal Historic Preservation Officers, representatives of the local government, a ffected Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, the applicant organization, an d other interested parties. In order for an OPDIV to carry out these responsibilities, applicants (and recipients) must identify to the OPDIV any property listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places that will be affected by the award. Generally this will be at the time of application, but may not be known until afte r award as a result of a planned post- award change. I-20 The term \"effect\" is define d under 36 CFR 800.16(i) as an \"alteration to the characteristics of a historic property qualifying it for inclusion in or eligibility for the National Register.\" The project's impact on the property's use, character, location, and setting, including whether it will have an adverse effect, are considered when determining its effect on the historic pr operty. The project or program will be considered to have an adverse effect if it will endanger those qualities that make the property eligible for inclusion in the National Register. If the undertaking will have an adverse effe ct on a historic prop erty, the consultation process must proceed as provided under 36 CFR 800.6 in the effort to develop either a memorandum of agreement or a programmatic agreement detailing the steps necessary to avoid, minimize, or miti gate the adverse effects. In cases where the consultation is terminated without an agr eement to resolve the adverse effects, the OPDIV will follow the applicable requirements of 36 CFR 800.7. These requirements must be satisfied before approval of the application or a post-award change to an approved application. Under the Council's regulations, applicants/recipients may initiate the Section 106 compliance consultations when authorized to do so by the OPDIV. If the OPDIV provides that authorization, it must notify the involved State Historic Preservation Officers, Tribal Historic Preservation Offi cers, and other consulting parties that the applicant has been given that authority. The OPDIV remains legally responsible for all findings and determinations made on it s behalf. Each organiza tion that plans to use OPDIV funds for purchase, construction, or renovation of a facility, other activity specified by the OPDIV, or activity deemed by the applicant to have an effect on a historic property must ensure that it has provided complete and accurate documentation to assist the agency with meeting its Section 106 compliance responsibilities. Failure to obtain this clearance and make this assurance will delay action on an application or change reques t. The State Historic Preservation Liaison Officer or the National Trust for Historic Preservation may be contacted for additional details. Protection of Wetlands EO 11990 provides that federally funded co nstruction and impr ovements minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands. The EO provides that, in furtherance of Section 101(b)(3) of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4331(b)(3)), Federal agencies, to the extent permitted by law, must avoid undertaking or assisting with new construction located in wetlands unless the head of the agency finds that there is no practicable alternative to such construction, and that the proposed action includes all practicable measures to minimize harm to wetlands that may result from such use. In making this finding, the head of the agency may take into account economic, environmental, and other pertinent fact ors. The public disclosure requirement described above also pertains to early pub lic review of any plans or proposals for new construction in wetlands. I-21 Uniform Relocation Act and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (the Uniform Relocation Act), 42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq ., applies to all programs or projects undertaken by Federal agencies or with Federal financ ial assistance that cause the displacement of any person. The HHS requirements for complying with the Uniform Relocation Act are set forth in 49 CFR part 24. Those regulations include uniform policies and procedures regarding treatment of displaced people. They encour age entities to negotiate promptly and amicably with property owners so prop erty owners' interests are protected and litigation can be avoided. The Application Budget Applicants generally will be required to prepare a detailed budget as part of the application consistent with instructions in the funding opportunity announcement and application instructions. Among other things, applicants need to understand the types of costs that are allowable under the program or award, the cost principles to which it will be subject, differences between direct and indirect costs, circumstances requiring establishment of an indirect cost rate or research patient care cost rate, and any requirement for non-Federal participation (in the form of matching or cost sharing). In general, HHS discretionary grant awar ds provide for reimbursement of actual, allowable program/project costs incurred. Ex cept for those types of awards for which HHS will not reimburse indirect costs as specified below, program/project costs consist of allowable direct co sts plus the allocable portio n of indirect costs of the organization, less applicable credits (as described in Part II and in the cost principles). A \"direct cost\" is any cost th at can be specifically identified with a particular project, program, or activity or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily and with a high degree of accuracy. Direct costs include, but are not limited to, salaries, travel, eq uipment, and supplies directly be nefiting the grant-supported project or activity. Most organizations also incur costs for common or joint objectives that, therefore, cannot be readily identified with an individual project, program, or organizational ac tivity. These costs are identified as \"indirect costs\" or \"facilities and admini strative costs.\" They generally include facilities operation and maintenance co sts, depreciation, and administrative expenses. Organizations must have or negoti ate an indirect cost rate to support a request for reimbursement of indirect costs (with limited exceptions specified below). I-22 The various sets of government-wide (or, in the case of hospitals, HHS) cost principles establish the general standards for the allowability, including allocability, of costs and provide detailed guidance on th e cost accounting treatment of costs as direct or indirect costs. App licability of a particular set of cost principles depends on the type of organization making the expend iture. For example, if a State government recipient collaborates with a university as a contractor under the grant, the State would be subject to the cost principles for States, while the university would be subject to the cost principles for institutions of higher education. The allowability of costs also is subject to any requirements or limits established in the governing statute, program regulations, or the terms and conditions of awards. Because these considerations apply throughout the grants process, they are addressed in detail in Part II. Indirect Costs If indirect costs are reimbursable under an award, applicants may request indirect costs in their applications. Indirect costs should not be requested in applications for the following types of awards: Construction grants Conference grants Fellowships. The following types of organization s may not request indirect costs: Federal institutions International or foreign organizations if the grant will be performed entirely outside the territorial limits of the United St ates (indirect costs may be paid to the American University, Beirut, which is not considered a foreign organization, and the World Health Organization). For other types of awards and organizations, OPDIVs will not reimburse indirect costs unless the recipient has an indirect cost ra te covering the applicable activities and period. Indirect cost rates ar e negotiated by DCA, DFAS in the Office of Acquisition Management and Policy, NIH (responsible for negotiating indirect cost rates for for-profit entities receiving awards from HHS), or other Federal agency with cognizance for indirect cost rate negoti ation. However, as indicated in OMB Circular A-87, certain governmental organizati ons other than Indian tribal go vernments are not required to submit their indirect cost rate proposals to the Federal government, but must retain the documentation related to their indirect cost requests for audi t purposes. Further, awarding offices will not require a recipient to establish an indirect cost rate if the organization's total operations consist of a single grant-supported project or if the organization appropriately and consistently treats all costs as direct costs to projects and accounts for them as su ch. In the latter case, the GMO must be satisfied that the organization's accounting system can adeq uately identify and support all costs as direct costs to the project or program. This includes being able to identify and segregate costs on the basis of a process that assigns costs co mmensurate with the benefits provided to indivi dual projects or programs. I-23 If an organization is advised by the GMO of the need to establish a rate, the GMO will refer the organization to the appropriate office. Indirect cost proposals must be prepared in accordance with the applicable cost principles and guidance provided by the cognizant office or agency. Further information concerning the establishment of indirect cost rates and the reimbursement of indirect costs may be obtained from DCA or DFAS. Even if an organization has an established indirect cost rate, un der training grants (including education grants and career awar ds) to all types of entities other than State, local, or Indian trib al governmental agen cies, OPDIVs reimburse indirect costs at a fixed rate. Therefore, wh en requesting indirect cost s, these applicants should budget indirect costs at a rate of 8 percent of modified total direct costs, exclusive of tuition and fees, expenditures for equipmen t, and subawards and contracts in excess of $25,000. Training grant applications fr om State, local, or Indian tribal governmental agencies ma y request full indirect co st reimbursement. State universities and hospitals are not considered governmental agencies for this purpose. Matching or Cost Sharing If the funding opportunity announcement specifies that matching or cost sharing is required, it also will specify the following: Whether the inclusion of matching or cost sharing in the application is an eligibility requirement or is an evaluation criterion The nature of the requirement, e.g., wh ether it is a fixed percentage or the OPDIV cannot fund more than a specified percentage of costs Required documentation, such as letters of commitment. The terms \"matching\" and \"cost sharing\" are often used interchangeably. However, \"matching\" usually refers to a statutorily specified percentage, whether specified as a fixed or minimum percentage of non-Federal participation in allowable program or project costs that must be contributed by a recipient in order to be eligible for Federal funding or a not-to-exceed percen tage of Federal participation. \"Cost sharing\" refers to any situation in which the recipient shares in the costs of a project other than as statutorily required matching. This includes situations in which contributions are voluntarily proposed by an applicant and accepted by the OPDIV by inclusion in the approved budget as shown in the NoA. Unless restricted by statute or regulation, matching or cost sharing may be provided as direct and/or indirect costs, consiste nt with the recipient' s accounting system\u2014 and its usual method of charging for similar items\u2014and any restrictions or limitations in the applicable cost principles. Recipi ent contributions may be derived from any non-Federal source; from Fe deral sources if received as fees, payments, or reimbursements for the provision of a specific service, such as patient care reimbursements received under Medicare or Medicaid; or from other program income, if authorized by th e OPDIV (see Part II). Otherwise, unless there is specific statutory authority, Federal funds may not be used to match HHS grant funds. The source and amount of costs and/or the value of third-party in-kind contributions proposed by the applicant to meet a matchi ng or cost-sharing requirement must be identified in the application budget. The determination of allowability of costs for I-24 matching or cost-sharing purposes is base d on the same requir ements, including the cost principles, that apply to use of Fede ral funds. Also, the classification of a contributed cost as eith er direct or indirect must be co nsistent with th e classification of other costs incurred by the recipient fo r the same purpose in like circumstances. Guidance on the valuation of in-kind contributions is found in 45 CFR 74.23, 45 CFR 92.24, and Part II of this policy statement. Research Patient Care Costs HHS provides funds for research patient care costs under grants to hospitals to cover the costs of routine services for inpatients or ancillary services for inpatient or outpatient subjects/volunteers involved in research studies. In order to receive reimbursement for research patient care costs, any hospital that, as a direct recipient of OPDIV funds, expects to incur more than $100,000 in patient care costs in any single budget period on a single OPDIV grant must either have in place, or take steps to negotiate, a research patien t care rate agreement with the cognizant DCA office. Detailed information on research pa tient care costs is included in Part II. Third-Party Reimbursement Under health services delivery programs , OPDIV funding may serve as seed money to allow recipients to develop necessary capabilities and the ability to obtain funding from non-Federal sources or may be cond itioned on recipients maximizing their funding from other sources, with Federa l funding for the diffe rence between those amounts and their costs of operation. In a ddition to any required narrative discussion of applicant plans to seek third-party reim bursement for delivery of health services and establishment of fee schedules to charge beneficiaries according to their ability to pay, the applicant may be required to show in the application budget the amounts expected to be collected from third-party payors (program income). More detailed discussion of program income is included in Part II. Submitting an Application Many OPDIV programs accept applications electronically through Grants.gov APPLY. Grants.gov provides a secure and reliable government-wide single portal for applying for Federal grants electronically, simplifying the grant application process and reducing paperwork. For OPDIV programs allowing submission of applications through Grants.gov, the OPDIV will post an application package at Grants.gov APPLY that includes the funding opportunity announcement, the required forms, and submission instructions. However, even if an OPDIV accepts applications electronically, an applicant may choose to submit its application in hard copy. Funding opportunity announcements also will indicate the date and time by which a competing application must be submitted in order to be considered as part of that competition, the address to which the app lication must be subm itted (which may be a contractor), and, if hard copy, the number of copies. Generally, OPDIVs will require submission of an original and tw o copies of an application. All applications must include a DUNS number, which is obtained from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) at 1-866-705-5711 or at http://ccr.dnb.com/ccr/pages/CCRSearch.jsp . To determine if an organization already has a DUNS number or to obtain a DUNS number , the organization should contact D&B. There is no charge to obtain a DUNS number. I-25 Before using Grants.gov APPLY, an applicant organization must re gister with Central Contractor Registration ( http://www.ccr.gov/) and the credential provider. Central Contractor Registration can be accomp lished online or by telephone (1-888-227- 2423). The DUNS number is required before initiating registration with Central Contractor Registration. Specific details about Central Contractor Registration and credential provider registration associated with the use of Grants.gov are available at http://www.grants.gov/GetStartedRegister?type=organization . Organizations are not required to register with Central Contractor Registration if they submit applications by any means other than through Grants.gov, e.g., in hard copy. For funding opportunity announcements wi th common deadline dates for application submission, to be considered timely, an application must be sent on or before the deadline date. The established receipt or deadline date may be waived only in extenuating circumstan ces such as extreme weather (e.g., floods or hurricanes), widespread disruptions of mail service, or di sruptions of electronic or other services. The deadline is the same for applications submitted electronically. For applications submitted through Grants.gov, the OPDIV will determine whether an application was submitted before the deadline based on the ti me it is received and clocked in at the Grants.gov portal. Applications may be sent through the United St ates Postal Service or delivered by a courier delivery service. Some OPDIVs will not accept applications hand-carried by individuals. For hard-copy applications, if sent on time to the address specified in the funding opportuni ty announcement (with documented proof of mailing) but received after the deadline, an application can be accepted for review only if it is received in time for orderly processing. If the receipt date falls on a weekend or a Federal holiday, the deadline date is extended to the next business day. If an application is sent to any address other than that specified in the funding opportunity announcement, it may result in a delay in processing or the application not being reviewed. Executive Order 12372 and Public Health System Reporting Requirements Certain HHS program/activiti es are subject to the requirements of EO 12372, as amended, \"Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,\" and the HHS implementation at 45 CFR part 100, and to other intergovernmental cooperation provisions. These requirements allow State and local governments to provide input on applications submitted (or to be subm itted) for funding consideration. If EO 12372 might apply to a program or applicants or applications under the program, the following information will be included in the funding opportunity announcement: Even if a program is covered by EO 12372, not all States pa rticipate in this process. To determine whether it must comply with a State process under EO 12372, an applicant should check the information maintained by OMB at its Web site ( http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/spoc.html ). If the State does not participate, no SPOC contact will be listed. Applications from federally recognized Indi an tribal governments are not subject to EO 12372 requirements, even under covered programs. Before an award decision, the OPDIV must allow adequate time\u201460 days from the established deadline date for receipt of applications for a new or other competing application, or 30 days from the established deadline date I-26 for receipt of the application for a non-competing continuation application\u2014for completion (or expiration ) of the State process. The primary purpose of the Public Health System Reporting requirements is to provide State and/or local health agencies with information on proposed in-State grant activity by cert ain applicants applying for fund ing under health care delivery programs. When applicable, the applicant mu st prepare and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement. Applicants are required to submit the following information to the head of the appropriat e State and local heal th agencies in the areas to be impacted no later than the application receipt due date: A copy of the application face page A summary of the project, not to ex ceed one page, which describes the population to be served and the servic es to be provided, and describes the coordination planned with the appropriate State an d local health agencies (the application abstract may be substi tuted for the one-page Public Health System Impact Statement). Although these requirements are specific to health care delivery programs, they are related to the EO 12372 requirements. The lin kage occurs when a State and/or local health official wants to revi ew an application, in whole or in part, submitted under these programs. In that case, the official must contact the SPOC for a copy of the application. Use of Application Information Applicants are discouraged from submitting information considered proprietary unless it is deemed essential for proper evaluation of the application. However, if the application contains information that the a pplicant organization considers to be trade secrets, information that is commercial or fi nancial, or information that is privileged or confidential, the pages co ntaining that information should be identified as specified in the funding opportunity announcement or application instructions. When non-Federal reviewers are used, th e funding opportunity announcement or application instructions will specify that applicants have the option of omitting specific salary rates or amounts for indi viduals specified in the application budget and, if required by the OPDIV, Social Secu rity numbers for indivi duals. For hard-copy applications, this can be accomplished by including the information in the original, but omitting it from the application copi es. The copies may include summary salary information. For electronic applications, the information must be supplied to the OPDIV as part of the submi ssion. The funding opportunity announcement will specify if the applicant should indicate, in the app lication or in a separate form, whether it wants to use that option. If the detailed information is an integral part of the application, the OPDIV will ensure that the information is not shared with reviewers. The OPDIV will protect the information contained in an application from unauthorized disclosure, consistent with the need for ob jective review of the application and the requirements of the Freedom of Informatio n Act and the Privacy Act. However, if a grant is awarded as a result of or in connection with an application, the Federal government has the right to use or disclose the information to the extent authorized by law. Post-award considerations concerning release of information and access to research data are addressed in Pa rt II of this policy statement. I-27 Freedom of Information Act The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, provides individuals with a right to access certain records in the possession of the Federal government. The government may withhold information pursuant to the exemptions and exclusions contained in the act. The exact language of the exemptions can be fo und in the act. Additional guidance on the exemptions and how they apply to certain documents can be found in the HHS regulations implementing the FOIA (45 CFR part 5). (Also see the HHS Web site http://www.hhs.gov/foia/ .) OPDIVs generally do not release trade secrets and commercial, financial, and otherwise intrinsically valuable items of information that are obtained from a person or organization and are privileged or confid ential; information that, if released, would adversely affect the competitive position of the person or organiza tion; and patent or other valuable commercial rights of the person or organization. OPDIVs generally will withhold the followin g types of records or information related to an application in response to a FOIA request: Pending competing grant applications Unfunded new and competing continuations and competing supplemental applications Evaluative portions of site visit reports and objective review summary statements, including scores. If, after reviewing a FOIA re quest, an OPDIV has reason to believe that information in its records could reasonably be considered releasable, the appropriate OPDIV Freedom of Information office will notify the applicant (recipient), through the PI, before the information is released. The PI/PD will be given an opportunity to identify potentially patentable or commercially valuable information that the PI/PD believes should not be disclosed. Af ter OPDIV consideration of the response, the PI/PD and applicant (recipient) will be informed if the OPDIV does not agree with the PI's/PD's position. If a document contai ns both disclosable and nondisclosable information, the nondisclosable information will be deleted and the balance of the document will be disclosed. This restriction does not limit the Federal government's right to use the information if it is obtained without restriction from another source. The HHS regulations implementing FOIA pr ovide that only designated Freedom of Information officers may deny requests fo r information. Requests for information, the release of which is believed to be ex empt under FOIA, are referred to the OPDIV Freedom of Information office r along with written documentation of the rationale for nondisclosure. If the Freedom of Information officer determines that the requested information is exempt from release under FOIA, the requester may appeal that determination to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (Media), HHS. Additional information on the FOIA process is available at OPDIV Web sites. Post-award considerations concerning rele ase of information and access to research data are addressed in Part II of this policy statement. I-28 Privacy Act The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, an d its implementing regulations (45 CFR part 5b) provide certain safeguards for information about individuals maintained in a system of records (i.e., in formation may be retrieved by the individual's name or other identifying information). These safeguar ds include the rights of individuals to determine what information about them is maintained in Federal agencies' files (hard copy or electronic) and how it is used; to have access to such records; and to correct, amend, or request deletion of inform ation in their records that is inaccurate, irrelevant, or outdated. Records maintained by OPDIVs with respect to grant applications, grant awards, and the administration of grants may be subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act. For example, OPDIVs that maintain or access an y such records by name of an individual, such as by the name of the PI/PD, are subject to the Privacy Act. Parties other than PIs/PDs may request th e release of Privacy Act records. Such requests are processed in the same ma nner as FOIA requests. For example, information requested by co-investigators in grant applications is released to them only when required under FOIA because they have no right of access under the Privacy Act. When releasing information about an individual to a party other than that individual, OPDIVs will balance the individual's right to privacy with the public's right to know as provided by the FOIA. Records maintained by non-Federal parties ordinarily are not subject to the requirements of 45 CFR part 5b. Objective Review of Applications Applications under discretionary grant programs, whether received in response to a funding opportunity announcement, solicited from a single source, or received as unsolicited requests for funding, are subjec t to objective review. Objective review is an advisory review of discr etionary grant applications conducted by a minimum of three unbiased reviewers with expertis e in the programmatic area for which applications are submitted. The review is intended to provide advice to the individuals re sponsible for making award decisions. Objective revi ew is essential to ensuring selection of applications that best meet the needs of the program cons istent with published evaluation criteria and providing assurance to the public that the evaluation process is impartial and fair. Peer review is a form of objec tive review required by stat ute. It is an assessment of scientific or technical meri t of applications by indi viduals with knowledge and expertise equivalent (peer) to that of the individuals whose applications of support they are reviewing. The statute may specify the types of reviewers or composition of review groups and include othe r requirements related to th e approval of applications, e.g., review by a National Advisory Council or equivalent body that performs a second level of review for programmatic cons iderations that augments the results of the peer review process. Application review criteria must be pub lished as part of the funding opportunity announcement. Typical review criteria may include the approach to the proposed I-29 project or program, whether to meet a he alth need or carry out an investigator- initiated research project; the potential of the program or project to contribute to meeting the objectives or purpose of the su pporting program; the method used to evaluate project or program results; reso urces of the applicant organization, e.g., facilities, and the capabiliti es of its staff, including the PI/PD; and reasonableness and appropriateness of the bu dget. Reviewers also will review proposed involvement of human subjects and verteb rate animals, as applicable, and assess compliance with specified public policy requirements, e.g., inclusion of women and minorities in research. IRB approval may be required before objective review of a new or competing continuation application unless the OPDIV has implemented just-in-time procedures. Applications received in response to th e same funding opportunity announcement generally are scored individually and then ranked with othe r applications reviewed by the same review group in their order of rela tive programmatic, tech nical, or scientific merit. The highest ranked applications are those that receive priority consideration for award within available funding. Authorized program officials (\"approving officials\") make final awar d decisions from among those applications receiving a favorable objective review and, where applicable, National Advisory Council recommendation. OPDIV approving official s also may apply ot her factors, e.g., geographical distribution, as specified in the funding opportunity announcement. The decision to fund an applicat ion will be communicated to th e applicant by issuance of a NoA. The decision not to fund an app lication will be communicated by letter. Depending on OPDIV procedures, the lette r may include a summary of the review (\"summary statement\") and may be sent to the PI/PD and/or to the person who signed the application as the official author ized to obligate the applicant. A copy of a letter transmitting a summary statement also will be provided to the individual named as the PI/PD for the project covered by the application if that individual is not the individual that sign ed the application. If an application has received a favorable objective review but is not expected to be funded in the current cycle due to funding constraints, the application may be held for one or more additional cycles and comp ete with other applications submitted for that subsequent cycle as long as the su bsequent cycle(s) re quirements remain unchanged from those under which the application was originally submitted. If an application is unsuccessful, under programs that have annual review cycles or multiple reviews within a year, the applicant may submit a revised application for review in a future review cycle. Some OPDIVs limit the number of times an application may be revised and resubmitted (see Part IV for any OPDIV limitations). Disposition of Applications All incomplete applications, ineligible, or otherwise non-compliant applications, and applications determined to be non-respon sive to funding opportunity announcement requirements will not be reviewed. An applicant may withdraw an application from consideration at any time before an award is issued. An applicant whose application receives a favorable review will be notified of additional information that it may be required to submit or other actions it or the OPDIV may or must take. The process leading to an award, including the business management review performed by the GMO, is described in the next section, \"Business Management Reviews and Other Pre-Award Activities.\" I-30 An unsuccessful applicant will be advised by letter (sent to the individual signing the application on behalf of the organization) that its application will not be held for further consideration or be funded. The deci sion not to award a grant, or to award a grant at a particular funding level, is discret ionary and is not subject to appeal to any OPDIV or HHS official or board. Business Management Reviews an d Other Pre-Award Activities Applications receiving a favorable objective review that an OPDIV is considering for funding are reviewed for other consideratio ns. These include, as applicable, cost analysis of the project/program budget, a ssessment of the applicant's management systems, ensuring continued applicant eligibility, and compliance with any public policy requirements, including those requ iring just-in-time submissions. The applicant may be asked to submit additional information (such as an updated budget or \"other support\" information or verifica tion of IACUC review) or to undertake certain activities (such as negotiation of an indirect co st rate) in anticipation of an award. However, even at this point in the process, such requests do not guarantee that an award will be made. Following review of all applicable information, the OPDIV approving and business management offici als will determine whether an award can be made, if special conditions are required, and what level of funding is appropriate. Although these reviews and determinations occur before an awarding office makes a new or competing extension award, recipi ents must continue to comply with eligibility and public policy requirements and maintain adequate management systems throughout the period of support. Assurances of Compliance Civil Rights Before an awarding office may make an award to a domestic organization, the authorized organizational representative mu st assure, by means of the signature on the application, that the organization has on file with OCR an Assurance of Compliance with the statutes enforced by OCR. The assurance, Form HHS 690, is filed for the organization and is not required for each application. If the application has been recommended for funding and the a pplicant organization does not have an Assurance of Compliance on file with OCR, it will receive, from the awarding office, the required form and instructions for completion and submission. Domestic organizations that receive funding from recipients as subrecipients or contractors under grants rather than directly from HHS also are required to file an HHS 690. The recipient is responsible for determining whether those organizations have the required assurance on file and, if not, ensuring that it is filed with OCR. Human Subjects and Animal Welfare Under just-in-time procedures, following objective revi ew, applicant organizations should proceed with IRB review for those applications that have not yet received IRB approval and which the OPDIV has indicated may be in a fundable range. If, at the time of award, a recipient does not have an ap plicable assurance approved by OHRP and certification of IRB review and approval, the awarding office will place a restriction on the award so that no human subjects research can be conducted or I-31 supported until the assurance and certificatio n of IRB review and approval have been obtained and accepted. The PHS Policy on Humane Care an d Use of Laboratory Animals (the PHS Policy) requires applicants proposing to use vertebrate animals in HHS-supported activities to file a written Animal Welfare Assurance with OLAW. An awarding office will not make an award for research involving live vertebrate animals unless the applicant organization and all performance sites are op erating in accordance with an approved Animal Welfare Assurance and provide verifi cation that the IACUC has reviewed and approved those sections of the application that involve use of vertebrate animals, in accordance with the requiremen ts of the PHS policy. If an application is selected for award and the verification of IACUC review has not been submi tted, the awarding office will contact the organization with instructions for negotiating an assurance or submitting the IACU C verification. Cost Analysis The GMO will ensure that a cost analysis is performed on any application that requires a detailed budget. Cost analysis involves obtaining cost breakdowns, validating cost data, evaluating specific elements of cost, and examining data to determine the necessity for, and the reas onableness and allowability of, the costs included in the application budget. The extent of cost analysis depends on the complexity of the project, prior experience with the applicant, and other factors. Information on the applicable cost principl es and on allowable and unallowable costs is provided in Part II. Assessment of Financial and Other Management Systems In addition to considering the specific in formation provided in the application, the GMO determines the adequacy of the applicant's financial and business management systems, including property management and procurement systems, that will support the expenditure of and accountability for grant funds if an award is made. Applicants/recipients are expected to have systems, policies, and procedures in place by which they manage grant funds and gr ant-supported activi ties. They may use their existing systems for th is purpose as long as or ganizational policies are consistently applied regardless of the so urce of funds and systems meet the standards and requirements set forth in 45 CFR part 74 or 92, as applicable (see \"Financial Management\"). If an applicant has no prior experience wi th Federal grants or cost-reimbursement contracts, the GMO may review the applicant's financial management and other management systems before award, or with in a reasonable time after award, to determine their adequacy and acceptability. For an applicant with prior OPDIV or other Federal cost-reimbursement awards, the GMO may review recent audit reports and other available information to determine whether the applicant's management systems meet the established standards. The GMO will advise the applicant if additional information is required. On the basis of the review results, the GMO will determine the need for any corrective action and may impose special conditions on the award. The OPDIV also will oversee the recipient's systems as part of its routine post-award monitoring. I-32 The Notice of Award The NoA is the legal document issued to the receiving organization that indicates an award has been made and that funds may be requested from the designated HHS payment system or office. A NoA, showing the amount of Federal funds authorized for obligation and any future-year commitments, is issued for each budget period in the approved project period (see \"Project Pe riod and Budget Period\" below). Until an awarding office has issued a NoA for the initial budget period, any costs incurred by the applicant for the project are incurred at its own risk. A revised NoA may be issued during a budget period to effect an action resulting in a change in the period or amount of support or other change in the terms and conditions of award. An awarding office generally will not issue a revised NoA to reflect a recipient's post- award rebudgeting. The NoA sets forth pertinent information about the grant, including, but not limited to, the following: Grant identification number (\"grant number\") Statutory authority for the award and any applicable program regulations Name of recipient organization Name of the PI/PD Approved project period and budget period start and end dates Amount of Federal funds authorized for obligation by the recipient Amount of matching or cost sharing (if applicable) Amount of anticipated future-year commitments (if applicable) Names of the cognizant OPDIV/awar ding office, PO, GMO, and GMS Applicable terms and conditions of award, either by reference or inclusion. The HHS-assigned EIN (based on the IRS EIN), which must be used to request payment. A recipient indicates acceptan ce of an award and its associated terms and conditions by drawing or requesting funds from the designated HHS payment system or office. For cooperative agreement awards, an awardi ng office may requir e the recipient to formally accept the award by signing and returning the NoA or separate document. When signature is required, th e authorized organizational representative must be the signatory of the NoA. If a recipient cannot accept the award, including the legal obligation to perform in accordance with award terms and conditions, the organization should notify the GMO imme diately upon receipt of the NoA. If resolution cannot be reached, the GMO will void the grant. The OPDIV's determination of applicable terms and cond itions of award or a GMO's denial of a request to change the terms and conditions is discretionary and not subject to appeal. Once the award is accepted by th e recipient, the contents of the NoA are I-33 binding on the recipient unless and until modified by a revised NoA signed by the GMO. Project Period and Budget Period For most grants, HHS uses the project period system of funding. Under this system, projects are programmatically approved for support in their entirety, but are funded in annual increments called budget periods. The total project period consists of the initial competitive segment, any additional competitive segments authorized by approval of a competing continuation application, and any non-competing extensions. A competitive segment genera lly will be no longer than 5 years (exclusive of non-competing extensions). A single award covering the entire period of support generally is used if the project is solely for construction (or major A&R of real property) or if the total planned period of support will be less than 18 months. The length of the project period (whether for one or more than one competitive segment) is determined by the OPDI V on the basis of the following: Any statutory, regulatory, or administrative requirements The length of time requ ested by the applicant Any limitation on the length of the project period recommended by the objective or reviewers The OPDIV's programmatic determination of the frequency of objective review necessary for managing the project, program, or activity The OPDIV's funding principles as specified in the funding opportunity announcement. Most NoAs document approval of a projec t period that extends beyond the budget period for which funds are provided, indicating the OPDIV's intention to provide continued financial support. The amount s shown for subsequent years represent projections of future funding levels based on the information available at the time of the initial award. Such projected levels of future support are contingent on satisfactory progress, the availability of funds, and the continued best interests of the Federal government. They are not guarante es that the project or program will be funded or will be funded at those levels, and they create no legal obligation to provide funding beyond the ending date of the current budget period as shown in the NoA. Recipients are required to submit a non-competing continuation application or annual progress report as a prerequisite to approv al and funding of each subsequent budget period (non-competing continuation award) within an approved project period. A decision to fund the next bu dget period will be formalized by the issuance of a NoA indicating the new budget period and the amount of new funding. Part II explains this process in greater detail. Budget periods usually are 12 months long ; however, shorter or longer budget periods may be established for programmatic or administrative reasons. The NoA will show the total approved budget for the ap plicable budget period, including direct costs and, if applicable, indirect costs as well as any required matching or cost I-34 sharing. SBIR and STTR awards also ma y include a fee; however, no other HHS awards may include profit or fee. The initial and each subsequent NoA that provides funding sets forth the amount awarded under that action, amounts previous ly awarded for that budget period, and, after the initial budget period, any author ized carryover (see Part II). The amount awarded also is shown genera lly with a categorical (line item) budget breakdown. The recipient has certain rebu dgeting flexibility within th e overall amount awarded as specified in Part II. However, the total amount awarded (direct and indirect costs and fee, where applicable) is the OPDIV's maximum financial obligation to the recipient under that award; in other words, it is the ceiling on the amount payable to the recipient under that award. Once an awar d is made, the OPDIV is not obligated to make any supplemental or other award or to provide additional funding for indirect costs or other purposes. If an applicant/recipient waives reimbursement of the full indirect costs to which it is otherwise entitled based on it s negotiated rate, the awardi ng office will either not award indirect costs or will award only partial indirect costs, as appropriate. In general, regardless of the type of recipient, the negotiated indirect cost rate(s) in effect at the beginning of the competitive segment will be used to determine the amount budgeted for indirect costs for each year of the competit ive segment. If the rate agreement does not extend to the end of the project period, the last rate in effect will be used to establish the total cost commitment for any remaining future years. Under limited circumstances, the GMO may award indirect costs where none were previously awarded or may increase the am ount previously awarded. If an award does not include an amount for indirect co sts because the applicant or recipient has not established a rate or did not submit a timely rate proposal and the recipient subsequently establishes a rate, the GM O may amend the award to provide an appropriate amount for indirect costs if the amendment can be made using funds from the same Federal fiscal year in which the award was made. However, the amount will be limited to the indirect costs applicable to the period after the effective date of the rate agreement. This provis ion does not affect local governmental agencies that are not required to submit th eir indirect cost proposals to the Federal government. They may charge indirect costs to grants based on the rate computations they prepare and keep on file for subsequent Federal review. Other Terms and Conditions In addition to, or in lieu of, the standard terms and conditions of award specified in the HHS GPS, the OPDIV may use terms an d conditions for program-specific or award-specific reasons. For example, if, on the basis of a recipient's application or other available information, the GMO find s\u2014at the time of award or at any time subsequent to award\u2014that the recipient' s management systems and practices are not adequate to ensure the appropriate stew ardship of grant funds or to achieve the objectives of the award, the GMO may impo se special, more restrictive terms and conditions on the award in accordance wi th 42 CFR 52.9 and 45 CFR 74.14 or 92.12. For example, an OPDIV could require a re cipient to obtain prior approval for expenditures that ordinarily do not requ ire such approval or to provide more frequent reports. In addition to closer mo nitoring, the OPDIV may assist the recipient with taking any necess ary corrective action. I-35 Payment HHS grant payments may be made by one of several advance payment methods, including SMARTLINK II/ACH, CASHLINE/ACH, or cash request, or by cash request on a reimbursement basis, as specified in the NoA and as described in this section. Payments under grants generally are made as advance payments. Except as indicated in this section, grant payments are made by the PMS, operated by HHS's DPM, in accordance with Department of the Treasury and OMB requirements, as implemented by 45 CFR 74.22 and 92.21. Th ese requirements are intended to minimize the time elapsing between th e transfer of funds from the Federal government and disbursement by a recipient. Therefore, although the grant may be financed by advance payments, the intent is that recipients draw funds as needed. Federal funds advanced to the recipient sh ould be fully disbursed (checks written, signed, and issued to the payees) by the close of busine ss the next work day after receipt of the funds. The potential for exce ssive Federal cash on hand exists each time a recipient does not disburse Federal funds timely. The reci pient is responsible for determining when the Federal funds have been deposited into its bank account for each drawdown, ensuring that the funds are fully disbursed by the close of business the next work day after they are received, and i mmediately returning undisbursed Federal cash on hand to PMS. An OPDIV may use reimbursement as the method of payment, in lieu of advance pa yment, if cash management requirements are not met. Advances made by recipients to subrecipients and contractors under grants must conform to substantially the same standards of timing and amount that govern advances to the recipient. Operational guidance for recipients is contained in the DHHS Manual for Recipients Financed under the Paym ent Management System (available through the HHS Web site at http://www.dpm.psc.gov/doc/hhsrecmanual.pdf ). Inquiries regarding payments should be directed to DP M at the address shown in Part III. OPDIVs make payments under awards to fo reign or international organizations, if those organizations do not have a U.S. bank account, and awards to agencies of the Federal government. SMARTLINK II/ACH The SMARTLINK II/ACH method of advance payment makes direct deposit of funds to a recipient's bank account and requires recipients to have Internet access to submit a request for funds to PMS. SMARTLINK II/ACH provides funds the day following the request with direct deposit using the ACH process of the Federal Reserve Bank (Richmond, Virginia). CASHLINE/ACH The CASHLINE/ACH method of advance paymen t provides for direct deposit of funds to the recipient's bank account using a touc h-tone telephone to dial directly to a \"voice-response\" computer located at PM S. CASHLINE/ACH makes funds available the day following the request with direct deposit using the Federal Reserve Bank's ACH process. I-36 Cash Request Recipients not eligible for an unrestricted advance of funds by SMARTLINK II/ACH or CASHLINE/ACH must submit a cash request as specified in the NoA. Cash requests usually are submitted monthly usin g SF 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. The cash re quest may be on either an advance or reimbursement basis, as specified by the awarding office. Cash requests are used when a recipient's cash management must be closely moni tored (for example, recipients whose financial management systems do not meet the standards specified in 45 CFR 74.21 or 92.20) or under programs where reim bursement financing is appropriate. A recipient also may be converted from an unrestricted advance payment method to a cash request basis if, during post-award administration, the GMO determines that the recipient is not complying with the cash management requirements or other requirements of the award, including the submission of complete and timely reports. If the cash request is for an advance payment, the recipient may request funds monthly on the basis of expected disbur sements during the succeeding month and the amount of Federal funds already on hand. A request for reimbursement may be submitted more often, if authorized. For timely receipt of cash , a recipient must submit the request through the awarding office early enough for it to be forwarded to PMS at least 2 weeks before the cash is needed. PMS makes paym ent electronically through the ACH process upon receipt of the approved payment request from the awarding office. Post-Award Administration The recipient, as the direct and primary re cipient of HHS grant fu nds, is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of grant-supported activities and is accountable to the OPDIV for the performanc e of the project, program, or activity; the appropriate expenditure of grant funds by all parties; and all other obligations of the recipient. Recipien ts may use their established controls and policies, as long as they are consistent with award requirements. HHS seeks to foster within recipient organizations an organization al culture that is committed to compliance with Federal and HHS grant regulations, po licies, and procedures. Actions to achieve this result should include a clear delineation of the roles and responsibilities of the organization's staff, both programmatic and administrative; written policies and procedures; training; management controls and other internal controls; performance assessment; administrati ve simplifications; an d information sharing. In addition, to fulfill their role in regard to the stewardship of Federal funds, OPDIVs monitor their awards to identify potential problems and areas where technical assistance might be necessary. This acti ve monitoring is accomplished through review of recipient- generated reports, including audi t reports, and correspondence; site visits; and other information available to the OPDIV. The names and telephone numbers of the individuals responsible for monitoring the programmatic and business management aspects of a project or activity will be provided to the recipient at the time of award. Monitoring will continue for as long as th e OPDIV retains a financial interest in the project, program, or activity as a result of property accountability, audit, and other requirements that may continue for a period of time after the grant is I-37 I-38 administratively closed out and the OPDI V is no longer providing active grant support. Post-award requirements are addressed in detail in Part II. Part II: Terms and Conditions of Award Overview of Terms and Conditions of Award General, Program-Specific, an d Award-Specific Terms and Conditions The terms and conditions of award include general administrative and public policy requirements that apply to all recipients or certain classes of aw ards or activities; program-specific-requirements; and, as nece ssary, award-specific requirements. This part of the HHS GPS serves as the general administrative and public policy terms and conditions of HHS discretionary grant and cooperative agreement awards, as referenced in NoAs. It addresses the applicability of those terms and conditions based on the type of award, recipien t, or grant-supported activity. The HHS GPS is consistent with the requir ements of 45 CFR parts 74 and 92, only some of which are repeated or highlighted here, and is not intended to be all- inclusive. All awards or a specified subs et of awards also may be subject to additional requirements , such as those included in a ppropriations acts and Executive orders. Notice of requirements not specified in the HHS GPS generally will be provided in the NoA, but such notice is not required for the award to be subject to the requirements of pertinent statutes and regulations. In addition to all of the applicable administrative requirements of 45 CFR part 74 or 92, as appropriate for the ty pe of recipient, and other general terms and conditions, each award also is subject to the requirements of the authorizing program legislation and program regulations, if any. These requirements will be specified or incorporated by reference in the NoA. An individual aw ard also may contain award-specific terms and conditions included in full text. For example, the GMO may include terms and conditions necessary to address concerns about a recipient's management systems. For cooperative agreement awards, the NoA wi ll specifically address the substantial programmatic involvement of Federal staff and any other special terms (e.g., ownership of data and research results, and use of equipment) appropriate for the cooperative agreement. Effect and Order of Precedence Any waivers of or deviations from these te rms and conditions must be requested and approved in writing by the GMO. OPDIV determination of applicable terms and conditions of award or a GMO's denial of a request to change the terms and conditions is discretionary and not subject to appeal. A recipient indicates acceptan ce of an award and its associated terms and conditions by requesting and accepting funds from PM S or the designated HHS payment office for that award. If a recipient cannot accept an award, incl uding the legal obligation to perform in accordance with its provisions, it should notify the GMO immediately upon receipt of the NoA. If resolution cannot be reached, the GMO will void the grant. Once an award is accepted by a recipient, the contents of the NoA are binding on the recipient and the OPDIV unless and until mo dified by a revised NoA signed by the GMO. II-1 If there is a perceived conflict between or among statutory and regulatory requirements, the terms and conditions in th is part of the HHS GPS, Part IV of the HHS GPS and award-specific terms and conditions, or if the recipient has questions concerning award terms and conditions, the recipient should request written clarification from the GMO. This may be done at any time; however, if the inclusion of the term or condition would cause the or ganization not to accept the award or to be unable to comply, the question should be raised before award acceptance. In the case of a conflict, statutes and regulation s take precedence over requirements or restatements of statutory or regulatory re quirements in the HHS GPS, and OPDIV or award-specific requirements take precedence over Pa rt II of the HHS GPS. Flow-Down of Requirements under Subawards and Contracts under Grants The terms and conditions in the HHS GPS apply directly to the recipient of HHS funds. The recipient is acco untable for the performance of the project, program, or activity; the appropriate expenditure of fund s under the award by all parties; and all other obligations of the recipient, as cited in the NoA. In genera l, the requirements that apply to the recipient, including public policy requirements, also apply to subrecipients and contractors under gran ts, unless an exception is specified. Public Policy Requirements This section addresses public policy requirements applicable to some or all HHS applications and/or awards. These requirem ents are in addition to the pre-award requirements specified in Part I or supplem ent the coverage in Pa rt I by indicating how a requirement applies following award. The term \"public policy\" indicates that the requirement is based on social, econom ic, or other objectives or considerations that may be attached to the expenditure of Federal funds by recipients, subrecipients (including consortium participants), or co ntractors under grants, in general, or may relate to the expenditure of Federal funds for specified activities, e.g., research. In addition to cross-cutting requirements base d in statutes, regulations, or Executive orders that some or all Federal agencies must apply to their grant programs, HHS recipients also are subject to requirements that apply to the use of grant funds as contained in HHS annual appropriations acts. Some of those requirements are included here because they have been includ ed in the appropriations acts for several years without change, but those requ irements may be changed or other requirements may be added in the future. As indicated in Part I, by signing the applic ation, the authorized or ganizational official certifies that the organization will comply with applicable public policies. Once a grant is awarded, the recipient is responsible for establishing and maintaining the necessary processes to monitor its complia nce and that of its employees and, as appropriate, subrecipients and contractors under the grant with these requirements; taking appropriate action to meet the stat ed objectives; and informing the OPDIV of any problems or concerns. If a grant is awarded on the basis of false or misrepresented information, or if a recipien t does not comply with these public policy requirements, the OPDIV or other cogniz ant office may take any necessary and appropriate action with respect to the recipient or the award. Exhibit 3, which includes public policy requir ements cited in Part I and in this section, contains information to help the applicant/recipient determine what public policy II-2 requirements and objectives apply to its activities. The exhibit indicates, by exception, whether a requirement applie s to less than all OPDIVs meeting the threshold requirement; for example, if a requirement applies to research awards, it applies to all OPDIVs awarding research gr ants unless otherwise specified. The table indicates\u2014by \"Y\" for Yes or \"NA\" for Not Applicable\u2014whether a given public policy requirement normally would apply to the recipient and under wh at conditions and whether it is required to be flowed down under subawards or contracts under grants for routine goods and services. However, even if the exhibit indicates that a requirement is not applicable, that public policy requirement potentially could be applicable in a specific situation, for exam ple, if a contract under a grant involves research activity. Therefore, this exhibit should be used as general guidance only. The applicant/recipient shou ld consult the funding opportunity announcement and the NoA (if applicable) as well as the statute, regulations, or other cited policies or documents for complete information and should contact the GMO if there is any question concerning the applicability of a particular public policy requirement or objective.

II-6 Standards of Conduct fo r Recipient Employees HHS requires recipients to establish safe guards to prevent employees, consultants, members of governing bodies, and others who may be involved in grant-supported activities from using their positions for purposes that are, or give the appearance of being, motivated by a desire for private financial gain for themselves or others, such as those with whom they have family, busi ness, or other ties. These safeguards must be reflected in written standards of conduct. Except as provided below, HHS does not require a recipient to establish separate standards of conduct if it maintains such standards for its non-grant- supported activities, as long as those standards are consistent with State and local laws and cover, at a minimum, expected conduct in regard to financial interests, gifts, grat uities and favors, nepo tism, and such other areas for governmental organizations as political participation and bribery. The standards also must do the following: Address the conditions under which outside activities, relationships, or financial interests are proper or improper. Provide for advance notification of outsid e activities, relationships, or financial interests to a responsible organizational official. Include a process for notifi cation and review by the responsible official of potential or actual violat ions of the standards. Specify the nature of penalties that the recipient may impose. These penalties would be in addition to any penalties that HHS or a cognizant Federal agency may impose for infractions that also violate the terms and conditions of award. Recipients are not required to submit it s general standards of conduct to HHS for review or approval. However, a copy mu st be made available to each of the recipient's officers; each employee and co nsultant working on the grant-supported program, project, or activity; each member of the governing board, if applicable; and, upon request, the OPDIV. The recipient is responsibl e for enforcing its standards of conduct, taking appropriate action on in dividual infractions, an d, in the case of financial conflict of interest, informing the GMO if the infraction is related to a research award (see \"Other Research-Relat ed Requirements\u2014Financial Conflict of Interest\" for the specific regulatory requirements that apply to financial conflict of interest under research grants). If a suspension or separation action is ta ken by a recipient agai nst a PI/PD or other key personnel, the recipi ent must request prior approval of the proposed replacement. II-7 Hatch Act The Hatch Act restricts political activity of executive branch empl oyees of the federal government and District of Columbia government employees (5 U.S.C. 7321-7328) and State or local officers or employees (5 U.S.C. 1501-1528). \"State or local officer or employee\" means an indi vidual employed by a Stat e or local agency whose principal employment is in connection with an activity that is financed in whole or in part by loans or grants made by the Unit ed States or a Federal agency. (Certain State educational or research institutions are excluded from this definition.) Age Discrimination Act of 1975 The Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq ., prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in any program or acti vity receiving Federal financial assistance. The HHS implementing regulations ar e codified at 45 CFR part 91. Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq ., provides that no person in the United States will, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. The HHS implementing regulations ar e codified at 45 CFR part 80. Education Amendments of 1972 Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681, 1682, 1683, 1685, and 1686, provides that no pers on in the United St ates will, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. The HHS implemen ting regulations are codified at 45 CFR part 86. Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Section 504 of the Rehabilitati on Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794, as amended, provides that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States will, solely by reason of the handicap, be excluded from pa rticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under an y program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. These requirements pertain to the provision of benefits or services as well as to employment. The HHS implementing regulati ons are codified at 45 CFR parts 84 and 85. II-8 Biological Agents and Toxins USA PATRIOT Act The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) amends 18 U.S.C. 175- 175c. Among other things, it prescribes cr iminal penalties for possession of any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system of a type or in a quantity that is not reasonably justified by a prophylactic, protective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purpose. The act also establis hes restrictions on access to specified materials. \"Restricted persons,\" as defi ned by the act, may not possess, ship, transport, or receive any biological agent or toxin that is listed as a select agent (see \"Public Health Security and Bioterro rism Preparedness and Response Act \" in this subsection). Public Health Security and Bioterro rism Preparedness and Response Act The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, 42 U.S.C. 201 Note, is designed to provide pr otection against misuse of select agents and toxins, whether inadvertent or the resu lt of terrorist acts against the U.S. homeland, or other criminal acts (see 42 U.S.C. 262a). The act was implemented, in part, through regulations published by CDC at 42 CFR part 73, Select Agents and Toxins. Copies of these regulations are av ailable from the Import Permit Program and the Select Agent Program, respecti vely, CDC, 1600 Clifton Road, MS E-79, Atlanta, GA 30333; telephone: 404-498-2255. Th ese regulations also are available at http://www.cdc.gov/od/oh s/biosfty/shipregs.htm. Research involving select agents and reco mbinant DNA molecules also is subject to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving DNA Molecules (see \" Guidelines for Research Involving DNA Molecules and Human Gene Transfer Research \" in this section). Human Subjects HHS regulations for the protec tion of human subjects, in 45 CFR part 46, implement Section 491(a) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 289(a), and provide a systematic means, based on established, internationally recogn ized ethical principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of individu als who participate as subjec ts in research activities supported or conducted by HHS. The Federal regulations require that each institution, domestic or foreign, engaged in human subjects research provide OHRP with a satisfactory assurance of compliance with the regulations, unless the resear ch is exempt under 45 CFR 46.101(b). An institution becomes engaged in human sub jects research when its employees or agents (1) intervene or interact with living individuals for research purposes, or (2) obtain individually identifiable private information for research purposes (45 CFR 46.102(f)). For purposes of 45 CFR pa rt 46, research means a systematic investigation, including research, development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowle dge. Activities that meet this definition constitute research for purposes of this po licy, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program that is considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service pr ograms may include re search activities. II-9 The HHS regulations specify that depart ments and agencies cannot conduct or support research covered by this policy unless the institution has an assurance approved by OHRP, and only if the institution has certified to the OPDIV that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB prov ided for in the assurance and will be subject to continuing review by the IRB. Under no co ndition will research covered by Section 46.03 of the regulation s be supported prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB (45 CFR 46.103(b) and (f)). The regulations specify additional protecti ons for research involving human fetuses, pregnant women, and neonates (Subpart B); prisoners (Subpart C); and children (Subpart D). The use of auto psy materials is governed by applicable State and local law and is not directly regulated by 45 CFR part 46. Office for Human Research Protections' and Recipient Responsibilities Assurances and Other OHRP Responsibilities On behalf of the Secretary, HHS, OHRP ne gotiates assurances covering all of an institution's federally supported research activities involving human subjects.11 Applicants proposing to involve human subjec ts in nonexempt research must file (or have previously filed) a written assurance (FWA) with OHRP setting forth the commitment of the institution to establish appropriate policies and procedures for the protection of human subjects. For inst itutions proposing nonexempt research involving human subjects and not currently holding an approved assurance, OHRP will negotiate an FWA. Each legally separate entity must file its own FWA even if the institution does not operate its own IRB and designates another IRB (registered with OHRP and agreeing to the designation) for that purpose. Affiliated institutions or organizations that will serve as additional performanc e sites for the grant-supported research also must file an FWA. OHRP also has responsibility for oversight of recipien t compliance with the HHS human subjects regulations. In carrying out this responsibility, OHRP evaluates all written substantive allegations or indications of non-compliance with the HHS regulations it receives from any source. All compliance oversight evaluations are based on the HHS regulations and the institution's assurance of compliance. Any corrective actions imposed as a result of compliance oversight evaluations are intended to remedy identified non-complia nce and prevent recurrence. Because each case is different, OHRP tailors corrective acti ons to foster the best interests of human research subjects and, to the extent possibl e, of the institution, research community, and HHS. Most compliance oversight evaluati ons and resultant corrective actions are resolved at the OHRP level. However, OH RP may recommend actions to be taken by other HHS officials. 11 As of February 28, 2001, OHRP no longer accepts applications for Multiple Project Assurances (MPAs) or Single Pr oject Assurances (SPAs) limited to HHS- supported research, to special categories of research, or to individual research projects. All MPAs have been superseded. Cu rrent SPAs will remain in effect through the expiration of their respective grant (or contract) award and any non-competing continuation award. II-10 Detailed information about FWA preparat ion and negotiation and about OHRP activities related to oversight and compliance, as well as copies of the human subjects regulations, may be obtained from OHRP at the address shown in Part III or from its home page at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp . OHRP also has produced a publication, available through GPO,12 and an instructional videotape, the OHRP Assurance Training Module, which is available on the OHRP Web site. Institutional Review Board Certificat ion and Other Recipient Responsibilities The recipient bears ultimate responsibility for protecting human subjects under the award, including human subjec ts at all sites, and for en suring that an assurance approved by OHRP and certification of IR B review and approval have been obtained before human subjects research can be co nducted at each collaborating site. HHS will not award a grant for no nexempt research in which human subjects are involved unless the applicant/recipient provides a certification to the OPDIV that the research has been approved by an appropriate IRB, consistent with 45 CFR part 46, within 12 months before the budget period start date. It also is the recipient's re sponsibility to comply with prior-approval requirements related to the addition of sites not included in the approved application. The list of organizations with approved assurances is available at the OHRP Web site (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp) . Recipients may not draw funds from the payment system, request funds from the paying offi ce, or make obligations against Federal funds for research involvin g human subjects at any si te engaged in nonexempt research for any period not covered by both an OHRP-approved assurance and IRB approval consistent with 45 CFR part 46. Co sts associated with IRB review of human research protocols are not allowable as dire ct charges under grants unless such costs are not covered by the organiza tion's indirect cost rate. Regardless of when the IRB review occurs (b efore objective review or just-in-time as specified in Part I or before award of a non-competing continuation award), the IRB should ensure that the research described in the application is consistent with any corresponding protocols reviewed and approv ed by the IRB. As specified in 45 CFR 46.111, the IRB review must include a determination that, for research covered by the regulations, the following conditions are met: The procedures to be used will minimize risks to subjects. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to expected benefits, if any, to subjects and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. Selection of subjec ts is equitable. Informed consent is sought from each prospective subjec t or the subject's legally authorized representative an d is appropriately documented in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the regulation. 12 Protecting Human Research Subjects: Institutional Review Board Guidebook , 1993, Stock No. 017-040-00525-3, may be ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, telephone: 202-512- 1800. This guidebook is also available from OHRP's website ( http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/irb/irb_guidebook.htm ). II-11 When appropriate, the research plan ma kes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects, the protection of privacy, and the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are lik ely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, pris oners, pregnant women, people with acute or severe physical or mental illn ess, or people who are economically or educationally disadvantaged, appropriate additional safeguards are included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. Protection of Research Subjects' Identities HHS expects recipients and others involved in grant-supported research to take appropriate actions to protect the confidenti ality of information about and the privacy of individuals participating in the research. Investigators, IRBs, and other appropriate entities should ensure that policies and pr ocedures are in place to protect identifying information and must oversee compliance with those policies and procedures. Animal Welfare As specified in Part I of the HHS GPS, the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals requires applicants proposing to use vertebrate animals in HHS- supported activities to file a written An imal Welfare Assuranc e with OLAW. The PHS policy defines \"animal\" as \"any live, vertebrate animal used or intended for use in research, research training, ex perimentation, biological test ing, or related purposes.\" The PHS policy implements and supplements the U.S. Government Principles for Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animal s used in Testing, Research, and Training . The PHS policy also requires the applicant to establish appropriate policies and procedures for the humane care and use of animals, based on the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and to comply with the Animal Welfare Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq ., and its implementing regulations. This includes appointing an IACUC with specified responsibilities. The PHS policy does not affect applicable State or local laws or regulations that impose more stringent standards for the care and use of laboratory animals. Verification of the IACUC revi ew of proposed research involving animals may be filed at any time before award unless required earlier by the OPDIV. Regardless of when the review occurs, the IACUC should ensu re that the research described in the application is consistent with any correspon ding protocols reviewed and approved by the IACUC. When organizations collaborate and multiple recognized IACUCs may be involved, only one of those IACUCs is requ ired to review the research project or evaluate a program facility. In such cases, organizations must defi ne their respective responsibilities to ensure compliance with th e policy. If both organizations have full Animal Welfare Assurances, they may exercise discretion in determining which IACUC will review the research protocol and under which organization's program the research will be performed. An applicant/recipient without an animal care and use program or IACUC may enter into an inte r-organizational agreement to use the IACUC of an organization with an assurance. Assured organiza tions also have the option, with OLAW approval, to amend th eir Animal Welfare Assurances to cover performance sites without such assura nces. Foreign organizations proposing activities involving vertebrate animals are required to comply with the PHS policy or II-12 provide evidence that acceptable standard s for the humane care and use of animals will be met. Information about preparing and submitting Animal Welfare Assurances and copies of the PHS policy and other relevant ma terials are available from OLAW (see Part III for contact information ). Other Research-Related Requirements Research Misconduct The recipient is responsibl e for the actions of its em ployees and other research collaborators, including third parties, involved in the project. The recipient will inquire into and, if necessary, investigate and resolve promptly and fairly all instances of alleged or apparent research misconduct. 42 CFR part 93, \"Public Health Service Policies on Research Misconduct,\" 13 specifies recipient responsibilities for dealing with and reporting po ssible research misconduct. Th e regulation is available from ORI on its home page ( http://www.ori.dhhs.gov ) and in hard copy at the address shown in Part III. The recipient must carry out its responsibilities with extra care if a research misconduct inquiry has been initiated as specified in 42 CFR 93.307 or if the recipient or ORI has made a finding of research misconduct. The recipient must report promptly to ORI any incident of alleged or apparent research misconduct that it judges as warranting investigation and must advise ORI of any decision to initiate an investigation. The recipient al so must notify ORI if it in tends to close a case at the inquiry or investigation stage based on an admission of responsibi lity, settlement, or for any other reason. The regula tions also require that the recipient submit an annual report. If a misconduct investigation has been initiated, the recipient must take any necessary steps, in addition to its norm al and ongoing responsibilities under the grant, to protect the scientific integrity of the project, protec t human subjects and animals, provide reports to ORI, and ensu re the proper expenditure of funds and continuation of the project during the investigation, if appropriate. ORI staff members are available to help recipients with investigating and reporting on research misconduct, and POs are available to provide technical assistance and to work with recipients to protect funded projects from the adverse effects of research misconduct. If the recipient finds rese arch misconduct by anyone working on an HHS grant- supported project, whether at its organizati on or at a third-party organization, the recipient must assess the effect of that finding on the ability to continue that project, as originally approved, and must promptly request OPDIV prior approval of any intended change of PI or other key personnel (see \"Prior Approval Requirements\u2014 OPDIV Prior Approval\"). In addition, the awar ding office may impo se sanctions, such as withdrawal of approval of the PI/PD or other key person nel, disallowance of costs associated with the invalid or unreliable research, withholding a non-competing 13 For this purpose and financial conflict of interest in the next subsection, PHS includes the following OPDIVs with research programs: NIH, CDC, FDA, HRSA, OPHS, and AHRQ. II-13 continuation award, suspension or termination, in whole or in part, of the current award, or debarment. If research misconduct has af fected data validity or reliability, ORI or the OPDIV may require the recipient and its employee/collabo rator authors to submit a correction or retraction of the data to a journal, pu blish the corrected data, or both. If the recipient does not comply with this requ irement, the OPDIV ma y invoke its rights, under 45 CFR part 74 or 92, to access th e data (including co pyrightable material developed under the award), have the data reviewed, and submit the correction. The recipient must promptly report issues involving potential civil or criminal fraud, such as false claims or misappropriatio n of Federal funds, to the HHS OIG (see Part III). Financial Conflict of Interest Recipients and investigators must comply with the requirements of 42 CFR part 50, Subpart F, \"Responsibility of Applicants for Promoting Objectivity in Research for Which PHS Funding Is Sought.\" That subpart promotes objectivity in research by establishing standards to ensure that the design, conduct, and re porting of research funded under PHS grants or cooperative agreements will not be biased by any conflicting financial interest of an investigator. These requirements do not apply to Phase I of the SBIR/STTR programs. Under those requirements the organi zation must do the following: Have a written and enforced administra tive process to identify and manage, reduce, or eliminate conflicting financia l interests with respect to research projects for which PHS funding is sought Before spending any PHS funds awarded under a new award, inform the GMO of the existence of any conflicting financial interests it identified of the type covered by 42 CFR 50.605 and assure th at the interest been managed, reduced, or eliminated in accordance with the regulations Continue to make similar reports on subsequently identified conflicts within 60 days of identifying them Make additional information available to the OPDIV, upon request, as to how it handled conflicting interests in accordance with the regulations. As described in the regulations, examples of how financial conflicts of interest might be addressed include the following: Public disclosure of significant financial interests Monitoring of research by independent reviewers Modification of th e research plan Disqualification from participation in all or a portion of the research funded by PHS Divestiture of significant financial interests II-14 Severance of relationships that crea te actual or potential conflicts. Recipients also must ensure that subaward s in the form of consortium agreements address whether the consortium participan t's employees will be subject to the financial conflict of interest requirements of the consortium participant or to those of the recipient. Some IRBs also consider investigator financial conflict of interest in their deliberations, although they are not required to do so. If an IRB considers the impact of potential financial (or other) conflicts of interest on the research and the protection of human subjects , it should refer to the organization's policies and procedures for identifying and monitoring conflicts of interest. Following are some strategies used by IRBs: Make IRB members aware of the organizati on's conflict of interest policies and procedures Include a statement in the informed consent form that all investigators comply with the organizational guidelines Ask investigators to complete a short questionnaire about whether they\u2014or any person responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of research\u2014 have an economic interest in or act as an officer or a director of any outside entity whose financial interest could reas onably appear to be affected by the research Instruct IRB members during their orientation on how to identify and respond to a perceived financial, academic, or other conflict of interest. Suggestions for recipients to consider when implementing the requirements of this regulation are available in an NIH publication, Financial Conflict of Interest- Objectivity in Research: Institutional Policy Review, available on the NIH Web site at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coi/nih_review.htm . Recombinant DNA and Human Gene Transfer Research The NIH Guidelines for Research Invo lving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines) (April 2002 or latest revision) a pply to (1) all research projects that involve recombinant DNA and are conducted at or sponsored by an organization that receives support for recombinant DNA resear ch, or (2) research projects involving testing in humans of materials containing recombinant DNA developed with HHS funds, if the organization that developed the materials sponsors or participates in those projects. The NIH guid elines are available at http://www4.od.nih.gov/oba/rac/guidelines/guidelines.html . As defined by the NIH guidelines, recombinant DNA molecules are either (1) molecules that are constructed outside of living cells by joining natural or synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell or (2) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (1). The NIH guidelines apply to both basic an d clinical research studies. Recombinant DNA research involving select agents also is subject to pertinent CDC and USDA II-15 regulations.14 Specific guidance for the conduct of human gene transfer studies appears in Appendix M of the NIH guidelines. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in suspension or termination of an award for recombinant DNA research at the organization, or a re quirement for OPDIV prior approval of any or all recombinant DNA projects at the organization. The recipient should carefully review the NIH guidelines in their entirety to ensure compliance with all of the requirements for projects involving recombinant DNA techniques. Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research and Cloning HHS funds may not be used to support human embryo research under any extramural award instrument. HHS funds may not be used for the creation of a human embryo for research purposes or fo r research in which a human embryo is destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero under 45 CFR 46.204 and 46.207 and Subsection 498(b) 42 U.S.C. 289g(b). The term \"human embryo\" includes any organism not protected as a human subject under 45 CFR part 46, as of the date of enactment of th e governing appropriations act, that is derived by fertilization, parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means from one or more human gametes or human diploid cells. In addition to the statutory restrictions on human fetal research under Subsection 498((b) of the PHS Act, HHS is prohibited, by a March 4, 1997, Presidential memorandum, from using Federal funds for cloning human beings. Research on Human Fetal Tissue Human fetal tissue is defined as tissue or cells obtained from a dead human embryo or fetus after a spontaneous or induced aborti on or stillbirth. This definition does not include established human fetal cell lines. Research involving the transplantation of human fetal tissue must be conducted in accordance with applicable State and local laws and with the following guidance. The scientific and ethical challenges associated with research utilizing human fetal tissue make it imperative th at researchers and their orga nizations be fully aware of and in compliance with the Federal requir ements, particularly Section 498B of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 289g-2. The statute specifically prohibits any person from knowingly acquiring, receiving, or transferring any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration. The term \"valuable consideration\" is a concept similar to profit and does not include reasonable payment for costs associated with the collection, processing, preservation, storage, quality co ntrol, or transportation of these tissues. Violation of this statute carries criminal pena lties that apply to both those that supply and those that acquire human fetal tissue. 14 See 42 CFR part 73, Select Agents and Toxins; and 7 CFR part 331 and 9 CFR part 121, Possession, Use, and Transfer of Biological Agents and Toxins. II-16 Sections 498A and 498B of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 289g-1 and 289g-2, contain additional legal requirements for research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes conducted or supported by PHS. Under Section 498A, the recipient must adhere to the following provisions: The woman who donates the fetal tissue mu st sign a statemen t declaring that the donation is being made h for therapeutic transplantation research, h without any restriction regarding the identity of individuals who may receive the transplantation, and h without the donor knowing the identity of the individual receiving the transplantation. The attending physician must sign a statement that he/she has h obtained the tissue in accordance with the donor's signed statement and h fully disclosed to the donor his or her intent, if any, to use the tissue in research and any known medical risks to the donor or risks to her privacy associated with the donation that are in addition to risk s associated with the woman's medical care. In the case of tissue obtained pursuant to an induced abortion, the physician's statement also must state that he/she h obtained the woman's consent for the abortion before requesting or obtaining consent for the tissue to be used; h did not alter the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate the pregnancy solely for the purpose of obtaining the tissue for research; and h performed the abortion in accordance with applicable State and local laws. The PI must sign a statemen t certifying that he/she is aware that the tissue is human fetal tissue obtained in a sp ontaneous or induced abortion, or pursuant to a stillbirth, and that the tissue was donated for research purposes. The PI also must certify that this information has been shared with others who have responsibi lities regarding the research and, before eliciting informed consent from the transplantation recipient, will obtain written acknowledgment that the pa tient is aware of the afor ementioned information. The PI must certify in writing that he/she has had no part in any decisions as to the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate the pregnancy. The recipient must certify that the physician's statement, the PI's statement, and the acknowledgment of the transplantation reci pient must be available for audit by the HHS Secretary or designee. Information for organizations conducting re search on human fetal tissue, including information on the governing Federal statutes, Sections 498A and 498B of the PHS II-17 Act, 42 U.S.C. 289g-1 and 298g-2, is available on the NIH Web site at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not93-235.html . Transplantation of Human Fetal Tissue If research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue is conducted under the grant-supported project, the recipient mu st make available for audit by the HHS Secretary or designee, the ph ysician statements and inform ed consents required by Subsections 498A(b)(2) and (c) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 289g-1(b)(2) and (c) or must ensure HHS access to those records, if maintained by an entity other than the recipient. This requirement is in additi on to the requirements concerning human subjects in research. In addition, FDA issued a letter on Nove mber 30, 2000, indicating that it has jurisdiction over fetal cells and tissues intended for use in humans. FDA requests that investigators contact it to determine whether any planned or ongoing clinical research would require submi ssion of an IND application. Additional information and FDA contact information is available at http://www.fda.gov/cb er/ltr/fetal113000.htm . Certificates of Confidentiality Section 301(d) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 241, provides that the Secretary may authorize people engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research activities to protect the privacy of research subjects by withholding the names and other identifying characteristics of those su bjects from individuals not engaged in the research. Individuals that have authorization may not be compelled to disclose subjects' identities in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative or other proceeding. CoCs may be granted for studies collecting information that, if disclosed, could have adverse consequences for subjects or damage their financial standing, employability, insurability, or reputation. By protecting researchers from being compel led to disclose information that would identify research subjects, CoCs contribu te to achieving research objectives and promote participation in studies by helping to ensure confidentiality and privacy to participants. Information on CoCs is available on the NIH Web site at the CoC Kiosk at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coc/index.htm . Requests for CoCs should be submitted to the GMO, and, subject to OP DIV review and approval, a certificate may be issued pursuant to Section 301(d). Investigational New Drug Applications /Investigational Device Exceptions To be eligible for funding, all clinical research involving INDs, drugs approved for a different indication, or experimental combinations of drugs must meet FDA IND regulations, FDA human subjects' protecti on requirements, and HHS human subjects' requirements. As provided in the FDA regulations, an IND or IDE also may apply to biologics or devices. The FDA regulations are published in 21 CFR parts 50 and 312. The official sponsor of the IN D/IDE, whether a Federal agen cy, a recipient, or a third party, is legally responsible for meetin g the FDA requiremen ts. If the IND/IDE sponsor is a third party, such as a pharma ceutical company or research organization under contract to a recipient or to a pharma ceutical company, the legal responsibility for monitoring the clinical trial and report ing to FDA rests with the sponsor rather than the recipient. This generally will be the case for larger, multi-site clinical trials. If the recipient is the IN D/IDE holder, commonly referre d to as an \"investigator- II-18 initiated IND/IDE,\" the recipient or the investigator serves as the sponsor and assumes the legal responsibili ty. In any case, the recipient is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirem ents for protection of human subjects, including compliance wi th FDA's requirements. Following the filing of an IND, FDA has a 30-day period in which to review it. FDA may allow the IND to proceed or may defe r approval of the IND until changes it deems acceptable are made. FDA also may or der a clinical trial to be suspended or terminated, at any time, based on information it receives about that clinical trial. When HHS funds all, or part of, a clinical study involving an IND or an IDE, the OPDIV must be aware of any significant communications with FDA concerning the study. The recipient must report certain types of FDA communications to the OPDIV within 72 hours of receiving a copy of or upon being informed of the FDA communication (through the PI or another pe rson acting on behalf of the recipient), whichever occurs first. This notification requirement applies to any of the following communications from FDA with th e sponsor of the IND or IDE: Warning letters (whether sent to the re cipient or to the commercial sponsor) Notice of Initiation of Disqualification Proceedings and Notice of Opportunity to Explain Notice of Opportunity for Hearing Notice of Disqualification Consent agreements Clinical hold letters that pertain to breaches of good manufacturing practices, good clinical practices, or other major issue requiring significant changes in the protocol. The notification should be made in writing, but also may be done by telephone if a written notice would delay the notification. It should include a statement of the action taken or contemplated and the assi stance needed to resolve the situation. These requirements apply to th e recipient even if the recipi ent or the funded PI is the sponsor. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in HHS imposing a corrective and/or enforcement action. FD A communications are considered grant- related records for purposes of retention and access. Controlled Substances Grantees are prohibited fr om knowingly using appropriated funds to support activities that promote the legalization of any drug or other substance included in Schedule I of the schedule of controlled substances established by section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 812. This limitation does not apply if the recipient notifies the GMO that there is si gnificant medical evidence of a therapeutic advantage to the use of such drug or other substance or that federally sponsored clinical trials are being conducted to determine therapeutic advantage. If controlled substances are proposed to be administered as part of a research protocol or if research is to be conducted on the drugs themselves, II-19 applicants/recipients must ensure that the DEA requirements, including registration, inspection, and certification, as applicable, are met. Regional DEA offices can supply forms and information concerning the type of registration required for a particular substance for research use. The main registration office in Washington, DC, may be reached at 800-882-9539. Information also is available from the National Institute on Drug Abuse at 301-443-6300. Construction-Related Requirements In addition to those requirements specified in \"Requirements Related to Construction, Modernization, and Other Designated Activities,\" the following public policy requirements apply to grants that involve construction or A&R. Flood Insurance The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq ., provides that no Federal financial assistance to acquire, modernize, or construct property may be provided in identified flood-prone communities in the United States, unless the community participates in the National Flood Insurance Program and flood insurance is purchased within 1 year of the identification. The flood insurance purchase requirement applies to both pub lic and private applicants for HHS support. Lists of flood-prone areas that are eligible for flood insurance are published in the Federal Register by FEMA. Architectural Barriers The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq ., as amended, the Federal Property Management Regulati ons (see 41 CFR 102-76), and the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards issued by GSA (see 36 CFR 1191, Appendixes C and D) set forth requirements to make faci lities accessible to, and usable by, the physically handicapped and include minimu m design standards. All new facilities designed or constructed with HHS gr ant support must comply with these requirements. These minimum standards must be included in the specifications for any HHS-funded new construction unless the recipient proposes to substitute standards that meet or exc eed these standards. Where HHS assistance is provided for alteration or renovation (including modernization and expansion) of existing facilities, the altered facility (or part of the facility) must comply, including use of the minimum standards in the specifications. Th e recipient is responsible for conducting inspections to ensure compliance with thes e standards by any contractor performing construction services under the grant. Clean Air and Clean Water Act 42 U.S.C. 7606 and EO 11738 provide for the protection and enhancement of the quality of the nation's air resources to promote public health and welfare and for restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. Safe Drinking Water Act 42 U.S.C. 300h-3 provides for the protecti on of underground sources of drinking water that have an aquifer, which is the so le source of drinking water. Specifically, II-20 no grant may be entered into for any pro ject that the EPA Administrator determines may contaminate such aquifer. Health, Safety, and Related Requirements Restriction on Funding Abortions HHS funds may not be spent for an abortion. Restriction on Distribution of Sterile Needles/Needle Exchange Funds appropriated for HHS may not be used to carry out any program of distributing sterile needles or syringes for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug. Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information The \"Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information\" (the Privacy Rule) implement the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, 42 U.S.C. 1320d et seq ., which governs the protection of individually identifiable health information. The Privacy Rule is administered and enforced by HHS's OCR and is codified at 45 CFR parts 160 and 164. Not all HHS recipients are subject to the Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule applies only to \"covered entities,\" as define d by the rule, which include heal th plans and most health-care providers. The OCR Web site ( http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa ) provides information on the Privacy Rule, including the complete text of the regulation and a set of decision tools for determining whether a particular entity is subject to the rule. An educational booklet, Protecting Health Information in Research: Understanding the HIPAA Privacy Rule, is available through OCR's Web site and at http://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov/ . That Web site al so includes other educational materials approved by OCR and the HHS Office of th e General Counsel. Confidentiality of Patient/Client Records Section 543 of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 290 dd-2, requires that records of substance abuse patients be kept confidential ex cept under specified circumstances and purposes. The covered records are those that include the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of any patient maintained in connection with any program or activity relating to substance abuse education, prevention, training, treatment, rehabilitation, or research that is conducte d, regulated, or directly or indirectly assisted by any department or agency of the United States. This requirement is implemented in 42 CFR part 2. Drug-Free Workplace The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. 701 et seq ., requires that all organizations receiving grants from any Federal agency agree to maintain a drug- free workplace. The recipient must notify the awarding office if an employee of the recipient is convicted of violating a criminal drug statute. Failure to comply with these requirements may be cause for debarment. HHS im plementing regulations are II-21 set forth in 45 CFR part 82, \"Governm entwide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace (Financial Assistance).\" Pro-Children Pro-Children Act of 1994, 20 U.S.C. 7183 , imposes restrictions on smoking in facilities where federally funded children's services are provided. HHS grants are subject to these requirements only if they meet the Act' s specified coverage. The Act specifies that smoking is prohibited in any indoor facility (owned, leased, or contracted for) used for the routine or re gular provision of kindergarten, elementary, or secondary education or library services to children under the age of 18. In addition, smoking is prohibited in any indoor facility or portion of a facility (owned, leased, or contracted for) used for the routine or regular provision of federally funded health care, day care, or early childhood development, including Head Start services to children under the age of 18. The statutory prohibition also applies if such facilities are constructed, operated, or ma intained with Federal funds. The statute does not apply to children's services provided in private residences , facilities funded solely by Medicare or Medicaid funds, portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment, or facili ties where WIC coupons are re deemed. Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1,000 per violation and/or the im position of an admi nistrative compliance order on the responsible enti ty. Any questions concerning the applicability of these provisions to an HHS grant should be directed to the GMO. Smoke-Free Workplace HHS strongly encourages recipients to provide smoke-free workplaces and to promote the nonuse of tobacco products. HH S defines the term \"workplace\" to mean office space (including priv ate offices and other workspace), conference or meeting rooms, corridors, stairways, lobbies, rest rooms, cafeterias, and other public spaces. Health and Safety Recipients are responsible for meeting Fede ral, State, and local health and safety standards and for establishing and implem enting necessary measures to minimize their employees' risk of injury or illness in activities related to HHS grants. In addition to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, the following regulations must be followed when developing and implem enting health and safety operating procedures and practices for both personnel and facilities: 29 CFR 1910.1030, Bloodborne pathogens; 29 CFR 1910.1450, Occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories; and other applicable occupational health and sa fety standards issued by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration and incl uded in 29 CFR part 1910. These regulations are available at http://www.osha.gov/comp-links.html . Nuclear Regulatory Commission Standard s and Regulations, pursuant to the Energy Reorganization Ac t of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5801 et seq .). Copies may be obtained from the U.S. Nuclear Re gulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001. Recipients are not required to submit docu mented assurance of their compliance with or implementation of these requirements . However, if requested by the OPDIV, II-22 recipients should be able to provide evidence that applicable Federal, State, and local health and safety standards have been cons idered and have been put into practice. Acknowledgment of Federal Funding As required by HHS appropriations acts, a ll HHS recipients must acknowledge Federal funding when issuing statem ents, press releases, requests for proposals, bid invitations, and other documents describing pr ojects or programs funded in whole or in part with Federal funds. Recipients are required to state (1) the percentage and dollar amounts of the total program or pro ject costs financed with Federal funds and (2) the percentage and dollar amount of th e total costs financed by nongovernmental sources. Activities Abroad HHS recipients must ensure that project activities carried on outside the United States are coordinated as necessary with appropriate government authorities and that appropriate lice nses, permits, or approvals are obtained. Limited English Proficiency Recipients of Federal financial assistance mu st take reasonable steps to ensure that people with limited English proficiency have meaningful access to health and social services and that there is effective communication between the service provider and individuals with limited English proficiency. To clarify existing legal requirements, HHS published \"Guidance to Federal Financia l Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons.\" This guidance, which is available at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/ lep/revisedlep.html , provides a description of the factors that recipients should consider in determining and fulfilling their responsibilities to individuals with limited English proficiency under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Under RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq. ), any State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State using appropriated Federal funds must comply with 42 U.S.C. 6962. This includes State and lo cal institutions of higher education or hospitals that receive direct HHS awards. Section 6962 re quires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines de veloped by EPA (40 CFR parts 247-254). Seat Belts Pursuant to EO 13043 (April 16, 1997), Incr easing the Use of Seat Belts in the United States, HHS recipients are encourag ed to adopt and enforce on-the-job seat belt policies and programs for their employees when operatin g vehicles, whether organizationally owned or rented or personally owned. II-23 Cost Considerations General This section addresses the general principles underlying the allowability of costs, differentiates direct co sts from indirect costs, and hi ghlights a number of specific costs and categories of cost. It is not intended to be all-inclusive and should be used as a supplement to the applicable cost principles. The Cost Principles Cost principles establish general standard s for the allowability of costs, provide detailed guidance on the cost accounting tr eatment of costs as direct or indirect costs, and set forth allowability principles for selected items of cost. Applicability of a particular set of cost principles depends on the type of organization making the expenditure. For example, a non-profit or ganization receiving a subaward from a State recipient would be subject to the cost principles for non-pr ofit organizations, while the State would be subject to the cost principles for States, local governments, and Indian tribal governments. The cost principles are set forth in the following documents and are incorporated by reference in 45 CFR 74.27 and 92.22: OMB Circular A-21 \u2014Cost Principles for Educational Institutions (2 CFR part 220) OMB Circular A-87 \u2014Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments15 (2 CFR part 225) OMB Circular A-122 \u2014Cost Principles for Non-Profit Institutions16 (2 CFR part 230) 45 CFR part 74, Appendix E \u2014Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Gran ts and Contracts with Hospitals 48 CFR subpart 31.2 (Federal Acquisition Regulation)\u2014Contract Cost Principles and Procedures\u2014Contracts with Commercial Organizations 15 Additional information on co st allocation plans and indi rect cost rates is found in HHS's A Guide for State, Local and Indian Trib al Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federa l Government - Implementation Guide for Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87 (ASMB C-10), which is available on the Internet at http://www.hhs.gov/grantsnet/state , and Review Guide for State and Local Governments State/Local-Wide Centra l Service Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates , which is available at http://rates.psc.gov/ . 16 Non-profit organizations that are specifically listed in Attachment C to OMB Circular A-122 are subject to the Federal cost principles applicable to commercial organizations (48 CFR subpart 31.2) rather than to the cost principles for non-profit organizations. II-24 Recipients can use their own accounting systems, policies, and procedures to implement the cost principle requirements as long as the standards prescribed in 45 CFR 74.21 or 92.20 for financial manage ment systems are met (see \"Financial Management\"). The cost principles address fo ur tests in determining the allowability of costs. The tests are as follows: Reasonableness (including necessity). A cost is reasonable if, in its nature or amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at th e time the decision was made to incur the cost. The cost principles elab orate on this concept and address considerations such as whether the cost is of a type generally necessary for the organization's operations or th e grant's performance, whether the recipient complied with its established organizational policies in incurring the cost or charge, and whether the indivi duals responsible for the expenditure acted with due prudence in carrying out their responsibilities to the Federal government and the public at larg e as well as to the organization. Allocability. A cost is allocable to a specific grant, function, department, or other component, known as a cost objecti ve, if the goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable to that cost objective in a ccordance with the relative benefits received or other equitable relationship. A cost is allocable to a grant if it is incurred solely in order to advance work under the grant; it benefits both the grant and other work of the organization, including other grant-supported projects or programs; or it is necessary to the overall operation of the organization and is deem ed to be assignable , at least in part, to the grant. Consistency. Recipients must be consistent in assigning costs to cost objectives. They must be treated consiste ntly for all work of the organization under similar circumstances, regardless of the source of funding, so as to avoid duplicate charges. Conformance. This test of allowability\u2014conformance with limitations and exclusions contained in the terms and conditions of award, including those in the cost principles\u2014may vary by the type of activity, the type of recipient, and other characteristics of individual awards. \" Allowable Costs and Activities \" below provides information common to most HHS grants and, where appropriate, specifies some of the distinctions if there is a different treatment based on the type of grant or recipient. These four tests apply regardless of whether the particular category of costs is one specified in the cost principles or one gove rned by other terms and conditions of an award. These tests also apply regardless of tr eatment as a direct cost or an indirect cost. The fact that a proposed cost is awar ded as requested by an applicant does not indicate a determination of allowability. Direct Costs and Indirect Costs Direct costs are costs that can be identifi ed specifically with a particular award, project or program, service, or other organi zational activity or that can be directly assigned to such an activity with a high degree of accuracy. Direct costs include, but II-25 are not limited to, salaries, travel, equipm ent, and supplies dire ctly benefiting the grant-supported project or program. Indi rect costs (also known as \"facilities and administrative costs\") are costs incurred fo r common or joint objectives that cannot be identified specifically with a particular pr oject, program, or organizational activity. Facilities operation and maintenance co sts, depreciation, and administrative expenses are examples of costs that usua lly are treated as indirect costs. The organization is responsible for presenting costs consistently and must not include costs associated with its indi rect rate as direct costs. Reimbursement of Indirect Costs HHS considers activities cond ucted by recipients that re sult in indirect charges a necessary and appropriate part of HHS gr ants. OPDIVs reimbu rse their share of those costs either as a fixed amount or through use of a rate. The amount may be specified in statute, regulations, or policy or be determined based on a rate negotiated by DCA, DFAS in the Office of Acquisition Management and Policy, NIH (responsible for negotiating indirect cost ra tes for for-profit entities receiving awards from HHS), or other cognizant Federal agency and reflected in a formal rate agreement. For certain gove rnmental organizations, am ounts claimed are based on documentation retained by the govern mental organization. State and local governmental organi zations also may be eligible for reimbursement of costs associated with provision of central services as provided in OMB Circular A-87. 17 If an applicant is advised by th e GMO of the need to establis h a rate prior to issuance of a NoA, the GMO will indicate the responsible office to be contact ed. If reimbursement of indirect costs is allowable under an aw ard, HHS will not reimburse those costs unless the recipient has established an indirect cost rate covering the applicable acti vities and period of time unless indirect costs are reimbursed at a fixed rate (e.g., HHS indire ct cost reimbursement for training grants to other than governmental re cipients) or the applicant is not required to submit a proposal to the Federal government as spec ified in OMB Circular A-87. The awarding office uses the applicable indirect cost ra te covering the award budget period (or part thereof) in calculating the amount to be shown or to be included on the NoA. If, on the basis of statute, regulati on, or policy, allowable indirect cost reimbursement is restricted to an amount less than full indirect cost reimbursement, the difference between those two amounts may be used to satisfy a recipient's matching or cost- sharing requirement (see \"Matching or Cost Sharing\"). Indirect cost proposals must be prepared in accordance with the applicable cost principles and guidance provided by th e cognizant office or agency. Further information concerning the establishment of indirect cost rates and the reimbursement of indirect costs may be obtained from DCA or DFAS (see Part III). DCA should be consulted to determine th e need to submit a Disclosure Statement (DS-2) pursuant to the requir ements of OMB Circular A-21. If the GMO determines that a recipient does not have a currently effective indirect cost rate, the award may not include an amount for indire ct costs unless the organization has never established an indirect cost rate (usually a new recipient) and 17 OMB Circular A-87 also addresses public assistance cost allocation plans; however, the types of programs eligible fo r such costs are not covered by this HHS GPS. II-26 intends to establish one. In such cases, the award shall include a provisional amount equaling one-half of the amount of indirect costs requested by the applicant, up to a maximum of 10 percent of direct salaries and wages (exclusive of fringe benefits). If the recipient fails to provide a timely proposal, indirect costs paid in anticipation of establishment of a rate will be disallowed. There are several other limited circum stances under which the GMO may award indirect costs if none were previously awarded or may increase the amount previously awarded. If an award does no t include an amount for indirect costs because the recipient did not submit a timely indirect cost proposal and the recipient subsequently establishes a rate, the GM O may amend the award to provide an appropriate amount for indirect costs if the amendment can be made using funds from the same Federal fiscal year in which the award was made. However, the amount will be limited to the indirect costs applicable to the period after the effective date of the rate agreement. This provisio n does not affect those local governmental agencies that are not required to submit th eir indirect cost proposals to the Federal government. They may charge indirect co sts to HHS grants based on the rate computations they prepare and keep on file for subsequent Federal review. Rebudgeting within the direct cost category may affect the amount of eligible indirect cost reimbursement, depending on the direct cost base on which indirect costs are calculated (for example, salaries and wages). The recipient is expected to accommodate such changes within the ceiling amount of the award. If permissible direct cost rebudgeting or unobligated bala nces of Federal funds result in the need for a lesser amount of indirect costs than awarded or a hi gher permanent rate results in a need for additional indirect cost s beyond those awarde d, recipients may rebudget between direct and in direct costs (in either dire ction) to accommodate such an increase or decrease without OPDIV pr ior approval unless it would constitute a change in the scope of the project (see \"Prior-Approval Requirements\u2014OPDIV Prior Approval\"). Generally, award amounts will not be adjusted based on a negotiated indirect cost rate different from that used at the time of the award (whether competitive segment or budget period). If funds are available, a GMO may, but is not obligated to, amend an award to provide additional funds for indirect costs, but only under the following circumstances: An error was made in computing the award. This includes situations in which a higher rate than the rate used in the grant award is negotiated and the date of the rate agreement for the higher ra te is on or before 1 calendar month prior to the beginning date of the grant budget period. The awarding office restores funds previously recaptured as part of a recipient's unobligated balance. The recipient is eligible for additional in direct costs associat ed with additional direct costs awarded, e. g., a supplemental award. For all recipients other than those subject to OMB Circular A-21, the negotiated rate in effect at the beginning of each budget period will be used as the basis for determining indirect costs for that budge t period. For recipients subject to OMB II-27 Circular A-21, the rate in effect at the beginning of a competit ive segment will be used to determine indirect cost funding le vels for the entire segment. If the rate agreement in effect at the outset of th e competitive segment does not cover the entire competitive segment, then the rate in effect for the last year of the negotiated agreement will be used to determine indirect cost fund ing for the duration of the competitive segment. For all recipients, if th e rate in effect at the beginning of the competitive segment or budget period, as applicable, was provisional and is superseded by a permanent rate, whether higher or lower, the latter rate will be used to determine indirect cost reimbursement. The award will not be adjusted downward, based on a lower permanent indire ct cost rate than a provisional rate used in calculating the award, unless the in direct cost proposal that served as the basis for the negotiation included unallowabl e costs. The OPDIV also is not required to provide any additional funding to accommo date this situation but may do so if an error was made in computing the award as indicated above. The recipient is responsible fo r establishing indirect cost rates for its subrecipients if those subrecipients do not have a current, ap plicable rate negotiated by a cognizant Federal agency. Applicable Credits The term \"applicable credits\" refers to thos e receipt or negative expenditure types of transactions that operate to offset or redu ce direct or indirect cost items. Typical examples are purchase discounts, rebates or allowances, recoveries or indemnities on losses, and adjustments for overpaymen ts or erroneous ch arges. Additional information concerning applicable credits is included in the cost principles. Applicable credits to direct charges made to HHS grants must be treated as an adjustment on the recipient's FSR, whether those credits accrue during or after the period of grant support. The awarding office will notify the recipient of any additional actions that may be necessary. Allowable Costs and Activities The governing cost principles address selected items of cost, some of which are mentioned in this subsection for emphasis. Th is subsection is not intended to be all- inclusive. The cost principles should be consulted for the complete explanation of the allowability or unallowability of costs they address. The allowability of costs under individual OPDIV awards also may be governed by requirements specified in the program legislation, regulations, or the specific terms and conditions of the award, which will take precedence over the general discussion provided here (see \"Overview of Terms and Conditions of Award\u2014Effect an d Order of Precedence \"). Recipients that have questions concerning the allowabili ty of costs should contact the GMO. If a cost is allowable, it is allocable as either a direct cost or an indirect cost, depending on the recipient's accounting system. For some costs addressed in this subsection, the text specifies whether the cost is usually a direct cost or an indirect cost. Unless otherwise indicated in the NoA, an award based on an application that includes specific information concerning an y direct costs or acti vities that require OPDIV prior approval constitutes the prior approval for those costs or activities. The recipient is not required to obtain any additional approval for those costs/activities. If II-28 a cost or activity requiring OPDIV prior approval is not included or fully described in the approved application, th e recipient must obtain post -award prior approval as described in \"Prior Approval Requ irements\u2014OPDIV Prior-Approval\"). Subrecipients and contractors under grants are subject to the re quirements of the cost principles otherwise applicable to their type of organization and to any requirements placed on them by the recipi ent to be able to comply with the terms and conditions of the award. The cost principles do not address profit or fee. HHS policy allows the payment of fee on SBIR/STTR grants, but HHS will not provide profit or fee to any other type of recipient under any other grant program. A fee may not be paid by a recipient to a subrecipient/consortium participant, including a for-profit organization. However, a fee (profit) may be paid to a contractor providing routine goods or services under a grant in accordance with normal commercial practice. Exhibit 4 describes sele cted cost items. II-29 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Advertising Allowable only for recruitment of staff or trainees, procurement of goods and services, disposal of scrap or surplus materials, and other specific purpose necessary to meet the requirements of the grant-supported activity. Alcoholic Beverages Unallowable as an entertainment expense. Allowable if within the scope of an approved project. Alteration and Renovation A&R costs are allowable unless the program legisl ation, implementing regulations, or other terms and conditions of the award specifically exclude such activity. See \"Prior Approval Requirements\u2014 OPDIV Prior-Approval\" for A&R costs requiring GMO prior approval. A&R costs that do not exceed the prior approval thresholds specified in that section (or in Part IV, as applicable) generally are considered \"minor A&R\" and those exceeding that amount generally are considered \"major A&R.\" Major A&R is allowable only if the authorizing statute specifically permits that type of activity, whether characterized as modernization, remodeling, or A&R (see \"Construction\" in this exhibit). A&R must be consistent with the following criteria and documentation requirements: \u00a1 The building has a useful life consistent with program purposes and is architecturally and structurally suitable for conversion to the type of space required. \u00a1 The A&R is essential to the purpose of the grant-supported project or program. \u00a1 The space involved will be occupied by the project or program. \u00a1 The space is suitable for human occupancy before A&R work is started except where the purpose of the A&R is to make the space suitable for some purpose other than human occupancy, such as storage. \u00a1 For minor A&R, if the space is rented, evidence is provided that the terms of the lease are compatible with the A&R proposed and cover the duration of the project period. \u00a1 If the A&R will affect a site listed in (or eligible for inclusion in) the National Register of Historic Places, the requirements specified in \"Preservation of Cultural and Historic Resources\" have been followed. Routine maintenance and repair of the organization's physical plant or its equipment, which is allowable and is ordinarily treated as an indirect cost, is not considered A&R. Work necessary to obtain an initial occupancy permit for the intended use is not an allowable A&R cost. Certain allowable costs of installing equipment, such as the temporary removal and replacement of wall sections and door frames to place equipment in its permanent location, or the costs of connecting utility lines, replacing finishes and furnishings, and installing any accessory devices required for the equipment's proper and safe utilization, may be considered either equipment costs or A&R costs, depending on the recipient's accounting system. A&R costs are not allowable under grants in suppor t of scientific meetings (conference grants). Animals Allowable for the acquisition, care, and use of animals for use in research and research-related activities, contingent upon compliance with the applicable requirements of the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . If the recipient operates an animal resource facility, charges for use of the facility should be determined in accordance with the Cost Analysis and Rate Setting Manual for Animal Resource Facilities (May 2000), available from NIH's National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) ( http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/newspub/CARS.pdf ) or from NCRR's Office and Public Liaison (e-mail: info@ncrr.nih.gov ). II-30 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Audiovisual Activities Allowable for the production of an audiovisual. \"Audiovisual\" means any product containing visual imagery, sound, or both, such as motion pictures, films, videotapes, live or recorded radio or television programs or public service announcements, slide shows, filmstrips, audio recordings, multimedia presentations, or exhibits where visual imagery, sound, or both are an integral part. \"Production\" refers to the steps and techniques used to create a finished audiovisual product, including, but not limited to, design, layout, scriptwriting, filming or taping, fabrication, sound recording, and editing. A recipient with in-house production capability must determine whether it would be more efficient and economical to use that capability or to contract for the production of an audiovisual. If an audiovisual intended for members of the general public (i.e., people who are not researchers, health professions, or service delivery personnel or who are not directly involved in project activities as employees, trainees, or participants, such as clients, volunteers or patients) is produced under an HHS grant-supported project or program, the recipient must submit two prints or tapes of the finished product along with its annual or final progress report. T he costs of such prints or tapes are allowable costs. Audiovisuals produced under a grant-supported project or program must bear an acknowledgment and disclaimer, such as the following: The production of this [type of audiovisual (motion picture, television program, etc.)] was supported by Grant [number of grant] from [name of OPDIV]. Its contents are solely the responsibility of [name of recipient] and do not necessarily represent the official views of [name of OPDIV]. Audit Costs Allowable (as specified in Section 230 of OMB Circular A-133). The charges may be treated as a direct cost when the audit's scope is limited to a single HHS grant-supported project or program, as specified in 45 CFR 74.26(d), or when it includes more than one project but the costs can be specifically identified with, and allocated to, each project on a proportional basis, and this practice is followed consistently by the recipient. Otherwise, charges for audits should be treated as indirect costs. In addition, a pass-through entity may charge an HHS award for the cost of a limited scope audit to monitor a subrecipient provided the subrecipient is not required to have a single audit and the other conditions of Section 230(b) (2) of OMB Circular A-133 are met. Bad Debts Unallowable. Bid and Proposal Costs Allowable as an indirect cost. See 45 CFR 74.27(b)(1) for policy for non-profit organizations covered by OMB Circular A-122. Bonding Allowable. See 45 CFR 74.21, 74.48(c) and 92.36 for policies and requirements concerning bonding. Books and Journals Allowable. If an organization has a library, books and journals generally should be provided as part of normal library services and treated as indirect costs. Capital expenditures for land or buildings See \"Land or Building Acquisition\" in this exhibit. Child-Care Costs Allowable if within the scope of an approved project or program or as incidental costs of a project or program if incurred to enable individuals to participate as subjects in research projects or to receive health services. Such costs also may be allowable as a fringe benefit for individuals working on a grant-supported project (see \"Fringe Benefits\" in this exhibit). Communica-tions Allowable. Such costs include local and long-distance telephone calls, telegrams, express mail, postage, messenger, and electronic or computer transmittal services and usually are treated as indirect costs. Compliance with Historic Preservation Requirements Allowable. May include hiring special consultants to research and document the historic value of proposed performance sites and costs associated with preparation and presentation of required materials to inform the public and others. II-31 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Construction/ Modernization Allowable only when program legislation specifically authorizes new construction, modernization, or other activities considered major A&R, and the OPDIV specifically authorizes such costs in the NoA. When authorized, construction activities may include construction of a new facility or projects in an existing building that are considered to be construction, such as relocation of exterior walls, roofs, and floors; attachment of fire escapes; or completion of unfinished shell space to make it suitable for human occupancy. Consultant Services Allowable. A consultant is an individual retained to provide professional advice or services for a fee but usually not as an employee of the requiring organization. The term \"consultant\" also includes a firm that provides paid professional advice or services. Recipients must have written policies governing their use of consultants that are consistently applied regardless of the source of support. Such policies should include the conditions for paying consulting fees. The general circumstances of allowability of these costs, which may include fees and travel and subsistence costs, are addressed in the applicable cost principles under \"professional services costs.\" In unusual situations, a person may be both a consultant and an employee of the same party, receiving compensation for some services as a consultant and for other work as a salaried employee as long as those separate services are not related to the same project and are not charged to the same project. For example, consulting fees that are paid by an educational institution to a salaried faculty member as extra compensation above that individual's base salary are allowable, provided the consultation is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote operation and the work performed by the consultant is in addition to his or her regular departmental workload. For employee consulting costs to be allowable under grant-supported projects (including subawards or contracts under the grant), recipients, subrecipients, and contractors must establish written guidelines permitting such payments regardless of the source of funding and indicating the conditions under which the payment of consulting fees to employees is proper. Unless subject to OMB Circular A-21, the recipient, subrecipient, or contractor also must document that it would be inappropriate or infeasible to compensate the individual for those services through payment of additional salary. Under no circumstances can an individual be paid as a consultant and an employee under the same HHS grant. Authorization for consulting fees paid to individuals serving as both employees and consultants of the same party must be provided in writing, on a case-by-case basis, by the head of the recipient, subrecipient, or contractor organization incurring the costs, or his/her designee. If the designee is personally involved in the project, the authorization may be given only by the head of the organization. This authorization must include a determination that the required conditions are present and that there is no apparent or actual conflict of interest. Recipients, subrecipients, and contractors under grants are encouraged to obtain written reports from consultants unless such a report is not feasible given the nature of the consultation or would not be useful. Documentation maintained by the receiving organization should include the name of the consulting firm or individual consultant; the nature of the services rendered and their relevance to the grant-supported activities, if not otherwise apparent from the nature of the services; the period of service; the basis for calculating the fee paid (e.g., rate per day or hour worked or rate per unit of service rendered); and the amount paid. This information may be included in the consultant's invoice, in the report, or in another document. II-32 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Consumer/ Provider Board Participation Allowable in accordance with applicable program regulations. When not specifically authorized by program regulations, only the following costs are allowable with OPDIV prior approval: \u00a1 Reasonable and actual out-of-pocket costs incurred solely as a result of attending a scheduled meeting, including transportation, meals, babysitting fees, and lost wages. \u00a1 The reasonable costs of necessary meals furnished by the recipient to consumer or provider participants during scheduled meetings if not reimbursed to participants as per diem or otherwise. Where programmatic regulations permit such payments but establish a maximum annual income for eligibility for reimbursement of consumer/provider board members for wages lost by reason of their participation in board activities, the determination of eligibility will be made on the basis of gross rather than net income. Members of consumer/provider boards are not considered employees or consultants of the recipient. Therefore, they may not be compensated for their services other than as above, nor are they eligible for associated fringe benefits. Although not eligible for individual insurance coverage, board members may be covered by an organizational insurance policy while acting in their official capacities as board members. Contingency Funds Contributions set aside for events whose occurrence cannot be foretold with certainty as to time, intensity, or assurance of their happening are unallowable under nonconstruction grants. Contingency funds do not include pension funds, self-insurance funds, and normal accruals for severance and post-retirement health costs (also see \"Reserve Funds\" in this exhibit). Construction grants may include a contingency fund in initial construction contract cost estimates to provide for unanticipated charges. These funds will be limited to 5 percent of construction and equipment costs before bids or proposals are received and must be reduced to 2 percent after a construction contract has been awarded. Customs and Import Duties Allowable under grants to domestic organizations when performance will take place entirely within the United States, its possessions, or its territories, or when foreign involvement in the project is incidental to the overall grant-supported project. Charges may include consular fees, customs surtaxes, value-added taxes, and other related charges. (Also see \"Requirements for Specific Types of Recipients\" of this part for the allowability of these costs.) Depreciation or Use Allowances Allowable. Such costs usually are treated as indirect costs. Depreciation or use charges on equipment or buildings acquired under a federally supported project are not allowable. Donor Costs Allowable for payment to volunteers or research subjects who contribute blood, urine samples, and other body fluids or tissues that are specifically project related. Drugs Allowable if within the scope of an approved project. Project funds may not be used to purchase drugs classified by FDA as \"ineffective\" or \"possibly effective\" except in approved clinical research projects or in cases where there is no alternative other than therapy with \"possibly effective\" drugs. Recipient acquisition practices for drugs used in outpatient treatment must meet Federal requirements regarding cost-effectiveness and reasonableness as found in 42 CFR part 40, Subpart E, and OMB Circulars A-122 and A-87. Dues or Membership Fees Allowable as an indirect cost for organizational membership in business, professional, or technical organizations or societies. Payment of dues or membership fees for an individual's membership in a professional or technical organization is allowable as a fringe benefit or an employee development cost, if paid according to an established organizational policy consistently applied regardless of the source of funds. Entertainment Costs Unallowable. This includes the cost of amusements, social activities, and related incidental costs. II-33 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Equipment Allowable for purchase of new, used, or replacement equipment as a direct cost or as part of indirect costs, depending on the intended use of the equipment. OPDIV prior approval may be required as specified in \"Prior-Approval Requirements.\" Funds provided under a conference grant may not be used to purchase equipment. For policies governing the classification, use, management, and disposition of equipment, see \"Property Management.\" For policies governing the allowability of costs for rental of equipment, see \"Rental or Lease of Facilities and Equipment\" in this exhibit. Federal (U.S. Government) Employees Only four types of costs\u2014consultant fees, outpatient or subject costs, salary or fringe benefits, and travel costs\u2014can be charged to HHS grants on behalf of Federal employees, and only under the conditions specified. Recipients should advise any Federal employees with whom these types of arrangements may be made to consult with their employing agency concerning their ability to meet the required conditions. Regardless of whether costs will be charged to the grant, special requirements apply when a Federal employee will be involved in an HHS grant-supported activity in any capacity other than as an employee working on a grant to a Federal institution, an outpatient, or a study subject. The requirements of that section do not apply to individuals that are classified as special government employees because of service on advisory groups or as a result of a formal consulting arrangement with a Federal agency. (See the HHS Standards of Conduct at 45 CFR part 73, Subpart J for additional guidance.) See \"Requirements for Specific Types of Recipients\u2014Grants to Federal Institutions and Allowable Costs and Payments to (or on Behalf of) Federal Employees under Grants\"for the allowability of payments made to, or on behalf of, Federal employees under HHS grants. Fines and Penalties Unallowable except when resulting from violations of, or failure of the organization to comply with, Federal, State, or local laws and regulations and incurred as a result of compliance with specific provisions of an award, or when such payments are authorized in advance in writing by the GMO. Fringe Benefits Allowable as part of overall employee compensation in proportion to the amount of time or effort an employee devotes to the grant-supported project or program, provided such costs are incurred under formally established and consistently applied policies of the organization (see \"Salaries and Wages\" in this exhibit). Tuition or tuition remission for regular employees is allowable as a fringe benefit. For organizations subject to OMB Circular A-21, tuition benefits for family members other than the employee are unallowable. For policies applicable to tuition remission for students working on grant-supported research projects, see \"Salaries and Wages\" in this exhibit. Fundraising Costs Unallowable. Hazardous Waste Disposal Allowable. Usually treated as an indirect cost. Honoraria Unallowable when the primary intent is to confer distinction on, or to symbolize respect, esteem, or admiration for, the recipient of the honorarium. A payment for services rendered, such as a speaker's fee under a conference grant, is allowable. Hospitalization See \"Research Patient Care\" in this exhibit. Incentive Costs Incentive payments to volunteers or patients participating in a grant-supported project or program are allowable. Incentive payments to individuals to motivate them to take advantage of grant-supported health care or other services are allowable if within the scope of an approved project. See \"Salaries and Wages\" in this exhibit for incentive payments to employees. Indemnification Allowable to the extent expressly provided in the award for indemnification against liabilities to third parties and any other loss or damage not compensated by insurance or otherwise. The Federal government is obligated to indemnify the institution only to the extent expressly provided for in the NoA. II-34 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Independent Research and Development Costs Unallowable, including their proportionate share of indirect costs. Insurance Allowable. Insurance usually is treated as an indirect cost. In certain situations, however, where special insurance is required as a condition of the grant because of risks peculiar to the project, e.g., provision of health services, the premium may be charged as a direct cost if doing so is consistent with organizational policy. If so, the insurance should be treated as a direct cost and assigned to individual grants based on the manner in which the insurer allocates the risk to the population covered by the insurance. Medical liability (malpractice) insurance is an allowable cost of research programs at educational institutions only if the research involves human subjects. The cost of insuring equipment, whether purchased with grant funds or furnished as federally owned property, normally should be included in indirect costs but may be allowable as a direct cost if this manner of charging is the normal organizational policy. Interest Allowable as an indirect cost for certain assets as specified in the applicable cost principles. Unallowable for hospitals. Invention, Patent, or Licensing Costs Unallowable as a direct cost unless specifically authorized in the NoA. May be allowable as indirect costs provided they are authorized under applicable cost principles and are included in the negotiation of indirect cost rates. Such costs include licensing or option fees, attorney's fees for preparing or submitting patent applications, and fees paid to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for patent application, patent maintenance, or recordation of patent-related information. Land or Building Acquisition Not allowable unless acquisition or construction is specifically authorized by program legislation and provided for in the NoA. Under those programs that have authority to permit recipients to acquire facilities, considerations such as the type of program being supported and the Federal interest in purchased property will be taken into account by the awarding office in determining whether property should be leased or purchased. For real property acquired with grant support, the cost of title insurance may be charged to the grant in proportion to the Federal share of the acquisition cost. Filing fees incurred with the recordation in appropriate official records of the applicable jurisdiction of the Federal interest in the real property also may be charged to the grant. Use allowance or depreciation on buildings that were not acquired under a Federal project are allowable, usually as an indirect cost. Leave Allowable for employees as a fringe benefit (see \"Fringe Benefits\" in this exhibit). See program guidance or Part IV for policy on leave for fellows and trainees. Legal Services Allowable. Generally treated as an indirect cost but, subject to the limitations described in the applicable cost principles, may be treated as a direct cost for legal services provided by individuals who are not employees of the recipient. Before a recipient incurs legal costs that are extraordinary or unusual, the recipient should make an advance agreement regarding the appropriateness and reasonableness of such costs with the GMO. Legal costs incurred in defending or prosecuting claims, whether equitable or monetary, including administrative grant appeals, are unallowable charges, except as provided in the applicable cost principles. Library Services General library support is not allowable as a direct cost but may be included in a recipient's indirect cost pool. These services are allowable as a direct cost when specifically required for the conduct of the project and when identifiable as an integral part of the grant-supported activity (e.g., in those programs designed to develop and support such services). Lobbying Generally unallowable, including costs of lobby ing activities to influence the introduction, enactment, or modification of legislation by the U.S. Congress or a State legislature. Under certain circumstances, as provided in the applicable cost principles, costs associated with activities that might otherwise be considered \"lobbying\" that are directly related to the performance of a grant may be allowable. The recipient should obtain an advance understanding with the GMO if it intends to engage in these activities. II-35 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Meals Generally unallowable except for the following: \u00a1 Subjects and patients under study \u00a1 Where specifically approved as part of the project or program activity, e.g., in programs providing children's services \u00a1 When an organization customarily provides meals to employees working beyond the normal workday, as a part of a formal compensation arrangement \u00a1 As part of a per diem or subsistence allowance provided in conjunction with allowable travel \u00a1 Under a conference grant, when meals are a necessary and integral part of a conference, provided that meal costs are not duplicated in participants' per diem or subsistence allowances. Guest meals are not allowable. (See \"Consumer/Provider Board Participation\" in this exhibit regarding the allowability of the cost of meals for consumer and provider board participants in grant-supported activities.) Moving See \"Recruitment Costs,\" \"Relocation Costs,\" and \"Transportation of Property\" in this exhibit. NEPA Analysis Costs associated with evaluation of the environmental effects of a proposed activity and producing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) are allowable. Overtime See \"Salaries and Wages\" in this exhibit. Pension Plan Costs Allowable. For institutions of higher education and non-profit organizations, the following applies: \u00a1 Such costs must be incurred according to the established policies of the organization consistently applied regardless of the source of funds. \u00a1 The organization's policies must meet the test of reasonableness. \u00a1 The methods of cost allocation must be equitable for all activities. \u00a1 The amount assigned to each fiscal year must be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \u00a1 The cost assigned to a given fiscal year must be paid or funded for all plan participants within 6 months after the end of that fiscal year. State, local, or Indian tribal governments or hospitals may use the \"pay-as-you-go\" cost method (i.e., when pension benefits are paid by the recipient directly to, or on behalf of, retired employees or their beneficiaries) in lieu of the method described above. Under this method, the benefits may be charged in the recipient's fiscal year in which the payments are made to, or on behalf of, retired employees or their beneficiaries, provided that the recipient follows a consistent policy of treating such payments as expenses in the year of payment. See the applicable cost principles for additional information on the allowability of costs associated with pension plans. II-36 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Pre-Award (Pre-Agreement) Costs Allowable. Where authorized by the OPDIV as an expanded authority (see Part IV of the HHS GPS), a recipient may, at its own risk and without OPDIV prior approval, incur obligations and expenditures to cover costs up to (and including) 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new or competing continuation award if such costs \u00a1 are necessary to conduct the project or program, and \u00a1 would be allowable under the grant, if awarded. However, even if authorized as an expanded authority, if a specific expenditure would otherwise require prior approval, the cost or activity must meet the same tests of allowability as if incurred after award. If not authorized as part of expanded authorities, the applicant/recipient must seek OPDIV prior approval before incurring pre-award costs. OPDIV prior approval is required for any costs to be incurred more than 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new or competing continuation award. Recipients may incur pre-award costs before the beginning date of a non-competing continuation award without regard to the time parameters stated above and without prior approval. The incurrence of pre-award costs in anticipation of a competing or non-competing award imposes no obligation on the OPDIV either to make the award or to increase the amount of the approved budget if an award is made for less than the amount anticipated and is inadequate to cover the pre-award costs incurred. Recipients are expected to be fully aware that pre-award costs result in borrowing against future support and that such borrowing must not impair the recipient's ability to accomplish the project or program objectives in the approved time frame or in any way adversely affect the conduct of the project or program. Public Relations Costs Allowable only for costs specifically required by the award or for costs of communicating with the public and the press about specific activities or accomplishments under the grant-supported activity or other appropriate matters of public concern. Such costs may be treated as direct costs but should be treated as indirect costs if they benefit more than one sponsored agreement or if they benefit the grant and other work of the organization. Publications Allowable. Page charges for publication in professional journals are allowable if the published paper reports work supported by the grant and the charges are levied impartially on all papers published by the journal, whether or not by government-sponsored authors. The costs of reprints and publishing in other media, such as books, monographs, and pamphlets, also are allowable. Publications and journal articles produced under an HHS grant-supported activity must bear an acknowledgment and disclaimer, as appropriate, as provided in \"Intellectual Property\u2014Publications.\" Recruitment Costs Allowable subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the applicable cost principles. These costs may include help-wanted advertising costs, costs of travel by applicants for interviews for prospective employment, and travel costs of employees while engaged in recruiting personnel. Grant funds may not be used for a prospective trainee's travel costs to or from the recipient organization for the purpose of recruitment. However, other costs incurred in connection with recruitment under training programs, such as advertising, may be allocated to a grant-supported project according to the provisions of the applicable cost principles (also see \"Travel\" and \"Relocation Costs\" in this exhibit). Registration Fees Allowable for attendance at conferences, symposiums, or seminars if necessary to accomplish project or program objectives. II-37 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Relocation Costs Allowable\u2014in other than change of grantee organization situations\u2014when such costs are incurred incidental to a permanent change of duty assignment (for an indefinite period or for a stated period of no less than 12 months) for an existing employee working on a grant-supported project, or when a new employee is recruited for work on the project, provided that the move is for the recipient's benefit rather than the individual's and that payment is made according to established organizational policies consistently applied regardless of the source of funds. Relocation costs may include the cost of transporting the employee and his or her family, dependents, and household goods to the new location and certain expenses associated with the sale of the former home. If relocation costs have been incurred in connection with the recruitment of a new employee, whether as a direct cost or an indirect cost, and the employee resigns for reasons within his or her control within 12 months after hire, the recipient must credit the grant account for the full cost of the relocation charged to the grant. When there is a change in the grantee organization, the personal relocation expenses of the PI/PD and others moving to the new recipient are not allowable charges. Rental or Lease of Facilities and Equipment Allowable subject to the limitations below. Rental costs are allowable to the extent that the rates are reasonable at the time of the decision to lease in light of such factors as rental costs of comparable property, if any; market conditions in the area; the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased; and available alternatives. Because of the complexity involved in determining the allowable amount under certain types of leases, recipients are encouraged to consult the GMO before entering into leases that will result in direct charges to an award. In general, the rental costs for facilities and equipment applicable to each budget period should be charged to that period. However, see \"Property Management\" for an exception to this general rule. Rental costs under leases that create a material equity in the leased property, as defined in the applicable cost principles, are allowable only up to the amount that would be allowed had the recipient purchased the property on the date the lease agreement was executed. This would include depreciation or use allowances, maintenance, taxes, and insurance, but would exclude unallowable costs. When a recipient transfers property to a third party through sale, lease, or otherwise and then leases the property back from that third party, the lease costs that may be charged to an HHS grant generally may not exceed the amount that would be allowed if the recipient continued to own the property. Rental costs under \"less-than-arms-length\" leases are allowable only up to the amount that would be allowed under the applicable cost principles had title to the property been vested in the recipient. A less-than-arms-length lease is one in which one party to the lease agreement is able to control or substantially influence the actions of the other. Such leases include, but are not limited to, those between divisions of an organization; between or ganizations under common control through common officers, directors, or members; and between an organization and its directors, trustees, officers, or key employees (or the families of these individuals), directly or through corporations, trusts, or similar arrangements in which they hold a controlling interest. Research Patient Care The costs of routine and ancillary services provided by hospitals to individuals, including patients and volunteers, participating in research programs are allowable if included in the NoA or approved as a post-award change as specified in \"Prior-Approval Requirements\u2014OPDIV Prior Approval.\" \"Routine services\" include the regular room services, minor medical and surgical supplies, and the use of equipment and facilities for which a separate charge is not customarily made. \"Ancillary services\" are those special services for which charges customarily are made in addition to routine services, e.g., x-ray, operating room, laboratory, pharmacy, blood bank, and pathology. See \"Research Patient Care Costs\" for policy concerning reimbursement of these costs. The following otherwise allowable costs are not classified as research patient care costs: items of personal expense reimbursement, such as patient travel; consulting physician fees; and any other direct payments to individuals, including inpatients, outpatients, subjects, volunteers, and donors. Reserve Funds Contributions to a reserve fund for self-insurance are allowable as specified in the governing cost principles (also see \"Contingency Funds\" in this exhibit). II-38 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Sabbatical Leave Costs Sabbatical leave costs may be included in a fringe benefit rate or in the organization's indirect cost rate. Costs of leave of absence by employees for performance of graduate work or sabbatical study, travel, or research are allowable as a direct charge provided the organization has a uniform policy on sabbatical leave for people engaged in research and the salary is proportional to the service rendered. Where sabbatical leave is included in fringe benefits for which a cost is determined for assessment as a direct charge, the aggregate amount of such assessments applicable to all work of the organization during the base period must be reasonable in relation to the organization's actual practice under its sabbatical leave policy. Sabbatical leave paid by an individual's employer, in combination with other compensation (e.g., partial salary from an HHS grant), may not exceed 100 percent of that individual's regular salary from his or her organization. Salaries and Wages Allowable. Compensation for personal services covers all amounts, including fringe benefits, paid currently or accrued by the organization for employee services rendered to the grant-supported project or program. Compensation costs are allowable to the extent that they are reasonable, conform to the established policy of the organization consistently applied regardless of the source of funds, and reflect no more than the percentage of time actually devoted to the OPDIV-funded project or program. Where restricted by language in the HHS appropriations act, OPDIVs will not reimburse recipients for the direct salaries of individuals at a rate in excess of the level specified. Direct salary is exclusive of fringe benefits and indirect costs. If there is a salary limitation, it does not apply to consultant payments or to contracts for routine goods and services, but it does apply to subrecipients (including consortium participants). Specific considerations are addressed below. Payroll Distribution Salary and wage amounts charged to grant-supported projects or programs for personal services must be based on an adequate payroll distribution system that documents such distribution in accordance with generally accepted practices of like organizations. Standards for payroll distribution systems are contained in the applicable cost principles (other than those for for-profit organizations). Briefly summarized, acceptable systems are as follows: Hospitals \u00a1 Monthly after-the-fact reports of the distribution of time or effort for professional staff members. \u00a1 Time and attendance and payroll distribution records for non-professional employees. Non-profit organizations \u00a1 Monthly after-the-fact reports, including a signed certification, by the employee, or by a responsible supervisory official having first-hand knowledge of the work performed, that the distribution of activity represents a reasonable estimate of the actual work performed by the employee during the period covered by the report. Each report must account for the total activity required to fulfill the employee's obligations to the organization as well as the total activity for which he or she is compensated. \u00a1 For non-professional employees, additional supporting reports, indicating the total number of hours worked each day, must be maintained in conformance with DoL regulations implementing the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 CFR part 516). \u00a1 The distribution of salaries and wages must be supported by personnel activity reports as described above, except when a substitute system has been approved, in writing, by the Federal cognizant agency designated under OMB Circular A-122. State, local, and Indian tribal governments \u00a1 Time and attendance or equivalent records for all employees. \u00a1 Time distribution records for employees whose compensation is chargeable to more than one grant or other cost objective. II-39 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Educational institutions \u00a1 A plan confirmation system for professorial and other professional staff members that is based on budgeted, planned, or assigned work activity and that is updated to reflect any significant changes in work distribution. This system must be incorporated into the organization's official records and must identify activity applicable to each sponsored agreement and to each category needed to identify indirect costs and the functions to which they are allocable. At least annually, the employee, PI/PD, or responsible officials will verify, by suitable means, that the work was performed and that the salaries and wages charged to sponsored agreements, whether as direct charges or in other categories of cost, are reasonable in relation to the work performed. \u00a1 A system, supported by after-the-fact activity reports, that reflects the distribution of covered employees' activity allocable to each grant and includes identification and recording of significant changes in work activity when initial charges were based on estimates. The system also must specify each category of activity needed to identify indirect costs and the functions to which they are allocable. For professorial and other professional staff members, the activity reports will be prepared each academic term, but at least every 6 months. For other employees, unless the OPDIV agrees to alternate arrangements, the reports will be prepared at least monthly and will coincide with one or more pay periods. \u00a1 A multiple confirmation records system, for professorial and other professional staff members, that is supported by records certifying costs separately for direct costs and indirect costs, with reports prepared each academic term, but at least every 6 months, that confirm the activities as allocable to direct or indirect costs. \u00a1 By mutual agreement, any other method meeting the criteria specified in Section J.10 of OMB Circular A-21. For-profit organizations HHS requires for-profit organizations to conform with industry standards to support salary and wage charges to HHS grants. Therefore, unless an alternate system is approved by the GMO, the recipient must maintain a time-and-effort reporting system for both professional and other-than-professional staff reflecting daily after-the-fact reporting of hours expended on individual projects or indirect activities. The system must record both hours worked and hours absent. This information must be certified by an authorized organizational representative no less frequently than every pay period. Overtime Premiums Premiums for overtime generally are allowable; however, such payments are not allowable for faculty members at institutions of higher education. If overtime premiums are allowable, the categories or classifications of employees eligible to receive overtime premiums should be determined according to the formal policies of the organization consistently applied regardless of the source of funds. Bonuses/ Incentive Payments Allowable for employees as part of a total compensation package, provided such payments are reasonable and are made according to a formal policy of the recipient that is consistently applied regardless of the source of funds. Payments for Dual Appointments For investigators with university and clinical practice plan appointments, compensation from both sources may be considered the base salary if the following criteria are met: \u00a1 Clinical practice compensation must be guaranteed by the university. \u00a1 Clinical practice effort must be shown on the university appointment form and must be paid through the university. \u00a1 Clinical practice effort must be included and accounted for on the university's effort report. II-40 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Compensation of Students Tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid as, or in lieu of, wages to students (including fellows and trainees) under research grants are allowable, provided the following conditions are met: \u00a1 The individual is performing activities necessary to the grant. \u00a1 Tuition remission and other forms of compensation are consistently provided, in accordance with established institutional policy, to students performing similar activities conducted in non-sponsored as well as in sponsored activities. \u00a1 During the academic period, the student is enrolled in an advanced degree program at a recipient or affiliated institution and the activities of the student in relation to the federally sponsored research project are related to the degree program. \u00a1 The tuition or other payments are reasonable compensation for the work performed and are conditioned explicitly upon the performance of necessary work. \u00a1 It is the institution's practice to similarly compensate students in non-sponsored as well as sponsored activities. Charges for tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid to students as, or in lieu of, salaries and wages are subject to the reporting requirements in Section J.10 of OMB Circular A-21, or an equivalent method for documenting the individual's effort on the research project. Tuition remission may be charged on an average rate basis. Payments made for educational assistance (e.g., scholarships, fellowships, and student aid costs) are allowable only when the purpose of the grant is to provide training to selected participants and the charge is approved by the OPDIV. These costs are unallowable charges to research grant funds even when they would appear to benefit the research project. Service Charges Allowable. The costs to a user of organizational services and central facilities owned by the recipient, such as central laboratory and computer services, are allowable and must be based on organizational fee schedules consistently applied regardless of the source of funds. Severance Pay Allowable only to the extent that such payments are required by law, are included in an employer- employee agreement, are part of an established policy effectively constituting an implied agreement on the part of the organization, or meet the circumstances of the particular employment. The amount of severance pay to be provided should be determined according to established organizational policy consistently applied regardless of the source of funds and should be reasonable, taking into consideration the practice of similar types of organizations and the extent of the organization's dependence on Federal funds. The applicable cost principles should be consulted regarding the different treatment of severance pay in regular and mass termination situations. Stipends Allowable as cost-of-living allowances for trainees and fellows if permitted by a program's statute authorizing or implementing regulations. The specific amounts may be established by policy. Generally, these payments are made according to a pre-established schedule based on the individual's experience and level of training. (See \"Traineeships, Fellowships, and Similar Awards Made to Organizations on Behalf of Individuals\u2014Allowable Costs.\") A stipend is not a fee-for-service payment and is not subject to the cost accounting requirements of the cost principles. Stipends are not allowable under research grants even when they appear to benefit the research project. Subawards/ Contracts under Grants Allowable to carry out a portion of the programmatic effort or for the acquisition of routine goods or services under the grant. Such arrangements may be in the form of consortium agreements or commercial contracts and may require OPDIV approval (see \"Prior-Approval Requirements\"). Supplies Allowable. Taxes Allowable. Such costs include taxes that an organization is required to pay as they relate to employment, services, travel, rental, or purchasing fo r a project. Recipients must avail themselves of any tax exemptions for which activities supported by Federal funds may qualify. State sales and use taxes for materials and equipment are allowable only when the State does not grant a refund or exemption on such taxes. II-41 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Termination or Suspension Costs Unallowable except as follows. If a grant is terminated or suspended, the recipient may not incur new obligations after the effective date of the termination or suspension and must cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. The awarding office will allow full credit to the recipient for the Federal share of otherwise allowable costs if the obligations were properly incurred before suspension or termination\u2014and not in anticipation of it\u2014and, in the case of termination, are not cancelable. The GMO may authorize other costs in, or subsequent to, the notice of termination or suspension. See 45 CFR 74.62(c) and 92.43. Toys and Nursery Items Allowable for the purchase of items such as toys and games to allow patients to participate in research protocols or, if age appropriate, in programs or projects serving children. Trailers and Modular Units Allowable only if considered equipment as provided below. A \"trailer\" is defined as a portable vehicle built on a chassis that is designed to be hauled from one site to another by a separate means of propulsion and that serves, wherever parked, as a dwelling or place of business. A \"modular unit\" is a prefabricated portable unit designed to be moved to a site and assembled on a foundation to serve as a dwelling or a place of business. The determination of whether costs to acquire trailers or modular units are allowable charges to HHS grant-supported projects depends on whether such units are classified as real property or equipment. The classification will depend on whether the recipient's intended use of the property is permanent or temporary. A trailer or modular unit is considered real property when the unit and its installation are designed or planned to be installed permanently at a given location so as to seem fixed to the land as a permanent structure or appurtenance thereto. Units classified as real property may not be charged to an HHS grant-supported project unless authorizing legi slation permits construction or acquisition of real property and the specific purchase is approved by the OPDIV. A trailer or modular unit is considered equipment when the unit and its installation are designed or planned to be used at any given location for a limited time only. Units classified as equipment may be charged to HHS grant-supported projects only if the terms and conditions of the award do not prohibit the purchase of equipment and OPDIV prior approval is obtained, as appropriate. A trailer or modular unit properly classified as real property or as equipment at the time of acquisition retains that classification for the life of the item, thereby determining the appropriate accountability requirements under 45 CFR 74.32 or 74.34 or 92.31 or 92.32, as applicable. Trainee Costs Allowable if permitted by statute, regulation, or program policy, as defined in the authorizing document, and included in the NoA. Transportation of Property Allowable for freight, express, cartage, postage, and other transportation services relating to goods either purchased, in process, or delivered, including instances when equipment or other property is moved from one recipient to another. In a change-of-grantee situation, the cost of transportation may be charged to the grant at either the original or the new organization, depending on the circumstances and the availability of funds in the appropriate active grant account. Travel Allowable as a direct cost where such travel will provide direct benefit to the project or program. Employees Consistent with the organization's established travel policy, costs for employees working on the grant-supported project or program may include associated per diem or subsistence allowances and other travel-related expenses, such as mileage allowances if travel is by personal automobile. Domestic travel is travel performed within the recipient's own country. For U.S. and Canadian recipients, it includes travel within and between any of the 50 States of the United States and its possessions and territories and also travel between the United States and Canada and within Canada. II-42 Exhibit 4. Selected Items of Cost Item Description Foreign travel is defined as any travel outside of Canada and the United States and its territories and possessions. However, for an organization located outside Canada and the United States and its territories and possessions, foreign travel means travel outside that country. In all cases, travel costs are limited to those allowed by formal organizational policy; in the case of air travel, the lowest reasonable commercial airfares must be used. For-profit recipients' allowable travel costs may not exceed those established by the FTR, issued by GSA, including the maximum per diem and subsistence rates prescribed in those regulations. This information is available at http://www.gsa.gov . If a recipient organization has no formal travel policy, those regulations will be used to determine the amount that may be charged for travel costs. Recipients are strongly encouraged to take advantage of discount fares for airline travel through advance purchase of tickets if travel schedules can be planned in advance (such as for national meetings and other scheduled events). Recipients must comply with the requirement that U.S. flag air carriers be used by domestic recipients to the maximum extent possible when commercial air transportation is the means of travel between the United States and a foreign country or between foreign countries. This requirement must not be influenced by factors of cost, convenience, or personal travel preference. The cost of travel under a ticket issued by a U.S. flag air carrier that leases space on a foreign air carrier under a code-sharing agreement is allowable if the purchase is in accordance with GSA regulations on U.S. flag air carriers and code shares (see http://www.gsa.gov/gsa/cm_attachments/GSA_DOCUMENT/ 110304_FTR_R2QA53_0Z5RDZ-i34K-pR.pdf ). (A code-sharing agreement is an arrangement between a U.S. flag carrier and a foreign air carrier in which the U.S. flag carrier provides passenger service on the foreign air carrier's regularly scheduled commercial flights.) Patients or Service Beneficiaries If patient care, including research patient care, or other direct health or social services are approved activities of the grant-supported project or program, the costs of transporting individuals participating in the program or project to the site where services are being provided, including costs of public transportation, are allowable. The purchase of motor vehicles for this purpose also may be allowable. Cost Transfers Cost transfers by recipients between gran ts, whether as a means to compensate for cost overruns or for other reasons, ge nerally are unallowable; however, cost transfers by recipients (or subrecipients or cost-type contractors) may sometimes be necessary to correct bookkeeping or cleric al errors. Recipients (and subrecipients and contractors) should have systems in place to detect such errors within a reasonable time frame. Untimely discovery of errors could be an indication of poor internal controls. Permissible cost transfers should be made promptly after the error occurs but no later than 90 days following occurrence unless a longer period is approved in advance by the GMO. The tran sfer must be supported by documentation, pursuant to 45 CFR 74.53 or 92.42, that fully explains how the error occurred and a certification of the correctness of the new charge by a responsible official of the recipient, subrecipient, or contractor. An explanation merely stating that the transfer was made \"to correct error\" or \"to transfer to correct project\" is not sufficient. This information need not be submitted to the GMO but is subject to audit. If the transfer affects a previously submitted FSR, a revised FSR must be submitted. Frequent errors in recording costs may in dicate the need for accounting system improvements, enhanced internal contro ls, or both. If su ch errors occur, II-43 organizations are encouraged to evaluate the need for improvements and to make whatever improvements are deemed ne cessary to prevent reoccurrence. An awarding office also may re quire a recipient to take co rrective action by imposing additional terms and cond itions on an award. Cost Overruns and Rate of Expenditure Transfers of costs from one project to an other or from one competitive segment to the next solely to cover cost overruns are not allowable. The GMO monitors expenditure rates under individual awards during each budget pe riod and within the overall project period. Although HHS allows its recipients certain flexibilities with respect to rebudgeting, HHS expects the ra te and types of expenditures to be consistent with the approved project/pr ogram and budget and may question or restrict expenditures that appear inconsis tent with these expect ations. In addition, recipients are expected to monitor their fund drawdowns and amounts reported on financial reports (e.g., PMS 272) to ensure that they do not exceed the amount authorized on the NoA. The GMO may review recipient cash drawdo wns to determine whether they indicate any pattern of accelerated or delayed ex penditures. Expenditure patterns are of particular concern because they may indicate a deficiency in the recipient's financial management system or internal controls. Accelerated or delayed expenditures may result in an inability to complete the approved project or program within the approved budget and period of performance. In these situations , the GMO may seek additional information from the reci pient and may make any necessary and appropriate adjustments. Allocation of Costs When salaries or other activities are supported by two or more sources, issues arise as to how the direct costs should be al located among the sources of support. In general, a cost that benefits two or more pr ojects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue e ffort or cost should be allocated to the projects on the basis of the propor tional benefit. A cost that benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved may be allocated or transferred to the benefiting projects on any reasonable basis as long as the costs charged are allowable, allocable, and reason able under the applicable cost principles and the recipient's financial management syst em includes adequate internal controls. Costs may be assigned entirely to one pro ject, with written prior approval from the GMO, under the following conditions only: The projects are scientificall y and technically related. The projects are under the di rection of the same PI/PD. The projects have been funded by the same OPDIV or OPDIV component. There is no change in the scope of the individual grants involved. The relating of costs will not be detrimental to the conduct of work approved under each individual award. II-44 The relatedness will not be used to circumvent the terms and conditions of an individual award. Services Provided by Affiliated Organizations A number of universities and other organiza tions have established closely affiliated, but separately incorporated, organizations to facilitate the administ ration of research and other programs supported by Federal fu nds. Such legally independent entities are often referred to as \"foundations,\" although this term does not necessarily appear in the name of the organization. Ty pically, the parent or ganization provides considerable support services, in the form of administration, fa cilities, equipment, accounting, and other services, to its foundation, and the latter, acting in its own right as a recipient, includes the cost of th ese services in its indirect cost proposal. Costs incurred by an affiliated, but separa te, legal entity in support of a recipient foundation (foundation) are allowable for reimbursement under HHS grants only if at least one of the following conditions is met: The foundation is charged for, and is lega lly obligated to pay for, the services provided by the parent organization. The affiliated organization is subject to State or local law that prescribes how Federal reimbursement for the costs of th e parent organization's services will be expended and requires that a State or local official acting in his or her official capacity approves such expenditures. There is a valid written agreement between the affiliated organizations whereby the parent organi zation agrees that the foundation may retain Federal reimbursement of parent organiza tion costs. The pa rent organization may either direct how the funds will be used or permit the foundation that discretion. If none of the above conditions is met, the costs of the servic es provided by the parent organization to the foundation ar e not allowable for reimbursement under an HHS grant. However, the services may be acceptable for cost-sharing (matching) purposes. Matching or Cost Sharing All required matching or cost sharing, whether required by statute or regulation, will be shown as part of the total approved budget in the NoA and becomes an award requirement enforceable through the NoA. The costs that the recipient incurs in fulfilling its matching or cost-sharing requirement are subject to the same requirements, including the cost principles, that are applicable to the use of Federal funds, including prior approval requirem ents and other rules for allowability described 74.23 and 45 CFR 92.24. Third-party in-kind 45 CFR 74.23 and 45 CFR 92.24. If a recipient does not meet the specifie d level of matching or cost sharing as reflected in the NoA, an OPDIV may take one or more of the following actions: Make a downward adjustment in the Federal award amount II-45 Take an enforcement action affecting th e current or future awards to that recipient (see \"Enfor cement Actions\") If the amount in the NoA exceeds the statutory (or implementing regulatory requirement) for matching, where justif ied, reduce the matching to no less than the statutory or regulatory requirement If the amount in the No A exceeds a regulatory co st-sharing requirement, where justified and au thorized by the regulation, reduce the cost sharing to no less than the regulatory requirement. If a recipient provides matching or cost sharing that exceeds th at required by the NoA, the excess amount is not subject to th e requirements of 45 CFR part 74 or 92 unless the amount is used to offset otherwise unallowable matching or cost-sharing amounts. When satisfying a matching or cost-sharing requirement by not claiming the full indirect cost reimbursement to which the recipient is otherwise entitled, the recipient should reduce its charge to the grant to reflect the amount clai med. The amount of the reduction qualifies as matching or cost sharing. The recipient should include an explanation in the \"Remarks\" section of the Financial Status Report (see \"Reporting\u2014Financial Reporting\"). Valuation of Donated Goods and Services Donated Supplies, Equipment, Space, or Land Donated supplies may include such items as expendable property, office supplies (unless treated as an indirect cost), laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. The value assigned to donated supplies must be re asonable and cannot exceed the fair market value of th e supplies at the time of donation. The value of donated equipment cannot exc eed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the ti me of donation. The value of loaned equipment cannot exceed its fair rental valu e. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as matching or cost sharing. If a third party donates equipment, buildings , or land and title passes to a recipient or subrecipient, the treatment of the dona ted property depends upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant as follows: If the purpose of the gran t or subgrant is to assist the recipient with the acquisition of property, the market valu e of that property at the time of donation may be counted as matching. If the purpose of the grant or subgrant is other than to assist with the acquisition of property, the following applies: h With GMO approval, the market value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and th e fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as matching or cost sharing. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant awar d may require that the approval be II-46 obtained both from the GMO and from the recipient. In either case, approval may be given only if purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be allowable as a direct cost. h If any part of the donated property wa s acquired with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as matching or cost sharing. h Unless GMO approval is obtained, no amount may be counted for donated land and only depreciation or use al lowances may be counted for donated equipment and buildings. The deprecia tion or use allowances for such property are not treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated as costs incurred by th e recipient or subrecipient. The allowances are computed and allocate d (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost principles in the same way as depreciation or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is based on the property's market va lue at the time it was donated. If a recipient or subrecipient donates real property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the current market value of that property may be counted as matching or cost sharing. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as matching or cost sharing. The value of donated space cannot exceed th e fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisa l of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality. The awarding office may require that the mark et value of land or buildings or the fair rental rate of land or of space in a building be established by an independent property appraiser or by a GSA representati ve and certified by a responsible official of the recipient, subrec ipient, or contractor. Volunteer Services Rates for donated services used to satisf y a matching or cost-sharing requirement must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient's organization, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient would compete for the kind of services involved. When an employer other than the recipi ent furnishes the services of an employee, the services must be valued at the empl oyee's regular rate of pay. Only the amount representing an amount consistent with the function pe rformed are allowable, e.g., if a doctor serves as a receptionist, only the amount that would be allowable for a receptionist is allowable as a contribution to the grant. Fringe benefits consistent with those that would be paid by the employing organizati on that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation. II-47 Using Program Income to Meet a Matching or Cost-Sharing Requirement Costs financed by program income may not count toward satisfying a matching or cost-sharing requirement unless they ar e expressly permitted by the NoA (see \"Financial Management \u2014Program Income\"). Documentation The basis for determining the valuation of personal services, ma terials, equipment, buildings, and land must be verifiable from the records of the recipient, subrecipient, or contractor under the grant. Volunteer se rvices, to the extent feasible, should be supported by the same level of documentation used by the recipient for its own employees, including time and attendance records. Prior-Approval Requirements HHS anticipates that the recipient may need to modify its award budget or other aspects of its approved application duri ng performance to accomplish the award's programmatic objectives. In general, reci pients are allowed a certain degree of latitude to rebudget within and between budget categories to meet unanticipated needs and to make other types of post-awa rd changes. In some cases, OPDIV prior written approval may be required. When OPDIV prior approval is required, the requirement applies whether the costs/activiti es are proposed in the application or in a separate request following award. If an application includes general language about a cost or activity that requires OPDIV prior approval, approval of the application does not necessarily mean that the prior-approval requirement has been satisfied. The recipient is still required to obtain any applicable OPDIV prior approval when specific details are known. This section addresses the post-award prio r-approval requirements related to making certain direct cost budget modifications or undertaking specified activities. Other post-award changes may be made without OPDIV prior approval as long as they are within the limits established by HHS (see \"Expanded Authorities\" in this section) or may be subject to different procedures as specified in other parts of the HHS GPS (e.g., as specified in \"Property Manageme nt\u2014Nonexempt Property ,\" the OPDIV must approve any proposal to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage, lease, or in any other manner encumber the property while the re cipient remains accountable to the OPDIV for the use of the property). Also, prior appr oval of costs considered indirect costs is governed by the procedures of the cognizan t agency rather than those of the OPDIV. The post-award changes that are consider ed changes to budgets or program plans and require OPDIV approval and the changes that may be made under the recipient's authority are outlined below. If OPDIV approval is required, it must be requested of, and obtained from, the GMO in advance of the change or obligation of funds as specified in \"Requesting OPDIV Prior Approval\" in this section. OPDIV Prior Approval OPDIV prior-approval requirements are summarized in Exhibit 5, which is provided for guidance only. For the post-award prio r-approval requirements specified in the exhibit, approval is required whether or not the change has a budgetary impact II-48 except as indicated (e.g., if provided as an expanded authority). The circumstances under which prior approval is required also are summarized in the exhibit. Supplementary policy or procedural informatio n related to certain of these categories follows the exhibit. Recipients also should see Part IV of this HHS GPS for OPDIV-specific prior-approval requirements that a pply to specific types of grants and types of recipients. Any questions ab out the need for prior approval for an activity or cost under a specific OPDIV award shou ld be directed to the GMO. Exhibit 5. Summary of Actions Requiring OPDIV Prior Approval OPDIV prior approval is required for Under the following circumstances A&R Rebudgeting into A&R costs in a single budget period that would exceed the lesser of $150,000 (or amount specified by the OPDIV in Part IV of the HHS GPS) or 25 percent of the total approved budget (direct and indirect costs) for a budget period (also see \"Allowable Costs and Activities\"). Any single A&R project exceeding $150,000 (or amount specified by the OPDIV in Part IV of the HHS GPS). Aggregate costs that would exceed the lesser of $150,000 (or amount specified by the OPDIV in Part IV of the HHS GPS) or 25 percent of the total costs reasonably expected to be awarded by the awarding office for a project period (or competitive segment under programs that entertain competing continuation applications). Carryover of unobligated balances If not provided as an expanded authority. Also see \"Carryover of Unobligated Balances\" below for potential OPDIV actions if provided as an expanded authority. Change of grantee organization All instances. Recipients must notify the awarding office of other changes in organizational status. See \"Change of Grantee Organization\" below. Change in scope All instances. See \"Change in Scope\" below for a discussion of the post-award changes that may indicate a change in scope: transfer of substantive programmatic work to a third party; significant rebudgeting; incurrence of research patient care costs; purchase of a unit of general- or special-purpose equipment exceeding $25,000. Changes in status of PI, PD, or other key personnel named in the NoA For PIs/PDs, replacement; absence for any continuous period of 3 months or more; reduction of time devoted to project by 25 percent or more from level in approved application. For other key personnel, substitution for named personnel. See \"Change in Status, including Absence, of PI/PD and Other Key Personnel\" below. Construction, land, or building acquisition All instances when purchase proposed; any proposal to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage, lease, or in any other manner encumber real property acquired with OPDIV grant funds. Cost principles prior-approval requirements All instances unless provided as an expanded authority (not available for construction, land, or building acquisition or indemnification of third parties). Deviation from award terms and conditions All instances. Includes undertaking any activities disapproved or restricted as a condition of the award. II-49 Exhibit 5. Summary of Actions Requiring OPDIV Prior Approval OPDIV prior approval is required for Under the following circumstances Foreign component added to a grant to a domestic organization All instances. Indemnification of third parties All instances. Need for additional OPDIV funding All instances whether or not additional time is needed, including extension of a final budget period of a project period with additional funds. See \"Need for Additional OPDIV Funding\" below. No-cost extension All instances unless authority to approve a one-time extension of up to 12 months without a change in scope is provided as an expanded authority. See \"Need for Additional Time to Complete Project- or Program-Related Activities ('No-Cost Extension')\" below. Pre-award costs All instances before the effective date of the initial budget period of a new or competing continuation award unless the authority to approve pre-award costs up to (and including) 90 days before the beginning date is provided as an expanded authority. In either case, the costs are incurred at the applicant's/recipient's own risk. Research patient care costs For States, local governments, and tribal governments, all instances. For institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, and commercial organizations, any instance in which such costs were not part of the approved budget shown in the NoA or a recipient wants to rebudget out of the approved research patient care category. Retention of research grant funds when career award made All instances. Transfer of amounts for training allowances (stipends, tuition, and fees) to other budget categories All instances unless provided as an expanded authority to States, local governments, or tribal governments. (The training allowance does not include trainee travel, which HHS does not consider to be a trainee cost, and other training-related expenses.) Transfer of funds between construction and nonconstruction work All instances. Transfer of substantive programmatic work All instances if the recipient is a governmental entity or, for recipients subject to 45 CFR part 74, the grant is a construction grant; otherwise considered an indicator of change in scope. See \"Transfer of Substantive Programmatic Work\" below. II-50 Carryover of Unobligated Balances Recipients should be aware of the diffe rence between unliquidated obligations and unobligated balances. Unliquidated obligations are commitments of the recipient and are considered to be obligations and, therefore, should not be reported as unobligated balances. To ensure the timely use of unobligated balances, recipi ents must use the \"first- in/first-out\" principle for recognizing and recording obligations and expenditures of those funds. Upon receipt of the annual FSR, the GMO will compare the total of any unobligated balance shown and the funds aw arded for the current budget period with the OPDIV share of the approved budget fo r the current budget period. If the funds available exceed the OPDIV share of th e approved budget for the current budget period, the GMO may select on e of the following options: In response to a written request from th e recipient, revise the current NoA to authorize the recipient to spend the excess funds for additional approved purposes (approval is intended to co ver only prospective costs, not costs already incurred by the recipient) Offset the current award or a subsequent award by an amount representing some or all of the excess For awards subject to expanded authorit ies, restrict the re cipient's authority to automatically carry over unobligated balances in the future, use the balance to reduce or offset OPDIV fund ing for a subsequent budget period, or use a combination of these actions. Change of Grantee Organization OPDIV prior approval is required for the transfer of the lega l and administrative responsibility for a grant-supported projec t or program from one legal entity to another before the expiration of the appr oved project period (competitive segment for grants where there may a competing co ntinuation for the same project). For other changes in organizational status, e.g., a name change, the recipient must notify the awarding office as specified in \"Changes in Organizational Status.\" A change of grantee organization may be accomplished under most OPDIV grants, including construction grants, if any of the following conditions are met and the OPDIV determines that the purpose and scope of the approved grant will not change and the transfer is consistent with Federal appropriations law requirements: The grant to be transferred has been te rminated at the original organization in accordance with 45 CFR 74.61 or 92.43. A non-competing continuation award that is within an approved project period has been withheld for a reason other than project performance, e.g., the recipient's management of the grant or non-compliance with award terms and conditions. The original recipient has agreed to re linquish responsibility for an active project before the expiration of the appr oved project period. This includes any proposed change of grantee as a resu lt of a PI on a research project II-51 transferring from one orga nization to another organi zation. The project under the same PI may be supported at a new organization for a period up to the remainder of the previously approved project period in an amount not to exceed that previously recommended for direct costs (plus applicable indirect costs) for the remainder of the approved project period. A request for a change of grantee organi zation (change of grantee) must be submitted to the GMO before the anticipate d start date at the new organization and preferably several months in advance. Failure to provide timely notification may result in disapproval of the request or a de lay in processing. As part of the request, the original organization must submit PHS 3734, \"Official Statement Relinquishing Interests and Rights in a Public Health Service Research Grant,\" or equivalent form as specified by the OPDIV, and, if the request involves a resear ch grant, a \"Final Invention Statement and Certification.\" The request also must include an application from the proposed recipient organization . (The relinquishing organization must submit a final FSR to the awarding office no later than 90 days after the end of HHS support.) The application from the proposed reci pient should include the following, as applicable: Face page Budget pages (current and future years) Updated biographical sketches for the PI/PD and existing key personnel and biographical sketches for any proposed new key personnel Statement indicating whether the over all plans/aims or objectives have changed from the original submission, and, if so, how For research grants h Updated \"other support\" pages, if necessary h Resources page h Checklist page h Certification of IRB/IACUC approval, if applicable Detailed list of any equipment purchase d with grant funds being transferred to the new organization (inclusion of th is list in the transfer application from the new organization indica tes its acceptance of ti tle to that equipment). The OPDIV may request additional informatio n necessary to accomplish its review of the request. Acceptance of a relinquis hing statement by the OPDIV does not guarantee approval of a tran sfer application for the continued funding of a project. A change of grantee request normally will be permitted only when all of the permanent benefits attributable to the orig inal grant can be tr ansferred, including equipment purchased in whole or in part wi th grant funds. In reviewing a request to transfer a grant, an OPDIV will consider whether there is a continued need for the II-52 grant-supported project or program and whet her there will be any a change in scope of the previously approved project. A change of grantee may be made without objective review, provided the PI/PD plans no change in scope and the facilities and resources at the new organization will allow for successfu l performance of the project or program. If the change involves a change in scope, the request may not be processed as a change of grantee, will re quire objective review, and may be subject to a different process, e.g., treated as an exception to competition. A change of grantee that involves the transfer of a grant to or betw een foreign organizations or international organizations also may require special OPDIV approval, e.g., approval by an Advisory Council or Board. If th ese conditions or other programmatic or administrative requirements are not met, the OPDIV may require objective review or may disapprove the request and, if appropriate, terminate the award. The OPDIV will accomplish a change of gran tee organization by issuing a revised NoA to the original recipient reflecting the re vised budget and project period end dates, deletion of any future-year support, and deobligation of remaining funds, if applicable. (A deobligation of funds will be based on the estimated grant expenditures through the relinquishment date, as determined from the relinquishing statement.) Concurrently, the new recipient will receive a NoA reflecting the balance reported on the relinquishing statement or, if the change of grantee organization occurs on the anniversary date of the project, the NoA to the new recipient will reflect the previously committed direct cost level pl us applicable indirect costs. This amount is subject to change as a result of the closeout of the original grant and may be adjusted downward. If a change of gr antee involves the tr ansfer of equipment purchased with grant funds, the transfer may be accomplished as part of the original recipient's relinquishment of the grant or HHS may transfer title to equipment to the new organization using its right to transfer title (see \"Property Management\"). Change in Scope In general, the PI/PD may make changes in the methodology, approach, or other aspects of the project/program objectives. However, the recipient must obtain prior approval from the GMO for a proposed change in scope. A change in scope occurs when the recipient proposes to change (or changes) the objectives, aims, or purposes identified in the approved app lication, such as shifting the research emphasis from one disease area to anothe r, changing the service area, applying a new technology (e.g., changing assays from those approved to a different type of assay), changing the approved design under a construction grant, eliminating a primary care delivery site, or making budge t changes that cause a project to change substantially from that which was approved. Also see the indicators specified below. The recipient must make the initial determination of whether a proposed change would be considered a change in scop e and should consult with the GMO as necessary. In addition to explicit changes in the objec tives, aims, or purposes identified in the approved grant application, post-award chan ges that are clear indicators of a change in scope or that are likely to be consider ed a change in scope include, but are not limited to, the following: Any change from the approved us e of animals or human subjects. Transfer of the performance of subs tantive programmatic work to a third party through a subaward, contract, or any other means, if the authority for II-53 such activities is not included in the a pproved application. If the third party is a foreign component, this type of action always requires OPDIV prior approval. Significant rebudgeting, whether or not the particular expenditures require prior approval. Significan t rebudgeting occurs when, under a grant with a Federal share exceeding $100,000, cumula tive transfers among direct cost budget categories for the current budget pe riod exceed 25 percent of the total approved budget (which includes di rect and indirect costs, whether chargeable to Federal funds or required matching or cost sharing) for that budget period or $250,000, whichever is less. Incurrence of research patient care cost s if costs in that category were not previously approved by the OPDIV or if a recipient wants to rebudget funds out of the research patient care category. Purchase of a unit of general-pu rpose or special-purpose equipment exceeding $25,000. Change in Status, including Absence, of Principal Investigator/Project Director and Other Key Personnel The recipient is required to notify the GMO in writing if the PI/PD or key personnel specifically named in the NoA will withdraw from the project entirely, be absent from the project during any continuous period of 3 months or more, or reduce time devoted to the project by 25 percent or mo re from the level that was approved at the time of award (for example, a propos ed change from 40 percent effort to 30 percent or less effort). The OPDIV mu st approve any alternate arrangement proposed by the recipient, including any replacement of the PI/PD or key personnel named in the NoA. The request for approval of a substitute PI/PD/key person should include a justification for the change, the biographical sketch of the indivi dual proposed, other sources of support (if applicable), an d any budget changes resulting from the proposed change. If the arrangements pr oposed by the recipient, including the qualifications of any proposed replacemen t, are not acceptable to the OPDIV, the grant may be suspended or terminated. If the recipient wants to terminate the project because it cannot make suitable al ternate arrangements, it must notify the GMO, in writing, of its wish to terminate, and the GMO will forward closeout instructions. The requirement to obtain OPDIV prior approval for a change in status pertains only to the PI/PD and those key personnel the OPDIV names in the NoA regardless of whether the applicant organiza tion designates others as key personnel for its own purposes. Need for Additional OPDIV Funding A request for additional funding for a curre nt budget period to meet increased costs that are within the scope of the approved application, bu t that were unforeseen when the new or competing continuation applicat ion (or progress report for non-competing continuation support) was submitted, is a non-competing supplem ental application. Such requests must be submitted, in writing, directly to the GMO and are not II-54 required to compete with other applications for funding. Other recipient-initiated requests for supplemental funding during a current budget period are considered to change the scope of the approved project or program and are required to compete for funding with other applications. A request for a non-competing extension of the final budget period of a project period with a minimal amount of additional funds should be submitted to the GMO, in writing, at least 30 days before the pro ject period is schedul ed to expire. Such requests usually are for a period of up to 12 months, based on a need to provide continuity of project or program activities while a competing continuation application is being reviewed or to permit orderly phase- out of activities for which there will be no further HHS support. The request must sp ecify the proposed revised ending date and must include justification for both the extension and the additional funds requested. Need for Additional Time to Complete Project- or Program-Related Activities (\"No-Cost Extension\") Unless provided as an expanded authority, OPDIV prior approval is required for any extension of up to 12 months. All extensions that would exceed 12 months, whether as part of an initial request or a subsequent request that would result in an aggregate period of that duration, require special justification. The OPDIV will not approve any extension request if the primary purpose of the proposed extension is to permit the use of unobligated balances of funds. All terms and conditions of the award apply during the extended period. Significant Rebudgeting The base used for determining significant rebudgeting excludes carryover balances but includes any amounts aw arded as competing or non-competing supplements. For example, the significant rebu dgeting threshold has been re ached if, under a grant in which the Federal share for a budget peri od is $100,000, the total approved budget is $300,000 and cumulative changes with in that budget period exceed $75,000. Once the significant rebudgeti ng threshold is reached, th e recipient must request and receive OPDIV prior approval for the change s that cause the reci pient to exceed the threshold. The OPDIV will determine if there has been a change in scope and do one of the following: Modify the award, as appropriate, to reflect an approved change in scope Advise the recipient that the change is not approved and specify the consequences of having rebudgeted to that extent without prior approval Advise the recipient that each subsequent budget change in that budget period\u2014regardless of type or dollar value\u2014requires OPDIV prior approval. The calculation generally begins anew wi th each subsequent budget period unless the OPDIV has concerns with the overall ex tent of the recipient's rebudgeting and, on the basis of a high-risk designation, us es an alternate cond ition in an award. II-55 Transfer of Substantive Programmatic Work The transfer of substantive programmatic work does not include contracting for routine goods or services used in or in support of a grant. Subgranting is allowable only if authorized by statute or regulation and specified in the NoA. Unless the program is intended as a pass-through pr ogram (i.e., one in which the recipient's role is to select subrecipients that are ex pected to provide the services that are the purpose of the grant, coordinate and ov ersee their activiti es, and provide the administrative support needed to meet OPDIV requirements), the recipient is expected to perform a substantive role in the project or program. In the case of a pass-through program, prior approval for the transfer of substantive programmatic work generally is not required. In all other cases, prior approval is required to ensure that the recipient is not acting as a condui t to another party (that may not be eligible to receive OPDIV funding directly) and remains eligible for the award. When prior approval is required, the request must include the following information: A description of the activities or functions involved A justification for their performance by a third party A breakdown of and justification for the estimated costs, including the manner in which indirect costs, if any, will be reimbursed The method to be used to select the subaward and the type of contract/agreement expected to be awarded The kinds of entities to be solicited (if selection has al ready taken place, identification of the organization and the reasons for selection). Requesting OPDIV Prior Approval All requests for OPDIV prior approval ot her than a request for carryover of an unobligated balance must be made in writing (which includes submission by e-mail) to the GMO no later than 30 days before the proposed change. Requests for carryover of unobligated balances should be initiated once the actual unobligated balance is known (generally during th e period allowed for preparation and submission of the FSR). Requests for carryov er of unobligated balances must include only prospective costs and activities, i.e., ones that will be incurred or undertaken following OPDIV review and appr oval of the request. Prior- approval requests must be signed by both the PI/PD and the authorized organizational representative. Failure to make a timely request and obtain required OPDIV prior approval from the GMO may result in the disallowance of costs, termination of the award, or other enforcement action within the OPDIV's authority. All requests must include the name of the recipient; the name of the initiating PI/PD; the PI/PD's telephone numb er, fax number, and e-mail address; and comparable identifying information for the authorized organization official. E-mail requests must be clearly identified as pr ior-approval requests, must reflect the complete grant number in the subject line, and should be sent by or through the authorized organizational representative to the GMO th at signed the NoA. If the entire message of the request cannot be incl uded in the body of the e- mail, the request should be submitted to the GMO in hard copy. II-56 The OPDIV will review the request and the GMO will provide a response to the authorized organizational representative, wi th a copy to the PI/PD, indicating the final disposition of the request. Only re sponses provided by the GMO are to be considered valid. Recipients that proceed on the basis of acti ons by unauthorized officials do so at their own risk, and HHS is not bound by such responses. Whenever a recipient contempl ates rebudgeting or other post-award changes and is uncertain about the need for prior approval, the recipient is strongly encouraged to consult, in advance, with the GMO. Under a subaward or contract under a grant, the prior-approval authority usually is the recipient. However, the recipient may not approve any action or cost that is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the HHS grant. If an action by a subrecipient or contractor will result in a change in the project/program scope or budget requiring OPDIV approval, the recipi ent must obtain that approval from the OPDIV before giving its approval to the subrecipient or contractor. Expanded Authorities OPDIVs may waive certain dire ct cost-related and other pr ior-approval requirements and provide authority for the recipient to undertake these activities and expenditures without the need for OPDIV prior approval. These operating authorities are termed \"expanded authorities.\" Exhibit 6 presents a summary of the ex panded authorities that may be provided by an OPDIV. Procedures for implementing several of these authorities follow the exhibit. The recipient should consult Part IV for detailed applicability of expanded authorities to specific award instruments and types of recipients. Certain grants or recipients are not eligible for expanded authorities, including those that require closer monitoring or technica l assistance. In addition, one or more of these authorities may be overridden by a spec ial term or condition of the award. The NoA will indicate the applicability of expanded authorities by reference to the HHS GPS and the OPDIV supplement in Part IV, or through specific terms and conditions of the award. Therefore, recipients must review the NoA to determine whether and to what extent they are permitted to use expanded authorities. When using expanded au thorities, recipients must ensu re that they exercise proper stewardship over Federal funds and that costs charged to awards are allowable, allocable, reasonable, necessary, and consiste ntly applied regardless of the source of funds. HHS may disallow the costs if it de termines, through audit or otherwise, that the costs do not meet the tests of allowabi lity, including allocability, reasonableness, necessity, and consistency. Several expanded authorities have specific deadlines for submission of reports or for timely notification to the awarding office. Recipients should be aware that a consistent pattern of failure to adhere to those deadlines for repo rting or notification will be grounds for excl uding that recipient from expanded authorities. II-57 Exhibit 6. Summary of Expanded Authorities May exercise as expanded authority Except Carryover of unobligated balances from one budget period to the next successive budget period If the NoA indicates otherwise Cost-related prior approvals for direct cost items, including research patient care costs and equipment If the scope would change Extension of final budget period of a project period without additional funds If the recipient already has given itself one extension of up to 12 months Pre-award costs up to (and including) 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a new or competing continuation award If the NoA indicates otherwise Transfer of performance of substantive programmatic work to a third party (by subaward or a contract under the grant) If the transfer would be to a foreign component or it would result in a change in scope Carryover of Unobligated Balances Under expanded authorities, OPDIV prior appr oval is not required to carry forward an unobligated balance from one budget peri od to the subseque nt budget period. However, if the GMO determines that some or all of the unobligated funds are not necessary to complete the project or perform the program activity, the GMO may restrict the recipient's authority to automa tically carry over unobligated balances in the future, use the balance to reduce or offset OPDIV funding for a subsequent budget period, or use a combination of these actions. The GMO's decision about the disposition of the reported unobligated balance will be reflected in the NoA. Extension of Final Budget Period of a Previously Approved Project Period The recipient may extend the final budget pe riod of a previously approved project period one time for a period of up to 12 mo nths beyond the origin al expiration date shown in the NoA if no additional funds are required to be obligated by the aw arding office; and the originally approved scope will not change; and any one of the following applies: h additional time beyond the establishe d expiration date is required to ensure adequate completion of the orig inally approved project or program, or h continuity of grant support is required while a competing continuation application is under review, or h the extension is necessary to permit an orderly phase-out of a project or program that will not receive continued support. The fact that funds remain at the expiration of the grant is not, in itself, sufficient justification for an extension without additional funds. II-58 The recipient must notify the awarding offi ce, in writing, of the extension 10 days before the expiration date of the projec t period. Upon notification, the awarding office will revise the project period ending date and provide an acknowledgment to the recipient. All terms and conditions of the award apply during the extended period and, by extending the final budget period of the project period, the recipient agrees to update all required certifications and assurances, including those pertaining to human subjects and animal welfare, in a ccordance with applicable regulations and policies. A recipient may not extend a pro ject period previously extended by the awarding office. Any additional project period extension beyond the one-time extension of up to 12 months requires OPDIV prior approval. Financial Management Financial Management System Recipients are required to meet the st andards and requirements for financial management systems set forth or refere nced in 45 CFR 74.21 or 92.20, as applicable. The adequacy of the financial management system is integral to the ability of the recipient to account for the expenditure of grant fu nds. These standards are intended to ensure that Federal funds are handled in a responsible manner that includes adequate internal controls, cash management consistent with Department of the Treasury requirements (see \"H HS Grants Process\u2014Payment\"). States may expend and account for fund s in accordance with State laws and procedures that apply to the expenditure of and the accounting for the State's own funds as long as those procedures are suffi cient to permit preparation of required reports and tracing of expenditures to a le vel adequate to establish that award funds have not been used in violation of any applicable statutory restrictions or prohibitions. All other types of recipients must use financial systems th at enable the recipient to do the following: Provide accurate, current, and complete financial information about Federal awards and, for subawards, reasonab le procedures for ensuring that subrecipients provide financial reports in sufficient time to allow preparation of OPDIV-required reports. Maintain records that adequately identi fy the sources of funds for federally assisted activities and the purposes for which the award was used, including authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or expenditures, and any program inco me. Accounting records must be supported by source documentation such as canceled checks, paid bills, payrolls, and time and attendance records. Maintain effective control over and accountability for all cash, real and personal property, and other assets un der the award; adequately safeguard those assets; and ensure that they ar e used only for authorized purposes. Compare actual expenditur es or outlays with the approved budget for the award. II-59 Determine the allowability of costs in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles, program regulations, an d other requirements cited in the NoA. This includes the ability to readily id entify unobligated balances, accelerated or delayed expenditures, and cost transfers. Minimize the time elapsing between any advance payment under this award and the disbursement of the funds for direct program costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect or facilities and administrative costs, and ensure that the timing and amount of any payments to subrecipients conform to this standard. Recipients must notify the GMO when financial management problems are discovered. Deficiencies in a recipient's financial management system, whether reported by the recipient or identified by the OPDIV, may result in the imposition of special award conditions, use of the reimbursement payment method, or other increased monitoring by the awarding office. Program Income Accountability and Alternatives for Use Program income is gross income\u2014earned by a recipient, subrecipient, or a contractor under a grant\u2014directly generated by the gr ant-supported activity or earned as a result of the award. Program income includes, but is not limited to, income from fees for services performed; charges for the use or rental of real property, equipment, or supplies acquired under the grant; the sale of commodities or items fabricated under an award; charges for research resources; and license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights. The requirements for accoun tability for the various types of income under HHS grants are specified in this section. However, the NoA governs the disposition of royalties and other income earned from a copyrighted work , patents, patent applications, trademarks, or inventions. Gener ally such income is not subject to the requirements of this section. Accountability refers to whether the OPDIV specifies how the income is to be used and whether the income needs to be report ed to the OPDIV and for what length of time. Program income earned during the project period must be reported by the recipient as discussed in this section. Each NoA will indicate the alternative for disposition of program income. For non- research grants, if no alternative is specified, the program income must be used under the deductive alternativ e. The default alternative fo r research grants (except for awards to commercial organizations under programs other than the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Bu siness Technology Transfer programs) is the addition alternative as provided in 45 CFR 74.24(d). Re gardless of the alternative applied, program income may be used only for allowable costs in accordance with the applicable cost principles and the term s and conditions of the award. Subawards and contracts under grants are subject to the terms of the subaward or contract with regard to any income generated, but the terms specified by the recipient must be consistent with the requ irements of the NoA. II-60 Program income earned during the period of grant support\u2014other than income earned as a result of copyrights, patents, or inventions (see \"Intellectual Property\u2014 Rights in Data\") or as a result of the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies (\"Property Management\")\u2014must be retained by the recipient and, as specified in the NoA, may be used in one or a combination of the ways indicated in Exhibit 7. Unless otherwise specified in the terms and conditions of the award, recipients are not accountable for program income earned after the period of grant support. Exhibit 7. Use of Program Income Alternatives Alternative Use of program income Additive Added to funds committed to the project or program and used to further eligible project or program objectives Deductive Deducted from total allowable costs of the project or program to determine the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs will be based Combination Uses all program income up to (and including) $25,000 as specified under the additive alternative and any amount of program income exceeding $25,000 under the deductive alternative Matching Used to satisfy all or part of the non-Federal share of a project or program Exhibit 8 summarizes the accountability requirements related to the timing of earning and use of program income. Exhibit 8. Summary of Accountability Requirements for Program Income If program income is earned... and that income is ... then the recipient is... During the project period Received and expended during the project period Required to use program income as provided in the NoA During the project period Received and expended after the project period Required to adjust the final FSR to reflect receipt and use of the income as directed by the GMO During the project period Received during the project period but expended after the project period because (1) earned during the final budget period of the project period or (2) with GMO approval (1) Required to use income as provided in the NoA and adjust final FSR accordingly (if earned during the final budget period of the project period) or (2) use the income under addition alternative and report as specified by the GMO After the project period Received and expended after the project period Not accountable for that program income unless specifically provided in the NoA II-61 Reporting of Program Income The amount of program income earned and the amount expended must be reported on the FSR (SF 269\u2014Long Form). Any costs associated with the generation of the gross amount of program income that ar e not charged to the grant should be deducted from the gross program income earned, and the net program income should be the amount report ed. Program income subject to the additive alternative must be reported on lines 10r and 10s, as appropriate, of the FSR; program income subject to the deductive alte rnative must be reported on lines 10c and 10q of the FSR; and program income subject to the matching alternative must be reported on lines 10g and 10q of the FSR. Income earned from the sale of equipmen t must be reported on the FSR for the period in which the proceeds are receiv ed in accordance with the reporting requirements for the program income alte rnative specified. Am ounts due the OPDIV for unused supplies must be reflected as a credit to the grant on line 10c of the FSR. Reporting requirements for accountable income accrued after grant support ends will be specified in the NoA. Interest Earned on Ad vances of Grant Funds The Treasury and OMB policies also establish requirements for recipients to account for interest earned on advances of grant funds and provide for use of the reimbursement method if cash management requirements are not met. Except as provided in 45 CFR 74.22(k), any HHS recipient subject to the requirements of 45 CFR part 74 that receives advance paymen ts must maintain those advances in an interest-bearing account. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds must be handled as follows: Nongovernmental recipients . Any interest earned by nongovernmental recipients on advances of Federal f unds under all Federal grant awards and subawards that, in the a ggregate, exceeds $250 per year (based on the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year ) must be remitted annually to PMS (as the government-wide agent for collection ). Recipients with electronic funds transfer (EFT) capability should use an electronic medium to remit interest. Governmental recipients other than States . Except as provided in 45 CFR 92.21(i), any interest earned by local governments or Indian tribal governments on advances of Federal funds under all Federal grant awards and subawards that, in the aggregate, exceeds $100 per year (based on the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal ye ar) must be remitted promptly, and at least quarterly, to PMS. State governments . State governments operating under Treasury-State agreements are subject to the payment an d receipt of interest as specified in their agreements. All other State reci pients are expected to follow sound financial management practices that minimize the potent ial for excessive Federal cash on hand and to comply wi th the cash management requirements of 45 CFR 92.20 and 21. II-62 Property Management Generally, recipients may use their ow n property management policies and procedures for property purchased, constructe d, or fabricated as a direct cost using HHS grant funds, provided they observe the requirements in 45 CFR 74.31 through 74.37 or 92.31 through 92.34, as applic able. State governments may use and manage equipment acquired under a gran t in accordance with State laws and procedures as specified in 45 CFR 92.32. Unless otherwise indicated, the following requirements for use and management of equipment and supplies do not apply to State governments. See \"Intellectual Property\" for requirements related to that type of property. These property management requirements do not apply to equipment for which only depreciation or use allowances are charge d or to equipment acquired primarily for sale or rental rather than for use. Wh en acquiring replacem ent equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be re placed as a trade-in or may sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the re placement equipment subject to the approval of the OPDIV. The dollar threshold for determining the applicability of several of the requirements in 45 CFR part 74 or 92 is based on the unit acquisition cost of an item of equipment. As defined in 45 CFR 74.2, the cost of an item of equipment includes necessary modifications and attachments that make it usable for the purpose for which it was acquired or fabricated. When such a ccessories or attachments are acquired separately and serve to replace, enhanc e, supplement, or otherwise modify the equipment's capacity and when they indivi dually meet the defini tion of equipment, required OPDIV prior approval for equipmen t must be observed for each item (see \"Prior-Approval Requirements\") . However, the aggregate acquisition cost of a piece of equipment will be used to determine the applicable provisions of 45 CFR 74.34 or 92.32. Fixed equipment that is part of a construction grant also is subject to these requirements. If property is fabricated from individual comp onent parts, each component must itself be classified as equipment if it meets the definition of equipment. In this case, the aggregate ac quisition cost of the resulting piece of equipment will determine the appropriate accountability requirements in 45 CFR 74.34 or 92.32. In general, title to equipment and supplies acquired by a recipient or subrecipient with HHS funds vests in the re cipient or subrecipient upon acquisition, subject to the property management requirements of 45 CFR 74.31, 74.34, 74.35, and 74.37 or of 45 CFR 92.32 and 92.33. Recipients (and subrecipients, as applicable) are required to be prudent in the acquisition of property under a grant-su pported project. It is the recipient's responsibility to conduct a prior review of each proposed property acquisition to ensure that the property is needed and that the need cannot be met with property already in the possession of the organization. If prior a pproval is required for the acquisition, the recipient must ensure that appropriate approval is obtained in advance of the acquisition. The recipient also must fo llow appropriate procurement procedures in acquiring property as sp ecified in \"Procurement Management.\" Recipients of HHS grants other than Federal institutions cannot be authorized to use Federal supply sources except that States may acquire hardware and software from II-63 Federal Supply Schedules consistent with the terms and conditions of those schedules. Recipients of HHS grants must not use equipment acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless th e NoA provides otherwise. Exempt Property Under the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act, 31 U.S.C. 6306, HHS may permit non-profit institutions of higher education and non-profit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research to obtain title to equipment and supplies acquired under grants for support of basic or applied scientific research without further obligation to the Federal government. However, an OPDIV has the right to require transfer of title to equipment with an ac quisition cost of $5,000 or more to the Federal government or to an eligible third party named by the OPDIV under the conditions specified in 45 CFR 74.34(h). An OPDIV may exercise this right within 120 days of the completion or term ination of an award or within 120 days of receipt of an inventory, as provided in 45 CFR 74.34(h)(2), whichever is later. Nonexempt Property All other equipment and supplies acquired under all other HHS grant-supported projects by any other type of non-State recipient are subject to the full range of acquisition, use, management, and disposition requirements of 45 CFR 74.34 and 74.35 or of 45 CFR 92.32 and 92.33. Property acquired or used under an HHS grant- supported project, including any federally owned property, also is subject to the requirements for internal control specifie d in 45 CFR 74.21 or 92.20. Pursuant to 45 CFR 74.37, for recipients subject to those regulations, equipment (and intangible property and debt instruments) acquired with, or improved with, HHS funds may not be encumbered with out OPDIV approval. Equipment Management System The recipient's management system for equipment must meet the requirements of 45 CFR 74.34(f) or 92.32, whic h include the following: Records that adequately identify (according to the criteria specified in the regulations) items of equi pment owned or held by the recipient and state the current location of each item A physical inventory of the equipment, at least once every 2 years, to verify that the items in the records exist and either are usable and needed or are surplus (a statistical sampling basis is acceptable) Control procedures and safeguards to prevent loss, damage, and theft Adequate maintenance procedures to k eep the equipment in good condition Proper sales procedures when the re cipient is authorized to sell the equipment. II-64 For items of equipment having a unit acquis ition cost of $5,000 or more, an OPDIV has the right to require transfer title to the equipment to the Federal government or to an eligible third party named by the OPDIV under the conditions specified in 45 CFR 74.34(h) and 92.32, respectively. This right applies to nonexempt property acquired by all types of recipients, including State governments and Federal institutions, under all types of grants under the stipulated conditions. Sale of Equipment and Supplies For equipment and supplies purchased un der HHS grants for basic or applied research by non-profit institutions of higher education or non-profit organizations whose principal purpose is the conduct of scientific research, the recipient is exempt from any requirement to account for proc eeds from their sale; however, OPDIVs have certain rights wi th respect to such property as specified in \"Exempt Property\" in this section. All other types of grants and recipients ar e subject to the requirements in 45 CFR 74.34 or 92.32, if title to the equipment vests in the recipient rather than in the OPDIV. These requirements al so apply to donated property used to meet a matching or cost-sharing requirement. If the gran t-supported project or program for which equipment was acquired is still receiving OPDIV funding at the time of sale, the recipient must credit the OPDIV share of the proceeds to the grant and use that amount under the deductive al ternative for program income . If the recipient is no longer receiving OPDIV grant support, the am ount due should be paid in accordance with instructions from the OPDIV. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in aggregate fair market value upon termination or completion of the grant and if the supplies are not needed for other federally sponsored progra ms or projects, the recipient may either retain them for use on other than federally sponsored activities or sell them, but, in either case, the recipient must compensate the OPDIV for its share as a credit to the grant. These grants and recipients al so are subject to the requir ements in 45 CFR 74.35 or 92.33 with respect to the use or sale of un used supplies. If the recipient retains the supplies for use on other than federally sponsored activities, an amount is due the OPDIV as if they were sold. Revocable License In some cases, federally owne d tangible personal property may be made available to a recipient under a revocable license agreement. The revocable license agreement between the OPDIV and the reci pient provides for recipient use of the property for the period of grant support un der the following conditions: Title to the property remains with the Federal government. The OPDIV reserves the right to require the property to be returned to the Federal government should it be determined to be in the best interests of the Federal government to do so. The use to which the recipient puts the property does not permanently damage it for Federal government use. II-65 The property is controlled and maintained in accordance with the requirements of the NoA. Debt Instruments Under certain programs and wh en authorized in the NoA, recipients may be allowed or required to enter into financing arra ngement with third parties. Under such circumstances, the NoA will address the OPDIV's role; provisions to be included in agreements with third parties; the recipient's role with respect to the third parties, including responsibilities and liabilities in the event of non- or late payment by a third party; and the recipient's a ccountability during and after the project period. Real Property Acquisition, Use, and Management Real property may be acquired only when authorized by statute and when specifically provided for in the NoA. In addition, activities under individual grants that constitute major renovation of real property or purchase of a trailer or modular unit that will be used as real property may be charged to HHS grants only with specific statutory authority and GMO approval. Real property constructed or acquired under an HHS grant is subject to the requirements of 45 CFR 74.30 through 74.32 and 74.37 or of 45 CFR 92.31, as applicable, regarding use, transfer of title, and disposition, unless alternate requirements are specified in the govern ing statute. For example, the governing statute for a construction grant program may contain usage and disposition requirements that are in addition to or different from the usage and disposition requirements of the governing regulations. To the extent statutory provisions differ from the requirements of 45 CFR part 74 or 92, including those described in this subsection, the statutory provisions, as reflected in the NoA, apply. In addition, statutory provisions or implementing prog ram regulations may specify the duration of the recipient's accountability obligations (e.g., 20 years) or allow for waivers. Real property constructed or renovate d with HHS grant su pport may not be conveyed, transferred, assigned, mortga ged, leased, or in any other manner encumbered by the recipient, except as expr essly authorized in writing by OPDIV. If the recipient defaults in any way on a mortgage, the recipient must immediately notify the GMO by telephone and in writing. If the mortgagor intends to foreclose, the recipient must notify th e GMO in writing at least 30 days before the foreclosure action is initiated. The mortgage agreement must specifically allo w, in the case of default, that HHS or its designee may assume the role of mortga gor and continue to make payments. If HHS (or its designee) chooses not to assume the role of mortgagor in the case of default, the recipient must pay HHS an amount equal to the share of the sales proceeds otherwise due the re cipient multiplied by the HHS share of the property. Any assignment of the property and mort gage responsibilities to any party other than HHS is subject to prior approval of the mortgagor. II-66 Disposition The recipient is accountable to the OPDIV for use of grant-supported real property as long as it owns the property or until it requests disposition instructions from the OPDIV. See Part IV to determine if an OPDIV has statutory or regulatory provisions that specify a different accountability period. For disposition of property acquired on an amortized acquisition basis, the formulas in 45 CFR 74.32 and 92.31 do not apply in de termining the Federal share. In cases of amortized acquisition, the Federal share will be determined by multiplying the amount of mortgage principal already repa id at the time of disposition by the average Federal participation (taken from th e FSR) plus the increase in value over the purchase price multiplied by the average Federal participation plus the Federal participation in the down payment. The computation of the Federal share of real property acquired with long-term debt financing must be computed for each year of grant support in which Federal funds are used to meet all or a portion of the down payment, the principal on the mortgage, or both. If a real estate transaction funded in whole or in part by HHS requires the use of a real estate appraisal (including, but not limited to, appraisals to determine the Federal share of real property and appr aisals to determine required insurance levels), the appraisal must be performed by appraisers certified or licensed by the applicable State in accordance with the re quirements established by Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (P.L. 101-73). Notice of Federal Interest To protect the Federal interest in real pr operty that has been constructed or has undergone major renovation with HHS grant f unds, recipients must record an NFI in the appropriate official records of the jurisd iction in which the property is located. Recordation must occur when construction or renovation begins. Fees charged for recording or modifying the NFI may be charge d to the grant. A copy of the NFI must be provided to the awarding office. Insurance Immediately upon completion of construction, a nongovernmental recipient must, at a minimum, provide the same type of insu rance coverage as it maintains for other property it owns, consistent with the minimum coverage specified below. \"Completion of construction\" means either the point at which the builder turns the facility over to the recipient (e.g., the date of the final acceptance of the building) or the date of benefici al occupancy, whic hever comes first. If title to real property acquired with HHS grant funds vests in the recipient, the following minimum insurance coverage is required: Title insurance policy that insures the fee interest in the real property for an amount not less than the full appraised value of the property. When the Federal participation in the construction of real property covers only a portion of a building, title insurance should cover the total cost of the facility to prevent liens on the unsecured portion from having an adverse impact on the portion with a Federal interest. If the recipient already owns the land (for II-67 example, land in the middle of a campus setting on which a building is being constructed), in lieu of a title insurance policy, the recipient may provide evidence satisfactory to the OPDIV, such as legal or title opinion, that it has good and merchantable title free of all mortgages or other foreclosable liens to all land, rights of way, and ease ments necessary for the project. In instances where a recipient is given land by the State, if the State recently acquired the land in a land swap transaction, the recipient should obtain title insurance. However, if th e State has owned the land for a considerable period of time, title insurance would not be necessary; a copy of the State documents giving the land to the recipient would be sufficient. If the recipient must buy the land on which to build, a legal opinion would not be sufficient; title insurance must be obtained in order to protect the Federal interest in the building to be constructed. Physical destruction insurance policy that insures the full appraised value of the facility from risk of partial and total physical destruction. When the Federal participation in the construction or renovation of real property covers only a portion of a building, the insurance should cover the total cost of the facility, because any damage to the building could make the building unusable and could thus affect the Federal inte rest. The insurance policy is to be maintained for the duration of the Federal interest in the property. The cost of insurance coverage after the period of grant support must be borne by a source other than the grant that provided the funds for the construction or renovation. The grant account will no t remain active for this purpose. Governmental recipients may follow thei r own insurance requirements. Federally owned property provided to a recipient for use need not be insure d by the recipient. Within 5 days of completion or beneficial occupancy, the recipient must submit, to the GMO, a written statement signed by the authorized organizational representative assuring that the recipient has purchase d the required insurance policies on the OPDIV-funded facility and will maintain the insurance coverage at the full appraised value of the facility throughout the period of Federal interest as specified in the NoA. The OPDIV may waive one or both of the re quirements above if the recipient shows that it is effectively self-insured against the risks involved. The term \"effectively self- insured\" means that the reci pient has sufficient funds to pay for any damage to the facility, including total replac ement if necessary, or to satisfy any liens placed against the facility. If a recipient claims self-insurance, it must provide the OPDIV an assurance that it has sufficient funds availabl e to replace or repair the facility or to satisfy all liens. This certification should st ate the source of the funds, such as the organization's endowment or other specia l funds set aside specifically for this purpose. Intellectual Property It is HHS policy that the results and accomplishments of the activities that it funds should be made available to the public . PIs/PDs and recipien t organizations are expected to make the results and accomplishm ents of their activities available to the research community and to the public at larg e. If the outcomes of the research result in inventions, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 , as implemented in 37 CFR part 401, apply. II-68 As long as recipients comply with the pr ovisions of the Bayh-D ole Act, as amended by the Technology Transfer Commercializ ation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-404), and 37 CFR part 401, they have the right to retain title to any invention conceived or first actually reduced to practice using HHS gran t funds. The principal objectives of these laws and the implementing regulation are to promote commercialization of federally funded inventions, while ensuring that inventions are used in a manner that promotes free competition and enterpri se without unduly encumbering future research and discovery. The regulation requires the recipient to de velop and commercialize the technology or use patent and licensing processes to tr ansfer grant-supported technology to industry for development. Al ternatively, unpatented rese arch products or resources may be made available through licensing to vendors or other investigators. Sharing of copyrightable outcomes of research may be in the form of journal articles or other publications. The importance of each of these outcomes is reflected in the specific policies pertaining to rights in data, sharing of re search data and unique research resources, and inventions and patents described in this section. Rights in Data In general, recipients own th e rights in data resulting from a grant-supported project or program. However, the NoA may indi cate alternative rights, e.g., under a cooperative agreement or based on specific programmatic considerations as stated in the applicable program announcement or so licitation. Except as otherwise provided in the NoA, any publications, data,18 or other copyrightabl e works developed under an HHS grant may be copyrighted without OP DIV prior approval. Rights in data also extend to students, fellows, or trainees under awards whose primary purpose is educational, with the authors free to copyright works without OPDIV approval. In all cases, whether HHS funded all or part of the project or program resulting in the data, the Federal government must be given a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license for the Federal government to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the material and to authorize others to do so for Federal purposes, e.g., to make it available in government-sponsored data bases for use by other researchers. The specific scope of OPDIV rights with respect to a particular grant-supported effort will be addressed in the NoA. Data developed by a subrecipient also are subject to this policy. Access to Research Data HHS handles requests for the release of research data from certain types of recipients as FOIA requests (see 45 CFR 74. 36). The term \"research data\" is defined as the recorded factual mate rial commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings. It does not include preliminary analyses; 18 For this purpose, \"data\" means recorded information, regardless of the form or media on which it may be recorded, and includes writings, films, sound recordings, pictorial reproductions, drawings, desi gns or other graphic representations, procedural manuals, forms, diagrams, work flow charts, equipment descriptions, data files, data processing or computer pr ograms (software), statistical records, and other research data. II-69 drafts of scientific papers; plans for future research; peer reviews; communications with colleagues; physical objects (e.g., laboratory samples, audio or video tapes); trade secrets; commercial information; materi als necessary to be he ld confidential by a researcher until publications in a peer-reviewed journal; information that is protected under the law (e.g., intellectual property); personnel or medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which woul d constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; or information that could be used to identify a particular person in a research study. As required by 45 CFR 74.36, recipients that are institutions of higher education, hospitals, or non-profit orga nizations must release research data first produced in a project supported in whole or in part with Federal funds that are cited publicly and officially by a Federal agency in support of an action that has the force and effect of law (i.e., regulations and administrative orders). If the data are publicly available, HHS directs the requester to the pub lic source. Otherwise, the OPDIV FOI coordinator handles the request, consulting with the affected recipient and the PI. This requirement also provides for assessm ent of a reasonable fee to cover grantee costs and (separately) the HHS costs of responding. This requirement to release research data does not apply to commercial organizations or to research data produced by State or local governments. However, if a State or local governmental recipient contracts with an educational institution, hospital, or non-profit organization, and the contract results in covered research data, those data are subject to the disclosure requirement. Publications As a means of sharing knowledge, HHS en courages recipients to arrange for publication of the results and accomplishments of HHS-supported activities. OPDIV prior approval is not required for publishing the results of an activity under a grant. Recipients also may assert co pyright in scientific and technical articles based on data produced under the grant and transfer it to the publisher or others where necessary to effect journal publication or inclusion in proceedings associated with professional activities. Any such transf er is subject to the roya lty-free, non-exclusive and irrevocable license to the Federal gove rnment and any agreement should note explicitly that the assignment is subject to the government license. Journal or other copyright practices ar e acceptable unless the copyright policy prevents the recipient from making copies for its own use (as provided in 45 CFR 74.36 and 92.34). The recipient should a ccount for royalties and other income earned from a copyrighted work as spec ified by the OPDIV (see Part IV and the NoA). For each publication that results from HHS grant-supported activities, recipients must include an acknowledgment of grant support using one of the following statements: \"This publication was made possible by Grant Number ________ from _________.\" \"The project described was supported by Grant Number ________ from ________.\" II-70 Recipients also must include a disclaimer stating the following: \"Its contents are solely the respon sibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official vi ews of the [name of OPDIV, OPDIV component, or HHS].\" If the recipient plans to issue a press re lease concerning the outcome of HHS grant- supported activities, it should notify the OPDIV in advance to allow for coordination. One copy of each publication resulting from work performed under an HHS grant- supported project must accomp any the annual or final progress report submitted to the OPDIV. Patents and Inventions The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-517; 35 U.S.C. 200-212) and the related EO 12591 (April 10, 1987) provide incentives for th e practical application of research or results of other activities supported throug h Federal funding agreements. To be able to retain rights and title to inventions ma de with Federal funds, so-called \"subject\" inventions, the recipient must comply with a series of regulations that ensure the timely transfer of the technology to the private sector, while protecting limited rights of the Federal government. The regulations apply to any subject invention\u2014defined as any invention either conceived or first actually reduced to prac tice in the performanc e of work under the Federal award\u2014and to all types of recipients of Federal funding. This includes non- profit entities and small businesses or large businesses receiving funding through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts as direct recipien ts of funds or as subrecipients or subcontractors under those awards. HHS recipients may retain intellectual property rights to subject inventions provided they do the following: Report all subject inventions to the OPDIV Make efforts to commercialize the subject invention through patent or licensing Formally acknowledge the Federal govern ment's support in all patents that arise from the subject invention Formally grant the Federal government a limited use license to the subject invention. Subawards and contracts under an award al so must reflect the objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act and the Technology Transfer Commercialization Act of 2000 to ensure that inventions made are used in a manner to promote free competition and enterprise without undu ly encumbering future research and discovery. Royalties and Licensing Fees from Copyrights, Inventions, and Patents HHS recipients do not have to report pr ogram income resulting from royalties or licensing fees from sale of copyrighted ma terial unless the NoA provides otherwise. II-71 The NoA may include additional terms and conditions if commercialization of an invention is an anticipated ou tcome of a research project. Pursuant to the regulation s implementing the Bayh-D ole Act (37 CFR 401.14(h)), HHS requires reporting of income resulting from HHS-funded inventions and patents. Specifically, as part of the annual invention utilization report, recipients must report income generated by all subject inventions to which title has been elected, including inventions that have been patented and those that are licensed but not patented (see \"Invention Reporting\" in this section). Invention Reporting Exhibit 9 summarize s recipient responsibilities for invention reporting as specified in 37 CFR part 401. Recipients should refe r to 37 CFR part 401 (available on the Interagency Edison site: https://s-edison.info.nih.gov/iEdison/) for a complete discussion of the regulations. Exhibit 9. Extramural Invention Reporting Compliance Responsibilities Action required When action must be taken Discussion 37 CFR part 401 reference Employee Agreement to Disclose All Inventions The PI/PD (employee) must sign an agreement to abide by the terms of the Bayh-Dole Act and the HHS GPS as they relate to intellectual property rights. At time of employment. Recipients and subrecipients must have policies in place regarding ownership of intellectual property. 401.14(f)(2) Invention Report and \"Disclosure\" The recipient must submit to the OPDIV a report of any subject invention. This includes a written description (the so-called \"invention disclosure\") of the invention. Within 2 months of the inventor's initial report of the invention to the recipient. There is no single format for disclosing the invention to the Federal government. The report must identify inventor(s), OPDIV grant number, and date of any public disclosure. 401.14(a)(2) 401.14(c)(1) Rights to Subrecipient Inventions Subrecipients retain rights to any subject inventions they make. Within 2 months of the inventor's initial report of the invention to the subrecipient. (The subrecipient has the same invention reporting obligations as the recipient.) The recipient cannot require ownership of a subrecipient's subject inventions as a term of the agreement. 401.14(g)(1) 401.14(g)(2) Election of Title to Invention The recipient must notify the OPDIV of its decision to retain or waive title to invention and patent rights. Within 2 years of the initial reporting of the invention to the OPDIV. 401.14(b) 401.14(c)(2) 401.14(f)(1) II-72 Exhibit 9. Extramural Invention Reporting Compliance Responsibilities Action required When action must be taken Discussion 37 CFR part 401 reference Confirmatory License For each invention, the recipient must provide a use license to the OPDIV for each invention. Promptly after election of title to the invention. 401.14(f)(1) Patent Application The recipient must inform the OPDIV of the filing of any non-provisional patent application. The patent application must include a Federal government support clause. Within 1 year after election of title, unless there is an extension. Initial patent application is defined as a non-provisional U.S. application. The patent application number and filing date must be provided. 401.14(c)(3) 401.2(n) Assignment of Rights to Third Party If the recipient is a non-profit organization, it must seek OPDIV approval to assign invention or U.S. patent rights to any third party, including the inventor(s). As needed. Recipients that are for-profit entities (including small businesses) do not need to seek approval. 401.14(k) Issued Patent The recipient must notify the OPDIV that a patent has been issued. When the patent is issued. The patent issue date, number, and evidence of Federal government support clause must be provided. 401.5(f)(2) Extension of Time to Elect Title or File Patent The recipient may request an extension of up to 2 years for election of title, or 1 year for filing a patent application. As needed. Request for extension of time must be made. Such requests are preapproved. 401.14(c)(4) Change in Patent Application Status The recipient must notify the OPDIV of changes in patent status. At least 30 days before any pending patent office deadline.This notification allows the OPDIV to consider continuing the patent action. 401.14(f)(3) Invention Utilization Report The recipient must submit information about the status of commercialization of any invention for which title has been elected. Annually. This report gives an indication of whether the objectives of the law are being met. Specific reporting requirements can be found in i -Edison ( https://s- edison.info.nih.gov/iEdison/ ). 401.14(h) II-73 Exhibit 9. Extramural Invention Reporting Compliance Responsibilities Action required When action must be taken Discussion 37 CFR part 401 reference Annual Invention Statement The recipient must indicate any inventions made during the previous budget period on all grant awards. Generally part of the competing application or non- competing grant progress reports. For PHS OPDIVs, the information is requested as a checklist item on the PHS 398 application or through the SF 424 (R&R), as applicable, and on the non-competing grant progress report (PHS 2590). PHS 398 and PHS 2590; SF 424 (R&R) Final Invention Statement and Certification The recipient must submit to the GMO a summary of all inventions made during the entire term of each grant award. Within 90 days after the project period (competitive segment) ends. Required information is specified on the HHS 568 form. If no inventions occurred during the project period, a negative report must be submitted. 401.14(f)(5) A recipient's failure to comply with any of these or other regulations cited in 37 CFR part 401 may result in the loss of pate nt rights or an enforcement action. The Bayh-Dole Act includes provisions for th e recipient to assign invention rights to third parties. Recipients that are non-profit organizations must request OPDIV approval for the assignment . If the assignment is approved and the rights are assigned to a third party, invention and pa tent reporting requirements apply to the third party. The recipient should review existing agreements with third parties and revise them, as appropriate, to ensure that they are consistent with the terms and conditions in the NoA and that the objecti ves of the Bayh-Dole Act are adequately represented in the assignment. Any invention made using funds awarded for educational purposes, e.g., training grants or certain types of career develo pment awards, is not considered a subject invention and therefore is not subject to invention reporting requirements (as provided in 45 CFR part 74 and 37 CFR 401.1(b)). The recipient should seek the advice of the GMO to verify whether any invention made under a career development award should be considered a subject invention. All issues or questions regarding extramural technology transfer policy and reporting of inventions and their utilization should be referred to the GMO or other designated individual. Sharing Research Tools HHS believes that sharing of data and othe r research tools produced or developed by investigators under HHS grants, such as ce ll lines, certain types of animals (e.g., transgenic mice), and computer programs, is essential for expedited translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. II-74 HHS endorses the sharing of final research data and research tools to serve these and other important scientific goals and expects and suppor ts the timely release and sharing of final research data and research tools from HHS-supported studies for use by other researchers. \"Timely release and sh aring\" is defined as no later than the acceptance for publication of the main fi ndings from the final data set or after submission to the OPDIV. Rest ricting the availability of unique resources can impede the advancement of further research. For any subaward, including a consortium ag reement, that may result in research data or tools, the recipien t must include a provision requiring third-party data or research tools to be made available to th e recipient and, as a ppropriate, the OPDIV upon request, to allow for sharing. HHS recognizes that data sharing may be co mplicated or limited, in some cases, by organizational policies, local IRB rules, and local, State and Federal laws and regulations, including the Privacy Rule. The rights and privacy of individuals who participate in HHS-sponsored research must be protected at all times. Thus, data intended for broader use should be free of identifiers that would permit linkages to individual research participants and variables that could lead to deductive disclosure of the identity of individual subjects. Investigators also must exercise great care to ensure that resources involving human cells or tissues do not identify original donors or subjects, either directly or through iden tifiers such as codes linked to the donors or subjects. To facilitate the availability of research tools developed with OPDIV funds, investigators may distribute the materi als through their own laboratory or organization or submit them, if appropri ate, to a repository. Investigators are expected to submit unique biological information, such as DNA sequences or crystallographic coordinates, to the appropri ate data banks so that they can be made available to the broad scientific community. When distributing unique resources, investigators are to include pertinent information on the nature, quality, or characterization of the materials. In addition to sharing data and research resources with the research community, upon request of the OPDIV, the recipient al so must provide a copy of documents or a sample of any material developed under an HHS grant award. The recipient may charge a nominal fee to cover shipping co sts for providing this material. Income earned from these charges must be treated as program income. Organizations that believe they will be unable to comply with these requirements should promptly contact the GMO to discuss the circumstances, obtain information that might enable compliance, and reach an understanding in advance of an award. Procurement Management Recipients may acquire a variety of commercially available goods or services in connection with a grant-supported project or program. States may follow the same policies and procedures they use for procur ements from non-Federal funds. All other recipients must follow the re quirements in 45 CFR 74.40 through 74.48 or 92.36, as applicable, for the purchase of goods or se rvices through contra cts under grants. The requirements for third-party activities involving transfer of substantive programmatic work are addressed under \"Subawards\" in this section. II-75 A contract under a grant must be a written agreement between the recipient and the third party. The contract must, as appropriat e, state the activities to be performed; the time schedule; the policies and requir ements that apply to the contractor, including those required by 45 CFR 74.48 or 92.36(i) and other terms and conditions of the grant (these may be incorporated by reference where feasible); the maximum amount of money for which the recipient ma y become liable to the third party under the agreement; and the cost principles to be used in determinin g allowable costs in the case of cost-type contracts. The contra ct must not affect th e recipient's overall responsibility for the direction of the pro ject or program and accountability to the Federal government. Therefore, the agreem ent must reserve suff icient rights and control to the recipient to enable it to fulfill its responsibilities. When a recipient enters into a service-type contract in which the term is not concurrent with the budget period of the award, the recipient may charge the costs of the contract to the budget period in wh ich the contract is ex ecuted even though some of the services will be performed in a succeeding period if the following conditions are met: The awarding office has been made aware of this situation ei ther at the time of application or through post-award notification. The project has been recommended for a project period extending beyond the current year of support. The recipient has a legal commitment to continue the contract for its full term. However, costs will be allowable only to the extent that they are for services provided during the period of OPDIV support. To limit liability if continued OPDIV funding is not forthcoming, it is recommended that recipients insert a clause in such contracts of $100,000 or less stipulating that payment beyond the end of the current budget period is contingent on continued Federal funding. The contract provisions prescribed by 45 CFR 74.48 and 92.36(i)(2) specify termination provisions for contracts in excess of $100,000. In general, the rental costs for facilities and equipment applicable to each budget period should be charged to that period. Recipients are encour aged to consult the GMO before entering into leases that will result in direct charges to the grant project. Approval Requirements The procurement standards in 45 CFR 74.44 and 92.36(g) allow OPDIVs to require approval of specific procurement transactio ns under the following circumstances (and provide a mechanism for governmental recipi ents to be exempt from this type of review): A recipient's procurement procedures or operations do not comply with the procurement standards requir ed by those regulations. II-76 The procurement is expected to exceed the \"simplified acquisition threshold\" (currently $100,000) (formerly the \"small purchase threshold\" ) established by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, as amended, and is to be awarded without competition, or only one bid or proposal is received in response to a solicitation. A procurement that will ex ceed the simplified acquisition threshold specifies a \"brand name\" product. A proposed award over the simplified acquisition thresh old is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed-bid procurement. A proposed contract modifi cation changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount considered to be a simplified acquisition. When OPDIV prior approval is required, th e recipient must make available sufficient information to enable review. This may include, at OPDIV discretion, pre-solicitation technical specifications or documents, such as requests for prop osals or invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates. Approval may be deferred pending submission of addition al information by the recipient or may be conditioned on the receipt of additional information. Any resu lting OPDIV approval does not constitute a legal endorsement of the business arrangem ent by the Federal government nor does such approval establish the OPDIV as a party to the contract or any of its provisions. Requirements for Using Small Businesses, Minority-Owned Firms, and Women-Owned Businesses Recipients must make positive efforts to use small busine sses, minority-owned firms, and women-owned businesses as sources of goods and services whenever possible. Recipients are required to take the fo llowing steps to implement this policy: Place qualified small, minority-owned, and women-owned business enterprises on solicitation lists Ensure that small, mino rity-owned, and women-owned business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources Consider contracting with consortia of small, minority-owned, or women-owned business enterprises when an intended contract is too large for any one such firm to handle on its own or, if economically feasible, divide larger requirements into smaller transactions for which such organizations might compete Make information on contracting opportunities available and establish delivery schedules that encourage participat ion by small, minority-owned, and women-owned busine ss enterprises Use the services and assistance of the SBA and DoC's Minority Business Development Agency, as appropriate If subcontracts are to be let, require the prime contractor to take the affirmative steps listed above. II-77 Subawards This section includes the requirements for a grant involving subawards, including consortium agreements in which the recipi ent collaborates with one or more other organizations in carrying out the grant-supported activity. Subrecipients should be selected by the recipient using its estab lished policies. HHS does not require that subawards comply with the procurement stan dards and requirements outlined above. The recipient is accountable to the OPDIV for the performance of the project, the appropriate expenditure of grant funds by all parties, and all other obligations of the recipient, as specified in th e HHS GPS. In general, the re quirements that apply to the recipient, including the intellectual property and program income requirements of the award, also apply to subrecipients. The recipient is responsi ble for including the applicable requirements of the HH S GPS in its subaward agreements. The recipient must enter into a formal wri tten agreement with each subrecipient that addresses the arrangements for meeting the programmatic, administ rative, financial, and reporting requirements of the grant, including those necessary to ensure compliance with all applicable Federal regulations and policies. At a minimum, the subaward agreement must include the following: Identification of the PI/PD and individuals responsible for the programmatic activity at the subrecipient organization along with their roles and responsibilities. Procedures for directing and moni toring the programmatic effort. Procedures to be followed in providing funding to the subrecipient, including dollar ceiling, method and schedule of payment, type of supporting documentation required, and procedur es for review and approval of expenditures of grant funds. If different from those of the recipien t, a determination of policies to be followed in such areas as travel re imbursement and salaries and fringe benefits (the policies of the subrecipient may be used as long as they meet HHS requirements). Incorporation of applicable public policy requirements and provisions indicating the intent of the subrecipient to comply, including submission of applicable assurances and certifications. For research subawards, in clusion of the following: h Statement specifying whether the financial conflict of interest requirements of the collaborating organization or those of the recipient apply. h Provision addressing ownership and disposition of data produced under the agreement. h Provision making the sharing of data and research tools and the inventions and patent policy applicable to the subrecipient and its employees in order to ensure that the rights of the parties to the II-78 agreement are protected and that the recipient can fulfill its responsibilities to the OPDIV. This provision must include a requirement to report inventions to the recipient and specify that the recipient has the right to request and receive data from the subrecipient on demand. Provisions regarding property (other than intellectual property), program income, publications, reporting, record retention, and audit necessary for the recipient to fulfill its obligations to the OPDIV. Changes in Organizational Status Recipients must give HHS advance notice of the following types of changes in organizational status: Merger\u2014legal action resulting in the unifica tion of two or more legal entities. When such an action invo lves the transfer of HHS grants, the procedures for recognizing a successor-in-interest will apply. When the action does not involve the transfer of HHS grants, th e procedures for recognizing a name change normally will apply. Successor-in-interest\u2014process whereby the rights to and obligations under an HHS grant are acquired incidental to the transfer of all of the assets of the recipient or the transfer of that part of the assets involved in the performance of the grant. A successor-in-interest may result from legislative or other legal action, such as a merger or other corporate change. Name change \u2014action whereby the name of an organization is changed without otherwise affecting th e rights and obligations of that organization as a recipient. If the change would be considered a change of grantee organization as described in \"Prior-Approval Requirements\u2014O PDIV Prior Approval,\" the recipient must obtain that approval rather than simply notifying the OPDIV of its intent. Advance notification is required to ensure that the recipient still is able to meet its legal and administrative obligations to HHS and payments are not interrupted. Recipients are encouraged to contact the GM O of the lead OPDIV awarding office to explain the nature of the change in organi zational status and receive guidance on whether it will be treated as a name ch ange or successor-in-interest. The lead awarding office ordinarily will be the OPDIV with which the organization has the most HHS grants. If there is no advance consulta tion, HHS reserves the right to review the material provided, seek clarification or additional information, and make an independent determination. A recipient's formal request for a change in organizational status should be submitted as soon as possible so that HHS can determine whethe r the organization will continue to meet the grant program' s eligibility requirements and take the necessary action to reflect the change in advance of the change in status. II-79 For a successor-in-interest, a letter signed by the authorized organizational representative of the curre nt recipient (trans feror) and the successor-in-interest (transferee) must be sent to the lead awar ding office, following consultation with the GMO of that office. The letter must do the following: Stipulate that the transfer will be properly effected in accordance with applicable law. Indicate that the transferor relinquishes all rights and interests in all of the affected grants. Request that the HHS awarding office (o ffices) modify its (their) records to reflect the transferee as the recipient of record. State the effective da te of the transfer. Provide the transferee's Entity Identification Number and DUNS number. Include verification of the transf eree's compliance with applicable requirements (e.g., research misconduct). Include a list of all affected HHS grants (active and pending) with the following information for each: h Complete grant number. h Name of PI/PD. h Current budget period and project period. h Total direct costs (as originally recommended) plus applicable indirect costs for each remaining budget peri od. If the successor-in-interest will occur during a budget period rather than on the anni versary date, the transferor also must provide estimate d levels of current-year direct and indirect costs remaining as of the effective date of the transfer. The estimate may be reported on the offi cial statement relinquishing interests and rights in the grant (e.g ., PHS 3734 is available at http://www.hhs.gov/forms/publicuse.html or an equivalent relinquishing statement) for each affect ed grant or may be itemized by grant number as an attachment to the letter. Include a complete application face page for each affected grant showing the transferee as the applicant organization. Each face page must be signed by both the PI/PD and the authorized organizational representative at the transferee organization. Include a copy of the current negotiated indirect cost rate agreement for the transferee. In order to be recognized as the succe ssor-in-interest, the \"new\" (transferee) organization must meet each grant progra m's eligibility requirements. Upon review and acceptance of this information, the awar ding office will revise the NoA to show the transferee as the recipient of record. II-80 For name changes, the recipi ent's written notification to the lead awarding office must include the effective da te of the change. Revised fa ce pages are not required for name changes because name changes ar e processed with the next award action (e.g., non-competing continuation award), and the organization will submit a face page with the information submi tted as part of that action. Federally Sponsored Surveys Recipients may use HHS grant funds to collect information through surveys or questionnaires under the following conditions: When the collection of in formation is not a primary objective of the grant but is incidental to, or is an integral part of, a grant-supported activity. When the collection of in formation is a primary objective of the grant, but such information is not intended primarily for the use of the Federal government or a party designated by the Federal government. (Contracts are used for this purpose unless a grant is specifically required by legislation.) When information is collected according to either of the two conditions above, recipients are prohibited from representing to their respondents that the information is being collected for, or in association with, the Federal government unless OPDIV approval has been obtained and, when requ ired, OMB report clearance procedures as contained in OMB regulations implementing the PRA at 5 CFR part 1320, Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public, have been followed. (When OMB approval is required, the OPDIV, rather than the recipient, is responsible for obtaining the necessary clearance.) OMB clearance is required whenever HHS sp onsors the use of a reporting form or plan to collect identical kinds of information or data from 10 or more people. Information collection is considered to be sponsored by HHS when one or more of the following circumstances exist: The OPDIV authorizes the recipient of a grant to represent to respondents that the information is being collected for, or in association with, an OPDIV. The recipient of a grant uses the report form or plan to collect information that an OPDIV has requested for the planning, operation, or evaluation of its program. The terms and conditions of a grant aw ard provide for OPDIV approval of the study design, questionnaire content, or data collection procedure. The terms and conditions of a grant aw ard provide for either submission of the data for individual respondents or the preparation and submission of special requested tabulations to the OPDIV. Any information collection under a cooperative agreement. HHS and OMB approval may also be required if the use of a report form or plan presents a relatively high risk of unwarranted invasion of privacy. II-81 Collection of the following types of information is not subject to the clearance requirements under OMB regu lations at 5 CFR part 1320: Health professions data as described in Section 708 of the PHS Act, as amended Tests or examinations given individuals for determining knowledge, abilities, or aptitudes of the person tested and the collection of information for identification or cla ssification in connect ion with such tests Information from patients that is to be used exclusively for research on or direct treatment of a clinical disorder; for the interpretation of biological analyses of body fluids, tissues, or other specimens; or for identification or classification of such specimens (see 5 CFR part 1320 for additional exemptions from clearance requirements). Monitoring Recipients are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of grant- supported activities using their established co ntrols and policies, as long as they are consistent with HHS requirements. However, to fulfill their role in regard to the stewardship of Federal funds, OPDIVs moni tor their grants to identify potential problems and areas where technical assist ance might be necessary. This active monitoring is accomplished through review of reports and correspondence from the recipient, audit reports, site visits, and ot her information available to the OPDIV. The names and telephone numbers of the individuals respon sible for monitoring the programmatic and business management aspe cts of a project or activity will be provided to the recipient as part of the NoA. During post-award administration, the GMO monitors expenditures for conformance with cost policies. The GMO's monitoring in cludes, among other things, responding to prior-approval requests and reviewing financial reports, audit reports, and other periodic reports. The GMO also may use au dit findings as the basis for final cost adjustments. The PO's monitoring includes review of progress reports, prior-approval requests, and other correspondence (written or telephonic), and site visits. Monitoring of a project or activity will continue for as long as the OPDIV retains a financial interest in the project or activity as a result of property accountability, audit, and other requirements that may cont inue for a period of time after the grant is administratively closed out and the OPDIV is no longer providing active grant support. Reporting HHS requires that recipients periodically submit financial and progress reports. Other required reports may include annual invention utilization reports, research misconduct reports, property reports, lobbying disclosures (as required by 45 CFR 93.110(c)), audit reports, reports to the a ppropriate payment points (in accordance with instructions received from the paym ent office), and spec ialized programmatic reports. II-82 Unless otherwise indicated in the NoA, the GMO is generally the receipt point for most required reports, including non-competing continuation applications, annual and final progress reports, FSRs, final invention statements and certifications, property reports, and lobbying disclosure statements. Generally, an original and two copies of progress reports must be subm itted. Submission of these reports to individuals other than the GMO may result in delays in processing of the non- competing continuation award or the submi ssion being considered delinquent. Also see Part IV of the HHS GPS. Recipients are allowed a specified period of time in which to submit required financial and final progress reports (see 45 CFR 74 .51, 74.52, 92.40, and 92.41 and the discussion in this subsection ). Failure to submit comp lete, accurate, and timely reports may indicate the need for closer mo nitoring by HHS or may result in possible award delays or enforcement actions, in cluding conversion to a reimbursement payment method or withholding a non-competing continuation award (also see \"Overdue Reports\" in this section). Financial Reporting Reports of expenditures are required as documentation of the financial status of grants according to the offi cial accounting records of th e recipient. Financial or expenditure reporting is accomplished using the FSR (SF 269 or SF 269A); the recipient must use the long form (SF 269) to report program income earned and used. The FSR generally is required annually, unless otherwise indicated in the NoA. If an FSR is required annually an d the award is operating un der an authorized no-cost extension, an FSR must be submitted for each 12 months of activity, regardless of the overall length of the extended budget period. For example, if the budget period would have ended on July 31, 2006, but is extended to July 31, 2007, the recipient must submit two FSRs\u2014one for the period August 1, 2005-July 31, 2006 and one for the period August 1, 2006-July 31, 2007. Wh en required annually, the report must be submitted for each budget period no later than 90 days after the close of the budget period or applicable 12-month period. If FSRs are required more frequently than annually, the NoA will specify both the frequency and due date. Some OPDIVs provide for electronic submission to the OPDIV. See Part IV for OPDIV-specific information concerning financial reporting, including the means of submission. For some awards, in lieu of the annual FSR, the OPDIV will use the quarterly FCTR, submitted to PMS to monitor the financial aspects of grants. The GMO may review the report for patterns of cash expendit ures, including accelerated or delayed drawdowns, and to assess whether performa nce or financial management problems exist. For these awards, an FSR generally is required only at the end of a competitive segment. It must be subm itted within 90 days after the end of the competitive segment and must report on the cumulative support awarded for the entire segment. An FSR must be submitted at this time whether or not a competing continuation award is made. If no further award is made, this report will serve as the final FSR. Before submitting FSRs, recipi ents must ensure that the information submitted is accurate, complete, and consistent with the recipient's ac counting system. The authorized organizational representative's signature on the FSR certifies that the II-83 information in the FSR is correct and complete and that all outlays and obligations are for the purposes set forth in grant documents, and represents a claim to the Federal government. Filing a false claim may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties (see \"Fraud, Waste, an d Abuse\" in Part I of the HHS GPS). In some cases, the recipient may have to revise or amend a previously submitted FSR. When the revision results in a bala nce due to the OPDIV, the recipient must submit a revised FSR whenever the overcharge is discovered, no matter how much time has lapsed since the original due date of the report. Revised expenditure reports representing ad ditional expenditures by the re cipient that were not reported to the OPDIV within the 90-day time fram e may be submitted to the GMO with an explanation for the revision. The explanation also should indicate why the revision is necessary and describe what action is be ing taken by the recipient to preclude similar situations in the future. This should be done as promptly as possible, but not later than 1 year from the due date of the original report, i.e., 15 months following the end of the budget period. If an adjustment is to be made, the awarding office will advise the recipient of actions it will take to reflect the adjustment. The OPDIV will not accept any revised report received after that date and will return it to the recipient. Progress Reporting Progress reports generally are required annually as part of the non-competing continuation award process. However, th e OPDIV may require these reports more frequently. Progress reports must be subm itted to, and approved by, the OPDIV to non-competitively fund each additional budget pe riod within a previously approved project period (competitive segment). When used in lieu of a non-competing continuation application, the progress report typically includes an updated budget in addition to other required information. The form/format to be used and the information to be included in the progress report are specified in the NoA or in specif ic OPDIV guidance, e.g., non-competing continuation guidance. Some OPDIVs have implemented procedures for the electronic transmission of progress reports. See Part IV for OPDIV-specific information on electronic procedures for submitting progress reports. Progress reports must be subm itted directly to the awarding office. Late submission or receipt of an incomplete grant progress report will result in delaying the issuance and funding of the non-competing continua tion award and may re sult in a reduced award amount. The progress report for the final budget pe riod of a competitive segment for which a competing continuation application is submitted will be part of that application; however, if an award is not made or the re cipient does not submit an application for continued support, a final progress report is required. The OPDIV will specify the requirements for progress reporting under construction grants or grants supporting both construc tion activities, including acquisition or modernization, and nonconstruction activities. II-84 Other Reporting Each competing continuation grant application and progress report (when used in lieu of a non-competing continuation applic ation) must indicate whether or not any subject inventions were made during the pr eceding budget period. If inventions were made, the recipient must indi cate whether they have b een reported. The recipient also must submit an annual invention utilization report for all subject inventions to which title has been elected and inventions that have been licensed but not patented (research tools). The utilization report provides a way to evaluate the extent of commercialization of subject inventions, cons istent with the objectives of the Bayh- Dole Act. Bayh-Dole regulations allow recipients to report inventions electronically (37 CFR 401.16). Electronic reporting is available through an In ternet-based system called Interagency Edison ( https://s-edison.info.nih.gov/ i-Edison/ ). Recipients should make all reasonable efforts to submit invention reports using i-Edison, where possible. The system supports confidential transmission of required information and provides a utility for generating reports and reminders of pending reporting deadlines. Further information about the system, including instructions for creating an account needed to submit reports electronically, is available on the i-Edison site. Title to federally owned property rema ins vested in the Federal government. Annually, recipients must submit to the OPDIV an inventory listing federally owned property in the recipient's custody. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient must report the property to the awarding office for further agency utilization. If the OPDIV has no further need for the property, it must be declared excess an d reported to GSA, unless the OPDIV has statutory authority to dispose of the prop erty by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Techno logy Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 3710(I) to donate research equipment to educational an d non-profit organizations in accordance with EO 12821, \"Improving Mathematics an d Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals\"). The OPDIV will issue appropriate instructions to the recipient. Overdue Reports Failure to submit required reports within the time allowed may result in suspension or termination of an active grant, withholding a non-competing continuation award, or other enforcement actions, including withholding of payments or converting to the reimbursement method of pa yment. Continued failure to submit required reports may result in the imposition of special award provisions or cause other eligible projects or activities involving that recipient or the individual responsible for the delinquency to not be funded. If at any time the recipient provides an acceptable explanation regarding the late submission of a report, the OPDIV may waiv e the reporting requirement or set a new due date. However, once a report becomes overdue, such action will be taken by the OPDIV only if the reasons for the recipient's inability to submit the report on time are legitimately beyond its control or if the purposes for which the report is to be used can be accomplished through other means. Fa ilure to meet a new date may result in the OPDIV taking action as described above. II-85 Submission of a required report does not ne cessarily fulfill the recipient's obligation. Such reports must also meet the content re quirements in regulations or other grant terms. Where reports need to be revised in order to be accepted, the recipient must provide a revised report by the due date indicated or immediate fund cutoff or other enforcement actions may be taken with regard to the delinquency. Record Retention and Access Recipients generally must retain financ ial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records that are required by the terms of a grant, or may reasonably be considered pertinent to a grant, for a period of 3 years from the date the annual FSR is submitted. For awards where the FSR is submitted at the end of the co mpetitive segment, the 3-year retention period will be calculated from the date the FSR for the entire competitive se gment is submitted. Those recipients must retain the records pertinent to the entire competitive segment for 3 years from the date the FSR is submitted. See 45 CFR 74.53 and 92.42 for exceptions and qualifications to the 3-year retention requirement (e.g., if any litigation, claim, financial management review, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year pe riod, the records must be retained until all litigation, claims, or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken). Those sections also specify the retention period for other types of grant-related records, including in direct cost proposals and property records. See 45 CFR 74.48 and 92.36 for record retention and a ccess requirements for contracts under grants. Audit Requirements An audit is a systematic review or appr aisal made to determine whether internal accounting and other control systems provid e reasonable assurance of the following: Financial operations are properly conducted. Financial reports are timely, fair, and accurate. The entity has complied with applicable laws, regulations, and terms and conditions of award. Resources are managed and used economically and efficiently. Desired results and objectives ar e being achieved effectively. Recipients (other than Federal institutions) and subrecipients are subject to the audit requirements of OMB Circular A-133, as implemented by 45 CFR 74.26 and 92.26, or the audit requirements stated in 45 CFR 74.26(d) and in the HHS GPS (for types of organizations to which OMB Ci rcular A-133 does not direct ly apply). In general, OMB Circular A-133 requires a State governme nt, local government, or non-profit organization (includi ng institutions of higher ed ucation) that expends $500,000 or more per year under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and/or procurement contracts to have an annual audit by a public accountant or a Federal, State, or local governmental audit or ganization. The audit must meet the standards specified in generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS). II-86 A for-profit organization is required to have a non-Federal audit if, during its fiscal year, it expended a total of $500,000 or more under one or more HHS awards (as a direct recipient and/or as a subrecipient ). Title 45, part 74.26(d) of the CFR incorporates the thresholds and deadlines of OMB Circular A-133 but provides for- profit organizations two options regarding the type of audit that will satisfy the audit requirements. The recipient ei ther may have (1) a financial-related audit (as defined in, and in accordance with, the Government Auditing Standards [commonly known as the \"Yellow Book\"], (GPO stock 020-000-00-26 5-4) of all the HHS awards, or (2) an audit that meets the requirem ents of OMB Circular A-13 3. Foreign recipients are subject to the same audit requirements as for-profit organizations specified in 45 CFR 74.26(d). When a recipient procures audit services, the procurem ent must comply with the procurement standards of 45 CFR part 74 or 92, as applicable, including obtaining competition and making posi tive efforts to use small, minority-owned, and women- owned business enterprises. Recipients should ensu re that comprehensive solicitations made available to interested firms include all audit requirements and specify the criteria to be used for se lection of the firm. Recipients' written agreements with auditors must specify the ri ghts and responsibiliti es of each party. OMB Circular A-133 explains in detail the sco pe, frequency, and other aspects of the audit. Some highlights of th is circular are as follows: Covered organizations expending $500, 000 or more per year in Federal awards are required to have an audit made in accordance with the circular. However, if the awards are under one program, the organization can have either a single organization-wide audi t or a program-specific audit of the single program, subject to the provisio ns of Section 235 of the circular. OPDIV research awards may not be considered a single program for this purpose. Covered organizations expe nding less than $500,000 in any year are exempt from these audit requirements in that year but must have their records available for review by the OPDIV. The data collection form and copies of the reporting package must be submitted to the FAC at the following address: Federal Audit Clearinghouse Bureau of the Census 1201 E. 10th Street Jeffersonville, IN 47132 The reporting package must contain the following: h Financial statements and Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards h Independent auditor's report, includ ing an opinion on the financial statements and the Schedu le of Expenditures of Federal Awards, a report on compliance and internal control over financial reporting, and a report on compliance with requirements applicable to each major program and on internal control over su ch compliance requirements h A schedule of findings and questioned costs II-87 h If applicable, a summary of prior audi t findings and a corrective action plan. An audit under OMB Circular A-133 is in lieu of a financial audit of individual Federal awards. However, Federal agen cies may request a dditional audits necessary to carry out their responsibilities under Fede ral laws or regulations. Any additional audits wi ll build upon work perf ormed by the independent auditor. If the schedule of findings and questioned costs discloses an audi t finding related to an HHS award or if the schedule of prior audit findings reports the status of any audit finding relating to an HHS award, the FAC wi ll provide copies of the audit report to NEARC, OIG, HHS. NEARC will, in turn, distribute them within HHS for further action, as necessary. Recipients must follow a systematic meth od for ensuring timely and appropriate resolution of audit findings and recommendations, whether discovered as a result of a Federal audit or a recipient-initiated audi t. Recipients usually are allowed 30 days from the date of request to respond to the responsible audit resolu tion official (Action Official) concerning audit findings. Failure to submit timely responses may result in cost disallowance or other actions by HHS or the OPDIV. At the completion of the audit resolution process, the recipient will be notified of the Action Official's final decision. The recipient may appeal this decision if the adverse determination is of a type covered by the OPDIV or HHS grant appeals procedures (see \"Grant Appeals Procedures\"). Refunds owed to the Fede ral government as a result of audit disallowances must be made in accordance with instruct ions issued by the Action Official. It is imperative that recipients submit re quired OMB Circular A- 133 audits within the time limits specified in the circular. If recipients are delinquent in complying with the provisions of the circular, HHS or the OPDIV will impose sanctions that may result in the loss of Federal funds. No audit costs will be allowed either as indirect costs or direct costs to Federal awards if the requ ired audits have not been completed or have not been conducted in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-133. Enforcement Actions A recipient's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award, including confirmed instances of research misconduc t, may cause an OPDIV to take one or more enforcement actions, depending on the severity and duration of the non- compliance. The OPDIV will undertake any such action in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, and policies. The OPDIV generally will afford the recipient an opportunity to correct the defi ciencies before taking enfo rcement action unless public health or welfare concerns require immediat e action. However, even if a recipient is taking corrective action, the OPDIV may take proactive steps to protect the Federal government's interests, including placing special conditions on awards or precluding the recipient from obtaining future awards for a specified period, or may take action designed to prevent future non-compliance, such as closer monitoring. If the OPDIV takes an enforcement action as a result of research misconduct or will more closely monitor an award through the use of special conditions, the OPDIV will share this information with other HHS components. II-88 Modification of the Terms and Conditions of Award During grant performance, the GMO may include special conditions in the award to require correction of identified financial or administrative de ficiencies. When the special conditions are imposed, the GMO will notify the recipient of the nature of the conditions, the reason why they are being imposed, the type of corrective action needed, the time allowed for completing corrective actions, and the method for requesting reconsideration of the conditions. (See 45 CFR 74.14 or 92.12.) The OPDIV also may withdraw approval of the PI/PD or ot her key personnel if there is a reasonable basis to conclude that they are no longer qualified or competent to perform. In that case, the OPDIV may re quest that the recipient designate a new PI/PD or other key personnel. The decision to modify the terms of an award\u2014by imposing special conditions, by withdrawing approval of the PI/PD or other key personnel, or otherwise\u2014is discretionary on the part of the OPDIV. Withholding a Non-Competing Continuation Award An OPDIV may decide not to make a non- competing continuation award within the current competitive segment for one or more of the following reasons: Adequate Federal funds are not av ailable to support the project. A recipient failed to show satisfactory progress in achieving the objectives of the project. A recipient failed to meet the terms and conditions of a previous award. For whatever reason, continued funding wo uld not be in the best interests of the Federal government. If a non-competing continuation award is denied (withheld) be cause the recipient failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a previous award, the recipient may appeal that determination. Depending on the nature of the deficiency, an OPDIV also may temporarily withhold payment or convert the grant from an ad vance payment method to a reimbursement method. Suspension or Termination If a recipient has failed to materially comply with the terms and conditions of award, the OPDIV may suspend the grant, pending corrective action, or may terminate the grant for cause. The regulatory procedures that pertain to suspension and termination are specified in 45 CFR 74.61 and 74.62 and in 45 CFR 92.43. The OPDIV generally will suspend (rather than immediately terminate) a grant and allow the recipient an opportunity to take appropriate corrective action before making a termination decision. The OPDIV may decide to terminate the grant if the recipient does not take approp riate corrective action during the period of suspension. II-89 The OPDIV may terminate\u2014without first suspending\u2014the grant if the deficiency is so serious as to warrant immediate termination or if public health or welfare concerns require immediate action. Termination for cause may be appealed under the OPDIV and HHS grant appeals procedures. A grant also may be terminated, partially or totally, by the recipient or by the OPDIV with the consent of the recipi ent. If the recipient decides to terminate a portion of a grant, the OPDIV may determine that the remaining portion of the grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the gran t was originally awarded. In any such case, the recipient will be advised of the po ssibility of termination of the entire grant and will be allowed to with draw its termination request. If the recipient does not withdraw its request for partial termination, the OPDIV may initiate procedures to terminate the entire grant for cause. See \"Selected Items of Cost\" for the allowabili ty of termination cost s. Allowability of these costs does not vary whether a grant is terminated for cause by the OPDIV, terminated at the request of the recipient, or terminat ed by mutual agreement. Other options available to an OPDIV incl ude suspension or debarment under 45 CFR part 76. Suspension under 45 CFR part 76 (see Eligibility\u2014Suspension and Debarment\" in Part I) is a distinct action from \"suspension\" described above in conjunction with termination. Closeout The OPDIV will close out a grant as soon as possible after expiration if the grant will not be extended or after termination, as provided in 45 CFR 74.71 through 74.73 and in 45 CFR 92.50. Closeout includes ensuring timely submission of all required reports and adjustments for amounts due the recipient or the OPDIV. Closeout of a grant does not automatically cancel any requirements for property accountability, record retention, or financial accountability. Following closeout, the recipient remains obligated to return funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions, and the Federal government may recover amounts based on the results of an audit covering any part of the period of grant support. Unless the GMO grants an extension, recipients must submit a final FSR, final progress report, and Final Invention Statement and Certification within 90 days of the end of grant support. Failure to submit timely and accurate final reports may affect future funding to the organizati on or awards with the same PI/PD. Final Financial Status Report A final FSR is required for any grant that is terminated, any grant that is transferred to a new recipient, or any award at the end of the project pe riod (or if comprised of multiple competitive segments, at the end of each competitive segment). II-90 The final FSR must cover the en tire project period (competitive segment) or as much of the project period (compe titive segment) as has been funded before termination or transfer. Final FSRs must have no unliquidated obligations and must indicate the exact balance of unobligated funds. Unob ligated funds must be returned to the OPDIV or must be reflected by an appropri ate accounting adjustment in accordance with instructions from the GMO or from the payment office. Fo r those organizations receiving their funds through PMS, final re ports, as specified by PMS, must be submitted to that office. It is the recipi ent's responsibility to reconcile reports submitted to PMS and to the OPDIV. Reconciliation consists of ensuring that disbursements equal obligations and draw downs or making any adjustments as necessary, e.g., for an overpayment. Wi thdrawal of the un obligated balance following expiration or termination of a gran t is not considered an adverse action and is not subject to appeal. When the submission of a revised final FS R results in addition al claims by the recipient, the OPDIV will consider the approval of such claims subject to the following minimum criteria: The recipient must indicate why the re vision is necessary and explain and implement internal controls that will preclude similar occurrences in the future. The charge must represent otherwise allowable costs under the provisions of the grant. There must be an unobligated balanc e for the budget period sufficient to cover the claim. The funds must still be available for use. The OPDIV must receive the revised FSR within 12 months of its original due date. Final Progress Report A final progress report is required for any grant that is terminated and at the end of the project period. The final progress report should follow specific OPDIV instructions and be submitted to the GMO, but minima lly will include a summary of progress toward the achievement of the originally stated aims, a list of significant results (positive or negative), and a list of publications. If the recipient submits a competing continuation application, the final progre ss report requirement will be met by the information included in that application. II-91 Final Invention Statement and Certification For research grants, the recipient must submit a Final Invention Statement and Certification (HHS 568), whether or not the funded activity results in any subject inventions. The HHS 568 must list all inventions that were conceived or first actually reduced to practice during the course of wo rk under the grant, and it must be signed by the PI/PD and an authoriz ed organizational representa tive. The completed form to be submitted to the GMO should cover the pe riod from the original effective date of support through the date of expiration or te rmination of the award. If there were no inventions, the form should indicate \"Non e.\" Copies of the HHS 568 are available on the i-Edison Web site at https://s-edison.info.nih.gov/iEdison/ . Debt Collection An OPDIV may administratively recover fund s paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally de termined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award, including mi sspent funds or unallowable costs incurred. If the recipient does not pay back the fund s in accordance with the demand by the OPDIV, which specifies the period of time for repayment, the OPDIV may collect the debt by making an administrative offset against payments that would be due under other grant awards, withholding advance payments that would otherwise be due, or taking any other action permitted by statute. Several Federal statutes governing debt collection and the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR parts 900-904) require th e OPDIV to collect debts due to the Federal government and, except where prohib ited by law, to charge interest on all delinquent debts owed to the OPDIV by re cipients (also see HHS claims collection regulations at 45 CFR part 30). Debts may re sult from cost disallowances, recovery of funds, unobligated balances, or other circumstances. Unless otherwise specified in law, regulation, or the terms and conditions of the award, debts are considered delinquent 30 da ys after notification to the recipient of the indebtedness. The interest on delinquent debts will be computed from the original notification date to the recipien t of the indebtedness. The interest rate applied will be the current value of funds rate or the private consumer rate of interest fixed by Treasury, whichever is higher. A higher rate may be charged if necessary to protect the intere sts of the Federal government. Penalties and administrative collection costs also will be charged in accordance with the act and the implementing HHS regulations, as follows: A penalty charge of 6 percent a year wi ll be assessed on debts that are more than 90 days overdue. Penalty charges will accrue from the date the debt became overdue until th e indebtedness is paid. Delinquent debtors will be assessed charges to cover the Federal government's administrative costs of collecting overdue debts. From time to II-92 time, HHS will publish a notice in the Federal Register setting forth the amounts to be assessed for admi nistrative collection costs. If a recipient appeals an adverse monetary determination under 45 CFR part 16 or specific OPDIV appeal procedures, collect ion will be suspen ded pending a final decision on the appeal. If the determination is sustained (either fully or partially), interest will be charged begi nning with the date of the original notification to the recipient of the indebtedness. Appeals HHS permits recipients to appeal to the DAB certain post-award adverse administrative decisions made by HHS officials (see 45 CFR part 16). In addition, some OPDIVs have implemented OPDIV-specif ic appeal procedures (see Part IV). In general, a recipient may appeal the following OPDIV actions: Termination, in whole or in part, of a grant for failure of the recipient to carry out its approved project in accordance with the applicable law and the terms and conditions of award or for failure of the recipient otherwise to comply with any law, regulation, assurance, term, or condition applicable to the grant Determination that an expenditure no t allowable under the grant has been charged to the grant or that the recipien t has otherwise failed to discharge its obligation to account for grant funds Denial (withholding) of a non-competing continuation award for failure to comply with the terms of a previous award Determination that a grant is void (i.e., a decision that an award is invalid because it was not authorized by stat ute or regulation or because it was fraudulently obtained). The formal notification of an adverse determination will contain a statement of the recipient's appeal rights. As the first level in appealing an advers e determination, the recipient must submit a request for review to the HHS or OPDIV official specified in the notification, detailing the nature of the disagreement with the adverse determination and providing supporting documents in accordance with the procedures contained in the notification . A recipient may not submit an appeal directly to the DAB where OPDIV appeal procedures are in place. In those instances, the DAB will review only thos e appeals that have been re viewed and acted on by the OPDIV. II-93 In addition to the adverse determinations indicated, the DAB is the single level of appeal for disputes related to the establis hment of indirect co st rates, research patient care rates, and certai n other cost allocations used in determining amounts to be reimbursed under HHS grants (e.g., cost allocation plans negotiated with State or local governments and computer, fringe benefit, and other special rates). HHS encourages its OPDIVs and recipients to try to resolve disputes by using alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techni ques. ADR often is effective in reducing the cost, delay, and contentiousness involved in appeals and other traditional ways of handling disputes. ADR techniques include mediation, neutral evaluation, and other consensual methods. Information about ADR is available from the HHS Dispute Resolution Specialist at the Departmental Appeals Board, U.S. De partment of Health and Human Services, Wa shington, DC 20201. Requirements for Specific Types of Grants Conference Grants This section addresses requirements fo r grants that support domestic and international conferences, which may be supported by grants or cooperative agreements. If no specific or alternative requirement for co nference grants is stated below or elsewhere in this HHS GPS, the requirements applicable to all other types of grants apply. Questions concerning conf erence grants or the allowability of conference activity under other types of OPDIV grants should be directed to the GMO. Definitions Definitions of key terms are as follows: Scientific meeting (conference)\u2014a gathering, symposium, seminar, workshop, or any other organized, formal event where people assemble to coordinate, exchange, and disseminate information or to explore or clarify a defined subject, problem, or area of knowledge. International conference\u2014a meeting so designated by its sponsor or one to which open invitations are issued on an equal basis to potential participants in two or more countries other than the United States or Canada. The meeting may be held in any country, including the United States. Domestic conference\u2014a meeting held in the United States or Canada primarily for U.S. or U.S.-Canadian participation (even if foreign speakers are invited). II-94 Representation Appropriate representation of women, indi viduals who are member s of racial/ethnic minority groups, people wi th disabilities, and other individuals who have been traditionally underrepresented must be included in all aspects of planning, organization, and implementa tion of OPDIV-sponsored or -supported meetings. \"Appropriate representation\" is based on th e availability of individuals from these groups known to be working in a partic ular field of endeavor. If appropriate representation is not apparent, the OPDIV will not make an award until the applicant has submitted acceptable documentation of its compliance. Funding Awards in support of a single conference will be made for a project period commensurate with the time involved in pl anning and conducting the conference and post-conference follow-up, usually 1 ye ar. A conference grant made to a permanently sponsoring organization for conferences held annually or biennially on a recurring topic may be awarded for up to a total of 5 years and will be funded annually, based on the availability of funds. Continued funding beyond the first year will be contingent on a report of satisfactory progre ss. A change in conference focus is considered a change in scope and requires OPDIV prior approval. Acknowledgment of Support and Disclaimer Conference grant materials, including promotional materials, the agenda, and any Internet sites that advertis e the conference, must ackn owledge that HHS provided support for the conference, whether in whol e or in part. That acknowledgment must be accompanied by a disclai mer indicating that information provided or views expressed at the conference, whether orally or in writing, or in any documents resulting from the conference, do not nece ssarily reflect the official views of the OPDIV providing the support or imply en dorsement by the Federal government. Use of the following language fulfills this requirement: \"Funding for this conference was made possible [ in part, if applicable ] by [insert grant or cooperative agreement number ] from [ insert name of OPDIV]. The views expressed in written conference mate rials or publications and by speakers and moderators do not necessarily reflect the official policies of the Department of Health and Human Services nor does mention of trade names, commercial pr actices, or organizations imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.\" Use of HHS and OPDIV Logos Generally, the NoA will indicate the conditions for use of the HHS or OPDIV logo in conference materials. If not specified in the NoA, a recipient must obtain prior approval to use an HHS or OPDIV logo. Un authorized use of th e HHS or OPDIV name or logo may result in imposition of civil monetary penalties (as provided in 42 CFR part 1003). II-95 Allowable and Unallowable Costs Grant funds may be awarded to provide gene ral support of domestic or international conferences held in the Unit ed States or Canada. Grant funds may not be used to provide general support for international conferences held outside the United States or Canada. Grant funds may be awarded to support only specific aspects of an international conference held outside the Un ited States or Canada. An example of a specific aspect would be a selected symposium, panel, or workshop. This section highlights allowable and unallo wable costs under conference grants. No costs other than those specified in Exhibit 10 as allowable, including any qualifications on their allowability, are permitted under conference grants. Exhibit 11 addresses areas for which applicants/recipie nts frequently seek clarification about allowability. Exhibit 10. Allowable Costs under Conference Grants Grant funds may be used for Under the following circumstances Conference services Necessary recording of proceedings, simultaneous translation, and subsequent transcriptions. Consultant services Consultant fees, including travel and supporting costs (per diem or, where applicable, subsistence). Equipment rental Rental of necessary equipment. Federal employees See \"Requirements for Specific Types of Recipients-Grants to Federal Institutions and Payments to (or on Behalf of) Federal Employees under Grants.\" Meals When certain meals are an integral and necessary part of a conference (i.e., a working meal where business is transacted), grant funds may be used for such meals, as qualified under \"Travel\" in this exhibit. Publication costs When grant funds are awarded to pay for either the entire or partial cost of publication of proceedings or a book or pamphlet, costs of special plates, charts, diagrams, printing, distribution, mailing, postage, and general handling, unless otherwise specified in the NoA. Registration fees Registration fees paid by the recipient to other organizations on behalf of attendees, provided such fees cover only those allowable costs properly chargeable to the grant. Salaries In accordance with the policy of the recipient, all or part of the salaries of professional personnel, clerical assistants, editorial assistants, and other non-professional staff in proportion to the time or effort directly related to the conference. Speakers' fees Speakers' fees for services rendered. Supplies Purchase of supplies for the conference if the supplies are received and used during the project period. II-96 Exhibit 10. Allowable Costs under Conference Grants Grant funds may be used for Under the following circumstances Travel Travel of staff, speakers, participants, and attendees, if identified in the application and approved at the time of award. Travel expenses for employees of the recipient are governed by the recipient's travel policies, consistently applied regardless of the source of funds. Any U.S. foreign travel restrictions that are in effect at the time of the award will be followed, such as \u00a1 limitations or restrictions on countries to which travel will be supported or budgetary or \u00a1 other limitations on availability of funds for foreign travel. Proposed per diem or subsistence allowances must be reasonable and limited to the days of attendance at the conference plus the actual travel time to reach the conference location by the most direct route. Local mileage costs only may be paid for local participants. Where meals and/or lodgings are furnished without charge or at a nominal cost (e.g., as part of the registration fee), the proposed per diem or subsistence allowance must take this into consideration. Transportation costs for attendees and participants at the conference may not exceed coach class fares. In all cases, U.S. flag carriers will be used where possible. Exhibit 11. Selected Unallowable Costs under Conference Grants Item Description A&R Not allowable under any circumstances. Entertainment and personal expenses Costs of amusement, diversion, social activities, ceremonials, and related incidental costs, such as bar charges, tips, personal telephone calls, and laundry charges of participants or guests, are unallowable. However, meals may be allowable as provided under \"Meals\" in Exhibit 10. Equipment purchase Not allowable under any circumstances. Honoraria Honoraria or other payments given for the purpose of conferring distinction or to symbolize respect, esteem, or admiration may not be paid from grant funds. Indirect costs Not allowable under any circumstances. Local participants' expenses With the exception of local mileage as indicated under \"Travel\" in Exhibit 10, grant funds may not be used to pay per diem or expenses for local participants in the conference. Membership dues Not allowable under any circumstances. Research patient care Not allowable under any circumstances. Intellectual Property: Publications, Copyright, and Public Disclosure If a recipient publishes materi al developed in whole or in part with HHS funds, the material may be distri buted free of charge. If the reci pient charges for the material, the sales proceeds are considered program income and must be accounted for as specified in the NoA and reported on the FSR. II-97 Unless otherwise provided in the terms and conditions of the award, the recipient is free to arrange for copyright of any public ation resulting from an OPDIV-supported conference. However, any such copyrighted publication is subject to a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to the Fede ral government to reproduce, translate, publish, and dispose of the material and to authorize others to use the work for government purposes. Copyright does not extend to any materials prepared by Federal employees as part of their official duties. The recipient should notify conference participants that any presentation or discussion constitutes public disclosure of information. Once information is disclosed publicly, it may adversely impact the degree to which any intellectual property rights could be protected. Reporting and Record Retention Recipients are responsible for submitting the following reports to the OPDIV upon completion or termination of a gr ant in support of a conference. Progress/Final Report For single conferences, a final report of the conference must be submitted in accordance with OPDIV instructions to the awarding office within 90 days after the end of the project period. With the approval of the OPDI V, copies of proceedings or publications resulting from a conference may be substituted for the final report, provided they contain the information specified for inclusion in the final report. Financial Status Report An FSR is required from the recipient within 90 days after the end of the project period. Records of expenditures and an y program income generated must be maintained in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 74.53 or 92.42. Construction and Modernization of Facilities This section applies to the following OPDIV grant-supported activities: Construction of new facilities, which includes the installation of fixed equipment, but excludes the cost of land and off-site improvements Modernization of existing facilities, which includes alteration, renovation, remodeling, improvement, expansion, or repair; provision of equipment necessary to make the building suitable for use by a particular program; and the modernization, or completion, of shell space. This may be under a grant for this purpose or as A&R un der another type of grant. To provide support for construction or modernization that is considered \"major\", an OPDIV must have specific statutory authorit y allowing construction or modernization. Even if an OPDIV has this authority, a re cipient may not incur costs for construction or modernization unless the OPDIV spec ifically authorizes such costs. II-98 In addition, an applicant/re cipient may propose to undertake an A&R project under a non-construction grant. HHS characterize s A&R projects as \"minor\" or \"major,\" depending on the type of activity proposed and the cost of the project and the threshold set by the HHS GPS or the OP DIV (see \"Cost Considerations\u2014Allowable Costs and Activities,\" Approval,\" Part IV). An OPDIV may support a major A&R pro ject only if it has specific statutory authority allowing modernization. Generally, an A&R project that is under the OPDIV threshold is treated as minor A&R; however, depending on the activity proposed, it may be considered modernization (which cannot be supported unless the OPDIV has the required statutory authority). The requir ements that apply to minor A&R projects are addressed in \"Allowabl e Costs and Activities.\" Except where indicated, the requirements in this section apply to HHS grant- supported construction or modernization (hereafter, \"construction\") in lieu of the requirements stated elsewhere in Part II of the HHS GPS for construction or modernization. Other activities under th e award would be subject to those other policies. However, there may be areas of overlap, e.g., a rebudgeting action that causes a minor A&R project to become a major A&R project. Funding Construction grants usually involve a single award, covering more than 1 year, made on the basis of an applicatio n for the entire construction project. Incremental funding (budget periods) within a project period norm ally is not used for construction grants. Allowable and Unallowable Costs and Activities Exhibits 12 and 13 indicate types of costs and activities generally allowable and unallowable under HHS construction grants. The allowability and unallowability of costs and activities apply to the use of Federal funds and funds expended by the grantee to satisfy cost sharing or matchi ng requirements (see \"Matching or Cost Sharing\"). The lists are not all-inclusive. Program guidelines and other terms and conditions of the award should be consulted for the specific costs allowable under a particular program or grant. Exhibit 12. Allowable Costs and Activities under Construction Grants Item Description Acquisition and installation of fixed equipment Allowable. Architectural and engineering services Allowable. Bid advertising Allowable. Bid guarantees and performance and payment bonds Bid guarantees and performance and payment bonds are allowable as provided in 45 CFR 74.48 or 92.36(h). Contingency fund Applicants for construction grants may include a project contingency amount with the initial cost estimates for construction contracts to provide for unanticipated charges. This amount will be limited to 5 percent of construction costs before bids are received and must be reduced to 2 percent after a construction contract has been awarded. II-99 Exhibit 12. Allowable Costs and Activities under Construction Grants Item Description Filing fees for recording the NFI Allowable. Force account If the grantee's own construction and maintenance staffs are used in carrying out modernization activities (i.e., force account), the associated costs are allowable provided the grantee can document that a force account is less expensive than if the project were competitively bid and can substantiate all costs with appropriate receipts for the purchase of materials and certified pay records for the labor involved. This requires OPDIV prior approval. Compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act Allowable. May include hiring special consultants to research and document the historic value of proposed performance sites and costs associated with preparation and presentation of required materials to inform the public and others. Incentive costs for contractors Allowable consistent with contract type as specified in the solicitation of bids or proposals and in the contract. Incentive costs must be reasonable and appropriately documented, e.g., that conditions to earn the incentive were met. In addition to an incentive fee provision, incentive-type contracts may also contain a penalty provision. Other types of bonus payments are not allowable. Inspection fees Allowable. Insurance Costs of title insurance, physical-destruction insurance, and liability insurance are generally allowable. Physical destruction and liability insurance are usually treated as F&A costs but may be treated as direct costs in accordance with the established policy of the recipient, consistently applied regardless of the source of funds. Title insurance, if required, may be charged to the grant in proportion to the amount of OPDIV participation in the property (see \"Real Property \u2014Insurance \"). Legal fees Legal fees related to obtaining a legal opinion regarding title to a site are allowable. Pre-award costs Costs incurred before award for architect's fees and consultant's fees necessary to the planning and design of the project are allowable if the project is subsequently approved and funded. Project management Allowable. Relocation expenses Allowable. Sidewalks necessary for use of facility Allowable. Site clearance. Site clearance costs are allowable as long as they are reflected in the bid. Site survey and soil investigation Allowable. NEPA analysis Costs associated with evaluati on of the environmental effects of proposed construction activity and producing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) are allowable. II-100 Exhibit 12. Allowable Costs and Activities under Construction Grants Item Description Threat-risk assessment. Costs incurred for a site-specific or project-specific assessment of security risk by a qualified professional are allowable. The threat-risk assessment identifies and quantifies potential threats, both internal and external to the building, its contents, the personnel working in it, and the general public. The analysis also includes a thorough examination and evaluation of the physical aspects of the proposed facility, along with operational issues. Exhibit 13. Unallowable Costs and Activities under Construction Grants Bonus payments other than earned incentive payments to contractors under formal incentive arrangements are unallowable. Construction of shell space designed for completion at a future date. Consultant fees not related to actual construction. Damage judgment suits. Equipment purchased through a conditional sales contract. Indirect/F&A costs. Fund-raising expenses. Land acquisition. Legal services not related to site acquisition. Movable equipment. Off-site improvements such as parking lots are not allowable. Prior-Approval Requirements Recipients must obtain OPDIV prior approv al for the following types of recipient- initiated project or budget changes: A revision that would result in a change in scope of the project, including proposed modifications that would materially alter the costs of the project, space utilization, or financial layout, resulting in changes in the previously approved procurement method or co ntract. Modificati ons that would materially alter the costs include significant rebudgeti ng actions, whether or not the particular expenditure requires prior approval and increase in the amount of Federal funds needed to complete the project. Any other applicable change as specified in \"Prior-Approval Requirements.\" Change in the use of the facility (see \"Use of Facility and Disposition\" in this section). The request for approval must include sufficient information to allow the OPDIV to review the circumstances and need for the proposed change. After receipt of OPDIV prior approval, the recipient may make or authorize the approved modifications of II-101 the construction contract. Other less subs tantive modifications to construction contracts may be made without OPDIV prior approval. However, copies of all change orders to construction contracts must be retained as grant-related records (see \"Record Retention and Access\"). Procurement Requirements Construction activity usually is carried ou t through one or more contracts under the grant. Therefore, the circumstances of the procurement ar e critical to the successful completion of the grant-suppo rted project. All constructi on work must be procured by the methods described in 45 CFR 74.40 th rough 74.48 or in 92.36, as applicable. Equal Employment Opportunity, Labor Standards, and Other Contract Requirements Equal employment opportunity and labor standards requirements for federally assisted construction and modernization must be specified in the information provided to potential bidders/offerors on construction contracts under HHS grants and must be included in the resulting contract documents (see 45 CFR part 74, Appendix A, and 45 CFR 92.36(i)). The Davis-Bacon Act or the Copeland \"Anti- Kickback\" Act apply only if specifically required by the program's authorizing statute. The NoA will indicate if they apply. Equal Employment Opportunity Requirements Construction contracts (and subcontracts) awarded under HHS grants are subject to the requirements of EO 11246 (September 24, 1965), as amended, as implemented in 41 CFR part 60-1 by OFCCP, DoL. The reci pient is required to include the \"Equal Opportunity Clause\" at 41 CF R 60-1.4(b) in any construc tion contract under the grant. The contractor must be directed to include this clause in any applicable subcontracts. In addition, recipients and construction co ntractors under HHS grants are required to comply with the solicitation and contract requirements for affirmative action specified in 41 CFR part 60-4 for contracts in specified geographical areas that will exceed $10,000. These requirements ar e specified in EO 11246 (\"Notice of Requirement for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity\") and EO 11246 (\"Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Construction Contract Specifications\"). The OFCCP regulations also require that the recipient notify the applicable OFCCP regional, area, or field office when it expe cts to award a construction contract that will exceed $10,000. Further information about thes e requirements and the full text of these regulations are available at http://www.dol.gov/esa/ofcp_org.htm Labor Standards Requirements Preservation of Open Competition and Go vernment Neutrality toward Government Contractors' Labor Relations on Federal an d Federally Funded Construction Projects. Pursuant to EO 13202, as amended by EO 13208 (April 6, 2001), executive agencies issuing grants, providing Federal assistance, or entering into cooperative agreements II-102 for construction projects (including major and minor A&R) must ensure that bid specifications, project agreements, or other controlling documents for construction services contracts awarded by recipients of grants, cooperative agreements, or other financial assistance do not do the following: Require or prohibit bidders, offerors, co ntractors, or subcontractors to enter into or adhere to agreements with on e or more labor organizations, on the same or other related construction pro jects. It does not prohibit contractors or subcontractors from voluntarily entering into such agreements. Otherwise discriminate against bidde rs, offerors, contractors, or subcontractors for becoming, refusing to become, or remaining signatories, or otherwise adhering to agreements with one or more labor organizations, on the same or other related construction projects. Non-segregated Facilities. Pursuant to 41 CFR 60-1.8, for any contract for construction services that will exceed $10,000, the gr antee must require each prospective contractor to submit a certification that the contractor does not, and will not, maintain any facilities it provides for its employees in a segregated manner; does not or will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location, under the contractor's contro l, where segregated facilities are maintained; and will obtain a similar certification befo re awarding any covered subcontract. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards. Contractors and subcontractors providing construction services under HHS grants with contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000 are subject to the requirem ents of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 40 U.S.C. 3701-3708, concerning the payment of overtime and the maintenance of healthful and safe working conditions if the statute authorizing the grant provides wage standa rds for the project to be funded by the grant. Under this act, wages paid any laborer or mechanic employed by the contractor or subcontractor must be computed on the basi s of a standard workweek of 40 hours. For all work in excess of the standard wo rkweek, mechanics and laborers must be compensated at a rate not less than one-and- a-half times the basic rate of pay. If this requirement is violated, the contractor or subcontractor is liable to the employee for the unpaid wages and may be liable to the Federal government for liquidated damages. The OPDIV or the recipient ma y withhold otherwise payable funds to satisfy any such liability. The statute also specifies penalties for intentional violation of these requirements. Further, pursuant to standa rds issued by the Secretary of Labor, a contractor or subcontractor under an HHS grant (with contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000) must not require any laborer or me chanic employed in the performance of the contract to work in surroundings or un der working conditions that are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to an individual 's health or safety. Violation of these requirements may be cause for debarment fr om future Federal contracts or financial assistance. II-103 Other Requirements Liquidated Damages. Invitations for bids must stipulate a time for completion of the project, expressed either in calendar days or as a fixed date, for each prime contract to be awarded under the project. At the op tion of the grantee, a liquidated damages provision may be included in the contract , allowing for assessment of damages when the contractor has not completed the construction or modernization by the date specified in the contract. Liquidated damage s must be real and justified and must be approved by the OPDIV before solicitat ion. Where damages are assessed, any amounts paid belong to the recipient. Disposition of Unclaimed Wages. During or after the period of performance of an HHS-assisted contract for construction servic es, if it is discove red that an employee is entitled to wages but cannot be locate d for the purposes of payment (or for some reason refuses to accept payment), the gr antee may eventually have to repay the Federal government. The recipient should notify the GMO that an escrow account has been established in the affected employee's name and should maintain the account for 2 years (or longer if required by State or local law) following the completion of the contract. Upon the expiration of this period, any amounts still unclaimed will be disbursed by refunding to the OPDIV either the entire amount, if the construction or modernization project was 100 percent funded by the OPDIV, or an amount representing the percentage of OPDIV participation in the project. If the project was funded by more than one HHS program at differing rates, the refund sh ould be based on an average percentage calculated by weighting each program's rate of participation by the dollar amount of that program's contribution. If the contractor has made a reasonable effo rt to locate the empl oyee by having mail forwarded and contacting the employee's unio n, the recipient need not repeat such attempts. If there is reason to believe that the contractor's efforts to locate employees that are due wages were not th orough, the recipient should attempt to locate the employees. Doing so will reduce the likelihood of future claims against the recipient. If any wages held in escrow are paid to an employee or an employee's legal representative while the account is maintained, a complete report must be made to the GMO when the account is closed. Use of Facility and Disposition HHS awards for construction or modernization generally require that a facility be used for the programmatic purpose of the aw ard as long as needed for that purpose (see the NoA or Part IV). During that time, the recipient must use the facility for the originally authorized purpose unless it obtains prior approval from the OPDIV to use the facility for an alternate purpose. If, du ring the required usage period, the facility is no longer used for the original intend ed purpose, the OPDIV may, for recipients covered by 45 CFR part 74, provide prior appr oval for alternate use as specified in 45 CFR 74.32; direct the recipient to sell the property or allow it to retain title and recover the OPDIV share; or direct that titl e be transferred to a third party named by the OPDIV (see \"Property Management\u2014Real Property\"). The usage obligation may also be transferred to facilities of substantially comparable or greater monetary value or utility to ca rry out the original purpose for which the II-104 grant was awarded. In this event, the remaining usage obligation must be released from the original facility constructed wi th grant funds and transferred to the new facility. The recipient remain s subject to all other requir ements imposed by the NoA or successor document (if the change occurs following the period of grant support). The OPDIV will monitor compliance with these requirements through periodic facility use certifications or reports, site vi sits, and other appropriate means for the duration of the required usage period. After the required usage period, the organization has no further accountability to the OPDIV concerning the use of the property or any sales proceeds. If, during the required usage period, the fa cility is no longer used for the original intended purpose and the OPDIV did not prov ide prior approval for an alternate use, the recipient must comply with dispositio n requirements. The OPDIV may recover its share of the construction or modernization co sts. For disposition of property acquired on an amortized acquisitio n basis, the formulas in 45 CFR 74.32 and 92.31 do not apply in determining the Federal share. In cases of amortized acquisition, the Federal share will be determined by multiplying the amount of mortgage principal already repaid at the time of disposition by the average Federal participation (taken from the FSR) plus the increase in value over the purchase price multip lied by the average Federal participation plus the Federal pa rticipation in the down payment. The computation of the Federal share of real property acquired with long-term debt financing must be computed for each year of grant support in which Federal funds are used to meet all or a portion of the do wn payment, principal on the mortgage, or both. Traineeship, Fellowship, and Similar Awards Made to Organizations on Be half of Individuals Applicants/recipients should consult the funding opportunity announcement and any program guidance or guidelines for application instructions; eligibility requirements, including citizenship and sp onsorship requirements; an d other program-specific requirements related to required forms, a llowable costs, and reporting requirements. Detailed requirements for the Kirschstein-Na tional Research Service Awards program are found at http://grants1.nih.gov/training/extramural.htm . Some of the administrative requirements that pertai n to fellowships under that program are described below. See Part IV for other programs. Initiation of Support The OPDIV will notify the individual of the intention to make an award and confirm the plans for the start of fellowship support. The fellowship award notice allows the individual to begin the fello wship immediately on or after the issue date, but permits up to 6 months for the individual to make final arrangements, such as the completion of degree requirements, final c oordination with the sponsor, and, if necessary, a move to the spon soring institution. The fellow must start the period of training under the award by the latest activation date as shown on the award notice, i.e., 6 months from the award issue date. Th e activation period may be extended in unusual circumstances. Written requests fo r extensions should be submitted by the fellow and must be countersigned by the sp onsor and the authorized organizational representative. II-105 An activation notice must be submitted to the awarding office as of the day the fellow begins training. A payback agreement may also be required to be completed and submitted (see Part IV or the program guidelines). A stipend may not be paid until the forms are submitted and the fellow be gins training. If necessary for payroll purposes, the activation notice and payback agreement may be submitted up to 30 days before the start date. However, any ch ange in the planned activation start date must be reported immediatel y to the sponsoring institut ion's business office and to the OPDIV. If an award is conditioned up on completion of degree requirements, the fellow must submit, with the activation notice, proof of completion by the degree-granting institution. Fellowship support generally is approved for consecutive years of training. The initial award usually is for 12 months. Subsequent periods of approved fellowship training are consecutive with the first year of support and are usually in 12-month increments (budget periods). Awards for less than 12 months will be prorated accordingly. If a fellow decides not to activate the award, or to terminate early, he or she should notify the recipient organizati on's business office, the sponsor, and the OPDIV immediately, in writing. The OPDIV will make any necessary adjustments in the stipend and other costs, including the institutional allowance. Payment Payment is as follows: Domestic organizations . Non-Federal sponsoring organizations receive an award for the stipend, institutional allowance, and tuition and fees (when applicable). The organization directly pays the fellow and disburses all other awarded costs. Federal laboratories. Fellows training at Federal laboratories are paid stipends directly by the OPDIV. Reimbursem ent to the fellow for appropriate expenditures from the institutional allowance also is paid by the OPDIV. Foreign organizations. Fellows training at fore ign sites receive stipends directly from the OPDIV. However, the institutional allowance is awarded to and disbursed by the sp onsoring organization. Allowable Costs Exhibit 14 lists and describes allowable costs of fellowships. Exhibit 14. Allowable Costs of Fellowships Item Description II-106 Exhibit 14. Allowable Costs of Fellowships Item Description Stipend A stipend is provided as a subsistence allowance for fellows to help defray living expenses during the training experience. It is not provided as a condition of employment with either the Federal government or the sponsoring organization. Stipends must be paid in accordance with stipend levels established by the OPDIV, which are based on a 12-month full-time training appointment. In the event of early termination, the stipend will be prorated according to the amount of time spent in training, and the OPDIV will issue a revised NoA. No departure from the standard stipend provided by the OPDIV under the fellowship may be negotiated by the sponsoring institution with the fellow. Stipend levels are updated nearly every year. When increases are approved, they are published and posted on the OPDIV Web site. The awarding office will adjust fellowship awards on their anniversary dates to include the currently applicable stipend amount. Institutional allowance An institutional allowance is generally provided to help support the costs of training. The specific levels of allowance for support, including those for individuals training at Federal laboratories, for-profit organizations, or foreign organizations, are published by the OPDIV and posted on its Web site. Costs for tuition and fees, where appropriate, will be awarded independent of the institutional allowance. The institutional allowance is a fixed amount. Expenditures under institutional allowances are not subject to OPDIV prior-approval requirements, and the institution is not required to account for these expenditures on an actual cost basis. Except for fellows at Federal training sites, consistent with OPDIV policy governing the type of expenditures appropriate for the institutional allowance, the sponsoring organization authorizes the expenditure of the institutional allowance on behalf of the fellow according to the organization's policy. The organization is entitled to expend up to the full institutional allowance upon official activation of the award. However, if an individual fellow is not in a training status for more than 6 months of the award year, only one-half of that year's institutional allowance may be charged to the grant. The NoA will be revised and the balance must be refunded to the OPDIV. The type of sponsoring institution dictates what costs may be charged to this category and how the funds are to be administered. Non-Federal public and private non-profit organizations (domestic and foreign) The allowance is intended to defray expenses for the individual fellow such as supplies, equipment, travel to meetings, and health insurance and to otherwise offset, insofar as possible, appropriate administrative costs of training. Funds are paid directly to and administered by the sponsoring organization. Federal laboratories The allowance is intended to cover the costs of meeting travel, health insurance, and books. Funds are administered by the OPDIV. II-107 Exhibit 14. Allowable Costs of Fellowships Item Description For-profit institutions The allowance is intended to cover the costs of meeting travel, health insurance, and books. Funds are paid directly to the sponsoring organization for disbursement to the fellow. The following are guidelines for the use of the institutional allowance: \u00a1 Travel. Payment for travel to meetings is appropriate when it is necessary for the individual's training and when the costs are incurred within the period of grant-supported training. For fellows at Federal laboratories, reimbursement of travel costs must be in accordance with current Federal travel regulations. Funds may not be expended to cover the costs of travel between the fellow's place of residence and the domestic training organization, except that the sponsoring organization may authorize the cost of a one-way travel allowance in an individual case of extreme hardship. \u00a1 Extraordinary costs. Additional funds may be requested by the organization when the training of a fellow involves extraordinary costs for travel to field sites remote from the sponsoring organization or accommodations for fellows who are disabled, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act. The funds requested for extraordinary costs must be reasonable in relationship to the total dollars awarded under a fellowship and must be directly related to the approved training activity. Such additional funds will be provided only in exceptional circumstances that are fully justified and explained by the organization. \u00a1 Health insurance. A fellow's health insurance is an allowable cost only if applied consistently to all people in a similar training status regardless of the source of support. Family health insurance is an allowable cost for fellows who have families and are eligible for family health insurance coverage at the sponsoring organization. Self-only health insurance is an allowable cost for fellows without families. Health insurance can include coverage for costs such as vision and/or dental care if consistent with organizational policy. Tuition and fees Costs associated with tuition and fees are allowable only if they are required for specific courses in support of the training. The recipient should consult the OPDIV guidelines or Part IV for specific guidance on the reimbursement of tuition and fees. Travel to foreign training sites For fellows at foreign training sites, in addition to the institutional allowance, awards may include a single economy or coach round-trip travel fare. No allowance is provided for dependents. U.S. flag air carriers must be used to the maximum extent possible when commercial air transportation is the means of travel between the United States and a foreign country or between foreign countries. This requirement will not be influenced by factors of cost, convenience, or personal travel preference. Employee benefits Since fellowships are not provided as a condit ion of employment with either the Federal government or the sponsoring organization, recipients may not seek funds, or charge fellowship awards, for costs that normally would be associated with employee benefits (for example, FICA, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance). II-108 Supplementation of Stipends, Compensation, and Other Income Stipend Supplementation Fellows receive stipends to defray livin g expenses. Stipends may be supplemented by an organization from non-Federal fund s provided this supplementation does not require any additional obligation from the fellow. An organization can determine the amount of stipend supplementation, if any, it will provide according to its own formally established policies governing stipend support. Thes e policies must be consistently applied to all individuals in a similar status regardless of the source of funds. Federal funds may not be used for stipend supplementation unless specifically authorized under the terms of the program from which funds are derived. Under no circumstances may OPDIV funds be used fo r supplementation. An individual may use Federal educational loan funds or VA benefi ts when permitted by those programs as described in this section. Compensation Fellows may seek part-time employment incide ntal to their training program to offset further their expenses. Funds characterized as compensation may be paid to fellows only when there is an empl oyer-employee relationship, th e payments are for services rendered, and the situation otherwise meet s the conditions for compensation of students as detailed in \"Selected Items of Cost.\" In addition, co mpensation must be in accordance with organizational policies applied consistently to both federally and non-federally supported activities and must be support ed by acceptable accounting records that reflect the employer-employ ee relationship agr eement. Under these conditions, the funds provided as compensation (salary, fringe benefits, and/or tuition remission) for services rendered, such as teaching or la boratory assistance, are not considered stipend supplementation ; they are allowable charges to Federal grants, including HHS grants. However, th e OPDIV expects that compensation from HHS grants will be for limited part-time em ployment apart from the normal training activities. Compensation may not be paid from a grant that supports the same activity that is part of the fellow's planned training experience as approved in the fellowship application. Under no circumstances may the conditions of stipend supplementation or the services provided for compensation interfere with, detract from, or prolong the fellow's approved trai ning program. Fellowship sponsors must approve all instances of employment on HHS grants to verify that the circumstances will not detract from or prolong the approved training program. Concurrent Benefits A fellowship under the Kirschstein-National Research Service Awards may not be held concurrently with another federall y sponsored fellowship or similar Federal award that provides a stipend or otherwise duplicates provisions of the fellowship award. Educational Loans or GI Bill An individual may accept co ncurrent educational remuneration from the VA (GI Bill) and Federal educational loan funds. Such funds are not considered supplementation or compensation. Taxability of Stipends II-109 Section 117 of the Internal Revenue Co de applies to the tax treatment of scholarships and fellowships. Degree candidat es may exclude from gross income (for tax purposes) any amount used for course tu ition and related expenses such as fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for courses of instruction at a qualified educational organization. Non-degree candid ates are required to report as gross income any monies paid on their behalf for stipends or any course tuition and fees required for attendance. The taxability of stipends in no way alters the relationship between fellows and sponsoring organizations. Stipends are not considered salaries. In addition, recipients of fellowships are not considered to be in an employee- employer relationship with the OPDIV or the sponsoring organization solely as a result of the fellowship award. The interpretation and implementation of the tax laws are the domain of the IRS and the courts. HHS takes no position on what the status may be for a particular taxpayer, and it do es not have the authority to dispense tax advice. Individuals shou ld consult their local IRS office about the applicability of the law to their situation and for information on their tax obligations. Form 1099 Although stipends are not considered salaries , this income is still subject to Federal and, sometimes, State income tax. Such in come may be reported by the sponsoring organization on IRS Form 1099, Statement of Miscellaneous Income. Normally, the business office of the sponso ring organization will be responsible for annually preparing and issuing IRS Form 1099 for fellows paid through the organization (fellows at domestic non-Federal organiza tions). Sponsoring or ganizations are not required to issue a Form 1099, but it is a useful form of documentation of income received and a reminder to the fellow that some tax liability may exist. Fellows are reminded that, even if the sponsoring organization does not issue a Form 1099, they still are required to report stipends as income. The OPDIV will issue a Form 1099 for each fellow training at a Federal or foreign laboratory and receiving a stipend check from the U.S. Treasury. Reporting Requirements The submission of the forms de scribed in this section is critical to establishing and paying stipends and other costs and determining payback service, if applicable. All of these forms generally are available in PDF- fillable and RTF formats at the OPDIV Web site or http://grants.nih.gov/grants/forms.htm . The awarding office may provide copies of applicable forms with\u2014or re ference the Web site in\u2014the NoA. Activation Notice Immediately upon the initiation of training , the individual must complete and sign a fellowship activation no tice (e.g., PHS 416-5), obtain th e signature of the authorized organizational representative, and forw ard the notice along with a payback agreement (where required) to the awarding office. For fellows pa id directly by the OPDIV, the activation notice is required at the start of each award year. The form should not be submitted befo re the fellow actually begins training. Stipend checks are issued when both the activation no tice and the payback agreement (where required) are received by the awarding office. For fellows whose stipend is paid through the organization, the activation noti ce is required for the initial year only. The activation notice may be submitted up to 30 days before th e individual begins training if necessary for payroll purpos es. However, the organization must not release any funds until the individual ha s started training. Furthermore, if the II-110 individual does not begin training on the day indicated, the organization must notify the awarding office immediately. Competin g continuation awards must be activated on the day following the en d of the last budget period of the previous award. Payback Agreement A payback agreement (e.g., PHS 6031), wher e required, must be signed by each person who is to receive a fellowship. Recipients should consult the OPDIV program guidelines or Part IV for guidance regard ing the submission of a payback agreement. Termination Notice The termination notice (e.g., PHS 416-7) (a long with the activation notice and the award notice) is the basis for validating th e total period of fellowship support and establishing the amount of payback obligatio n, if any. A reminder of this reporting requirement may be sent to the fellow by the awarding office before the scheduled termination date. For early terminations, the completed form will be required immediately upon receipt of notificati on from the fellow or an authorized organizational representative. The lack of timely and accurate information on this form could adversely affect the payback process. Progress Reports Progress reports must be submitted fo r non-competing continuation support. Progress report forms and instructions ge nerally are available from the OPDIV Web site or at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/forms.htm . Report form pages are available in PDF-fillable and RTF formats. Inadequate or incomplete progress reports may be returned to the fellow for revision and may result in a delay of continued support. A final progress report is required as part of the termination notice. Financial Status Report An annual or final FSR is not required on fellowship awards. Changes in the Project/Activity Fellowship awards are made for training at a specific orga nization under the guidance of a particular sponsor. OPDIV approval is required for a transfer of the award to another organization, a change in sponsor, or a project/activity change. As part of the approval process, if a fellow sponsored by a domestic non- Federal organization requests a transfer to another domestic no n-Federal organization before the end of the current award year, the initial organization may be requested to continue to pay the stipend until the end of the current year. Disposition of the institutional allowance is negotiable between the two sponsoring organizations. No activation notice is required from the new sponsoring organization. Transfers involving Federal or foreign sponsoring organizations require unique administrative procedures an d approvals. Because each tr ansfer varies depending on individual circumstances, th e sponsoring organization should contact the awarding office for specific guidance. II-111 Any proposed change in the individual's specified area of training must be reviewed and approved in writing by the OPDIV to ensure that the training continues to fall within the area of the original reviewed a pplication. When the sponsor is going to be absent for more than 3 months, an in terim sponsor must be named by the organization and approved in writing by the OPDIV. Consecutive Support If a fellow switches from one grant mechanism to another (e.g., from an institutional research training grant to a fellowship or from one OPDIV or OPDIV component to another), the requirement for payback serv ice incurred is deferred until the total period of support is completed. All fellowship applications are reviewed to determine if previous fellowship support has been provided. Termination An OPDIV may terminate a fellowship before its normal expiration date if it determines that the recipient has material ly failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the award or to carry out the purpose for which it was made. If an award is terminated for cause, the OPDIV will notify the fellow in writing of the determination, the reasons for the determination, the effective date, and the right to appeal the decision. The OPDIV also may terminate an awar d at the request of the sponsoring organization or the recipient. The awarding office must be notified immediately if a sponsoring organization wants to terminate an individual fellow or the fellow decides to terminate training before the schedu led expiration date. If a fellowship is terminated early, the stipend must be prorated according to the amount of time spent in training, and the award notice will be revised. The balance of any institutional allowance (at least one-half) must be refunded if the training has been for 6 months or less. Copyright Except as otherwise provided in the condit ions of the award, when a publication or similar copyrightable material is developed from work supported by HHS, the author is free to arrange for copyright without a pproval of the OPDIV. Such copyrighted materials are subject to a royalty-free, no nexclusive, and irrevocable license to the Federal government to reproduce them, tr anslate them, publis h them, and use and dispose of them, and to authorize others to do so for Federal government purposes. Inventions and Patents Fellowships funded primarily for educationa l purposes are not subject to invention reporting requirements nor does the OPDI V have any rights to inventions under those awards (as specified in 37 CFR 401. 1(b)). Kirschstein- National Research Service Award fellows training at HHS represent an exception to this policy. Those fellows are subject to the provisions of EO 10096 and the OPDIV determines the disposition of rights to any invention concei ved or actually reduced to practice during the period of the fellowship. II-112 Disposition of Professional Fees Fees resulting from clinical practice, professional consul tation, or other comparable activities performed pursuant to the purpos e of the award must be assigned to the sponsoring organization for di sposition in accordance with established organizational policy. The term \"professional fees\" does not apply to honoraria, fees for scholarly writing, delivery of occasional outside lectur es, or service in an advisory capacity to public or private non-profit organizations, which, if permitte d by organizational policy, may be retained by the fellow. Requirements for Specific Types of Recipients Grants to Foreign Organizations, International Organizations, and Domestic Grants wi th Foreign Components and Subawards to Foreign Organizations Most of the policies contained in this HHS GPS apply to grants made to foreign organizations and international organizations (hereafter \"foreign grants\"), including the requirements of 45 CFR part 74 or 45 CFR part 92, as applicable to the type of foreign organization, and the cost principles incorporat ed by reference in those regulations. If an applicant/recipient would be unable to comply with these requirements, the authorized organizational representative should contact the GMO. Specific exceptions and modifications of the HHS GPS requirements for foreign grants, and highlights of other policies, are set forth in this section. This section also includes policies that apply to domest ic grants with a foreign component. Public Policy Requirements All public policy requirements included in \"Public Policy Requirements\" in Part I apply to foreign grants, with the following exceptions: Civil rights. None of the civil rights requirements specified in \"Public Policy Requirements\" apply to foreign grants. Debarment and suspension. Applicants and recipients that are foreign governments or governmental entities, public international organizations, or foreign-government-owned or -controlled (in whole or in part) entities are not subject to the debarment or suspensi on certification requirement or to debarment or suspension under 45 CFR part 76. All other foreign organizations and international organizations are subject to these requirements. Drug-free workplace. Foreign applicants and recipients may be exempted from the drug-free workplace requirem ents of 45 CFR part 83 based on a documented finding by the OPDIV that application of those requirements is inconsistent with U.S. international obligations or the laws and regulations of a foreign government. Environmental requirements. Receipt of a grant does not make a foreign applicant/recipient subject to environmental requirements that would not otherwise apply to it. II-113 Funding and Payment The application budget, requests for funds, and financial reports must be stated in U.S. dollars using the currency rate in effect at the time of submission. Once an award is made, the OPDIV may adjust for cu rrency exchange fluctuations as part of the non-competing continuation award process. This may result in an upward or downward adjustment from the total approv ed budget for that budget period based on the net change from the prior year's award. Awards to foreign organizations and internat ional organizations ge nerally are paid by the OPDIV's servicing finance office rather than through PMS unless the recipient is serviced by a U.S. owned- or -based bank. A ll payments will be in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange current at the time of payment. Foreign recipients are strongly encouraged to use U.S. banks to ensu re that payments arrive on time. Payments are made by U.S. Treasury check. If paid by the OPDIV, grants normally will be paid on a predeter mined quarterly advance basis, usually in four equal installments, unless the total amount of the award is $25,000 or less. If the amount advanced to an organization based on the predetermined quarterly advance is insufficient to meet the grant's cash requir ements, the recipient must make a written request to the GMO for any a dditional funds needed. If payments are made by PMS, they are made on the same basis as for domestic grants (see \"HHS Grants Process\u2014 Payment\"). Allowable Costs The costs that are generally allowable under grants to do mestic organizations also are allowable under foreign grants, with the following exceptions: A&R. Major A&R costs are unallowable under foreign grants and domestic grants with foreign components. Mino r A&R costs are allowable (see \"Cost Considerations\u2014Allowable Costs and Activities\" and \"Prior-Approval Requirements\"). Audit costs. Costs of financial-related audits are allowable (see \"Audit\" in this section). Customs and import duties. These costs, which includ e consular fees, customs surtax, value-added taxes, and other related charges, are unallowable under foreign grants and domestic grants with foreign components. Indirect costs. With the exception of the Americ an University of Beirut, which is not considered a foreign organizati on, and the World He alth Organization, indirect costs will not be reimbursed. Research patient care costs. Research patient care co sts are allowable only in exceptional circumstances as determined by the OPDIV. Prior-Approval Requirements Foreign grants generally are included in expanded authorities. II-114 A change in the performance site within a foreign country or performance in a country other than that specified in the approved application requires OPDIV prior approval. The transfer of work by a domest ic recipient to a foreign component also requires OPDIV prior approval. A change of grantee organization that involv es the transfer of a grant to or between foreign organizations or international orga nizations requires OP DIV approval and, where applicable, the associat ed National Advisory Council or Board. OPDIV approval also is required for the transfer of a gran t from a foreign organization to a domestic organization. Audit Foreign recipients are subject to the sa me audit requirements as for-profit organizations (s pecified in 45 CFR 74.26(d)). Subawards Subawards to foreign entities that are cons idered financial assistance arrangements (rather than acquisition of goods or servic es) require special oversight by recipients. The recipient must do the following: Ensure that appropriate OPDIV approval is obtained for a foreign subaward; i.e., that the OPDIV approves of the intent to subawa rd (subgrant) as defined in 45 CFR (see \"P rior Approval Requirements\u2014OPDIV Prior Approval\"). The recipient does not have to obtain GMO approval of the selected subrecipient or the ag reement between the recipient and subrecipient. Determine whether the subaward recipi ent is subject to OMB Circular A-133 audit requirements (generally the case only if the subaward recipient has direct awards from HHS because HHS has adopted A-133 as the standard audit requirement for foreign recipients). Determine appropriate means of oversight, including re view of reports, or on- site reviews, or alternat ives to an A-133 audit if one will not be available during the period of the subaward, as part of seeking OPDIV approval, and indicate how it will monitor foreign subawards. Provide adequate evidence during its own A-133 audit and in reports to the OPDIV that it is meeting its subrecipient monitoring responsibilities. Grants to Federal Institutio ns and Allowable Costs and Payments to (or on Behalf of) Federal Employees under Grants Most of the policies contained in this HHS GPS apply to grants made to Federal institutions. If an applicant/recipient would be unable to comply with these requirements, the authorized Federal offi cial should contact the GMO. Specific exceptions and modifications of the HHS GPS requirements for Federal recipients, and highlights of other policies, are set forth in this section. II-115 Eligibility Federal institutions are eligible to receive certain types of grants from PHS OPDIVs. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, grants for research, training, and demonstration projects. Federal institutions must meet the eligibility requirements of the grant program from which support is sought. However, in no case may an awarding office issue a grant award to any component of its own OPDIV. Although the performance site may be at a level lower than the agency or department, when an award is made to an eligible Federal institution, the Federal agency or department will be the de signated recipient and must assume responsibility for the project. Federal institutions must also ensure that their own authorizing legislation will allow them to receive a PHS grant and be able to comply with the award terms and conditions. A document certifying both the assumption of responsibility and authority to receive a grant must be submitted at the time of each new and competing continuation application. The certification must be signed by the head of the responsible Federal department or independent agency or a designee who reports directly to the department or agency head. (In the case of the Department of Defense, the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Ai r Force are considered the Federal department and their Secretaries as the responsible Department head.) The certification requirement does not apply to VA hospitals, Bureau of Prisons (Department of Justice) hospitals, IHS hospitals, or other PHS OPDIVs applying for grants. Generally an award to a PHS OPDIV other than to an IHS hospital will be considered only if a project cannot be supported within the mission of the applicant OPDIV or organizational segment, the acti vity cannot be performed elsewhere, its non-pursuit would have an adverse or potentially important impact on the OPDIV mission, and a grant is determ ined to be the appropriat e means of carrying out the activity. Payment Grants to DoD normally will be paid by U.S. Treasury check after submission of the appropriate interagency fo rm. Payments to all other Federal departments and agencies generally will be accomplish ed by transfers of funds between appropriations. Allowable Costs under Grants to Federal Institutions Allowable costs under grants to Federal institutions will be determined by the established policies of the institution, consistently applied to both its own activities and to grant-supported activi ties, and by the requirements shown in Exhibit 15. In the absence of a governing organizational policy, the cost pr inciples for State, local, and Indian tribal governments ( OMB Circular A-87 ) will apply. II-116 Exhibit 15. Allowable Costs under Grants to Federal Institutions These costs are allowable only as specified If Indirect costs Indirect costs will not be provided to Federal institutions. Institutional allowances under fellowships Institutional allowances may be requested by Federal institutions sponsoring a predoctoral or postdoctoral fellow. Federal (U.S. Government) employees No salary or fringe benefit payments may be made from HHS grant funds to support career, career-conditional, or other Federal employees (civilian or uniformed services) with permanent appointments provided for under existing position ceilings of a Federal institution receiving a grant. While the level of effort required for the project must be allowed by the recipient as part of the individuals' official duties, salary costs associated with an individual participating in an official capacity as a Federal employee under a grant to that Federal institution are not allowable costs under an HHS grant. See \"Payments to (or on behalf of) Federal Employees under Grants\" for the conditions under which salary and fringe benefits may be paid for Federal employees working on a grant-supported project when the recipient is a non- Federal organization or a Federal institution other than the one that employs the individual. Project-related travel costs of such employees are allowable as long as they consistent with the FTR. See Exhibit 16 in this section. Payments to temporary employees Payments to individuals specifically hired to assist in the performance of the grant are allowable. Equipment Accountability HHS will consider all nonexpendable pers onal property acquired under a grant awarded to a Federal institution as federa lly owned, subject to 45 CFR 92.32. Upon completion of the award, or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient must request disposition inst ructions from the OPDIV. Procurement Requirements Procurement under grants to Federal institutions is governed by the FAR and the recipient agency's FAR supplement. Intellectual Property Inventions resulting from grants supporting the activities of Federal employees under grants to Federal institutions must be reported simultaneously to the OPDIV and to the employing agency under the terms of EO 10096, as amended, and are subject to the licensing requirements of 37 CFR part 401. (See https://s- edison.info.nih.gov/iEdison/ for reporting requirements.) In cases where the VA is involved with the invention but is not the recipient, and the recipient chooses not to elect title or pursue practical application of an invention, the recipient must note VA's involvement on its notice to the OPDIV an d provide a courtesy copy of the OPDIV notification to the appropriate VA office. The OPDIV will notify the recipient and the VA whether the OPDIV has an interest in taking title and/or continuing the pursuit of practical application of the invention. II-117 Reporting Requirements Federal institutions must submit annual FSRs and progress reports. Allowable Costs and Payments to (or on Behalf of) Federal Employees under Grants Exhibit 16 lists and describe s allowable costs and payments to Federal employees under grants. Exhibit 16. Allowable Costs and Payments to (or on Behalf of) Federal Employees under Grants Item Description General Only four types of costs\u2014consultant fees, outpatient or subject costs, salary or fringe benefits (when the employee is not an employee of a recipient Federal institution or is a part-time VA employee as described in this exhibit), and travel costs\u2014can be charged to OPDIV grants on behalf of Federal employees, whether by a recipient or subrecipient, and under the conditions specified only. Applicants/recipients should advise any Federal employees with whom these types of arrangements may be made to consult with their employing agency concerning their ability to meet the required conditions. The applicant/recipient must submit, as part of the grant application or subsequent request, any letters or documentation specified below, and that documentation must be deemed acceptable by the GMO before the Federal employee may be involved in a project. These limitations do not apply to individuals that are classified as special government employees because of service on advisory groups or as a result of a formal consulting arrangement with a Federal agency. (See the HHS Standards of Conduct at 45 CFR part 73, Subpart J for additional guidance.) Consultant fees These costs are allowable only for medical personnel of the Uniformed Services of the United States (excluding PHS Commissioned Officers) and when all of the following conditions are present: \u00a1 The employees are providing the kind and extent of medical services approved in the grant award. \u00a1 Adequate numbers of qualified civilian personnel are not available to provide these services, and eligible Federal medical personnel are hired only in addition to those qualified civilian medical personnel, if any, who are available. The applicant/recipient organization provides prior written authorization from the proposed consultant's commanding officer that he or she is authorized to work on the grant-supported activity during non-duty hours or while on authorized leave, and can be paid for his or her efforts. Outpatient or subject costs These costs are allowable when the employee is an outpatient or subject under study in connection with grant-supported activities. II-118 Exhibit 16. Allowable Costs and Payments to (or on Behalf of) Federal Employees under Grants Item Description Salary or fringe benefits Salary payments may be made from OPDIV grant funds to career, career-conditional, or other Federal employees (civilian or uniformed services) with permanent appointments provided under existing position ceilings of a Federal institution only if prior approval is obtained from an authorized official of the employee's agency and the employee is one of the following: \u00a1 A PHS Commissioned Officer or a civil service employee carrying out duties for which specific statutory authorization exists permitting direct Federal assistance in lieu of cash under the grant, or where the government is reimbursed for services rendered subject to restrictions applicable to such personnel, including the applicable Federal standards of conduct (for HHS, 45 CFR part 73). \u00a1 A PHS Commissioned Officer on LWOP if the \u0083 recipient has obtained written prior approval from the OPDIV; \u0083 total amount of salary paid from OPDIV grant funds is proportional to the time devoted to the project and does not exceed the total annual amount of pay and allowances the individual would have received if not in LWOP status; and \u0083 parties concerned have made a prior determination that there is no possibility of dual compensation and there is no actual or apparent conflict of interest or other violation of the applicable standards of conduct. \u00a1 A civil service employee participating in a grant to a non-Federal organization and all of the following conditions are met: \u0083 The individual is participating as part of an approved IPA assignment in a role other than as PI/PD. IPA assignments generally do not exceed 2 years and may not exceed 4 years of continuous duration (5 U.S.C. 3372). Based on this statutory time restriction, the involvement of the civil service employee should be limited in scope. Therefore, the proposed PI/PD for an HHS grant may not be participating through an IPA. On a case-by-case basis, the OPDIV may determine that certain other key personnel on the project are sufficiently critical to its long-term success that participation through an IPA is not appropriate. \u0083 Before making any payment from HHS grant funds to such an employee, the recipient must certify that the employee is on an IPA assignment and must provide adequate documentation, as determined by OPDIV, of the IPA assignment and information about its nature and duration. \u0083 The level of effort required for the project must be allowed by the employing agency as part of the individual's official duties. Salary payments from OPDIV grant funds must be proportional to the time an individual devotes to the grant-supported project. The total salary support may not exceed the normal level of compensation from Federal salary if the individual were not participating in the grant. \u0083 The parties concerned have made a prior determination that there is no possibility of dual compensation and there is no actual or apparent conflict of interest or other violation of the applicable standards of conduct. II-119 Exhibit 16. Allowable Costs and Payments to (or on Behalf of) Federal Employees under Grants Item Description Salaries under research grants to VANPCs In accordance with the established policies and salary structure of the VANPC, if the PI is a part-time VA employee, grant funds may be used to pay the differential between the individual's VA part-time salary and the salary level for a full-time VANPC commitment in proportion to the level of effort devoted to the project. Therefore, if the PI has a part-time appointment with the VANPC, an appropriate portion of the individual's salary that would otherwise be supported by the non-profit VANPC may be charged to the grant. An HHS grant may not be the source of funding for an increase in an investigator's salary regardless of the type of entity with which the investigator holds an appointment (e.g., university, VA, or VANPC). Travel costs These costs are allowable if the employee is \u00a1 performing allowable reimbursable services as specified under \"Salary or Fringe Benefits\" above, or \u00a1 attending an OPDIV grant-supported conference non-duty hours, \u0083 while in a preexisting LWOP status or one that continues beyond the conference, or \u0083 while on detail to a State or local government, educational institution, or other non-profit organization. Such payments must be made in accordance with established organizational policy, consistently applied regardless of the source of funds, and the parties concerned must take reasonable steps to ensure that there is no actual or apparent conflict of interest. Grants to For-Profit Organizations General For-profit organizations gene rally are subject to the same requirements specified in the HHS GPS for non-profit organizations, including those relating to personal property title and management. However, some of the terms and conditions for grants to for-profit (commercial) organi zations vary from the standard terms and conditions included in the HHS GPS. In addition, the terms and conditions of the SBIR and STTR programs vary from those otherwise applicable to for-profit organizations. This section addresses separately the policies applicable to for-profit organizations generally and those that apply to SBIR and STTR awards specifically. It also highlights several policies that apply equally to for-profit and non-profit recipients. If an exception is not stated below or in the NoA, the public policy requirements cited in the \"Public Policy Requirements\" section of this HHS GPS, including the requirements fo r the protection of human su bjects and animal welfare, apply. Allowable Costs and Payment of Fee No cost principles are specifically applicable to grants to for-profit organizations. Therefore, the cost principles for comme rcial organizations set forth in the FAR (48 CFR Subpart 31.2) generally are used to determine allowable costs under HHS grants to for-profit organizations. As pr ovided in those costs principles, allowable travel costs may not exceed those es tablished by the FTR (available at http://www.gsa.gov ). In addition, as provided in 45 CFR 74.27(a), HHS does not II-120 allow for-profit organizations to be reimbursed for IR&D (self-sponsored) costs. The cost principles in 45 CFR part 74, Appendix E, are used to determine allowable costs under HHS grants to proprietary hospitals. Except for grants awarded under the SBIR/STTR programs, no profit or fee will be provided to a for-profit organization, whethe r as a recipient or subrecipient. A profit or fee under a grant is not a cost, but is an amount in excess of actual allowable direct and indirect costs. In accordance with normal commercial pr actice, a profit/fee may be paid to a contractor under an HHS grant providing routine goods or services to the recipient. Intellectual Property Intellectual property requirements set fort h in 37 CFR part 401 apply to for-profit organizations, whether sma ll businesses or large busine sses. However, invention reporting requirements for for-profit orga nizations differ somewhat from those for non-profit organizations. When the recipien t is a for-profit orga nization, assignment of invention rights to a third party does not require OPDIV approval. To the extent authorized by 35 U.S.C. 205 (the Patent Ac t, as amended), the Federal government will not make public any information di sclosing a Federal government-supported invention. Audit The requirements for non-Fede ral audits of for-profit or ganizations are specified in 45 CFR 74.26(d). A for-profit organization is required to have a non-Federal audit if, during its fiscal year, it expended a tota l of $500,000 or more under one or more HHS awards (as a direct recipient and/or as a subrecipient). Title 45, part 74.26(d), of the CFR incorporates th e thresholds and deadlines of OMB Circular A-133 but provides for-profit organizations two options regarding the type of audit that will satisfy the audit requirements: A financial-related audit, as defined in, and in accordance with, the Government Auditing Standards, of all its HHS awards. The standards, commonly known as the \"Yellow Book\" (GPO stock 020-000-00-265-4), are available at http://www.gao.gov/govaud/ybk01.htm. The Government Auditing Standards audits must be completed and submitted within 30 days after receipt of the auditor's report or 9 months after the end of the audit pe riod (i.e., the end of the organization's fiscal year), whichever is earlier. An audit that meets the requirements of OMB Circular A-133. OMB Circular A- 133 is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/o mb/circulars/a133/a133.html . II-121 Within 30 days after receipt of the auditor' s report(s), or 9 months after the end of the audit period, i.e., the end of the organization's fiscal year, whichever is earlier, the audit must be submitted to the following office: National External Audit Review Center HHS Office of Audit Services 323 West 8th Street Lucas Place Room 514 Kansas City, MO 64105. For-profit organizations expending less than $500,000 a year are not required to have an annual audit for that year but must make their grant-related records available to the OPDIV or other designated officials for review or audit. Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Programs Certain OPDIVs are required by statute to reserve a portion of its annual extramural budget for projects under the SBIR and S TTR programs. These programs primarily are intended to encourage private-sector commercialization of technology and to increase small business participation in federally funded R&D. Both the SBIR and STTR programs consist of the following three phases; however, individual projects may not be eligible for all three phases: Phase I. The objective of this phase is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of proposed research or R&D efforts and to determine the quality of performance of the applicant (small business concern or SBC) before providing further Federa l support in Phase II. Phase II. The objective of this phase is to continue the research or R&D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding will be based on the results of Phase I and the scientific and te chnical merit and commercial potential of the Phase II application. Only Phase I recipients are eligible to receive Phase II funding. Unless submitted as a Fast-Track application ( see below ), Phase II applications may be submitted only af ter the Phase I award is made. OPDIVs expect non Fast-Track Phase II applications to be submitted within the first six receipt dates following expiration of the Phase I budget period, i.e., normally 2 years beyond the expiration date of the Phase I award. Phase III. The objective of this phase, where appropriat e, is for the SBC to pursue, with non-Federal funds, the commercialization of the results of the research or R&D funded in Phases I and II. There are two major differences betw een the SBIR and STTR programs: The STTR program requires that the SB C formally partner with a single, non- profit research institution in the collaborative conduct of a project that has potential for commercialization. To be eligible for an STTR award, at least 40 percent of the research must be performed by the SBC and at least 30 percent of the research must be performed by a domestic non-profit research institution through a formal, cooperative arrangement. Such organizations II-122 include universities, non-profit hospitals, and other non-profit research organizations as well as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers. (The same requirement applie s to Phase I and to Phase II.) STTR grants are awarded to the SBC, which will receive all of the funding for the project and disperse the appropriate fund ing to the research institution. The SBIR program does not have this re quirement; therefore, the SBC may conduct the entire SBIR project without outside collaboration. The SBIR program requires that the pr imary employment of the PI (greater than 50 percent of the indivi dual's time) be with the SBC at the time of award and during the conduct of the project. The STTR program does not have this requirement, i.e., the PI may have hi s or her primary employment with an organization other than the SBC, in cluding the collaborating research institution. However, there must be an official relationship between the PI and the SBC. As an eligibility criterion, the PI also is required to devote at least 10 percent of his or her time to the STTR project. The Fast-Track application process expedi tes award decisions and funding of SBIR and STTR Phase II applications for scientifica lly meritorious projects that have a high potential for commercialization. The Fast-Track process allows Phase I and Phase II grant applications to be submitted and reviewed together. Typically, Fast-Track applications will receive a single rating. An OPDIV determines whether to allow SBCs to use the Fast-Track review option. Theref ore, before submitting applications for Fast-Track review, applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with OPDIV program staff. SBIR/STTR Phase I and Phas e II applications submitted concurrently without prior consultation with the OPDIV may be redirected for review under the OPDIV's normal review procedures. For additi onal information on the submission of Fast-Track applications, see the OPDIV's SBIR/STTR program solicitations. Qualification as a Small Business Concern Each organization receiving a grant under the SBIR/STTR programs must qualify as a U.S.-owned SBC\u2014an entity that, at the time of the Phase I and Phase II awards, meets all of the following criteria: The entity is organized for profit and has a place of business located in the United States, operates primarily wi thin the United States, or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor. It is in the legal form of an individual proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, join t venture, association, trust, or cooperative. If the entity is a joint venture, there can be no more than 49 percent participation by foreign business entities. As provided by the express terms of 13 CFR 121.702(a), it is at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens in, the Un ited States. In the case of a joint venture, each party to the venture must be 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citi zens of, or permanent resident aliens in, the United States. Unde r these regulations, corp orations or artificial entities cannot quality as individuals wh o are U.S. citizens. Further, indirect II-123 ownership of the entity by a U.S. citizen does not satisfy the requirements of 13 CFR 121.702(a). h Example 1. An entity applying for an SBIR/STTR grant is 100 percent owned by Company A. Company A is 100 percent owned by U.S. citizens. The entity is not eligible for su pport under the SBIR/STTR program because it is not 51 percent directly owned and controlled by citizens of, or permanent resident alie ns in, the United States. h Example 2. An entity applying for an SBIR/STTR grant is 51 percent owned by U.S. citizens of and permanent resident aliens in the United States and 49 percent owned by a corporation. The entity is eligible for support under the SBIR/STTR progra m, assuming it meets the other eligibility criteria (e.g., size), beca use 51 percent of the ownership rests directly with U.S. citize ns and permanent resident aliens of the United States. The entity, including its affiliates, ca nnot have more than 500 employees. In accordance with 13 CFR 121.103, affiliation exists wh en, either directly or indirectly, (1) one concern controls or ha s the power to control the other, or (2) a third party or parties controls or has the power to control both. One of the circumstances that wo uld lead to a finding that an organization is controlling or has the power to control another organization involves sharing common office space, employees, and/or other facilities (e.g., laboratory space). The research and analytical work performed by the recipient under an SBIR/STTR award is to be conducted in research space occupied by, available to, and under the control of, the recipi ent. However, when required by the project activity, access to special facilities or equi pment in another organization is perm itted, as in cases where th e SBIR recipient has entered into a consortium arrangement with another organization for a specific, limited portion of the research projec t. See 13 CFR 121.3-2(a) and 13 CFR 121.3-2(t) for additional information concerning this criterion. All appropriate factors will be considered in determining whether an entity qualifies for an SBIR/STTR award, including co mmon ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. Place of Performance For both Phase I and Phase II SBIR/STTR awards, the research or R&D project activity must be performed in its entirety in the United States. (The United States is defined as the 50 States, the territories and possessions of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the District of Columbia.) In those rare instances where the study design requires use of a foreign site (e.g., to conduct testing of specific patient populations), the investigator must thoroughly justify in the application the need for use of a foreign site. Similarly, in those rare instances where it may be necessary to purchase materials fr om other countries, investigators must thoroughly justify the request. The OPDIV will consider these instances on a case-by-case basis, and th ey should be discu ssed with cognizant OPDIV staff before submitting an applicat ion. Whether the request is approved or disapproved, it will be explicitly addressed in the NoA if an award is made. Whenever II-124 possible, work outside the United States, wh ich is necessary to the completion of the project, should be supported by fu nding other than SBIR/STTR grants. Minimum Level of Effort Generally, under SBIR Phase I awards, a minimum of two-thirds or 67 percent of the research or analytical effort must be carried out by the SBC. In addition, payments, in the aggregate, to consultants, consortium participants and contractors for portions of the scientific/technical effort generally may not exceed 33 percent of the total requested amount. Generally, under SBIR Phase II awards, a mi nimum of one-half or 50 percent of the research or analytical effort must be carried out by the SBC. In addition, payments, in the aggregate, to consultants, consortium participants, and contractors for portions of the scientific/tech nical effort generally may no t exceed 50 percent of the total requested amount. For STTR awards (both Phase I and Phase II), at least 40 percent of the work is to be performed by the SBC and at least 30 percent of the work is to be performed by the single, non-profit research institution. The basis for determining the percentage of work to be performed by each of the coop erating parties is the total of direct and F&A costs attributable to each party, unle ss otherwise described and justified in the \"Contractual Arrangements\" portion of the \"Research Plan\" section of the grant application. Public Policy Requirements The requirements concerning disclosure of financial conflicts of interest (see \" Public Policy Requirements\u2014Other Research-Relat ed Requirements\u2014Financial Conflict of Interest \") do not apply to applications or awards under Phase I of the SBIR/STTR programs. Allowable Costs and Fee Profit or Fee. A reasonable profit or fee may be paid to an SBC receiving an award under Phase I or Phase II of the SBIR and STTR programs. The profit or fee is not considered a \"cost\" for purposes of determining allowable use, program income accountability, or audit thresholds. The profit or fee may be used by the SBC for any purpose, including additional effort under the SBIR/STTR award. It is intended to provide a reasonable profit consistent with normal profit margins for for-profit organizations for R&D work. Fee amounts ma y not exceed 8 percent of total costs (direct plus indirect) exclusive of fee, unless there is compelling justification and the request is approved by the OPDIV. Re gardless, total costs and fee must be accommodated within the statutory limitations on the size of awards under the SBIR/STTR programs (see Part IV for allowa ble fee percentage). The profit or fee should be drawn from PMS in increments proportional to the drawdown of funds for direct and indirect costs. The profit or fee applies solely to the SBC receiving the SBIR/STTR award and not to any other part icipant; however, in accordance with normal commercial practice, the SBC may pay a profit or fee to a contractor providing routine goods or services to the SBC under the grant. For multi-year awards, i.e., those where the approved pro ject period will exceed 1 year, the overall fee negotiated will be divided into the number of years in the II-125 project period and the resulting amount a dded to each budget period as a \"fixed fee.\" The fee paid is not subject to the cost principle tests of allowability and it will not be adjusted downward based on actual allowable costs incurred. However, in the event of a termination or the withholding a non-competing continuation award for failure to make satisfactory progress, non- compliance with the terms and conditions of a previous award or absence of an approp riation, the recipient is not entitled to any fee amount in excess of the negotiated percentage applied to the period for which grant support has been provided. Indirect Costs. Phase I. If the applicant SBC has a currently effective indirect cost rate with a Federal agency, that rate should be us ed when calculating proposed indirect costs for an application. (However, th e rate must be adjusted for IR&D expenses, which are not allowable unde r HHS awards.) If the applicant SBC does not have a currently effective negoti ated indirect cost rate with a Federal agency, the applicant should propose estimated indire ct costs at a rate not to exceed 40 percent of the total direct co sts. However, SBCs are reminded that only actual indirect costs are to be charged to projects. (If awarded at a rate of 40 percent or less, the rate used to ch arge actual indirect costs to projects cannot exceed the awarded rate unless th e SBC negotiates an indirect cost rate with a Federal agency.) OPDIVs will not negotiate indirect cost rates for Phase I awards. Phase II. If the applicant SBC has a currently effective negotiated indirect cost rate with a Federal agency, that rate should be used when calculating proposed indirect costs for an applic ation. (However, the rate must be adjusted for IR&D expenses, which are not allowable under HHS awards.) If the applicant SBC does not have a current ly effective negotiated indirect cost rate with a Federal agency, the applicant should propose an estimated indirect cost rate in the application. If the requested indirect cost rate is 25 percent of total direct costs or less, no further justification is required at the time of award, and indirect costs wi ll be awarded at the requested rate. However, SBCs are reminded that only actual indirect costs may be charged to projects. If awarded at a rate of 25 percent or less of total direct costs, the rate used to charge actu al indirect costs to projects cannot exceed the awarded rate unless the SB C negotiates an indirect cost rate with DFAS. DFAS\u2014the office authorized to negoti ate indirect cost rates with SBCs receiving HHS SBIR/STTR awards\u2014will negotiate indirect cost rates for SBCs receiving Phase II awards that requested a rate greater than 25 percent of total direct costs. Upon request, the applicant SBC should provide DFAS with an indirect cost proposal and supporting financial data for its most recently completed fiscal year. If financial data are not available for the most recently completed fiscal year, the applicant should submit a pr oposal showing estimated rates with supporting documentation. Further information about DFAS is available at its Web site or by telephone (see Part III of the HHS GPS). Market Research HHS will not support market re search, including studies of the literature that lead to a new or expanded statement of work, under the grant. Fo r purposes of the II-126 II-127 SBIR/STTR programs, \"market research\" is the systematic gathering, editing, recording, computing, and analyzing of data about problems relating to the sale and distribution of the subject of the proposed research. It includ es various types of research, such as the size of potentia l markets and potential sales volume, the identification of consumers most apt to purchase the products, and the advertising media most likely to stimulate their purcha ses. However, \"market research\" does not include activities under a resear ch plan or protocol that in clude a survey of the public as part of the objectives of the project to determine the impact of the subject of the research on the behavi or of individuals. Intellectual Property Rights to data, including software developed under the terms of any funding agreement resulting from an HHS award, must remain with the recipient except that any such copyrighted material is subject to a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to the Federal governme nt to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the material, and to authorize others to do so for Federal purposes. In addition, under the SBIR/STTR programs, in contrast to awards to for-profit organizations under other support mechanisms, such da ta must not be released outside the Federal government without th e recipient's permission for a period of 4 years from completion of the project under which the data were generated. The STTR program requires that the sma ll business recipient and the single, non- profit research institution execute an agreement allocating between the parties intellectual property rights and rights, if any, to carry out follow-on research, development, or commercialization of th e subject research. (A model agreement, \"Allocation of Rights in Intellectual Property and Rights to Carry Out Follow-On Research, Development, or Commercialization,\" is available at the NIH Web site at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/sbir.htm .) By signing the face page of the grant application, the SBC's AOO certifies that the agreement with the research institution will be effective at the time the grant aw ard is made. A copy of the agreement must be furnished upon request to the awarding office. SBIR/STTR recipients are covered by 37 CFR part 401 with respect to inventions and patents. Data Sharing. Applicants for SBIR Phase II fundin g of $500,000 or more of direct costs in any single year must comply with the HHS policy on data sharing consistent with the Small Business Act. If the final data would not be amenable to sharing, e.g., proprietary data, the SBC should explain th at in the application. In addition, as indicated under \"Intellectual Property\" in this subsection, whether or not the award meets the threshold for data sharing, the OPDIV will not release data outside the Federal government without th e recipient's permission for a period of 4 years from completion of the project under which the data were generated. The entire policy may be found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm .

United States Code A-2 A-3 USDA United States Department of Agriculture VA Department of Veterans Affairs VANPC VA-Affiliated Non-Profit Research Corporation Appendix B: Glossary This glossary defines term s commonly used in the HHS GPS. These definitions are included for purposes of clarity in this document and are not intended to replace controlling definitions found in applicable statutes and regulations. The policy associated with these definitions is found in Part II of the HHS GPS, unless otherwise indicated. accrual basis An accounting method in which revenues and expenses are identified with specific periods of time, such as a month or year, and are recorded when they are earned or incurred without regard to the date of receipt or payment of cash; distinguished from cash basis. acquisition cost The net invoice price of property or supplies, including the cost of modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges, such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty, and protective in-transit insurance, are included or excluded from the unit acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's regular accounting practices. The term does not include costs for rental of property or alteration and rental of real property. administrative requirements The general practices that are common to the administration of grants, such as financial accountability, reporting, equipment management, and retention of records. advance payment A payment made to a recipient upon its request either before cash disbursements are made by the recipient or through the use of predetermined payment schedules. Most HHS advance payments are made by the Payment Management System (PMS), the HHS centralized grant payment system. allocable cost A cost that is allocable to a particular cost objective (i.e., a specific function, grant project, service, department, or other activity) in accordance with the relative benefits received. A cost is allocable to a Federal award where it is treated consistently with other costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances and (1) is incurred specifically for the award, (2) benefits both the award and other work and can be distributed in reasonable proportion to the benefits received, or (3) is necessary for the overall operation of the organization. allowable cost A cost incurred by a recipient that is (1) reasonable for the performance of the award; (2) allocable; (3) in conformance with any limitations or exclusions set forth in the Federal cost principles applicable to the organization incurring the cost or in the NoA as to the type or amount of cost; (4) consistent with regulations, policies, and procedures of the recipient that are applied uniformly to both federally supported and other activities of the organization; (5) accorded consistent treatment as a direct or indirect cost; (6) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and (7) not included as a cost in any other federally supported award (unless specifically authorized by statute). B-1 alteration and renovation Work that changes the interior arrangements or other physical characteristics of an existing facility or installed equipment so that it can be used more effectively for its currently designated purpose or adapted to an alternative use to meet a programmatic requirement. Alteration and renovation may include work referred to as improvements, conversion, rehabilitation, remodeling, or modernization, but is distinguished from construction and large-scale permanent improvements. alternative dispute resolution A process in which mediation or other techniques are used to avoid or resolve disputes. Alternative dispute resolution is intended to reduce cost, delay, and contentiousness in the resolution process as well as to prevent disputes from escalating to levels requiring more formal or judicial resolution. applicable credit Those receipts that offset or reduce direct or indirect costs. Typical examples of such transactions include purchase discounts, rebates, or allowances; recoveries or indemnities on losses; insurance refunds; and adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges. application A request for financial support of a project, program, or activity submitted on specified forms and in accordance with OPDIV instructions. (See \"Types of Applications and Letters of Intent\" in Part I for an explanation of the types of applications.) approved budget The financial expenditure plan fo r a grant-supported project, program, or activity, including revisions approved by the OPDIV and permissible revisions made by the recipient. The approved budget consists of Federal (grant) funds and, if required by the terms and conditions of the award, non-Federal participation in the form of matching or cost sharing. Expenditures under an approved budget that consists of both Federal and non-Federal shares are deemed to be borne by the recipient in the same proportion as the percentage of Federal/non-Federal participation in the overall budget. assurance A written statement by an applicant, normally included with the application, indicating that it will abide by a particular requirement if a grant is awarded. (See Part I.) audit resolution The process of resolving audit findings, including those related to management and systems deficiencies and monetary findings (i.e., questioned costs). award The document that provides OPDIV funds to a recipient to carry out an approved program or project (based on an approved application or progress report). The term, when used as a noun, is sometimes used interchangeably with \"grant.\" awarding office The OPDIV organizational component responsible for the business management and non-programmatic aspects of the award and administration of grants. When referring to the focal point for recipient-initiated prior approval requests or actions by an awarding office that may require changes in the terms and conditions of award, reference will be to the GMO. budget periods The intervals of time (usually 12 months each) into which a project period is divided for budgetary and funding purposes. Funding of individual budget periods sometimes is referred to as \"incremental funding.\" carryover Unobligated Federal funds remaining at the end of any budget period that may be carried forward to another budget period to cover allowable costs of that budget period (whether as an offset or additional authorization). Obligated but unliquidated funds are not considered carryover. B-2 cash basis An accounting method in which revenue and expenses are recorded on the books of account when received and paid, respectively, without regard to the period in which they are earned or incurred; distinguished from accrual basis. cash contribution The recipient's cash outlay, including the outlay of money contributed to the recipient by third parties. change of grantee A process in which the legal and administrative responsibility for a grant- supported project, program, or activity is transferred from one legal entity to another before the end of the project period. This action also may be termed \"transfer of a grant.\" clinical trial A biomedical or behavioral research study of human subjects that is designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions (drugs, treatments, devices, or new ways of using known drugs, treatments, or devices). Clinical trials are used to determine whether new biomedical or behavioral interventions are safe, efficacious, and effective. Clinical trials of an experimental drug, treatment, device, or intervention may proceed through four phases: Phase I\u2014testing in a small group of people (e.g., 20 to 80) to determine efficacy and evaluate safety (e.g., determine a safe dosage range and identify side effects). Phase II\u2014study in a larger group of people (several hundred) to determine efficacy and further evaluate safety. Phase III\u2014study to (1) determine efficacy in large groups of people (from several hundred to several thousand) by comparing the intervention to other standard or experimental interventions, (2) monitor adverse effects, and (3) collect information to allow safe use. Phase IV\u2014studies done after the intervention has been marketed. These studies are designed to monitor the effectiveness of the approved intervention in the general population and to collect information about any adverse effects associated with widespread use. closeout The process by which an OPDIV determines whether all applicable administrative actions and all work required under the award have been completed by the recipient and the awarding office. cognizant agency The Federal agency that, on behalf of all Federal agencies, is responsible for reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans, indirect cost rate and similar rates; monitoring non-Federal audit reports; conducting Federal audits as necessary; and resolving cross-cutting audit findings. The cognizant agency under applicable cost principles and under OMB Circular A-133 may be different for a given recipient. competition A process in which applications undergo an objective review; the applications are evaluated against established review criteria and scored and rated accordingly. competitive segment The initial project period recommended for support (up to 5 years) or each extension of a project period resulting from a competing continuation award. completion date The date on which all work under an award is completed or the date in the NoA (as amended) on which Federal sponsorship ends (i.e., the end of a project period). B-3 consortium agreement A formal agreement whereby a project is carried out by a recipient and one or more other organizations that are separate legal entities. Under the agreement, the recipient must perform a substantive role in the conduct of the planned project or program activity and not merely serve as a conduit of funds to another party or parties. Consortium agreements are considered subawards for purposes of this policy statement. contract under a grant A written agreement between a recipient and a third party to acquire commercial goods or services. construction A project to support the initial building or major A&R (i.e., large-scale modernization or permanent improvement) of a facility. consultant An individual who provides professional advice or services for a fee, but normally not as an employee of the engaging party. The term \"consultant\" also includes a firm that provides paid professional advice or services. cooperative agreement A financial assistance support mechanism used when there will be substantial Federal programmatic involvement. Substantial involvement means that OPDIV program staff will collaborate or participate in project or program activities as specified in the NoA. copyright A form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (Title 17, U.S. Code) to the authors of \"original works of authorship,\" including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works, including computer programs. This protection is available to both published and unpublished works. cost analysis The breakdown and verification of cost data proposed in an application budget, including evaluating specific elements of costs and examining them to determine the necessity, reasonableness, and allocability of the costs and their allowability pursuant to the applicable Federal cost principles and other governing requirements. cost sharing See \"matching or cost sharing.\" Departmental Appeals Board The administrative board responsible for resolving certain disputes arising under HHS assistance programs. The DAB provides an impartial adjudicatory hearing process for appealing certain final written decisions by GMOs. The DAB's jurisdiction is specified in 45 CFR part 16, \"Procedures for HHS Grant Appeals Board.\" direct assistance A financial assistance support mechanism, which must be specifically authorized by statute, whereby goods or services are provided to recipients in lieu of cash. Direct assistance generally involves the assignment of Federal personnel or the provision of equipment or supplies such as vaccines. This type of financial assistance also is described as \"non-monetary assistance.\" direct costs Costs that can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. domestic organization A public (including a State or other governmental agency) or private non-profit or for-profit organization that is located in the United States or its territories, is subject to U.S. laws, and assumes legal and financial accountability for funds awarded and for the performance of the grant-supported activities. B-4 Entity Identification Number A three-part coding scheme of 12 characters used in PMS to identify organizations and individuals. The first character identifies the recipient as an organization or an individual. The next 9 characters are the Internal Revenue Service tax number identification (TIN) for organizations or the social security number (SSN) for individuals. The last 2 characters are a suffix to provide distinction between organizational entities that are assigned a single EIN and those that have more than one EIN. The entities could be subsidiaries, divisions, branches, subdivisions, or other organizational groupings of a major organizational entity. equipment An article of tangible nonexpendable personal property that has a useful life of more than 1 year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit or the capitalization threshold established by the recipient, whichever is less. excess property The property under the control of any OPDIV that, as determined by the head of the OPDIV or designee, is no longer required for its needs or the discharge of its responsibilities. exempt property Tangible personal property acquired, in whole or part, with Federal funds, where the OPDIV has statutory authority to vest title in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal government. expanded authorities Operating authorities provided to recipients that waive the requirement for OPDIV prior approval for specified actions. expenditure report For non-construction grants, generally the FSR; and for construction grants, the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. expiration date The date signifying the end of the current budget period, as indicated in the NoA, after which the recipient does not have authority to obligate grant funds. facilities and administrative costs See \"indirect costs.\" Federal cash transactions report A standard form, PMS 272, used to obtain disbursement information and to monitor cash advanced to recipients.

If the costs or other actions are specifically identified in an application, approval of the application, and issuance of an award based thereon, constitutes such authorization. Prior approval for components of indirect costs must be obtained from the cognizant agency or as specified in the applicable cost principles. profit See \"fee.\" program income Gross income earned by a recipient that is directly generated by the grant- supported project, program, or activity or earned as a result of the award. progress report Periodic, usually annual, reports submitted by the recipient and used by the OPDIV to assess progress and, except for the final progress report, to determine whether to provide funding for the budget period subsequent to that covered by the report. project or program costs The total allowable costs incurred by a recipient (and the value of in-kind contributions made by third parties) in accomplishing the objectives of the award during the project period. project period The total time for which support of a project has been programmatically approved. The total project period comprises the initial competitive segment, any subsequent competitive segments resulting from a competing continuation award, and any non-competing extensions. real property Land, including land improvements, structures, and appurtenances, but not movable machinery and equipment. reasonable cost A cost whose nature or amount does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing when the decision was made to incur the cost. recipient The organization or individual that receives a grant or cooperative agreement award from an OPDIV and is responsible and accountable for the use of the funds provided and for the performance of the grant-supported project or activity. The recipient is the entire legal entity even if a particular component is designated in the NoA. The term includes \"grantee.\" reimbursement A payment made to a recipient upon its request after it makes cash disbursements. Most reimbursement payments are processed through the Payment Management System (PMS), the Department's centralized grants payment system. B-8 research A systematic, intensive study intended to increase knowledge or understanding of the subject studied, a systematic study specifically directed toward applying new knowledge to meet a recognized need, or a systematic application of knowledge to the production of useful materials, devices, and systems or methods, including design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet specific requirements. Also termed \"research and development.\" research misconduct Fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them. Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that research is not accurately represented in the research record. Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. The term does not include honest error or differences of opinion. research patient care Routine and ancillary services provided by hospitals to patients participating in research programs. The costs of these services are normally assigned to individual research projects through the development and application of research patient care rates or amounts (collectively referred to as \"rates\"). significant rebudgeting A threshold that is reached when expenditures in a single direct cost budget category deviate (increase or decrease) from the approved budget amount for that budget category for that budget period by a specified amount, usually more than 25 percent of the total costs awarded. Significant rebudgeting is one indicator of change in scope. small business concern A business that is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field of operation; has its principal place of business in the United States and is organized for profit; is at least 51 percent owned or, in the case of a publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of its voting stock is owned by U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens; has, including its affiliates, not more than 500 employees; and meets other regulatory requirements established by the SBA at 13 CFR 121. State government The government of any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any U.S. territory or possession, or any agency or instrumentality of a State exclusive of local governments. State institutions of higher education and State hospitals are not considered State governments for purposes of the HHS general administrative requirements for grants and the HHS GPS. stipend A payment made to an individual under a fellowship or training grant in accordance with established levels to provide for the individual's living expenses during the period of training. A stipend is not considered compensation for the services expected of an employee. subaward Financial assistance in the form of money or property in lieu of money provided under an award by a recipient to an eligible subrecipient (or by an eligible subrecipient to a lower-tier subrecipient). The term includes financial assistance when provided by any legal agreement, even if the agreement is called a contract, but does not include either procurement of goods or services or, for purposes of this policy statement, any form of assistance other than grants and cooperative agreements. The term includes consortium agreements. subrecipient An entity that receives a subaward from a recipient or another subrecipient under an award of financial assistance and is accountable to the recipient or other subrecipient for the use of the Federal funds provided by the subaward. B-9 substantive programmatic work The primary project activities for which grant support is provided. supplies Personal property other than equipment, intangible property, and debt instruments. The category of \"supplies\" includes items that could be considered equipment, but do not meet the threshold definition. suspension Temporary withdrawal of a recipient's authority to obligate grant funds, pending either corrective action by the recipient, as specified by the OPDIV, or a decision by the OPDIV to terminate the award. This meaning of the term \"suspension\" differs from that used in conjunction with the debarment and suspension process. tangible property Equipment, supplies, and any other property other than that defined as intangible property. It also does not include copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property that is generated or developed (rather than acquired) under an award. termination Permanent withdrawal by the OPDIV of a recipient's authority to obligate previously awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise expire, including the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by the recipient. terms and conditions of award All legal requirements imposed on a grant by the OPDIV, whether based on statute, regulation, policy, or other document referenced in the NoA, or specified by the NoA itself. In addition to general terms and conditions, the NoA may include other conditions that are considered necessary to attain the award's objectives, facilitate post-award administration, conserve grant funds, or otherwise protect the Federal government's interests. third-party in-kind contributions The value of non-cash contributions directly benefiting a grant-supported project or program that is provided by non-Federal third parties to the recipient, the subrecipient, or a cost-type contractor under the grant or subgrant without charge. In-kind contributions may be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies and other expendable property, and goods and services directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or program. total project or program costs The total allowable costs (both direct and indirect) incurred by the recipient to carry out a grant-supported project or activity. Total project or program costs include costs charged to the award and costs borne by the recipient to satisfy a matching or cost-sharing requirement. unallowable cost A cost specified by law or regulation, Federal cost principles, or term and condition of award that may not be reimbursed under a grant or cooperative agreement unliquidated obligations The amount of obligations incurred by the recipient that has not been paid (for financial reports prepared on a cash basis) or the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient for which an outlay has not been recorded (for reports prepared on an accrual basis). unobligated balance The portion of the funds authorized by the Federal agency that has not been obligated by the recipient. vertebrate animal Any live animal having a backbone or spinal column used or intended for use in research, research training, experimentation, biological testing, or related purposes. withholding of payment An action taken by an OPDIV, after appropriate administrative procedures have been followed, that restricts a recipient's ability to access its grant funds until the recipient takes corrective action required by the OPDIV. B-10 B-11 withholding of support A decision by an OPDIV not to make a non-competing continuation award within a previously approved project period. woman-owned business A business that is, at least, 51 percent owned, controlled, and operated by a woman or women.
