Similar to [ fungal infections in dogs](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/fungal-infections-in-dogs), there are a number of fungi that can cause serious illness in cats. Fungal infections can be made up of both fungal infections or yeast infections. They like to develop and grow in warm humid areas of the body and mainly occur on the skin. But it's not uncommon for fungal infections to also develop and grow in the body in moist areas such as your cat's nose. Fungi are organisms that feed of living matter for their food. Don't be mislead into thinking that all fungi are bad, they are not. Without the ability of fungi to do their thing we wouldn't be able to survive on the planet. However, give the millions of fungi in the environment thankfully, only a handful can potentially affect the health of your cat. Most fungal infections occur or reoccur in those cats that have a compromised immune system. A compromised immune system in your cat can be anything from your cat suffering numerous flea problems, to allergies to a flown blown disease such as cancer. A weak immune system means parasites, bacteria, fungi etc. have found the perfect living condition or \"host\" to feed off, as the weaker the immune system the easier it is for the parasites to spread like wildfire effectively eating the host alive with their invasion. Knowing that the top causes of fungal or yeast infections in cats are a weakened immune system then it's important to understand what causes a weakened immune system? 1) Poor un-natural diet 2) Vaccinations 3) Monthly flea treatments 4) The extensive and over-use of antibiotics, medications such as cortisone and corticosteroids, use of antimicrobial drugs or immunosuppressive. Most cats that suffer from fungal or yeast infections are those cats feed a processed diet. An unnatural diet is responsible for the vast majority of cases in pet's that have a poor immune system which then leads to all other health issues. Unfortunately, the majority of pet's owners and many vets alike seem to believe that a cat or dog can only survive on kibble or processed food. This couldn't be further from the truth and in fact plays a major role in why pets are so ill, suffer so many human-made illnesses and have low life expectancies. Cats are natural meat-eaters. It is biologically essential for their survival that they eat real meat. They are known as \"obligatory carnivores\" in that the digestive system of cats is specifically adapted to eating raw. Throughout the whole of evolution, this has not changed. Cats must eat real food for the health of all their internal systems. The digestive tract of cats is short and they have little ability to make amino acids and vitamins in their bodies the way other animals do. They have high requirements for taurine, which in its truest form is found in raw flesh and blood. They need a high amount of real protein in their diet to convert to glucose rather than digesting carbohydrates. Everything about a cat's digestive system is adapted for raw eating. Simply put, it's essential cats eat raw. When you look at the meal plan of an average domesticated cat, it is nothing but kibble for breakfast, kibble for lunch and kibble for dinner. Apart from it being incredibly dull to feed the same thing day in and day out for years on end, these types of foods have absolutely nothing in them that your cat can actually use to support the proper metabolic process in the body and thrive. Health issues begin to appear by the time cats are about two years old as the unreal ingredients in dried kibbles or processed wet food start the whole domino effect into chronic illness. By the time your cat is two and if the only thing he or she has ever eaten is kibble, then you could probably bet the farm that your cat has a weak immune system and on the back of this poor diet. The long term effect will inevitably be illness and disease, the only question is how many more years will your cat have before it's diagnosed with a major disease? A natural meal for your cat is a mouse, a small bird etc. so you need to replicate this as much as possible into their diet by feeding your cat a variety of raw meats and raw organ meats. The core vaccines for cats are those that protect against feline parvovirus (FPV), feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline herpesvirus1 (FHV1) and rabies Anything outside of the core vaccines are unnecessary and likely to cause serious illness in cats. Research done by Heska over the years has demonstrated that the injectable vaccines administered to cats produced autoantibodies against cats' kidneys, which may well explain why cats, as a species, have such a high rate of [chronic renal disease](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/kidney-disease-in-cats), and often die of kidney failure. Kidneys in cats, even the big cats in the zoos are apparently destroyed by repeating unnecessary immune assaults via vaccination to these cats. Not just rabies vaccines, any vaccine can lead to glomerulonephritis where the intimate anatomy of the kidney is destroyed by immune complexes. Injectable feline vaccines are not safe and are not necessary. They also have Herpes and Calicivirus in the vaccines injected deep into the body where these viruses fight a war on the mucosal surfaces. The only way these viruses should be vaccinated is via mucosal drops, not by injection. In 2015 over 1,500 medical doctors and researchers from 60 different countries came together to produce a credible source on the topic of how vaccines lead to [autoimmunity](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/auto-immune-diseases-in-pets) and sadly despite efforts by many forward thinking vets to follow a protocol of just injecting the core vaccines once in the lifetime of cats, many mainstream vets continue to administer unnecessary vaccines to generate revenue. Vaccines are in fact causing VIDS vaccine induced diseases and are the main reason for chronic disease in cats, amongst them being the most common, - [chronic renal disease](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/kidney-disease-in-cats) and they are a major long term disruptor to your cat's immune system. The top common causes of weakening your cat's immune system mean the effect is, your cat is completely susceptible to fungal and yeast infections, illnesses and diseases. All of the above negatively impact the ability of your cat's [innate immune system](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/immune-system-responses-in-cats-dogs-innate) to do its job and keep your cat healthy by fighting invaders. The weaker the immune system the less likely the body can defend itself against an invader attack. Yeast and fungal infections are signals your cat is heading for a more serious illness. The most common places fungal infections take root in cats are the skin, ears and nose and if not treated can actually be a slow and deadly killer. Most vets don't consider the underlying reason behind fungal or yeast infections and go straight for treating the symptoms which then leads to other health issues further down the line. If you don't help recover the immune and lymph system of your cat whilst treating the fungal infections your poor cat will always be bouncing between bouts of wellness and ill-health. The symptoms will depend on the type of fungi or yeast that's caused the infection and where about on your cat's body the infection appears so this can't be an all inclusive list of symptons but some of the most common signs of fungal infections are; With the skin being the largest organ of the body any issues concerning the skin are a good indication that things are not in harmony on the inside. Skin infections which can include [allergic](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/itchiness-food-allergies-anal-gland-problems) dermatitis, eczema, rosea, psoriasis, fungal infections such as ringworm, yeast infections etc. are signs that you should really be paying attention to and not just to treat the infection. You need to investigate what caused your cat to have the fungal infection and as mentioned above underneath most illnesses in our pets, is a weak immune system or compromised immune system. Investigate what caused the immune system to be weak and unable to fight infection, then start cleaning up your cat's health both on the inside to aid the immune system and on the outside to combat the fungal infection. Without coming at it from these two points your cat will never fully recover it's health. Candidiasis is a yeast like fungal infection and although rare in cats it can affect the mucous membranes and the skin, it can also cause oral and upper respiratory disease, lesions of the eye, infection of the space between the lungs and chest wall, intestinal disease, and bladder infection. Infection symptoms vary between cats but some notable signs are skin lesions, weakness, diarrhoea. Mycetomas is rare in cats but affects the skin and underlying tissues and has the appearance of nodules or tumours. The fungus multiplies in the lesions and organizes into aggregates known as granules or grains. Most infections are within the tissues beneath the skin but the fungal infection has been known to enter the abdomen and legs of the cat. Phaeohyphomycosis is from the family Dematiaceae and is a pigmentation fungus. It's uncommon in cats but when infected it is normally of the surrounding tissue where there is an injury. Masses will appear beneath the skin and can be found on the toes, ears, face, and the lining of the nasal passages. Sporotrichosis normally found in more coastal regions and occurs when spores enter the body through an open wound. Long term symptoms of the infection can be fever, listlessness, and depression and if left untreated can spread to the organs through the bloodstream. It is more common in cats especially outdoor cats that may pick up the fungus on their explorations and if your cat is injured by a sharp object such as a tree branch, a scratch in a fight etc. then the fungus can enter the wound. Source: Merck Veterinary Manual Fungal or yeast infections in cats ears are quite common and again the underlying reason why cats tend to suffer [ ear infections](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/dog-ear-infections-in-cats) are due to a weakened or compromised immune system. Ear infections are a sign that there has been a major disruption to the immune system and that the body is under attack by inflammation. Ears are one of the pathways for the body to rid itself of toxins and ear infections, develop trying to discharge the mediators of inflammation. Nose fungal infections are generally classed as a respiratory infection the most common being Aspergillosis which can focus on the nasal area or the lungs. Symptoms can vary between individual cats and It's often hard to determine if a cat has a respiratory fungal infection as known symptoms are the same as signs of other illnesses or diseases in cats. If you suspect your cat has a nose/respiratory fungal infection then it's highly recommended you work with your vet to devise a treatment plan that includes re-regulating both your cat's immune and lymph systems and not just administering medications that only treat the symptoms. You'll also have to be patient as respiratory infections can take months to clear from your cat's body. Aspergillosis affects the respiration it normally enters through the nasal cavity, sinuses or lungs and can potentially be destructive to the nasal bone and inevitably enters the rest of the body through the circulatory system. Known symptoms can vary between cats but signs include inflammation of the sinuses, facial swelling, and pneumonia. If the fungus invades the nervous systems then cats can suffer seizures. Coccidioidomycosis is a dust borne infection but is more prevalent in regions where cats are around weather conditions that have a lot of dust storms and it's normally caused by a cat inhaling the spores in the air created by environmental conditions. Common symptoms include a persistent cough, poor appetite, malnutrition, lameness, enlarged joints, fever, ulcerated skin. Cryptococcosis fungi are founds in soils and bird manure and infections are through inhalation of the spores or through open lesions. Symptoms include issues with the nasal cavity, central nervous system issues such as circling, paralysis, lameness, problems with the eyes, and skin. Cat's infected tend to suffer sneezing; bloody, clear, or pus-filled nasal discharge; polyp-like mass(es) in the nostril; and a firm swelling under the skin and over the bridge of the nose. Rhinosporidiosis is a longterm infection. It's non-fatal but primarily impacts the lining of the nasal passages and occasionally penetrates the skin. Its infections produce growths that obstruct or close up the nasal passage.

Some of the more common lung fungal infections in cats are; Histoplasmosis is a soil fungus that is widely distributed particularly by bird and bat populations especially in river valleys. Infection occurs through the inhalation of spores. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea, lameness, eye and nasal discharges, sneezing or coughing, breathing problems and lack of appetite. In advanced cases, the infection can spread to the bone marrow. Blastomycosis occurs more in dogs that live near water and where the fungus can thrive in sandy soils so spores may enter the cat's system. It can present like pneumonia and include fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and panting, loss of appetite, weight loss, eye lesions, possible seizures, lameness. Source: Merck Veterinary Manual Given what we know about fungal/yeast infection being an effect of a weak immune system and knowing that the main causes of a weak immune system in or pets are diet, vaccinations, chemical toxins on the skin and the administration of antibiotics immunosuppressive drugs, you ideally want to work with an integrative vet who understands the importance of healing the infection whilst healing the internal systems. However, some simple steps you can do to be in control of your cat's health are; Investigate then medicate. Once you understand the real reason behind the infection you ideally want to clear out any toxins from his body, then start a new diet regime. You can help your cat by feeding proper nutrition through [healing bone broths](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/bone-broth) and [ immune healing soups](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/improve-your-pets-immune-system-with-this-recipes), then start adding in [real raw food](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/barf-diet-dogs-vegetables) and [healing herbs](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/medicinal-healing-herbs-cats-dogs) or [homeopathic remedies](https://authenticapets.com/en/cat-shop/natural-cat-accessories/happy-belly) to get your cat's immune system back on track and to ensure that the lymph system is working optimally to eliminate toxins from the body. Long term, you'll want to ensure a proper pH balance in their digestive system and add in a natural source of [digestive enzymes](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/digestive-enzymes) and [probiotics](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/prebiotics-probiotics) to help protect the part of the immune system that is in your cat's gut. In more severe cases or long term recurring issues, it would be a good idea to work with a pet nutritionist to work out an individual eating plan for your cat until any infections are cleared from the body and all internal systems are working optimally. Raw feeding cats is one of the most powerful things you can do to feed your cat out of ill-health.
