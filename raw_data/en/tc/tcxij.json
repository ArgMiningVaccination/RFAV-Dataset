The J osephine At Home project will serve all patients who meet Home Health eligibility and require such services in all of Snohomish County and Camano Island. By definition of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ), Home Health patients must meet the criteria for being homebound and able to receive intermittent skilled care. With an aging population in Snohomish County, and on Camano Island, the expectation supported by Medicare claims and other publicly reported data is that home health care utilization will continue to increase.

The anticipated completion date of the project is April 1, 2021. Jose phine At Home has partnered with the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) in seeking Home Health Accreditation. Ver. (07 /2012) H.Describ e the relationship of this project to the applicant's long -range business plan and long -range financial plan (if any). Obtaining a Certificate of Need for a Home Health Ag ency is an important piece of our long -range business and financial plans. Through the Certificate of Need application, Josephine Caring Community will take another step improving continuity of care by providing physician directed home health care to those living in Snohomish County and Camano Island. The demand for home health from our existing skilled nursing facility and local partners remains high. Long term, the Jose phine At Home service line plans to ex pand to provide Home Care and Hospice. These plans will ensure continuity for patients and their families. As the health care landscape changes to value driven models, and data supports better outcomes when patients are a ble to obtain care in their home, Josephine is making evidence -based decisions to ensure we can meet and exceed the community's health care needs. COVID -19 has added additional evidence for both Josephine, and the nation, that significant changes must occur in how and where we deliver health care services. Home Health Agencies are uniquely positioned to step- in and fill an even larger community need than originally foreseen. Josephine Caring Community will remain consistent in maintaining our current financi al health by becoming Medicare and Medicaid certified so that we can continue to responsibly expand care across Snohomish County and Camano Island. In the past 112 years, Josephine has prov en that by dedicating our organization to the wellbeing of our staff, seniors, rural residents and those that are vulnerable in our co mmunity, we are investing in a healthy future for all residents. Since 1908, Josephine Caring Community has provided care with One Heart and Many Hands and continues to celebrate Fullness of Life with our community centered service lines . I.Provide documentation that the applicant has sufficient interest in the site or facility proposed. \"Sufficient interest\" shall mean any of the following: 1.Clear legal title to the proposed site; or 2. A lease for at least one year with options to renew for not less t han a total of three years; or 3. A legally enforceable agreement (i.e., draft detailed sales or lease agreement, executed sales or lease agreement with contingencies clause) to give such title or such lease in the event that aCertificate of Need is issue d for the proposed project.

PROJECT RATIONALE A.Nee d (WAC 246-310-210) 1.Iden tify the proposed geographic service area. Jose phine At Home is proposing to provide Medicare and Medicaid certified Home Health services to both Snohomish County and Camano Island . 2.If t he proposed service area is designated as a Medically Underserved Area (MUA) as defined by HCFA or a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), please provide documentation verifying the designation Snoho mish County and Camano Isla nd have areas designated as Medically Underserved. Snohomish County and Camano Island also have areas designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas. Plea se see Exhibit 6 for additional supporting maps of the MUA and HPSA. https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage -area/mua- find https ://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage -area/mua- find 3.Identify and analyze the unmet home health service needs and/or other problems toward which this project is directed. A.Identify the unmet home health needs of the patient population in the proposed service area . Note that the unmet patient need should not include p hysical plant deficiencies and/or increase facility operating efficiencies .11 V er. (07 /2012) Utilizing the 1 987 Wa shington State H ealth Plan need methodology offered by the De partment for calculating home health need, we included summarization tables of each methodology step below. Please see Exhibit 7 for the 1987 Washington State Health Plan need methodology utilized to calculate n eed.

With a net need of thirteen home health agencies, Snohomish County and Camano Island are at risk of continued limitations in reside nt access to care, higher payor and patient costs , and poor health outcomes for those that develop complications or cannot find care in their area. Home Hea lth services allow for patients to remain in their homes while receiving skilled care. Keeping patients at home, or discharging them from the hospital to their homes, reduces he alth care costs. It also reduces hospitalizations and fragmented care that can lead to poor health outcomes. The proposed project will improve continuity of care through increased access to care and serve the needs of a population that continues to increase. 4.Define the types of patients that are expected to be served by the project . The types of patients expected to be served can be defined according to specific needs and circumstances of patients (i.e., culturally diverse, limited English speaking, etc.) or by the number of persons who prefer to receivethe services of a particular recognized school or theory of medical care. Jose phine At Home will serve home health eligible homebound Snohomish County and Camano Island residents . The applicant 's Medicaid certification and large census of Medicaid patients in the skilled nursing facility and assisted living residences reflect the commitment to serving low -income members of the community. Recent and current Charity Care accounting records also reflect the intentionality of serving those who are unable to afford care. Cons istent with the Josephine Caring Community's Mission and Values, it is the policy of Josephine At Home to not discriminate against, exclude or treat differently any individuals accessing any Josephine At Home Program or Activity on any basis prohibited by local, state or federal laws, including but not limited to on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, handicap, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or as those terms are defined under federal law and rules. Where applicable, federal statutory protections for r eligious freedom and conscience are applied. It is also Josephine At Home's policy to provide aids and language assistance services to individuals with a disability, handicap, or limitedEnglish proficiency who are accessing a Josephine At Home Program or Activity. Such services may includeproviding qualified bilingual/multilingual staff, qualified interpreters, and qualified translators.14 V er. (07 /2012) Acc ording to the Snohomish County Community Health Assessment 2018, Snohomish County is less racially and ethnically diverse than the state. A smaller portion of the population is Hispanic (9.6% compared to 11.5% statewide) or Black (2.8% compared to 3.6% statewide). However, the Asian population makes up a larger p ercentage of the county than the state (9.9% compared to 7.7%). Snoh omish County is becoming more diverse over time. In 2000, 83.4% of the population was white. That number is now 71.4%. The figure below shows this data (with Hispanic people of all races combined).

Provide detailed information on the availability and accessibility of similar existing services to the defined population expected to be served. This section should concentrate on other facilities and services which \" compete\" with the applicant.18 V er. (07 /2012) a.Identify all existing providers of services (licensed only and certified) similar to those proposed and provide utilization experience of those providers that demonstrates that existing services are not available to meet all or some portion of the forecasted u tilization. It wa s found after our analysis that there are 17 existing Home Health Agencies. Of those 17, only 10 were found to have Certificate of Need approval, have data supporting the ability to bill for services through Medicaid and Medicare and are able to serve Snohomish County. Reflected in Table 8 , after the analysis of existing home health agency data provided by the Department against Medicare billing data in Snohomish County and Agency Sources of Patients for 2019, the following table summariz es an adjusted list of current Home Health Agencies. Table 9.

Being a certified home health provider is a requirement for home health agencies to bill Medicare and Medicaid. Home health agency certification and accreditation are als o a requirement s for the insurances with which Josephine At Home plans to establish contracts . b.If existing services are available, demonstrate that such services are not accessible. Unusual time and distance factors, among other things, are to be analyzed in this section.

Medicare certified home health agencies can monitor their individual timeliness through OASIS data, unfortunately this information is not currently publicly reported. However, in H ome Health it is important to note that these results may be impacted by COVID-1 9 in 2020 and beyond due to new changes to the in-h ome services landscape.19 Ve r. (07 /2012) Table 13.

R ec ruiting s killed s taff in ru ral areas s o th at t hey may s erve t hose same rural community members is a key o bjective f or Josephine At H ome. c. If existing services are available and accessible, justify why the proposed project does not constitute an unnecessary duplica tion of services . The net need of 13 home health agencies was calculated using the Washington State Health Plan need methodology. The results support that there is no unnecessary duplication of services in Snohomish County. 10. Document the manner in which low-i ncome persons, racial and ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, a nd other under-s erved groups will have access to the services proposed. The department uses t he applicant's current or proposed status as a Medicare and Medicaid certifie d p rovider of service as part of its evaluation of question. Josephine Caring Community has been serving Snohomish County and Camano Island for 112 years. Our commitment to serving those most vulnerable is supported in our commitment to Medicaid patients, our significant charity care and our formal non-d iscrimination policies that document our mission in serving the entirety of Snohomish County re gardless of race, religion, disabili ty, gender or income. 11.

By extending the continuum of care within Josephine Caring Community we will reduce fragmented care for patients transitioning to the post -acute care setting. Jos ephine At Home intends to deepen existing resource relationships while creating new healthcare partnerships to best service Snohomish County and Camano Island residents .

W e ha ve continued to g row a nd expand services to m eet patient and community ne eds ba sed on evidence and data. Terry Robertson , Josephine C aring C ommunity's CEO, has be en leading J osephine fo r tha t past 12 y ears. H e's developed n ew s ervice lines , advanced existing services and has a vision to provide the e ntire c ontinuum of care to all of Snohomish County and Camano Island.

D.Cost Containment (WAC 246-310-240) 1.Identify the exploration of alternati ves to the project you have chosen to pursue, including postponing action, shared service arrangements, joint ventures, subcontracting, merger, contract services, anddifferent methods of service provision, including different spatial configurations you have evaluatedand rejected. Each alternative should be analyzed by application of the following: Decision making criteria (cost limits, availability, quality of care, legal restriction, etc.): Advantages and disadvantages, and whether the sum of either the advantages or the disadvantages out weighs each other by application of the decision -making criteria; Capital costs; Staffing impact. Shoul d Josephine At Home not be approved for Home Health Certificate of Need, the project will be cancelled. An approved Certificate of Need is required for accreditation to receive payment through the Center of Medicare Services (CMS). W ithout CMS as a payor, the project is not financially feasible and will therefore be cancelled without alternative actions. 2.Des cribe how the proposal will comply with the Medicare conditions of participation, without exceeding the costs caps. Medic are conditions of participation and available data on PDGM reimbursement are the basis of our proforma budget. The proforma budget will inform the initial start -up costs and staffing, while the ongoing financial reviews by the Board, CEO, Controller, Admiss ions and Josephine At Home Executive Director will meet regularily to es tablish revenue projections that align with the Medicare conditions of participation . That said, under PDGM there remains no cost caps. 3.Describe the specific ways in which the proj ect will promote staff or system efficiency or productivity . Staff a nd system efficiencies are promoted through the use of SharePoint, a Microsoft Azure Cloud application that allows for a single source of data and workflow truth. SharePoint is an inter nal website that is a repository of all documentation, resources and links to the Josephine At Home policies, procedures and operational hyperlinks. This allows for all staff to be able to access the most 30 Ve r. (07 /2012) current Jo sephine in formation f rom any d evice ( mobile, laptop or de sktop). Josephine At H ome als o employs t he u se of Point C lick C are for clinical documentation. P oint C lick C are u tilizes C RM an d data analytics that can be fed to dashboards. This a llows for quick access to productivity metrics a nd detailed data sets that inform both management and clinical and non-c linical individual contributors. T raining to the metrics o ccurs during onboarding and will be updated frequently in multiple modes of c ommunications (monthly staff meetings, emails, on-d emand training and resources through the applications of Relias and Point Click Care, Skills Training and annual reviews). 4.If applicable, i n the case of construction, renovation, or expansion, capital cost reductions achieved by architectural planning and engineering methods and methods of building design and construction. Include an inventory of net and gross square feet for each service and estimated capital cost for each proposed service. Reference appropriate recognized space planning guidelines you have employed in your space allocation activities. Not ap plicable, the Josephine At Home pr oject has not required any construction costs 5.If applicable, i n the case of construction, renovation or expansion, an analysis of the capital and operating costs of alternative methods of energy consumption , including the rationale for choosing any method other than the least costly. For energy-related projects, document any efforts to obtain a grant under the National Energy Conservation Act. Not applicable, Josephine At Home will not have construction, renovation or expansion costs other than the low capital costs of what was outlined in Table 1. Alternative e nergy consumption is not a consideration for Josephine At Home due the office residing within an existing building of Josephine Caring Community.

OBJECTIVE ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................. 10 simione.com Driving Results 1 1. OBJECTIVE The objective of this engagement is to provide consulting and data analysis to inform the CON application process for Josephine Caring Community (Josephine at Home) , as well as expose gaps and opportunities in Snohomish and Island counties, WA. We organized this report to include the following for the home health service line : What we identified using Medicare claims , cost report data, and other publicly reported data: o Home health care utilization in Snohomish County, inclusive of Camano Island and Stanwood. o Market demographics o Competitive market share o Presumptive m arket need 2. HOME HEALTH CARE UT ILIZATION What We Identified Home health utilization in both counties is largely driven by hospitals and SNFs, although physicians have a greater contribution to utilization in Snohomish County. In Snohomish County and Camano Island , only one home health provider rated 5/5 stars on i ts patient survey rating summary - Alapha Home Health. EvergreenHealth Home Care in Snohomish County and Camano Island rated 4.5/5 starts on its rating for quality of patient care, while three others rated 4/5 for quality - Alapha, Assured, and Gentiva. At 155 years in existence, Providence Health & Services is the largest health care provider in Washington state, with more th an 35 hospitals, health and living facilities, 20,000 employees, and nonprofit status for provision of home health and hospice serv ices through its Snohomish County foundation. All other sources are diversified across referrals made to providers . Of note, clinics have a strong rate of referrals in Island County - meaning these patients were admitted upon the recommendation of a facil ity's clinic physician. simione.com Driving Results 2 simione.com Driving Results 3 simione.com Driving Results 4 simione.com Driving Results 5 simione.com Driving Results 6 simione.com Driving Results 7 3. MARKET DEMOGRAPHICS What We Identified Snohomish County has a population of more than 800,000 - a change of 15.3% over the past decade , higher than the state change of 13.2% for Washington . Adjacent Island County has grown at a lower rate and well below the state change , but still experienced a positive change in its population by more than 8% to 85,000 residents during the same period. Residents over 65 make up 14% of the population of Snohomish County; however, seniors represent one quarter of Island County's population. Household size is larger in Snohomish County, likely representing a younger, family -oriented population with nearly 300,000 households . Total employment represented 31% of the population in 2018. More than 20% of those households speak a language other than English i n the home. Medicare enrollment in Snohomish County represents 58% of the population 65 years and over. Island County's Medic are enrollment represents 81% of its population 65 year and over. With a small household size of 2.3 persons and 34,000 households in the county , and with home ownership and value above the state rate , total employment represented 15% of the population in 2018 , well below the state's employment rate of 37%. Snohomish County Island County simione.com Driving Results 8 4. COMPETITIVE MARKET SHARE What We Identifie d Based on Medicare reimbursement for home health care provided to patients who live in Snohomish County Two agencies provided 6 6% of the care to Snohomish County patients in 2019: Providence and Evergreen . Providence has increased their market share by 9% over the last four years, from 30% to 3 9%. Gentiva, in the third market position, lost 4% market shar e in 2019 after a 3% decrease in market share in 2017. The agencies in the fourth and fifth market positions also decreased market share in 2019. simione.com Driving Results 9 What We Identifie d Based on Medicare reimbursement for home health care provided to patients who live in Island County Two agencies provided 67% of the care to Island County patients in 2019: Eden Home Health and WhidbeyHealth. Eden has dramatically increased their market share over the last four years, from 9% in 2016 to 39% in 2019. WhidbeyHealth Home Health lost 5% market share in 2019. Note that WhidbeyHealth only provides care on Whidbey Island, not Cam ano, according to Home Health Compare service areas, while Eden services both islands. Providence H ospice and Home Care, in the third market position, increased market share 4% in 2019 each. Signature Home Health, in the fourth market positions decreased market share each of the last three years, from 20% in 2016 ( which put it in the second market position that year) to 11% in 2019. simione.com Driving Results 10 5. PRESUMPTIVE MARKET NEED What We Identifie d Discharge Referral Patterns and Trends for Snohomish County Hospitals Market -wide, inclusive of hospitals in both Snohomish and Island Counties, hospitals were about equally likely to refer patients to home health (20%) and to SNF (19%) in 2019. Home health referrals as a percent of total discharges increased by 3% in 2019. This pattern is not consistent at the hospital level --the highest volume hospital refers more patients to HH compared to SNF (22% and 17%), while the next three all refer a considerably higher volume of patients to SNF (21% -30%) compared to home health (10% -16%). The large percentage of patients discharged to home/self -care with no post -acute care represents an opportunity for an aggressive provider to increase home health utilization and likely reduce potential for rehospitalizations of these patients. Based on the data below, as well as the market share findings, there appears to be opportunity for a provider aggressively entering th ese counties to position itself as an alternative to the existing providers and can expect growth if a strategic, consistent appr oach to the market is supported and properly resourced both in sales and service.

These temporary changes will apply immediately across the entire U.S. healthcare system for the duration of the emergency declaration. The goals of these actions are to 1) expand the healthcare system workforce by removing barriers for physicians, nurses, and other clinicians to be readily hired from the community or from other states; 2) ensure that local hospitals and health systems have the capacity to handle a potential surge of COVID-19 patients through temporary expansion sites (also known as CMS Hospital Without Walls); 3) increase access to telehealth in Medicare to ensure patients have access to physicians and other clinicians while keeping patients safe at home; 4) expand in-place testing to allow for more testing at home or in community based settings; and 5) put Patients Over Paperwork to give temporary relief from many paperwork, reporting and audit requirements so providers, health care facilities, Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, and States can focus on providing needed care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries affected by COVID-19. Medicare Telehealth and Telecommunications Technology Home Health Agencie s (HHAs) can provide more services to beneficiaries using telecommunications technology within the 30-day period of care, so long as it's part of the patient's plan of care and does not replace needed in-person visits as ordered on the plan of care. We acknowledge that the use of such technology may result in changes to the frequency or types of in-persons visits outlined on existing or new plans of care. Telecommunications technology can include, for example: remote patient monitoring; telephone calls (audio only and TTY); and 2-way audio-video technology that allows for real-time interaction between the clinician and patient. However, only in-person visits can be reported on the home health claim. The required face-to-face encounter for home health can be conducted via telehealth (i.e., 2 -way audio-video telecommunications technology that allows for real-time interaction between the physician/allowed practitioner and the patient). Patients Over Paperwork Homebound Definition: A beneficiary is considered homebound when their physician advises them not to leave the home because of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis or if the patient has a condition that makes them more susceptible to contract 9/8/2020 1 COVID-19. As a result, if a beneficiary is homebound due to COVID-19 and needs skilled services, a n HHA can provide those services under the Medicare Home Health benefit. Detailed Information Sharing for Discharge Planning for Home Health Agencies . CMS is waiving the requirements of 42 CFR \u00a7484.58(a) to provide detailed information regarding discharge planning, to patients and their caregivers, or the patient's representative in selecting a post-acute care provider by using and sharing data that includes, but is not limited to, (another) home health agency (HHA), skilled nursing facility (SNF), inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), and long-term care hospital (LTCH) quality measures and resource use measures. This temporary waiver provides facilities the ability to expedite discharge and movement of residents among care settings. CMS is maintaining all other discharge planning requirements. Plans of Care and Certifying/Recertifying Patient Eligibility : In addition to a physician, section 3708 of the CARES Act allows a Medicare-eligible home health patient to be under the care of a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or a physician assistant who is working in accordance with State law . These physicians/practitioners can: (1) order home health services; (2) establish and periodically review a plan of care for home health services (e.g., sign the plan of care), (3) certify and re-certify that the patient is eligible for Medicare home health services. These changes, effective March 1, 2020, provide the flexibility needed for more timely initiation of services for home health patients, while allowing providers and patients to practice social distancing. Specifically, for Medicare, these changes are effective for Medicare claims with a \"claim through date\" on or after March 1, 2020. Clinical Records: In accordance with section 1135(b)(5) of the Act, CMS is extending the deadline for completion of the requirement at 42 CFR \u00a7484.110(e), which requires HHAs to provide a patient a copy of their medical record at no cost during the next visit or within four business days (when requested by the patient). Specifically, CMS will allow HHAs ten business days to provide a patient's clinical record, instead of four. Training and Assessment of Aides: CMS is waiving the requirement at 42 CFR \u00a7418.76(h)(2) for Hospice and 42 CFR \u00a7484.80(h)(1)(iii) for HHAs, which require a registered nurse, or in the case of an HHA a registered nurse or other appropriate skilled professional (physical therapist/occupational therapist, speech language pathologist) to make an annual onsite supervisory visit (direct observation) for each aide that provides services on behalf of the agency. In accordance with section 1135(b)(5) of the Act, we are postponing completion of these visits. All postponed onsite assessments must be completed by these professionals no later than 60 days after the expiration of the PHE. 12-hour annual in-service training requirement for home health aides : CMS is modifying the requirement at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7484.80(d) that home health agencies must assure that each home health aide receives 12 hours of in-service training in a 12-month period. In 9/8/2020 2 accordance with section 1135(b)(5) of the Act, we are postponing the deadline for completing this requirement throughout the COVID-19 PHE until the end of the first full quarter after the declaration of the PHE concludes. This will allow aides and the registered nurses (RNs) who teach in-service training to spend more time delivering direct patient care and additional time for staff to complete this requirement. Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) : CMS is modifying the requirement at 42 CFR \u00a7418.58 for Hospice and \u00a7484.65 for HHAs, which requires these providers to develop, implement, evaluate, and maintain an effective, ongoing, hospice/HHA-wide, data-driven QAPI program. Specifically, CMS is modifying the requirements at \u00a7418.58(a)-(d) and \u00a7484.65(a)-(d) to narrow the scope of the QAPI program to concentrate on infection control issues, while retaining the requirement that remaining activities should continue to focus on adverse events. This modification decreases burden associated with the development and maintenance of a broad-based QAPI program, allowing the providers to focus efforts on aspects of care delivery most closely associated with COVID-19 and tracking adverse events during the PHE. The requirement that HHAs and hospices maintain an effective, ongoing, agency-wide, data-driven quality assessment and performance improvement program will remain. Waive Onsite Visits for HHA Aide Supervision : CMS is waiving the requirements at 42 CFR \u00a7484.80(h), which require a nurse to conduct an onsite visit every two weeks. This would include waiving the requirements for a nurse or other professional to conduct an onsite visit every two weeks to evaluate if aides are providing care consistent with the ca re plan, as this may not be physically possible for a period of time. This waiver is also temporarily suspending the 2 -week aide supervision by a registered nurse for home health agencies requirement at \u00a7484.80(h)(1), but virtual supervision is encouraged during the period of the waiver. Reporting: CMS is providing relief to HHAs on the timeframes related to OASIS transmission through the following 1) extending the 5-day completion requirement for the comprehensive assessment to 30 days; and 2) waiving the 30-day OASIS submission requirement. Delayed submission is permitted during the PHE. We are now allowing 30 days for the completion of the comprehensive assessment. HHAs must submit OASIS data prior to submitting their final claim in order to receive Medicare payment. Home Health Quality Reporting Program : HHAs are exempted from the Home Health Quality Reporting Program reporting requirements. The time period covered by this exemption is October 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. HHAs that do not submit data for those quarters will not have their annual m arket basket percentage increase reduced by two percentage points. CMS is also delaying the compliance dates for collecting and reporting the Transfer of Health Information quality measures and certain standardized patient assessment data elements (SPADEs) adopted for the HH Quality Reporting 9/8/2020 3 Program. HHAs will be required to begin collecting the Transfer of Health Information quality measures and certain SPADEs on January 1st of the year that is at least one calendar year after the end of the public health emergency. Home Health Value Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model: CMS is implementing a policy to align HHVBP data submission requirements with any exceptions or extensions granted for purposes of the Home Health Quality Reporting Program during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a policy for granting exceptions to the New Measures data reporting requirements under the HHVBP Model during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic. Allow Occupational Therapists (OTs), Physical Therapists (PTs), and Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) to Perform Initial and Comprehens ive Assessment for all Patients: CMS is waiving the requirements in 42 CFR \u00a7 484.55(a)(2) and \u00a7 484.55(b)(3) that rehabilitation skilled professionals may only perform the initial and comprehensive assessment when only therapy services are ordered. This temporary blanket modification allows any rehabilitation professional (OT, PT, or SLP) to perform the initial and comprehensive assessment for all patients receiving therapy services as part of the plan of care, to the extent permitted under state law, regardless of whether or not the service establishes eligibility for the patient to be receiving home care. The existing regulations at \u00a7 484.55(a) and (b)(2) would continue to apply; rehabilitation skilled professionals would not be permitted to perform assessments in nursing only cases. We would continue to expect HHAs to match the appropriate discipline that performs the assessment to the needs of the patient to the greatest extent possible. Therapists must act within their state scope of practice laws when performing initial and comprehensive assessments, and access a registered nurse or other professional to complete sections of the assessment that are beyond their scope of practice. Expanding the category of therapists who may perform initial and comprehensive assessments provides HHAs with additional flexibility that may decrease patient wait times for the initiation of home health services. Requests for Anticipated Payments (RAPs): MACs can extend the auto-cancellation date of RAPs during emergencies. RAPs are a pre-payment for home health services. ** Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services: CMS is offering flexibilities for home health agencies in the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services. CMS is phasing in participation in the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Agencies (HHAs) in North Carolina and Florida, for a limited period of time, to help ease the transition during the current public health emergency. If Florida and North Carolina HHAs wish to participate, they may submit pre-claim review requests for billing periods beginning August 31, 2020. Florida and North Carolina providers who have already made a choice selection do not need to take any further action if they choose not to participate. CMS plans to reassess this phased-in approach in 60 days. In Illinois, Ohio, 9/8/2020 4 and Texas, claims submitted under Choice 1 without going through the pre-claim review process will not be subject to a 25% payment reduction until further notice, but will be subject to prepayment review. Cycle 2 in Illinois and Cycle 1 in Texas will end on September 30, 2020. Cycle 2 in Ohio will begin on August 31, 2020, as previously stated. Medicare appeals in Fee for Service, Medicare Advantage (MA) and Part D CMS is allowing Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) and Qualified Independent Contractor (QICs) in the FFS program 42 CFR 405.942 and 42 CFR 405.962 and MA and Part D plans, as well as the Part C and Part D Independent Review Entity (IREs), 42 CFR 562, 42 CFR 423.562, 42 CFR 422.582 and 42 CFR 423.582 to allow extensions to file an appeal; CMS is allowing MACs and QICs in the FFS program 42 CFR 405. 950 and 42 CFR 405.966 and the Part C and Part D IREs to waive requirements for timeliness for requests for additional information to adjudicate appeals; MA plans may extend the timeframe to adjudicate organization determinations and reconsiderations for medical items and services (but not Part B drugs) by up to 14 calendar days if: the enrollee requests the extension; the extension is justified and in the enrollee's interest due to the need for additional medical evidence from a noncontract provider that may change an MA organization's decision to deny an item or service; or, the extension is justified due to extraordinary, exigent, or other non-routine circumstances and is in the 422.568(b)(1)(i), \u00a7 CMS is and QICs in the FFS program 42 C.F.R 405.910 and MA and Part D plans, as well as the Part C and Part D IREs to process an appeal even with incomplete Appointment of Representation forms 42 CFR \u00a7 422.561, 42 CFR \u00a7 423.560. However, any communications will only be sent to the beneficiary; CMS is allowing MACs and QICs in the FFS program 42 CFR 405. 950 and 42 CFR 405.966 and MA and Part D plans, as well as the Part C and Part D IREs to process requests for appeal that don't meet the required elements using information that is available 42 CFR \u00a7 422.562, 42 CFR \u00a7 423.562. CMS is allowing MACs and QICs in the FFS program 42 CFR 405. 950 and 42 CFR 405.966 and MA and Part D plans, as well as the Part C and Part D IREs, 42 CFR 422.562, 42 CFR 423.562 to utilize all flexibilities available in the appeal process as if good cause requirements are satisfied. Accelerated/Advance Payments: In order to provide additional cash flow to healthcare providers and suppliers impacted by COVID-19, CMS expanded and streamlined the Accelerated and Advance Payments Program, which provided conditional partial payments to providers and suppliers to address disruptions in claims submission and/or claims processing subject to applicable safeguards for fraud, waste and abuse. Under 9/8/2020 5 this program, CMS made successful payment of over $100 billion to healthcare providers and suppliers. As of April 26, 2020, CMS is reevaluating all pending and new applications for the Accelerated Payment Program and has suspended the Advanc e Payment Program, in light of direct payments made available through the Department of Health & Human Services' (HHS) Provider Relief Fund. Distributions made through the Provider Relief Fund do not need to be repaid. For providers and suppliers who have received accelerated or advance payments related to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, CMS will not pursue recovery of these payments until 120 days after the date of payment issuance. Providers and suppliers with questions regarding the repayment of their accelerated or advance payment(s) should contact their appropriate Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC). Provider Enrollment: CMS has established toll-free hotlines for all providers as well as the following flexibilities for provider enrollment: o Waive certain screening requirements. o Postpone all revalidation actions. o Expedite any pending or new applications from providers. Cost Reporting CMS is delaying the filing deadline of certain cost report due dates due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We are currently authorizing delay for the following fiscal year end (FYE) dates. CMS will delay the filing deadline of FYE 10/31/2019 cost reports due by March 31, 2020 and FYE 11/30/2019 cost reports due by April 30, 2020. The extended cost report due dates for these October and November FYEs will be June 30, 2020. CMS will also delay the filing deadline of the FYE 12/31/2019 cost reports due by May 31, 2020. The revised extended cost report due date for FYE 12/31/2019 will be August 31, 2020. For the FYE 01/31/2020 cost report, the extended due date is August 31, 2020. For the FYE 02/29/2020 cost report, the extended due date is September 30, 2020. COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing If a patient is already receiving Medicare home health services, the home health nurse, during an otherwise covered visit, could obtain the sample to send to the laboratory for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Workforce Ordering Medicaid Home Health Services and Equipment: Medicaid home health regulations now allow non-physician practitioners to order medical equipment, supplies and appliances, home health nursing and aide services, and physical therapy, occupational therapy or speech pathology and audiology services, in accordance with state scope of practice laws. Waived onsite visits for both HHA Aide Supervision: CMS is waiving the requirements at 42 CFR 484.80(h), which require a nurse to conduct an onsite visit every two weeks. This 9/8/2020 6 would include waiving the requirements for a nurse or other professional to conduct an onsite visit every two weeks to evaluate if aides are providing care consistent with th e care plan, as this may not be physically possible for a period of time. This waiver is also temporarily suspending 2-week aide supervision requirement at 42 CFR \u00a7484.80(h)(1) by a registered nurse for home health agencies, but virtual supervision is encouraged during the period of the waiver. Allow Occupational Therapists (OTs) to Perform Initial and Comprehensive Assessmentfor all Patients: 42 CFR 484.55(a)(2) and 484.55(b)(3). CMS is waiving the requirement that OTs may only perform the initial and comprehensive assessment if occupationaltherapy is the service that establishes eligibility for the patient to be receiving homehealth care. This temporary blanket modification allows OTs to perform the initial andcomprehensive assessment for all patients receiving therapy services as part of the planof care, to the extent permitted under state law, regardless of whether occupationaltherapy is the service that establishes eligibility. The existing regulations at \u00a7 484.55(a)and (b)(2) would continue to apply that OTs and other therapists would not bepermitted to perform assessments in nursing only cases. We would continue to expectHHAs to match the appropriate discipline that performs the assessment to the needs ofthe patient to the greatest extent possible. Therapists must act within their state scopeof practice laws when performing initial and comprehensive assessments, and access aregistered nurse or other professional to complete sections of the assessment that arebeyond their scope of practice. Expanding the category of therapists who may performinitial and comprehensive assessments to include OTs provides HHAs with additionalflexibility that may decrease patient wait times for the initiation of home health services. Certification for Payment of Medicare Home Health Services: As required under section 3708 of the CARES Act, CMS is allowing nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists andphysician assistants to certify the need for home health services as defined under 42CFR \u00a7 424.507(b)(1) payment requirements for covered Part A or Part B home health services. Patients Over Paperwork \"Stark Law\" Waivers: The physician self-referral law (also known as the \"Stark Law\") prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain healthcare services payable byMedicare if the physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationshipwith the entity performing the service. There are statutory and regulatory exceptions,but in short, a physician cannot refer a patient to any entity with which he or she has afinancial relationship. On March 30, 2020, CMS issued blanket waivers of certainprovisions of the Stark Law regulations. These blanket waivers apply to financialrelationships and referrals that are related to the COVID-19 emergency. Theremuneration and referrals described in the blanket waivers must be solely related to 9/8/2020 7 COVID-19 Purposes, as defined in the blanket waiver document. Under the waivers, CMS will permit certain referrals and the submission of related claims that would otherwise violate the Stark Law. These flexibilities include: o Hospitals and other health care providers can pay above or below fair market value for the personal services of a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician), and parties may pay below fair market value to rent equipment or purchase items or services. For example, a physician practice may be willing to rent or sell needed equipment to a hospital at a price that is below what the practice could charge another party. Or, a hospital may provide space on hospital grounds at no charge to a physician who is willing to treat patients who seek care at the hospital but are not appropriate for emergency department or inpatient care. o Health care providers can support each other financially to ensure continuity of health care operations. For example, a physician owner of a hospital may make a personal loan to the hospital without charging interest at a fair market rate so that the hospital can make payroll or pay its vendors. o Hospitals can provide benefits to their medical staffs, such as multiple daily meals, laundry service to launder soiled personal clothing, or child care services while the physicians are at the hospital and engaging in activities that benefit the hospital and its patients. o Health care providers may offer certain items and services that are solely related to COVID-19 Purposes (as defined in the waivers), even when the provision of the items or services would exc eed the annual non-monetary compensation cap. For example, a home health agency may provide continuing medical education to physicians in the community on the latest care protocols for homebound patients with COVID-19, or a hospital may provide isolation shelter or meals to the family of a physician who was exposed to the novel coronavirus while working in the hospital's emergency department. o Physician-owned hospitals can temporarily increase the number of their licensed beds, operating rooms, and procedure rooms, even though such expansion would otherwise be prohibited under the Stark Law. For example, a physician-owned hospital may temporarily convert observation beds to inpatient beds to accommodate patient surge during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. o Some of the restrictions regarding when a group practice can furnish medically necessary designated health services (DHS) in a patient's home are loosened. For example, any physician in the group may order medically necessary DHS that is 9/8/2020 8 furnis hed to a patient by one of the group's technicians or nurses in the patient's home contemporaneously with a physician service that is furnished via telehealth by the physician who ordered the DHS. oGroup practices can furnish medically necessary MRIs, CT scans or clinicallaboratory services from locations like mobile vans in parking lots that thegroup practice rents on a part-time basis.

Is a doctor of medicine, osteopathy or podiatry legally authorized to practice medicine and surgery in the state of Washington; b.Is available at all times during operating hours; and c.Participates in the establishment and periodic review of a written plan of care d.Is a PECOS enrolled provider for traditional Medicare patients Services for a client receiving Skilled Nursing, Therapy or Home Health Aide services must follow a written Plan of Care established and periodically reviewed by a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, or podiatric medicine. The written Plan of Care shall be reviewed at least every 60 days by that physician or their designee 2.Skilled services and homebound status are considered to determine appropriateness for admission to HH. 3.HH services personnel and resources are adequate and suitable to provide services ordered bythe physician for the patient. 4.The patient and family are cooperative and willing to participate with HH services. 5.There must be a reasonable expectation that the patient's health will be benefited by care athome as distinguished from care in a hospital or extended care facility. 6.Equipment, supplies and pharmaceut ical products are available at the time of admission to meet the patient/client needs. 7.Patient's place of residence or surrounding area does not pose a safety hazard or security risk tostaff. 8.Patient resides within the defined service area for HH. If the referral has been accepted, and then it is determined that a person did not qualify for HH Services, the person and physician will be notified promptly. If JAH is unable to meet patient needs, a referral will be made for services as available elsewhere, up on physician approval. 2 JOSEPHINE AT HOME Referral Sources and Response Referrals Referrals are accepted by phone, fax, email and software referral systems. Patient insurance will be verified with the intent to receive an authorization prior to initiation of HH Services. Ong oing authorizations may be required. All patients who accept admission to HH shall be assessed within 48 hours of the receipt of the referral or as specified by the physician. The secondary service (any discipline beyond the admitting discipline) contact t o the patient will be made within 72 hours. The physician will be informed by phone call or written communication if the initial visit for any discipline is changed. Once it is determined that a patient meets the Admission Criteria, (should we add anything here about insurance, Charity Care or other forms of payment?) and is appropriate for HH, the admission to service will begin. Admission Process The referral is will be handled by the Intake Coordinator. The Admission Process ens ures that HH has the following information at time of referral/admission: 1.Attending physician name, address and telephone number 2.Patient's address 3.Patient's working contact number 4.Patient's admitting diagnosis 5.History and Physical as possible 6.Current orders for HH Services 7.Insurance information In determining the appropriate hour to make the home visit, such factors as physician's instructions, knowledge of patient needs, and geographic area will be given consideration. All admission visits will be preceded by a phone call to the patient to agree upon an appointed time. When multidisciplinary services are ordered at the initial referral the scheduler will schedule all disciplines. Non discrimination Policy Con sistent with the Josephine Caring Community's Mission and Values, it is the policy of Josephine At Home to not discriminate against, exclude or treat differently any individuals accessing any Josephine At Home Program or Activity on any basis prohibited by local, state or federal laws, including but not limited to on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, handicap, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or as those terms are defined under federal law and rules.

Policy Patients may be eligible for charity care at the time of admission to Josephine At Home or during the period when they receive home health services. Application of charity care is contingent upon the patient's cooperation with the application process, including timely submission of all information that Josephine At Home deems necessary or appropriate to enable it to make a charity care determination. Screening and application to Medicaid is required prior to charity care determination. Admitted patients can appeal charity care determinations according to the Patient Grievances policy. Patient who are eligible for charity care at the time of admission to Josephine At Home or during the period then they receive home health services, is based on household income and family size as outlined below. Income Level of 200% or less - 100% discount level Income Level of 201% to 300% - 75% discount level Income Level of 301% to 400% - 50% discount level Josephine At Home will refer to the annual National Federal Poverty Guideline to apply the above metrics Exhibit 11 Pro Forma BudgetPatients Age Patients Cohort 2021 2022 2023 0-64 407 488 526 65-79 54 66 72 80+ 20 25 27 65 and Over 74 91 99 Total 481 579 625 Patients by Cohort 2021 2022 2023 0-64 1 20 24 65-79 1 6 8 80+ - 2 3 65 and Over 1 8 11 Total 2 28 35 Visits 2021 2022 2023 0-64 - - - 65-79 - - - 80+ - - - 65 and Over - - - Total - - - Visits 2021 2022 2023 0-64 - - - 65-79 - - - 80+ 5 1 2 65 and Over 5 1 2 Total 5 1 2 Q#7 2021 2022 2023 401 431 MSW 470 582 481 12,252 2022 $ 2 00.00$ 2 00.00$ PT $ 105.84 $ 2 00.00$ 2 00.00$ OT $ 80.00 $ 1 50.00$ 1 50.00$ ST $ 75.00 50.00$ 1 50.00$ MSW 50.00$ 1 50.00$ HHA 25.00 19.72 18.17 42.77 $ 4 4.72 $ 4 3.17 $ 7 5.00 $ 7 5.00 $ 7 5.00 $ Q#C1 Staff FTE Contracted TOTAL - - 2.01 1.12 2.01 0.31 3.01 1.24 Total CHARGE (Nearest 2023 Current Island County Snohomish County Island County Snohomish County Admin 3.00 5.00 5.00 Medical Director DNS 1.00 1.00 1.00 Business/Clerical ADMIN.

Management 's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor 's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally acc epted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor 's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity 's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for t he purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity 's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant acco unting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 2 Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Josephine Caring Community as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operation s and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Other Matters Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying supplementary information on page 27 presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financia l state ments. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedur es applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial stateme nts as a whole.

Other donor -imposed restrictions are perpetual in nature, where the donor stipulates that resources be maintained in perpetuity. Donor -imposed restrictions are released when a restriction expires; that is, when the stipulated time has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for which the resource was restrict ed has been fulfilled, or both. These are reported as reclassifications between the applicable classes of net assets. Federal income tax - The Organization is exempt from fed eral income tax under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Exemption has also been given by Snohomish County (the County) from all personal property taxes. In addition, the County has granted exemption for real property associated with the nursing home , boarding home, and child care programs . Also, the Organization qualifies for the charitable contribution deduction under Section 170(b)(l)(A) and has been classified as an organization that is not a private foundation under Section 509(a)(2). The Organization accounts for uncertain tax positions whereby the effect of the uncertainty would be recorded if the outcome was considered probable and was reasonably estimable. As of December 31, 2019 , the Organization had not identified any uncertain tax positions requiring accrual or disclosure. Josephi ne Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 10 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Cash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with remaining maturity at the date of purchase of t hree months or less. Investments - The Organization records its investments in accordance with ASC 958, Not -for-Profit Entities. Under ASC 958 , investments in marketable securities with readily determinable fair values and all investments in debt securities are reported at their fair values in the balance sheet s. Unrealized gains and losses are included in the statement s of activities and change s in net assets (Note 1 0). Inventor y - Inventor y consist s mainly of dietary supplies, central supplies, food, and gift shop merchandise and is stated at the lower of cost ( first-in, first -out method ) or market . Accounts receivable - The Organization carries its accounts receivable at standard rates less an allowance for uncollectible accounts. On a periodic basis, the Organization evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts, based on a history of past wri te-offs and collections. The allowance is $41,500 and $192,636 at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively . The Organization can charge interest of 12% per annum on skilled nursing and boarding home private past due accounts . Other nursing home and boarding home late fees may be assessed according to the resident financial agreements in place during the year. Approximately $2,514 and $3,692 of child care accounts receivable and $266,173 and $205,802 of skilled nursing and boarding home accounts receivable are greater than 90 days at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively . Land, buildings , and equipment - Land, buildings , and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The Organization capitalizes fixed assets with a c ost greater than $ 750. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of significant assets sold or retired are removed from the property accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reported as an incre ase or decrease in net assets as explaine d in the revenue recognition section . Depreciation is provided on the straight -line method over the assets ' estimated useful lives, which , for land improvements , is 5 to 25 years, for buildings is 25 to 30 years, for building improvements is 10 to 26 years, for furniture and equipment is 3 to 20 years, and for vehicles is 4 to 10 years. The Organization, using its best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, reviews for impairmen t of long -lived assets when indicators of impairment are identified. The review addresses the estimated recoverability of the assets' carrying value, which is principally determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying tan gible assets. When the carrying value of an asset exceeds estimated recoverability, an asset impairment is recognized. No impairment losses were present for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 11 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policie s (continued) Endowments - The Organization has interpreted the Washington Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor -restricted endowment fun ds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the Organization classifies as with donor restrictions net assets (1) the original value of gifts donated to the endowment, (2) the original value of subsequent gift s to the endowment, and (3) accumulations to the endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The Organization has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowm ent assets include those assets of donor -restricted funds that the Organization must hold in perpetuity or for a donor -specified period, an accumulation of earnings on the fund in accordance with the endowment fund investment policy, and board -designated f unds (if any). Under this policy, as approved by the board of directors, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results while assuming a low level of investment risk. The Organizati on expects its endowment funds, over time, to provide a consistent rate of return. Actual returns in any given year may vary. The Organization has a policy that allows spending of annual interest earned on the corpus of the endowment fund. The amount of interest earnings to be released annually for di stribution is specified by the b oard as soon as equitably possible after fiscal year -end. The interest funds are spent as authorized by the b oard on programs or capital expenditures to benefit the Organization in accordance with the endowment policy. See Note 12 for endowment investment information. Revenue recognition - On January 1, 2019, the Organization adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606 ) applying the modified retrospective method. There was no cumulative effect on the opening balance of accumulated deficit as a result of adopting the standard as of January 1, 2019. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 , are presented under ASC 606, while comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Resident Care (Nursing Home and Boarding Home) Revenue - Resident care revenue is reported at the amount that reflects the consideration the Organization expects to receive in exchange for the services provided. These amounts are due from residents or third -party payors and include variable consideration for retroactive adjustments, if any, under reimbu rsement programs. Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided. Resident care revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Under the Organization's senior living residency agreements, the Organizati on provides senior living services to residents for a stated daily or monthly fee. The Organization recognizes revenue for skilled nursing residency, assistance w ith activities of daily living, healthcare, and personalized health services in accordance wit h the provisions of ASC 606 . The Organization has determined that the senior living services included under the daily or monthly fee have the same timing and pattern of transfer and are a series of distinct services that are considered one performance obligation which is satisfied over time. Josephi ne Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 12 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Child Care Revenue - The Organization provides child care services to individuals at standard rates . The Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program is a state -funded kindergarten p reparedness program for limited income four -year-olds provided by a grant through the Snohomish County Hum an Services Department. During 201 9, the grant was renewed and expires on June 30, 20 20. The Organization has determined that the child care services included under the daily or monthly fee have the same timing and pattern of transfer and are a series of distinct services that are considered one performance obligation which is satisfied over time. The Organization determines the transaction price based on level of care in accordance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) guidelines and c riteria and provider contracts, reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third -party. The Organization determines its estimates of contractual adjustments based on contractual agreements and historical experience. Agreements with third -party payors p rovide for payments at amounts less than established charges. A summary of the payment arrangements with major third -party payors follows: Medicare - Certain health care services are paid at prospectively determined rates per level of care based on clinic al, diagnostic or other factors. Certain services are paid based on a cost - reimbursement methodologies subject to certain limits. Services are paid based upon established fee schedules. Medicaid - The Organization's reimbursement methodology is determined based on prospective rates similar to the Medicare methodology. Medicaid rates are facility -specific. Rates are determined based on services provided, occupancy levels, the resource needs of individual residents , as well as a quality incentive component . Certain services are paid based on a cost -reimbursement methodologies subject to certain limits. Services are paid based upon established fee schedules. Private - Generally, patients who are covered by third -party payors are responsible for related deduc tibles and coinsurance, which vary in amount. The Organization estimates the transaction price for patients with deductibles and coinsurance based on historical experience and current market conditions. The initial estimate of the transaction price is dete rmined by reducing the standard charge by any contractual adjustments determined on a resident by resident basis. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to health services revenue in the period of the change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the residents' ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense. Third -party payors - Payment agreements with certain commercial insurance carriers, health maintena nce organizations and preferred provider organizations provide for payment using prospectively determined rates per discharge, discounts from established charges, and prospectively determined daily rates.

In accordance with ASC 958 , contributions, including unconditional promises to give, are recorded in the period made. All contributions are available for unrestricted use unless specifically restricted by the donor. Conditional promises to give are recognized when the conditions on which they depend are substantially met. Unconditional promises to give due in the next ye ar are recorded at their net realizable value. Unconditional promises to give due in subsequent years are reported at the present value of their net realizable value, using risk -free interest rates applicable to the years in which the promises are to be received. During 2019 , more than 8 0 volunteers contributed significant amounts of time and effort in assisting to carry out the programs and activities of the Organization. The time contributed by volunteers is not reflected in the financial statements. Recognition of donor -restricted contributions - Support that is restricted by the donor is reported as an increase in net assets without donor restriction s if the restriction expires in the reporting period in which the support is recognized. All other donor -restricted support is reported as an increase in net assets with donor restriction s, depending on the nature of the restriction. When a restriction expires, the donor restriction s net assets are reclassified to without donor restriction s net assets. Loan issuance fees - Loan issuance fees are amortized on the straight -line basis over the term of the debt. Straight -line calculation of loan fees is not significantly dif ferent than the effective interest method. Amortization included in interest expense was $15,393 and $18,24 5 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively . Accumulated amortization was $173,907 and $158,514 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Use of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amoun ts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Josephi ne Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 14 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Performance indicator - Excess revenues over expenses as reflected in the accompanying statements of activities is a pe rformance indicator. E xcess revenues over expenses include changes in net assets without donor restrictions other than net unrealized losses (gains) on investments. Expense allocation - Directly identifiable expenses are charged to program, fund raising , and general and administrative expenses . Expenses relating to more than one function are charged to the function based on an estimate of utilization , square footage , or revenue on each function . General and administrative expenses include those expenses that are not directly identifiable with any specific function but to provide for the overall support of the Organization . Recent accounting p ronouncements - In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016 -02 (ASU 2016 -02), Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016 -02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability in the balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases, with terms of more than twelve months. The new guidance will be effective for nonpublic company fiscal years beginn ing on or after December 15, 2020 , with early adoption permitted. The amendment must be applied on a modified retrospective basis. The Organization is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on the financial statements. Subsequent events - Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are available to be issued. The Organization recognizes in the financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide addit ional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet s, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing the financial statements. The Organization 's financial statements do not recognize subsequent events that provide e vidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet s but arose after the balance sheet date and before financial stateme nts are available to be issued. The Organization evaluated subsequent events through April 15, 2020 , which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued , for events requiring recording or disclosure in the financial stateme nts for the year ended December 31, 2019 . On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID -19, th e disease caused by the novel coronavirus, a pandemic. Management is closely monitoring the evolution of this pandemic, including how it may affect the economy and the general population. Management has not yet determined the financial impact of these even ts. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 15 Note 3 - Liquidity and Availability The Organization regularly monitors liquidity required to meet its operating needs, liabilities, and other obligations as they become due. The Organization is substantially supported by a contract with the Department of Social and Health Services in the state of Washington for Medicaid reimbursement and the federal government for Medicare reimbursement . The majority of the financial assets recorded by t he Organization are used to support the skilled nursing facility, boarding home and a child care program in Snohomish County and surrounding communities in the northern Puget Sound region. In addition to financial assets available to meet general expenditures over the next twelve months, the Organization opera tes with a balanced budget and anticipates collecting sufficient revenue to cover general expenditures. The Organization has $ 12,535,905 and $9,595,688 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of financial assets available within one year of th e statement of financial position date to meet cash needs for general expenditure consisting of cash and cash equivalents and investments of $10,970,631 and $8,076,153 and accounts receivable of $1,565,274 $1,519,535 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively . None of these financial assets are subject to donor or other contractual restrictions that make them unavailable for general expenditure within one year of the statement of financial position date.

Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 17 Note 5 - Inventory Inventory consists of the following at December 31 : 2019 2018 Central supplies 46,249 $ 52,807 $ Food 18,499 19,037 Dietary Gift shop 2,008 1,892 69,882 $ 75,617 $ Note 6 - Assets at Fair Value ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , provides the framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the high est priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are descri bed as follows: Basis of fair value measurement Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Organization has the ability to access. Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments without quoted market prices, but for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and sign ificant to the fair value measurement. The asset or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2019 . Registered investment c ompanies ( mutual funds) - Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of shares held in the fund at year -end using prices quoted by the relevant pricing agent. Josephi ne Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 18 Note 6 - Assets at Fair Value (continued) Pooled investment accounts - The poo led investment accounts are a beneficial interest in Community Foundation of Snohomish County (CFSC) are valued using the net asset value practical expedient (NAV practical expedient) of the common account as reported by the common account managers. The NA V practical expedient is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the common account, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of units outstanding. These investments do not allow the Organization to submit redemption requests above the total spendable balance of $36,079 and $8,740 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as the investments are restricted . Other investments - The Organization accounts for its investment in life settlement contracts in accordance with the investment method, using the contract value of the policy. Cash disbursements related to this investment are classified in the cash flow statement under operating and non -cash activity as it is used as deferred compensation. The insurance policy is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy . Common stock - Common stock is valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual se curities are traded . Common stock is generally classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The following table discloses, by level, the fair value hierarchy of the Organization's investments and assets limited to use at fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively: Fair Value Measurement at December 31, 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Operating investments Registered investment companies 3,937,291$ - $ - $ 3,937,291$ Common stock 2,779,581 - - 2,779,581 Other investments - 413,858 - 413,858 6,716,872$ 413,858$ - $ 7,130,730 Endowment investments Pooled investment accounts 611,748 7,742,478$ Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 19 Note 6 - Assets at Fair Value (continued) Fair Value Measurement at December 31, 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Operating investments Registered investment companies 3,428,737$ - $ - $ 3,428,737$ Common stock 2,413,649 - - 2,413,649 Other investments - 246,193 - 246,193 5,842,386$ 246,193$ - $ 6,088,579 Endowment investments Pooled investment accounts 521,680 6,610,259$ Note 7 - Land, Buildings , and Equipment The following represents the amounts of land, building s, equipment, vehicles , and construction in progress for the Organization at December 31 : 2019 2018 Buildings and improvements 16,144,595$ 15,984,041$ Furniture and equipment 2,228,646 2,139,565 expense is $711,975 and $800,823 for the year s ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively .

Approximately 33% and 41% of accounts receivable in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, was derived from the federal government. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Organization to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, investments, and ac counts receivable. At times, cash deposits, including amounts held as investments, exceed the federally insured limits of the financial institution and expose the Organization to credit risk. Note 14 - Defined Contribution Plan The Organization s ponsors a defined contribution p lan, in which employees who have completed one year of service and ha ve attained age 21 a re eligible to receive safe harbor contributions using the following formula: 100% of each p articipant 's elec tive deferrals up to 3% of the p articipant 's compensation (excluding grossed up bonuses and length of service awards). Plus 50% of each p articipant 's elective deferrals in excess of 3% but not in excess of 5% of the participant 's compensation (excluding grossed up bonuses and length of service awards). The Organization has accrued $244,186 and $251,851 of employer contributions to be made to the Plan for the year s ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively . Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 25 Note 15 - Cost Reports The Organization is contractually required to prepare an annual Medicaid cost report . The 2019 report has not been filed and is due March 31, 2020, and is subject to audit and possible adjustment. The Organization is also contractually required to prepare an annual Medicare cost report. The 2019 report is due May 31, 20 20, and is subject to audit and possible adjustment. Note 16 - Medical Malpractice Insurance The Organization maintains medical malpractice insurance coverage through \"claims made \" type policies for the benefit of its clinical employees and the Organization . Should the \"claims made \" policies not be renewed or replaced with equivalent insurance, claims related to occurrences during their terms, but reported subsequent to their termination, may be uninsured. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that a health care facility disclose the estimated costs of malpra ctice claims in the period of the incident of malpractice, if it is reasonably possible that liabilities may be incurred and losses can be reasonably estimated. A health care facility shall also recognize an insurance receivable at the same time that it re cognizes the liability. The Company has a claim outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The range of the liability as a result of this claim is not determinable although it is reasonably certain the claim will not exceed $150,000, which is fully covere d by insurance. Therefore, a provision for the settlement of this matter has been included in these financial statements as of December 31, 2019 , for $150,000. Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Organization is a party to claims and legal actions by residents, providers, employees , and others. After consulting with legal counsel, the Organization 's management is of the opinion that any liability that may ultimately be incurred as a result of claims or legal a ctions will not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Organization . Industry regulations - The health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditations, government health care program participation requirements, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government activity continues with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse statutes and regulati ons by health care providers. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in expulsion from government health care programs together with the imposition of significant fines and penalties, as well as significant repayments for patient services pr eviously billed. Management believes that the Organization is in compliance with fraud and abuse regulations , as well as other applicable government laws and regulations. Although no regulatory inquir ies have been made, compliance with such laws and regula tions can be subject to future government review and interpretation , as well as regulatory actions known or unasserted at this time. Josephi ne Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 26 Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations - ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations , requires management to recognize the fair value of a liability related to environmental matters. Management cannot estimate the impact of this standard on the balance sheets for the Organization .

Management 's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these fi nancial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial sta tements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor 's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing st andards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor 's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whethe r due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity 's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circums tances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity 's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonablenes s of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 2 Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Josephine Caring Community as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Matters Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying supplementary information on pages 25 through 28 presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financia l statements. Such information is the responsibilit y of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole. Emphasis of Matter As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, as of December 31, 2018, Josephine Caring Community adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016 -14, Presentation of Financial Statements for Not -for-Profit Entities. The update addresses the complexity an d understandability of net asset classification, information about liquidity and availability of resources, and other support information, and direction for consistency about information provided on investment return. The adoption of the standard resulted in additional footnote disclosures and changes to the disclosures related to net assets.

Corporate membership is composed of 18 local congregations. Members of the Organization 's corporation are entitled to elect the board of directors and approve certain actions of the board of directors. The Organization operates a 160 -bed skilled nursing facility, a 57-unit boarding home licensed for 6 5 residents, and a child care prog ram licensed for a capacity of 111 children in Stanwood, Washington. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of accounting - The Organization maintains its financial records using the accrual basis of accounting, whereby revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when an obligation is incurred. Basis of presentation - The Organization presents its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP ), as codified by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The Organization has im plemented Accounting Standards Codifications (ASC) 958, Not-for-Profit Entities . Under ASC 958, the Organization reports information regarding its financial position and activities according to two classes of net assets: without donor restrictions and with donor restrictions. Net assets without donor restrictions - Net assets available for use in general operations and not subject to donor restrictions. Net assets with donor restrictions - Net assets subject to donor -imposed restrictions. Some donor - imposed restrictions are temporary in nature, such as those that will be met by the passage of time or other events specified by the donor. Other donor -imposed restrictions are perpetual in nature, where the donor stipulates that resources be maintai ned in perpetuity. Donor -imposed restrictions are released when a restriction expires; that is, when the stipulated time has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for which the resource was restrict ed has been fulfilled, or both. These are reported as recla ssifications between the applicable classes of net assets. In accordance with ASC 958, net assets at December 31, 2017 , have been reclassified as follows: Without Donor With Donor Restrictions Restrictions Unrestricted 14,748,335$ - $ Temporarily restricted - 136,784 Permanently restricted - 448,891 14,748,335$ 585,675 $ Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 8 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Federal income tax - The Organization is exempt from federal in come tax under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Exemption has also been given by Snohomish County (the County) from all personal property taxes. In addition, the County has granted exemption for real property associated with the nursing hom e, boarding home, and child care programs . Also, the Organization qualifies for the charitable contribution deduction under Section 170(b)(l)(A) and has been classified as an organization that is not a private foundation under Section 509(a)(2). The Organization accounts for uncertain tax positions whereby the effect of the uncertainty would be recorded if the outcome was considered probable and was reasonably estimable. As of December 31, 2018, the Organization had not identified any uncertain ta x positions requiring accrual or disclosure. Cash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with remaining maturity at the date of pu rchase of three months or less. Investments - The Organization records its in vestments in accordance with ASC 958, Not -for-Profit Entities. Under ASC 958 , investments in marketable securities with readily determinable fair values and all investments in debt securities are reported at their fair values in the balance sheet s. Unrealized gains and losses are included in the statement s of activities and changes in net assets (Note 12 ). Inventor y - Inventor y consist s mainly of dietary supplies, central supplies, food, and gift shop merchandise and is stated at the lower of cost ( first-in, first -out method ) or market . Accounts receivable - The Organization carries its accounts receivable at standard rates less an allowance for uncollectible accounts. On a periodic basis, the Organization evaluates its accounts receivable and estab lishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts, based on a history of past write -offs and collections. The allowance is $192,636 and $93,246 at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively . The Organization can charge interest of 12% per annum on skilled nursing and boarding home private past due accounts . Other nursing home and boarding home late fees may be assessed according to the resident financial agreements in place during the year. Approximately $3,692 and $3,065 of child care accounts receivabl e and $205,802 and $172,407 of skilled nursing and boarding home accounts receivable are greater than 90 days at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively . Land, buildings , and equipment - Land, buildings , and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The Organization capitalizes fixed assets with a cost greater than $ 750. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of significant assets sold or r etired are removed from the property accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reported as an increase or decrease in net assets as explaine d in the revenue recognition section . Depreciation is provided on the straight -line method over the assets ' estim ated useful lives, which , for land improvements , is 5 to 25 years, for buildings is 25 to 30 years, for building improvements is 10 to 26 years, for furniture and equipment is 3 to 20 years, and for vehicles is 4 to 10 years. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 9 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) During 2013, t he Organization entered into a capital lease for equipment. Total assets under capital lease were approximately $ 147,187 with accumulated amortization of $147,187 and $122,656 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively . The Organization, using its best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, reviews for impairment of long -lived assets when indicators of impairment are identified. The review addresses the estimated recoverability of the a ssets' carrying value, which is principally determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying tangible assets. When the carrying value of an asset exceeds estimated recoverability, an asset impairment is recognized. No impairment losses were present for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Endowments - The Organization has interpreted the Washington Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor -restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpre tation, the Organization classifies as with donor restrictions net assets (1) the original value of gifts donated to the endowment, (2) the original value of subsequent gifts to the endowment, and (3) accumulations to the endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The Organization has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to program s supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor -restricted funds that the Organization must hold in perpetuity or for a donor -specified period, an accumulat ion of earnings on the fund in accordance with the endowment fund investment policy, and board -designated funds (if any). Under this policy, as approved by the board of directors, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce re sults that exceed the price and yield results while assuming a low level of investment risk. The Organization expects its endowment funds, over time, to provide a consistent rate of return. Actual returns in any given year may vary. The Organization has a policy that allows spending of annual interest earned on the corpus of the endowment fund. The amount of interest earnings to be released annually for di stribution is specified by the b oard as soon as equitably possible after fiscal year -end. The interest funds are spent as authorized by the b oard on programs or capital expenditures to benefit the Organization in accordance with the endowment policy. See Note 12 for endowment investment information. Revenue recognition - Revenues are reported as increases in net assets without donor restrictions unless use of the related assets are limited by donor -imposed restrictions. Expenses are reported as decreases in net assets without donor restrictions . Gains and losses on investments and other assets or liabilities are reported as increases or decreases in net assets without donor restrictions unless their use is restricted by explicit donor stipulation or by law. Expirations of with donor restrictions net assets are reported as transfers between the appl icable classes of net assets. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 10 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) The Organization is reimbursed for services provided to qualifying residents of the nursing and boarding homes under contracts and is reimbursed at rates that may be different from its standard charge. Unearned revenue at year -end consists of prepaid room and board fee payments from individuals for th e month following year -end. The Organization provides child care services to individuals at standard rates . The Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program is a state -funded kindergarten p reparedness program for limited - income four -year-olds provided by a grant through the Snohomish County Human Services Department. During 201 8, the grant was renewed and expires on June 30, 20 19. Contributions - The Organization records contributions according to ASC 958, Not-for-Profit Entities . In accordance with ASC 958 , contributions, including unconditional promises to give, are recorded in the period made. All contr ibutions are available for unrestricted use unless specifically restricted by the donor. Conditional promises to give are recognized when the conditions on which they depend are substantially met. Unconditional promises to give due in the next year are rec orded at their net realizable value. Unconditional promises to give due in subsequent years are reported at the present value of their net realizable value, using risk -free interest rates applicable to the years in which the promises are to be received. During 201 8, more than 8 0 volunteers contributed significant amounts of time and effort in assisting to carry out the programs and activities of the Organization. The time contributed by volunteers is not reflected in the financial statements. Recogniti on of donor -restricted contributions - Support that is restricted by the donor is reported as an increase in net assets without donor restriction s if the restriction expires in the reporting period in which the support is recognized. All other donor -restri cted support is reported as an increase in net assets with donor restriction s, depending on the nature of the restriction. When a restriction expires, with donor restriction s net assets are reclassified to without donor restriction s net assets. Land held for future development - Land , and costs attributable to the development activities of the land, which are held for future development where no significant de velopment has been undertaken are stated at cost less impairment costs, if any. As of Decembe r 31, 2018, Management does not believe this land has been impaired. Land held for sale - Land which is held for sale is stated at cost less impairment costs, if any. As of December 31, 2018, Management does not believe this land has been impaired. Loan issuance fees - Loan issuance fees are amortized on the straight -line basis over the term of the debt. Straight -line calculation of loan fees is not significantly different than the effective interest method. Amortization included in interest expense was $18,24 5 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Accumulated amortization was $158,514 and $140,269 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 11 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Use of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Performance indicator - Changes in excess revenues over expenses as reflected in the accompanying state ments of activities is a performance indicator. Changes in excess revenues over expenses include changes in net assets without donor restrictions other than net realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments. Expense allocation - Directly identifia ble expenses are charged to program, fund raising , and general and administrative expenses (Note 1 6). Expenses relating to more than one function are charged to the function based on an estimate of utilization , square footage , or revenue on each function . General and administrative expenses include those expenses that are not directly identifiable with any specific function but to provide for the overall support of the Organization . Change in a ccounting principle - In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016 -14, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958): Presentation of Financial Statements of Not -for-Profit Entities , which provided guidance related to the pr esentation and disclosure requirements for not -for profit entities. The guidance is intended to provide more relevant information about an entity's resources (and the changes in those resources) to donors, grantors, creditors, and other users. Changes in q ualitative and quantitative requirements as a result of the standards update are included in the following areas: net asset classes, investment return, expenses, liquidity and availability of resources, and prese ntation of operating cash flows . The require ments of this standard are to be applied retrospectively, with the exception of the analysis of expenses by both natural classification and functional classification, and disclosures about liquidity and availability of resources. The Organization has imple mented this standard for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Recent accounting p ronouncements - In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016 -02 (ASU 2016 -02), Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016 -02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability in the balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases, with terms of more than twelve months. The new guidance will be effective for nonpublic company fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The amendment must be applied on a modified retrospective basis. In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers, which provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model to apply in determining how and when to recognize revenue. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. When applying the new revenue model to contracts with customers, the guidance requires five steps to be applied, which include: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, 2) identify the pe rformance obligations in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract , and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 12 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) The guidance also requires both quantitative and qualitative disclosures, which are more comprehensive than existing revenue standards. The disclosures are intended to enable financial statement users t o understand the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flow. For nonpublic entities the new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The amendment must be a pplied on a modified retrospective basis. The Organization is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these standards on the financial statements. Subsequent events - Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sh eet date but before financial statements are available to be issued. The Organization recognizes in the financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet s, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing the financial statem ents. The Organization 's financial statements do not recognize subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet s but arose after the balance sheet date and before financial stateme nts are availabl e to be issued. The Organization did not have any subsequent events through March 26, 2019 , which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued , for events requiring recording or disclosure in the financial stateme nts for the year ended December 31, 2018. Reclassification - Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior financial statements to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on previously reported net income. Note 3 - Liquidity and Availability The Organization regularly monitors liquidity required to meet its operating needs, liabilities, and other obligations as they become due. The Organization is substantially supported by a contract with the Department of Soci al and Health Services in the state of Washington for Medicaid reimbursement and the federal government for Medicare reimbursement . The majority of the financial assets recorded by t he Organization are used to support the skilled nursing facility, boarding home and a child care program in Snohomish County and surrounding communities in the northern Puget Sound region. In addition to financial assets available to meet general expenditures over the next twelve months, the Organization operates with a balanced budget and anticipates collecting sufficient revenue to cover general expenditures. The Organization has $ 9,595 ,688 of financial assets available within one year of the statement of financial position date to meet cash needs for general expe nditure consisting of cash and cash equivalents and investments of $8,076,153 and accounts receivable of $1,519,535 . None of these financial assets are subject to donor or other contractual restrictions that make them unavailable for general expendit ure within one year of the statement of financial position date.

Nonqualified deferred compensation plan - The Organization adopted a nonqualified deferred compensation plan in 2013 for a certain highly paid employee. This deferred compensation arrangement is unfunded, unsecured , and subject to a vesting schedule th at begins when the employee reaches 62 years of age. The Plan allows for both an elective deferral and an employer deferral. Benefits are reported on the employee's W -2 and subject to FICA tax as vesting occurs. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 14 Note 4 - Assets Restricted for Use (contin ued) The Participant's entire accrued benefit is subject to the following vesting schedule: Year Age Vesting % 2024 62 20% 80% 2028 66 100% Plan assets are included in assets restricted for long term use on the balance sheet .

That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the hi ghest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are desc ribed as follows: Basis of fair value measurement Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Organization has the ability to access. Level 2 - Quoted prices i n markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments without quoted market prices, but for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and si gnificant to the fair value measurement. The asset or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2018 . Registered investment c ompanies ( mutual funds) - Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of shares held in the fund at year -end using prices quoted by the relevant pricing agent. Pooled investment accounts - The pooled investment accounts are a beneficial in terest in Community Foundation of Snohomish County (CFSC) are valued using the net asset value practical expedient (NAV practical expedient) of the common account as reported by the common account managers. The NAV practical expedient is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the common account, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of units outstanding. These investments do not allow the Organization to submit redemption requests. Other investments - The Organization acc ounts for its investment in life settlement contracts in accordance with the investment method, using the contract value of the policy. Cash disbursements related to this investment are classified in the cash flow statement under operating and non -cash act ivity as it is used as deferred compensation. The insurance policy is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy . Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 16 Note 6 - Assets at Fair Value (continued) Common stock - Common stock is valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded . Common stock is generally classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 24 Note 18 - Medical Malpractice Insurance The Organization maintains medical malpractice insurance coverage through \"claims made \" type policies for the benefit of its clinical employees and the Organization . Should the \"claims made \" policies not be renewed or replaced with equivalent insurance, claims related to occurrences during their terms, but reported subsequent to their termination, may be uninsured. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that a health care facility disclose the estimated costs of malpractice claims in the period of the incident of malpractice, if it is reasonably possible that liabilities may be incurred and losses can be reasonably estimated. A health care facility shall also recognize an insurance receivable at the same time that it recognizes the liability. Management is unable to reasonably estimate the range of future costs, if any, of unasserted medical malpractice claims arising from incidents in current and prior periods. Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Organization is a party to claims and legal actions by residents, providers, employees , and others. After consulting with legal counsel, the Organization 's management is of the opinion that any liability that may ult imately be incurred as a result of claims or legal actions will not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Organization . Industry regulations - The health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditations, government health care program participation requirements, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government activity continues with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse statutes and regulati ons by health care providers. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in expulsion from government health care programs together with the imposition of significant fines and penalties, as well as significant repayments for patient services pr eviously billed. Management believes that the Organization is in compliance with fraud and abuse regulations , as well as other applicable government laws and regulations. Although no regulatory inquir ies have been made, compliance with such laws and regula tions can be subject to future government review and interpretation , as well as regulatory actions known or unasserted at this time. Accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations - ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations , require s management to recognize the fair value of a liability related to environmental matters. Management cannot estimate the impact of this standard on the balance sheets for the Organization .

Management 's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor 's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor 's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity 's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity 's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 2 Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Josephine Caring Community as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Matters Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying supplementary information on pages 24 through 27 is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole.

Corporate membership is composed of 18 local congregations. Members of the Organization' s corporation are entitled to elect the board of directors and approve certain actions of the board of directors. The Organization operates a 160-b ed skilled nursing facility, a 57- unit boarding home licensed for 65 residents, and a child care program licensed for a capacity of 111 children in Stanwood, Washington. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of accounting - The Organization maintains its financial records using the accrual basis of accounting, whereby revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when an obligation is incurred. Basis of presentation - The Organization presents its financial statements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC) 958, Not-for-Profit Entities . Under ASC 958, the Organization is required to report information regarding its financial position and activities according to three classes of net assets: unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets. Unrestricted net assets - Unrestricted net assets are funds controlled and designated by the board of directors that include the general, operating, and equipment accounts . Temporarily restricted net assets - Temporarily restricted net assets are assets with donor -imposed restrictions that allow the use of the assets as specified or by the passage of time . (Note 10) Permanently restricted net assets - Permanently restricted net assets are controlled by law or donor -imposed restrictions stating the resources be maintained permanently. (Note 10) Federal income tax - The Organization is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Exemption has also been given by Snohomish County (the \"County \") from all personal property taxes. In addition, the County has granted exemption for real property associated with the nursing home, boarding home, and child care programs . Also, the Organization qualifies for the charitable contribution deduction under Section 170(b)(l)(A) and has been classified as an organization that is not a private foundation under Section 509(a)(2). The Organization accounts for uncertain tax positions whereby the effect of the uncertainty would be recorded if the outcome was considered probable and was reasonably estimable. As of December 31, 2017 , the Organization had not identified any uncertain tax positions requiring accrual or disclosure. Cash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 8 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Investments - The Organization records its investments in accordance with ASC 958, Not -for-Profit Entities. Under ASC 958, investments in marketable securities with readily determinable fair values and all investments in debt securities are reported at their fair values in the balance sheet s. Unrealized gains and losses are included in the statement s of activities and changes in net assets (Note 5) . Inventor y - Inventor y consist s mainly of dietary supplies, central supplies, food, and gift shop merchandise and is stated at the lower of cost ( first-in, first -out method) or market . Accounts receivable - The Organization carries its accounts receivable at standard rates less an allowance for uncollectible accounts. On a periodic basis, the Organization evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts, based on a history of past write- offs and collections. The allowance is $93,246 and $80,930 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively . The Organization can charge interest of 12% per annum on skilled nursing and boarding home private past due accounts . Other nursing home and boarding home late fees may be assessed according to the resident financial agreements in place during the year. Approximately $3,065 and $3,017 of child care accounts receivable and $172,407 and $93,660 of skilled nursing and boarding home accounts receivable are greater than 90 days at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively . Land, buildings , and equipment - Land, buildings , and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The Organization capitalizes fixed assets with a cost greater than $75 0. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of significant assets sold or retired are removed from the property accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reported as an increase or decrease in net assets as explained in the revenue recognition section. Depreciation is provided on the straight -line method over the assets ' estim ated useful lives, which, for land improvements , is 5 to 25 years, for buildings is 25 to 30 years, for building improvements is 10 to 26 years, for furniture and equipment is 3 to 20 years, and for vehicles is 4 to 10 years. During 2013, the Organization entered into a capital lease for equipment. Total assets under capital lease were approximately $147,187 with accumulated amortization of $122,656 and $93,218 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively . The Organization, using its best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, reviews for impairment of long- lived assets when indicators of impairment are identified. The review addresses the estimated recoverability of the assets' carrying value, which is principally determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying tangible assets. When the carrying value of an asset exceeds estimated recoverability, an asset impairment is recognized. No impairment losses were present for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 9 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Endowments - The Organization has interpreted the Washington Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor -restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the Organization classifies as permanently restricted net assets (1) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (2) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment, and (3) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The remaining portion of the donor -restricted endowment fund that is not classified in permanently restricted net assets is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the board of directors in accordance with the endowment spending policy. The Organization has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor -restricted funds that the Organization must hold in perpetuity or for a donor -specified period, an accumulation of earnings on the fund in accordance with the endowment fund investment policy, and board- designated funds (if any). Under this policy, as approved by the board of directors, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results while assuming a low level of investment risk. The Organization expects its endowment funds, over time, to provide a consistent rate of return. Actual returns in any given year may vary. The Organization has a policy that allows spending of annual interest earned on the corpus of the endowment fund. The amount of interest earnings to be released annually for distribution is specified by the board as soon as equitably possible after fiscal year -end. The interest funds are spent as authorized by the board on programs or capital expenditures to benefit the Organization in accordance with the endowment policy. Revenue recognition - Revenues are reported as increases in unrestricted net assets unless use of the related assets are limited by donor -imposed restrictions. Expenses are reported as decreases in unrestricted net assets. Gains and losses on investments and other assets or liabilities are reported as increases or decreases in unrestricted net assets unless their use is restricted by explicit donor stipulation or by law. Expirations of temporary restrictions on net assets are reported as transfers between the applicable classes of net assets. The Organization is reimbursed for services provided to qualifying residents of the nursing and boarding homes under contracts and is reimbursed at rates that may be different from its standard charge. Unearned revenue at year -end consists of prepaid room and board fee payments from individuals for the month following year -end. The Organization provides child care services to individuals at standard rates . The Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program is a state- funded kindergarten preparedness program for limited- income four -year-olds provided by a grant through the Snohomish County Human Services Department. During 2017 , the grant was renewed and expires on June 30, 2018. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 10 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Contributions - The Organization records contributions according to ASC 958, Not-for-Profit Entities . In accordance with ASC 958 , contributions, including unconditional promises to give, are recorded in the period made. All contributions are available for unrestricted use unless specifically restricted by the donor. Conditional promises to give are recognized when the conditions on which they depend are substantially met. Unconditional promises to give due in the next year are recorded at their net realizable value. Unconditional promises to give due in subsequent years are reported at the present value of their net realizable value, using risk -free interest rates applicable to the years in which the promises are to be received. Recognition of donor -restricted contributions - Support that is restricted by the donor is reported as an increase in unrestricted net assets if the restriction expires in the reporting period in which the support is recognized. All other donor -restricted support is reported as an increase in temporarily or permanently restricted net assets, depending on the nature of the restriction. When a restriction expires, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets. During 2017 , more than 80 volunteers contributed significant amounts of time and effort in assisting to carry out the programs and activities of the Organization. The time contributed by volunteers is not reflected in the financial statements . Land held for future development - Land, and costs attributable to the development activities of the land, which are held for future development where no significant development has been undertaken are stated at cost less impairment costs, if any. As of December 31, 2017, Management does not believe this land has been impaired. Land held for sale - Land which is held for sale is stated at cost less impairment costs, if any. As of December 31, 2017 , Management does not believe this land has been impaired. Loan issuance fees - Loan issuance fees are amortized on the straight -line basis over the term of the debt. Straight -line calculation of loan fees is not significantly different than the effective interest method. Amortization included in interest expense was $18,244 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Accumulated amortization was $140,269 and $ 122,025 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Use of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Performance indicator - Changes in excess revenues over expenses as reflected in the accompanying statements of activities is a performance indicator. Changes in excess revenues over expenses include changes in unrestricted net assets other than net realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 11 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Expense allocation - Directly identifiable expenses are charged to program, fund raising, and general and administrative expenses (Note 15) . Expenses relating to more than one function are charged to the function based on an estimate of utilization, square footage, or revenue on each function . General and administrative expenses include those expenses that are not directly identifiable with any specific function but to provide for the overall support of the Organization . Recent accounting pronouncements - In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016- 02 (ASU 2016- 02), Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016- 02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability in the balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases, with terms of more than twelve months. The new guidance will be effective for nonpublic company fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The amendment must be applied on a modified retrospective basis. In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers, which provides a single comprehensive revenue recogniti on model to apply in determining how and when to recognize revenue. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. When applying the new revenue model to contracts with customers, the guidance requires five steps to be applied, which include: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligat ion. The guidance also requires both quantitative and qualitative disclosures, which are more comprehensive than existing revenue standards. The disclosures are intended to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flow. For nonpublic entities the new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The amendment must be applied on a modified retrospective basis. The Organization is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these standards on the financial statements. Subsequent events - Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are available to be issued. The Organization recognizes in the financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet s, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing the financial statements. The Organization 's financial statements do not recognize subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet s but arose after the balance sheet date and before financial statements are available to be issued. The Organization did not have any subsequent events through March 28, 2018, wh ich is the date the financial statements were available to be issued, for events requiring recording or disclosure in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Reclassification - Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior financial statements to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on previously reported net income. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 12 Note 3 - Assets Restricted for Use The following assets are limited in use for specific purposes by donor designation , board designation, or by trustee under trust indenture as of December 31: 2017 2016 Josephine Endowment Fund 564,176 $ 512,180 $ Scholarship Fund 1,191 (256) Good Samaritan Fund 22,462 22,361 Resident trust 255,835 213,397 863,706 $ 765,602 $ The assets restricted for use are invested in the following at December 31: 2017 2016 Deposit accounts 174,003 $ 169,204 68,810 Other investments 610,380 527,588 863,706 $ 765,602 $ Josephine endowment fund - The Josephine Endowment Fund was established to support and further the mission and ministry of the Organization (Note 11 ). Scholarship fund - The Organization maintains a scholarship fund that is used to help fund the education of employees wishing to further their education in a field that benefits the Organization. Good Samaritan fund - The Good Samaritan Fund was established to provide for quality of life enhancements to residents in financial need. Resident trust accounts - The Organization maintains two resident trust bank accounts for its residents as required by the Department of Social and Health Services of Washington State (Note 7) . Nonqualified deferred compensation plan - The Organization adopted a nonqualified deferred compensation plan in 2013 for a certain highly paid employee. This deferred compensation arrangement is unfunded, unsecured and subject to a vesting schedule that begins when the employee reaches 62 years of age. The Plan allows for both an elective deferral and an employer deferral. Benefits are reported on the employee's W -2 and subject to FICA tax as vesting occurs. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 13 Note 3 - Assets Restricted for Use (continued) The Participant's entire accrued benefit is subject to the following vesting schedule: Year Age Vesting % 2024 62 20% 80% 2028 66 100% Plan assets are included in assets restricted for long term use on the balance sheet . Deferred compensation liability on the balance sheet includes accrued employer taxes . The total amount accrued under the deferred compensation plan was $270,275 and $227,454 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Employer contributions consist of premiums paid for a life insurance contract having a face value of $800,000, with a cash surrender value of $37,080 and $ 25,723 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . The Organization is both owner and beneficiary of this policy which insures the life of the plan participant. Employer contributions totaled $12,000 in both, 2017 and 2016. Premiums anticipated to be paid to keep the policy's underlying contracts in force are $12,000 annually until 2020. Note 4 - Inventory Inventory consists of the following at December 31: 2017 2016 Central supplies 47,485 $ 55,577 $ 2,188 2,279 71,949 $ 77,021 $ Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 14 Note 5 - Assets at Fair Value ASC 82 0, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , provides the framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described as follows: Basi s of fair value measurement Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Organization has the ability to access. Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments without quoted market prices, but for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. The ass et or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Foll owing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents - Cash and savings accounts held in federally insured institutions. The carrying amount reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. Reg istered Investment Companies (Mutual Funds) - Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of shares held in the fund at year -end using prices quoted by the relevant pricing agent. Ind ex-based securities - The principal protected securities are purchased based on a unit price, determined at the offering date, adjusted by the index's underlying observable market information, based on an average of the index's performance over the unit's life. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 15 Note 5 - Assets at Fair Value (continued) Other investments - The other investments include pooled investment accounts and a life insurance policy. The pooled investment accounts are valued using the net asset value (NAV) of the fund as reported by the fund managers and they are classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy . The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities. The net asset value of a pooled investment account is calculated based on a compilation of primarily observable market information. The pooled investment accounts include beneficial interests in assets of others. The life insurance policy is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The changes in fair value of the Level 3 asset were not significant. The Organization accounts for its investment in life settlement contracts in accordance with the investment method, using the contract value of the policy. Cash disbursements related to this investment are classified in the cash flow statement under operating and non- cash activity as it is used as deferred compensation.

Approximately 19% of revenue in 2017 and 2016 , was derived from private pay or other third- party payors. Approximately 25 % and 31% of revenue in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, was derived from the f ederal government. The primary geographic source of patients for skilled nursing and assisted living includes Snohomish County and surrounding communities in the northern Puget Sound region. In addition to skilled nursing and assisted living operations , the Organization derives approximately 7% and 6% of revenues in 2017 and 2016 , respectively by providing child day care and a Montessori school to the Stanwood community. Approximately 39% and 38% of account s receivable in 2017 and 2016, respectively, was derived from a contract with the Department of Social and Health Services in the state of Washington to provide skilled nursing and assisted living/congregate care to medical recipient residents. Approximately 19% and 15% of accounts receivable in 2017 and 2016, was derived from private pay or other third- party payors. Approximately 38% and 48% of accounts receivable in 2017 and 2016, respectively, was derived from the federal government. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Organization to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, investments, and accounts receivable. At times, cash deposits, including amounts held as investments, exceed the federally insured limits of the financial institution and expose the Organization to credit risk. Note 14 - Defined Contribution Plan The Organization sponsors a defined contribution plan, in which employees who have completed one year of service and ha ve attained age 21 are eligible to receive safe harbor contributions using the following formula: 100% of each p articipant 's elec tive deferrals up to 3% of the participant 's compensation (excluding grossed up bonuses and length of service awards). Plus 50% of each participant 's elective deferrals in excess of 3% but not in excess of 5% of the participant 's compensation (excluding grossed up bonuses and length of service awards). The Organization has accrued $252,398 and $238,553 of employer contributions to be made to the Plan for the year s ended December 31, 2017 and 201 6, respec tively .

The 201 7 report has not been filed and is due March 31 , 201 8, and is subject to audit and possible adjustment. The Organization is also contractually required to prepare an annual Medicare cost report. The 20 17 report is due May 31, 2018, and is subject to audit and possible adjustment. Note 17 - Medical Malpractice Insurance The Organization maintains medical malpractice insurance coverage through \"claims made\" type policies for the benefit of its clinical employees and the Organization . Should the \"claims made\" policies not be renewed or replaced with equivalent insurance, claims related to occurrences during their terms, but reported subsequent to their termination, may be uninsured. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that a health care facility disclose the estimated costs of malpractice claims in the period of the incident of malpractice, if it is reasonably possible that liabilities may be incurred and losses can be reasonably estimated. A health care facility sh all also recognize an insurance receivable at the same time that it recognizes the liability. Management is unable to reasonably estimate the range of future costs, if any, of unasserted medical malpractice claims arising from incidents in current and pri or periods. Josephine Caring Community Notes t o Financial Statements 23 Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies In th e ordinary course of business, the Organization is a party to claims and legal actions by residents, providers, employees , and others. After consulting with legal counsel, the Organization 's management is of the opinion that any liability that may ultimately be incurred as a result of claims or legal actions will not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Organization. Ind ustry regulations - The health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditations, government health care program participation requirements, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government activity continues with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse statutes and regulations by health care providers. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in expulsion from government health care programs together with the imposition of significant fines and penalties, as well as significant repayments for patient services previously billed. Management believes that the Organization is in compliance with fraud and abuse, as well as other applicable government laws and regulations. Although no regulatory inquir ies have been made, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions known or unasserted at this time. Acc ounting for conditional asset retirement obligations - ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations , requires management to recognize the fair value of a liability related to environmental matters. Management cannot estimate the impact of this standard on the balance sheets for the Organization.

PAGE 4 Cultural Awareness PAGE 5 Cultural Diversity History First introduced in 2000 by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Minority Health, and then updated in 2010, the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health Care work to increase cultural competence in the health care industry. Among these standards is a cultural diversity training recommendation. Since then, a number of federal agencies, including the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, have adopted the national standards and require health care professionals to receive cultural competence traini ng. Workforce Diversity Training Internal training focuses on the beliefs, attitudes and expectations of a culturally diverse workforce. The emphasis is on teamwork, developing good interpersonal relationships and maintaining effective work performance. Cultural diversity is essential to maintaining a balanced organization. In global organizations whose operations include business dealings and affiliations in other countries, understanding cultural differences is key to successful business partnerships. Employees should be aware of the importance of respecting the cultural differences of others, and employers can offer training to increase awareness and to better equip employees to function in a diverse workplace. Importance of Cultural Diversity Recogniz ing and respecting cultural differences in the workplace is essential to a company's organizational structure and the health of its human resources. Companies with employees of culturally diverse backgrounds recognize the benefits of having people with different perspectives, problem -solving skills and creativity. Many companies benefit from multilingual employees. Training is key to helping employees with different backgrounds understand and respect each other's differences so they learn to collaborate and achieve the company's goals. PAGE 6 Common Diversity Issues It is not uncommon for companies to hire employees of various nationalities and ethnic groups. Issues such as differences in pay or differing treatment of employees because of cultural differences could be perceived as discrimination. By emphasizing awareness of and promoting sensitivity to cultural issues, employers can show they recognize the contributions and value of all workers. Importance of Cultural Competence Cultural competence relates to the quality of the day -to-day interactions and relationships between health care providers and patients. Unlike workforce diversity training, which affects patients indirectly, cultural competence affects patients directly. For example, the quality of patient interactions, including communication, determines how well or whether a patient is able to communicate symptoms, follow instructions and participate in his care. It also affects whether a patient feels respected or disrespected, as both an individual and a member of a cultural group. Cultural Competence Training Working with a diverse patient population requires ongoing training that provides workers with specific knowledge, abilities and skills. For example, health care workers must understand common cultural barriers to preventing and treating conditions or disease. When interacting with patients, an ability to ask questions tactfully and respectfully and negotiate between a patient's cultural interpretation of a condition or disease and treatment expectations and options is crucial to good patient care. Practical skills such as using a telephone or working with an interpreter are also important. PAGE 7 Employee Relations The lack of cultural diversity or the perception of disrespect for other cultures can be detrimental to partnerships. Organizational leaders can benefit from understanding the differences in the way operations at other organizations are structured. Cultural differences are not limited to ethnicity and race relations; they extend to areas of religious views, sexuality and even differences in geographical differences pertaining to the location of one's upbringing. Consideration should be given to each of these areas when evaluating the organizational balance. Managers should demonstrate sensitivity to employees who express concern regarding the ability to interact with others in the group. In some cases, communication may be hindered due to cultural differences. Moving past these barriers requires training and sensitivity to the differences of the employees and ensuring that other employees recognize this importance as well. Prevention and Education A complete understanding of cultural diversity is imperative for successful business operations. Mandatory diversity training for managers should be incorporated as part of a developmental learning process to ensure managers can effectively deal with diversity issues. By staying abreast of federal guidelines governing employment discrimination and the importance of cultural diversity and employment practices, managers become equipped on how to handle conflicts in the organization that may stem from these differences. Managers with an understanding of the importance of cultural diversity also can key in on employee relations and retention. PAGE 8 Workplace Discrimination Laws A company's leaders are charged with ensuring compliance with federal laws that govern the equal treatment of employees regardless of race, ethnicity, religious views and many other individual traits. When employees believe they are treated differently because of their individualism, this perception could lead to legal trouble for the company. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission prohibits companies from discriminating against employees for any reason. Allegations of discrimination in the workplace, if proved, could result in financial penalties for the company. The EEOC website provides information about employment laws and ways to avoid discrimination for both employers and employees. www.eeoc.gov . Customer Service Cultural diversity training and education is important to support the customer service efforts of an organization. Providing quality customer service across many cultures requires a solid understanding of what different cultures consider appropriate behavior. Diversity training will help businesses understand what barriers are affecting key customer relationships as well as improve communication between employees and their clients. Tips on Culture Diversity in the Workplace Attempts at c ultural diversity in the workplace have been met with mixed reviews, according to AdminSecret.com. To a small business owner, diversification may mean hiring only a handful of workers from different cultural backgrounds. However, due to the highly interd ependent nature of the small- business work force, it is critical that diversity is implemented successfully. PAGE 9 Learn to Communicate You may need to communicate differently with workers from other cultures. For example, some cultures do not openly praise workers in front of others, preferring that it be done in private. You may need to read and study about the differences in your worker home culture to build trust and avoid offending them. Train Frequently To ensure that workers fully understand policies and procedures, you may need to spend additional time on training and orientation so that there are no ambiguities. For example, you may need to spend extra time covering areas such as sexual harassment or general behavior so em ployees are clear as to how you expect them to act. If you have a dress code, you may also need to clarify what attire is appropriate. Cultural diversity training can help employees improve their performance by creating a workplace free of judgments and stereotypes. Although employees may have certain opinions about their co-workers, diversity training will help employees recognize the behaviors that could possibly create a hostile or uncomfortable work environment. Educational activities about cultural variations also provide employees with a level of understanding about other cultures they may not have had before. Orient Current Workers You may also need to spend some time getting your current workers to accept a more diverse work force. This may include sensitivity or diversity training that allows employees to understand the difficulties people from different cultures may have in adapting. You should also attempt to identify any issues your current workers may have with the implem entation of a multicultural work force. PAGE 10 Assign Mentors Some of your workers may have an easier time and will be more receptive to adapting to a diverse work culture than others. These individuals could fill a valuable role as mentors. Pair them with workers from different cultures to provide training and help with assimilation into the work environment. Finding common ground in an environment rich with varying opinions and perspectives can be challenging to some employees. Education initiatives that teach employees how to succeed and perform optimally across a multi - cultural workforce can directly support diversity efforts in the workplace. Diversity education encourages thoughtfulness and consideration between co- workers of different nationalities and backgrounds. Leadership Role The business owner and managers, bear the ultimate responsibility for developing a more diverse work culture. If they show strong leadership during this adjustment period by demonstrating commitment to diversity and including everyone in the process, the chances of attaining success in diversification are likely to increase. Supervisors are in a position where they have to manage the diverse perspectives of workers and customers. Managers are obligated to treat their people equally, but sometimes fall short of communicating effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds or experiences. Training that focuses on managing a diverse workforce will help supervisors connect with all team members and include every worker in the activities that support the agency's bottom line. Examples of Cultural Differences in the Workplace Workplace diversity trainers often mention that there are more similarities among employees than there are differences; however, despite the many common attributes employees share, there still exist cultural differences. Culture is defined as a set of values, practices, traditions or beliefs a group shares, whether due to age, race or ethnicity, religion or gender. PAGE 11 Other factors that contribute to workplace diversity and cultural differences in the workplace are differences attributable to work styles, education or disability. Generations There are cultural differences attributable to employees' generations. A diverse workplace includes employees considered traditionalists, baby boomers, Generation X, Generation Y and Millennials. Each generation has distinct characteristics. For example, employees considered baby boomers tend to link their personal identity to their profession or the kind of work they do. Baby boomers are also characterized as being committed, yet unafraid of changing employers when there's an opportunity for career growth and advancement. Employees considered belonging to Generation Y, on the other hand, also value professional development, but they are tech- savvy, accustomed to diversity and value flexibility in working conditions. Education Differences exist between employees who equate academic credentials with success and employees whose vocational and on- the-job training enabled their career progression. The cultural differences between these two groups may be a source of conflict in some workplace issues when there's disagreement about theory versus practice in achieving organizational goals. For instance, an employee who believes that a college degree prepared him for managing the processes and techniques of employees in the skilled trades may not be as effective as he thinks when compared to employees with years of practical knowledge and experience. Personal Background Where an employee lives or has lived can contribute to cultural differences in the workplace. Many people would agree that there is a distinct difference between the employee from a small town and the employee from a large metropolis. New York, for example, is known for its fast pace and the hectic speed of business transactions. Conversely, an employee from a small, Southern town may not approach her job duties with the same haste as someone who is employed by the same company from a large city where there's a sense of urgency attached to every job task. PAGE 12 Ethnicity Ethnicity or national origin are often examples of cultural differences in the workplace, particularly where communication, language barriers or the manner in which business is conducted are obviously different. Affinity groups have gained popularity in large organizations or professional associations, such as the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce or in- house groups whose members are underrepresented ethnicities, such as the Chinese Culture Network at Eli Lilly. The pharmaceutical conglomerate organizes affinit y groups to bridge cultural differences and establish productive working relationships within the workplace and throughout its global locations. In his article \"Winning with Diversity,\" author Jason Forsythe explains that Eli Lilly's many affinity groups are necessary: \"Because the company currently markets products in 156 countries and has affiliates in many of them, multicultural competency is a priority.\" How to Resolve Cultural Communications in the Workplace Differences in race, sex, religious beliefs, lifestyle and sexual orientation are among many cultural differences that may affect how people communicate in the workplace. Resolving communications problems caused by cultural differences requires patience, understanding and respect. A major mistake is forming opinions before even engaging in communications. Opinions reached before an opportunity to discuss the matter makes resolving conflict difficult. Respect Treating people as individuals regardless of culture is sometimes a key to resolving communication issues. For example, it is improper to assume that a woman takes a certain position on a subject because she is a woman. Such generalizations can cause conflict in communication. Not all people who are members of the same culture will react to communication in the same way or offer the same opinion on a subject. However, it is true that cultural backgrounds may affect how people act, behave and communicate. But that does not mean people of a certain culture will all communicate or react to events in the same way. PAGE 13 Knowledge Learning more about other lifestyles and cultures helps people avoid conflict in communication, particularly in multicultural settings. Information on cultural awareness is widely available in books at public librari es. Open and honest discussions about cultural differences with friends and colleagues are helpful as well. Learning more about cultural differences helps avoid jumping to unfair or wrong assumptions about a person's statements or other communication eff orts. Blame Conflict in communications between cultures also is avoidable when all parties resist assigning blame. Two companies merging staffs in a business transaction may have different styles of managing and working. Putting the teams together can cause an immediate clash of cultures, with problems intensified if both sides always blames the other for problems and breakdown in communication. Simply placing the blame on others is not constructive and can make communication problems worse. Listening Skills Focusing on listening well with an open mind also helps resolve cultural communications problems. Paying c lose attention to words used in a conversation or other form of communication can help resolve these problems. It's also important to pay attention to the context of the discussion and the tone of the communication. Cultural Diversity Policy The Agency will provide care to patients and families regardless of their cultural background and beliefs. Cultural considerations for all patients/clients shall be respected and observed. Where such considerations impede the provision of prescribed health care or treatment, personnel shall notify the supervisor and physician in an effort to accommodate the patient/client. PAGE 14 Different cultural backgrounds, beliefs and religions impact the patient's lifestyles, habits, and view of health and healing. Employees must be able to identify differences in their own beliefs and the patient's beliefs and find ways to support the patient. Upon admission, staff will identify the patient's individual beliefs based on their cultural background and develop the plan of care accordingl y. The Agency will not assign personnel unwilling to comply with the Agency's policy, due to cultural values or religious beliefs, to situations where their actions may be in conflict with the prescribed treatment or the needs of the patient. Cultural diversity training will be completed for all employees at time of orientation and annually thereafter. PAGE 15 Emergency/Disaster PAGE 16 The Emergency/Disaster Plan provides an orderly procedure to be implemented in an emergency to assure that the health care needs of patients continue to be met. The plan comprehensively describes its approach to a disaster. The Agency must maintain documentation of compliance with emergency preparedness. The Agency is not required to physically evacuate or transport a patient in the event of an emergency. All employees shall be oriented to the plan and their responsibilities in carrying out the plan. Possible emergency or risk factors will be identified for each patient and appropriate emergency plans discu ssed with the patient and/or the responsible person at the time of admission as indicated. The name and telephone number of an emergency contact will be obtained by the Agency. The Agency has taken the following actions to develop, maintain and implement an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan as follows: 1. The Agency must involve the Administrator, Director of Nursing, if applicable, and, based on the Agency's organizational chart, other Agency leaders designated by the Administrator. 2. The Administrator of the Agency is designated as the Agency's disaster coordinator. In his/her absence, the Alternate Administrator is designated as the alternate disaster coordinator. 3. The Agency has a continuity of operations business plan to address emergency financial needs, essential functions for the patient services, critical personnel and how to return to normal operations as quickly as possible. 4. The Agency has a risk assessment to identify the potential disasters from natural and man- made causes most likely to occur in the Agency's service area. 5. The Agency has determined the actions and responsibilities for Agency staff in each phase of emergency planning, including mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. The response and recovery phases include actions and responsibilities when warning of an emergency is not provided. 6. The Agency has a plan to monitor disaster -related news and information including after hours, weekends, and holidays, to receive warnings of imminent and occurring disasters. PAGE 17 7. The Agency has implemented the following for the response and recovery phases of the Plan: a. The Agency Administrator is responsible for initiating each phase of the Plan. In his/her absence the office manager is responsible. b. The Agency has procedures for communicating with staff, patients or responsible representative, local, state and Federal emergency management agencies and other entities as applicable including: i. Emergency medical services. ii. State regulatory departments. iii. Other healthcare providers and suppliers. iv. Primary a nd alternate modes of communication or alert systems in the event of telephone or power failure. 8. The patient is provided with the following: a. A copy of the Agency's policy on how to handle disaster related emergencies in the home. b. Patient responsibilities in the Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan. c. A list of community disaster resources that can assist during a disaster -related emergency. d. Survival tips and plans for evacuation and sheltering in place. 9. The patients are categorized into groups determined by the need for continuity of services, the acuity level of the patient, and the availability of someone to assume responsibility for the patient's Emergency Response Plan if needed by the patient. 10. The Agency has identified patients who may need evacuation assistance from local or state jurisdictions and can readily access recorded information about a patient's triage category in the event of an emergency to coordinate and communicate as required. 11. All employees including contractors are oriented about their responsibilities in the Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan on hire and the plan is reviewed at least annually with an emergency drill performed. 12. The Agency reviews its Disaster Plan as needed and after every response, but at least yearly through its Professional Advisory Committee. The Agency discusses the plan and the procedures for communicating with staff. 13. The Agency will follow the emergency requirements during a disaster and will document in the Agency's records attempts of staff to follow procedures in the event they are unable to comply with any of the requirements. 14. The Agency will present its best efforts to provide care to patients in emergency situations. However, if the Agency is unable to comply with situations beyond its control making it impossible to provide services, such as when roads are impassable or when a patient relocated to a place unknown to the Agency, the Agency is not required to continue to provide care. PAGE 18 Our community is vulnerable to a wide range of emer gencies, including natural, technological, and man- made disasters, all of which threaten the life, health and safety of its people; damage and destroy property; disrupt services and everyday business and recreational activities; and impede economic growth and development. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the state's growth and population, especially the growth in the elderly population, in the number of seasonal vacationers, and in the number with persons of special needs. State policy for responding to disasters is to support local emergency response efforts 1. To reduce the vulnerability of the people and the property of this state to damage, injury, and loss of life and property. 2. To prepare for prompt and efficient rescue, care and treatment of threatened or affected persons. 3. To provide for the rapid and orderly rehabilitations of persons, and for the restoration of services and properties. 4. To provide for the coordination of activities relating to emergency preparedness with public and private agencies in the community. 5. A comprehensive emergency plan is prepared, reviewed annually and revised as necessary. PAGE 19 Emergencies: 1. Any occurrence, or threat thereof which results or may result in substantial injury or harm to the population, or substantial damage to or loss of property. 2. In the event of an emergency that disrupts the Agency's ability to provide care, needs shall be prioritized to determine those which are the greatest. Patients will continue to receive care, if possible, with minimal disruption of schedule. Patients will be instructed in emergency measures if nursing availability is limited. 3. If an emergency occurs, either within the Agency causing staffing limitation (such as labor disputes, staff illnesses) or within the environment (such as floods, hurricanes, fires or other natural disasters), the Director of Nursing or designee will be responsible for reviewing patients and prioritizing them. When the demand for personnel exceeds available resources, the following factors should be considered in deciding priorities with the safety of the patient being the first priority: a. Availability of appropriate alternative coverage (family, friends, etc.) for the hours of service in question. A patient who has no other appropriate person to assist sho uld receive a higher priority that those with appropriate alternatives. b. Level of priority of the patient's medical and nursing needs. Those patients whose medical and nursing needs are more acute should receive higher priority than those with less acute needs. c. Usual number of personnel hours that the patient routinely receives from nursing services. Those patients receiving a greater number of personnel hours should receive a higher priority than those receiving less. d. If an emergency occurs, either within the Agency causing staffing limitation (such as labor disputes, staff illnesses) or within the environment (such as floods, blizzards, hurricanes, fires or other natural disasters), the DON or his/her designee will be responsible for reviewing patients and prioritizing them according to the following classifications: PAGE 20 Class I Emergency: When the patient has a condition which is potentially life threatening, requires ongoing medical treatment, or requires assistance of a medical device to sustain life (i.e., there is a potential wide spread power black -out and the patient is on ventilator), the home environment and support system will be reviewed. When appropriate, arrangements for evacuation to an acute care facility will be made. These patients will be seen immediately. The Agency will obtain assistance from emergency personnel as necessary. (Examples: Oxygen, Multiple Assistive Devices, Infusion) Class II Emergency: The patient has in- home support that may be mobilized in the event of disaster. The family is responsible for evacuation and care of patient. Patients with the greatest need for care will be seen as soon as possible by available staff. Patients requiring daily insulin injections, IV medications, sterile wound care of a wound with a large amount of drainage. Class III Emergency: Services could be postponed 24- 48 hours without adverse effects on the patient. (Examples: a new, insulin dependent diabetic able to self -inject, patient under cardiovascular and/or respiratory assessment, and a patient that requires sterile wound care to a wound with minimal amount or no drainage.) Class IV Emergency: The patient has maximum in home support through the family structure. The family is totally responsible for the care and transfer. Services could be postponed 72 -96 hours without adverse effect on the patient (Examples: a postoperative patient with no open wound, a patient who is anticipated to be discharged within the next 10- 14 days, a patient who requires routine catheter changes.) 1. In the event evacuation of the patient is required, the local authority responsible for coordinating disaster preparedness and emergency response will be contacted. The Agency is not responsible for evacuating patients. 2. If some patient visits cannot be made and it is not a life threatening situation, contact will be maintained by phone if possible. If office phone service is disrupted, phones will be turned over to the answering service, if possible. A staff member will be assigned to remain in contact with the answering service to receive and send messages. PAGE 21 TYPES OF EMERGENCIES Man-Made Emergencies: Those that are caused by acts against persons or society, including but not limited to enemy attack, sabotage, terrorism, civil unrest and bio- terrorism. Natural Emergencies: Those that are caused by natural events, including but not limited to winter storms, hurricane, flood, mudslides, severe wave action, drought and earthquakes. Technological Emergencies: Those caused by a technological failure or accident, including but not limit ed to explosions, transportation accidents, radiological accidents, chemical and/or other hazardous materials incident.

If written records are damaged during a disaster, the Agency must not reproduce or recreate patient records except from existing electronic records. Records reproduced from existing electric record must include: a. The date the record was reproduced. b. The Agency staff member who reproduced the record. c. How the original record was damaged. 2. The Agency is responsible to notify the State licensing unit, by fax or email, no later than five working days after any of the following temporary changes resulting from the effects of an emergency or disaster: a. Temporary relocating address including date of temporary relocation. b. License number, physical address and phone number. c. Date the Agency plans to returns to its permanent location. 3. If the Agency is temporarily expanding its service area to assist in the emergency, the state should be notified of: a. License number, and revised boundaries of the original service area. b. Date of temporary expansion. c. Date temporary expansion of the service area ends. PAGE 25 Handling Complaints and Grievances PAGE 26 Definition A grievance is a concern relating to patient care conditions or to relationships between a patient and the Agency or a caregiver in which the patient believes that he/she has been wronged and wants the wrong corrected. It is regarding problem areas in the delivery of care which appear to threaten the health and well-being of the patient. Policy All patients will be informed of their right to voice a complaint/grievance against anyone furnishing services on behalf of the Agency. All patients will receive v erbally and in writing the Agency's process for receiving, investigating and resolving complaints. All patients receive the state regulatory hotline number, ACHC's telephone number as well as the appropriate person/department within the Agency to contact regarding a complaint/grievance regarding services furnished by the Agency and/or concerns regarding the implementation of Advance Directive requirements. The Agency will investigate any complaint made by patient or patient's family or guardian regarding treatment or care that is (or fails to be) furnished, or regarding the lack of respect for the patient's property by anyone furnishing services on behalf of the Agency. Both the existence of the complaint and the resolution of the complaint will be documented. A summary of grievances, complaints and concerns will be reported to the Governing Body quarterly. Patient grievances, complaints and concerns will be included in the (PI) annual report. Agency staff will be educated on patient grievance policies at orientation and annually thereafter. All complaints/grievances are retained for a minimum of three years. Procedure 1. When a patient is admitted to the Agency, he/she is to be given an admission packet that includes a copy of the Agency Bill of Patient Rights and Responsibilities. This policy indicates that grievances are to be filed with the Agency Administrator. The fact that the policy was given to the patient is to be recorded in the clinical record. 2. All grievances and concerns are to be dealt with by the Administrator or his/her designee. 3. Any employee receiving a complaint/grievance will complete and submit a report to the Administrator. If the complaint is received after business hours, the supervisor on call will be notified and the complaint form will be submitted the next business day. 4. When a grievance is received, whether written or verbal, it is to be documented in the patient's clinical record by the Administrator or his/her designee. It is also to be noted in a log kept by the Administrator. 5. The resolution of the problem is also to be documented in the same manner. 6. Each written grievance received is to be responded to in writing by the Agency within ten (10) days. PAGE 27 7. Grievance received after hours, on weekends and holidays and whenever the office is closed are handled on the next business day. 8. Each written or verbal grievance received is to be responded to in writing by the Administrator within ten (10) days. This information is reviewed by the Administrator and a complaint form is completed by the Administrator. Each person involved is interviewed by the Administrator who then evaluates all collected information. 9. After thorough evaluation, The Administrator makes a determination and formulates a decision notifying all persons involved. All information regarding activities, investigation, analysis, resolution and outcomes are documented in the Administrator's log and in the patient's chart. 10. The response is to explain the decision rendered by the Agency and it is to notify the patient of his/her right to appeal. 11. A copy of the outcome is to be filed in the clinical record and noted in the Administrator's log. 12. If the patient files an appeal, it is to be reviewed and responded to by a member of the Governing Body within thirty (30) days of its receipt by the Agency. 13. The response to the appeal is to be filed in the patient's clinical record and noted in the Administrator's log. Staff Rights All employees have rights and are entitled to fair, consistent and professional treatment including but not limited to the following: 1. Staff may request a change in assignment because of a personality conflict. 2. Staff may complain without fear of repercussion. 3. Staff has the right to special consideration to accommodate personal requests arising from cultural or religious practices provided the Agency can cover the needs of the patient/cl ients. 4. Staff has a right to be treated in accordance with the Agency mission and vision. 5. Staff is to receive information in a timely manner. 6. Staff is entitled to a workplace free from solicitation and distribution of unsolicited material. Grievance Procedures 1. Any person(s) who believes that he/she or any class of individuals has been subject to discrimination may file a complaint pursuant to procedures set forth below, on behalf of him or herself another person or handicapped persons as a class. Filing of a complaint will not subject employees to any form of adverse action, reprimand, retaliation or otherwise negative treatment by the Agency. 2. Accordingly, the Agency has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the United States department of Health and Human Services regulation 45 CFR part 84, 29 USC 794. The law and PAGE 28 regulations may be examined in the office of the Director of Nursing who has been designated to coordinate the efforts of the agency to comply with the regulation. 3. Complaint processing procedures are as follows: a. All complaints involving matters prohibited shall first be filed with the Director, who shall render an initial resolution within seven days of receipt of the complaint. b. If the complaint is not satisfied with the results achieved in step 'a,' the complainant may file an appeal with the President/CEO, who shall render a decision within five days. c. A complaint should be in writing, contain the name and address of the person filing it and briefly describe the action(s) alleged to be prohibited. d. All complaints should be filed as set forth above within three days after the complaining party becomes aware of the action(s) allegedly prohibited by the regulations. e. All complaints should also be referred to the office of the Coordinator, who shall maintain the files and records of the Agency relating to complaints filed hereunder. The Coordinator may assist persons with the preparation and filling of complaints, participate in the investigation of complaints and advise the President/CEO concerning their resolution. f. The President/CEO, or his designee, shall take steps to insure an appropriate investigation of each complaint to determine its validity. These rules contemplate informal but thorough investigations, affording all interested persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to the complaint. The right of a person to prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of a Complaint with the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human services. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies. 4. These rules shall be liberally construed to protect the substantial rights of interested persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure Agency compliance with regulations.

HIPAA also co ntains legisl ation ai med at red ucing health care related admi nistrative costs, eliminating pre-existing clauses and waiting periods for individu als changing insurance coverage, and increas ing access to insurance for individual purchasers. Strict guidelines for maintaining privacy, confid entiality, a nd security of health information are also part of HIPAA legislation. The implications HIPAA has for researc hers are also discussed. Objectives: Upon com pletion of this module, the learner will be able to complete the following objectives: 1. Explain the com ponents of the HIPAA legislation. 2. Discuss how HIPAA expands availability of health care coverage. 3. Describe who is affected by the pri vacy and confidentiality requirem ents. 4. Explain what is meant by protected hea lth in formation (PHI) and indi vidually identifiable health infor mation (IIHI). 5. Describe processes that must be used to assure patient infor mation is kept confidenti al and secur e. 6. Describe how HIPAA influences inf ormed consent and the use of patient data for research. Introduction: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), also known as \"Kennedy -Kassebaum \", passed congress rapidly and with great bipartisan support in 1996. Many aspects of the l egislation have been i mplemented in the ensu ing year s; the deadline for full im plementation of the privacy and confidentiality requirem ents was April 14, 2003. Health care providers and organizations have strict guidelines that must be followed to rem ain within the law. While this module and most of our attention now is focused on the provisions of the legislation that deal with privacy, conf identi ality, and sec urity of patient records, HIPAA also contains other requirem ents that have an i mpact on e mployers, insurance companies, and purchasers of health ins urance cov erage. HIPAA was designed to address public concerns about managed care, insurance availability, and insuranc e affordab ility. For exa mple, HIPAA prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage because of: 1. preexisting conditions, 2. a fam ily member's health status, or 3. wh ether or not an individual has been covered under a group policy and is seeking a personal health insurance policy. Further, HI PAA ensures im mediate coverage without regard to pre- existing conditions for individuals who change jobs and insurance carriers. HIPAA also established a pil ot program for PAGE 32 medical savings accounts (MSAs) that allows individuals to crea te a \"health insuranc e individual account\" to purchase health services and retain unspent funds rather than paying monthly prem iums. Further, to encourage the purchase of long- term care insurance, HIPAA allows employers to deduct premium s and most benefits are tax -free to the beneficiary. Additionally, to facilitate purchase of health insurance by self - employed persons, the law allows 80% of the annual prem iums to be tax - deductible by 2006. While many health policy analysts agree that these provisions have little i mpact on redu cing the number of uninsured, they do, however, think these efforts are worthwhil e. At this ti me, however, attention to HIPAA is riveted on im plementing and paying for the privacy, confidentiality, and security aspects of the legislation (DiBenedetto, 2003). In 1996, HIPAA was viewed as a way to reduce admi nistrative costs, provide better access to health infor mation, reduce fraud, and guaranty privacy of health infor mation. However, the American Hospital Association esti mates that it may cost between $4 billion and $22 billion to implement the tenets of the law. A search of the literature failed to produ ce specifics regar ding cost; however, accor ding to Gue and Upham (2004), the majority of costs are associated with developing and i mplementing soft ware that integrates providers, payers, and governm ental agencies. As part of the HIPAA rule prom ulgation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS mandated standardization of transaction and code sets (TSC) to reduce duplication, confus ion, and non- compliance. CMS standards rely on use of ICD -9 codes for disease classification, CPT codes for procedures, and national drug codes (NDC) for medications. CMS adm its that p roblems with these coding sets exist; new ICD -10-CM and ICD -10-PCS are thought to reduce the ambiguity and facilitate full implem entation of electronic processing. The industry is working toward integrating HIPAA fully, it is just taking longer than they hoped to get the electron ic interfaces coordinated (Gue and Upham 2004). HIPAA is just the beginning of t he ulti mate conversion of healthcare inf ormation into an electronic health record (EHR). The Bush admi nistration projects it will cost $100 m illion a year for 10 years primarily to fund dem onstration projects and trial progr ams aimed at achieving four major goals: 1. establish routine use of EHRs in clin ical practice, 2. conn ect health c are workers in inform ation exchange for clinical decision making, 3. enhance patient s' ability to choos e providers based on quality, and 4. integrate pu blic health surveillance system s into an interoperable network to support new research and better care (Scott 2004, p. 34). The Basics HIPAA contains provisions for both privacy and security. Privacy rules have been prom ulgated and compliance was r equired by most health plans by April 14, 2003; plans with less than $5 million in annual receipts had until April 14, 2004 to fully comply. These rules have gone through several iterations, som e as recently as March 2003 and refinements con tinue. Security rules t hat detail further requirem ents for the health care industry and patients were issued in October 2004. A key factor for all health care providers and organizations to keep in mind is that, while HIPAA rules are strict, if state law covering the sam e topic is more stringent, the state law must be followed (Herrin, 2003). Health providers are well advised not to overlook state law as they accommodate HIPAA. Providers and organizations must rem ain up- to-date with both HIPAA and state law changes. PAGE 33 The inten t of HIPAA is to protec t patients from unauthorized or inappropriate use and access to their health infor mation. Further, the rules protect patients by giving t hem access to their health information so they know what has been docum ented about their health status. Proposed by - products of HIPAA are to i mprove quality of care, rest ore trust in the health care sy stem , and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of infor mation dissemi nation by building on existing legal frameworks. HIPAA also contains an admi nistrative simplification section designed to i mprove the efficie ncy of health infor mation coding to facilitate digital trans fer of inform ation between and among health care providers, payers, and health plans. HIPAA creates safeguards so that on ly those people or entities having a real need to kno w health infor mation will be a ble to access it (Calloway and Venegas 2002). The HIPAA rules complement other standards that protect patient s' rig hts. Compliance with privacy rules prom ises to be a cornerstone of future JCAHO and Medicare/Medicaid s urveys. Re member, compliance is mandatory, not voluntary. PAGE 34 WHY HIPAA IS NE EDED Health care professionals have long realized the need to protect patients from unauthorized use of their health infor mation; at the sam e time, they want to have access to needed information when treating a patient. Widespread use of elec tronic data is facilitating t he rapid tran sfer of information and the Institute of Medicine has urged the creation of s tandards so electronic records can be available (Follansbee, 2002). Similarly, the public is greatly concern ed about the privacy of their medical records. Prior to the electronic medical record, patient information was maintained in paper form and neatly locked away, acce ssible only to th ose who had authorized acces s. With co mputerized records information can be accessed, changed, distributed, and copied with far less rega rd for appr opriate authorization (Follansbee, 2002). Serious breaches of record confidential ity have occurred. An em ployee of the Hillsborough county health depart ment was able to carry hom e a disk with the nam es of 4000 HIV positive patients. People have purchased used co mputers that cont ained prescri ption records of patient s; Eli Lilly re cently sent out an em ail with the na mes of patient s tak ing Prozac; the University of Montana inadvertently placed the medical recor ds of some 62 people on the i nternet. Consequently, patients, health care prov iders, and other h ealth care en tities are very concerned about c onfidentialit y, restoring t he public tr ust, and pr otecting them selves from lawsuits. Yet, the ab ility of multiple pro viders to acc ess a patient 's rec ord can significantly i mprove the overall quality of care. Think about the chronically ill individual who receives care from more than one or two specialist providers. If each provid er has acces s to the most recen t treat ment plan, it stands to reason that care will be more coordinated, efficient, and effective. PAGE 35 UNDERSTANDING HIPAA - WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE LAW HIPAA describes those affected by the law as \"covered entiti es\". Included under this um brella are health care providers, health plans, health care clearinghouses, and business associates. Health care providers are defined as anyone who is paid for health care services or bills for services provided. The list is all inclusive: physi cians, licensed health care providers, hospitals, outpatient physical therapists, s ocial workers, c ertified nurse midwives, technicians admi nister ing X-rays done at hom e, home health agencies, phar macists, providers of hom e dialysis supplies and equipm ent, nursing homes, nurses, and nurse admini strato rs. This lis t means tha t any hospital or health facility worker who may see c onfidenti al patient information is included. A health plan is any individual or group that pays for health care services. Included are health maintenance organizations ( HMOs), insurance com panies, Medicare/Medicaid, sel f-insured plans, employee group plans, federal plans such as CHAMPUS, military, veteran' s admi nistration, and Indian health services. Clearinghouses are those entities that receive he alth infor mation from providers and health plans. They typically ar e responsible for standardizing the infor mation to i mprove clai ms processing. Included in this group are third- party admi nistrators, billing services, and re- pricing agencies The busine ss associates catego ry covers a br oad range of professionals and services. Included are attorneys, consultants, auditors, accountants, billing fir ms, data processing co mpanies, and practice managem ent fi rms. Nurses working as independent contractors, i.e., case managers, legal nurse consultants, and educat ors are includ ed and subject to compliance with HIPAA law. A contract between the business associate and hiring agen t must be in place before t he associate can see any patient information. PAGE 36 WHAT HEALTH IN FORMATION IS PRO TECTED? HIPAA created two new phrases to describe infor mation protected by the legislation. The medical record is now referred to as protected health inf ormation (PHI). This includes all information that is created by any covered entity. All for ms of the inform ation are p art of protected health infor mation, i.e., paper, electronic, video tapes, photos, audiotapes, and any information that has been duplicated, discussed, read from a computer screen, or shared over the int ernet. The other new HIPAA phrase is indiv idually identifiable health infor mation (IIHI). Inclu ded in his category is an y infor mation that coul d reasonabl y be linked to a specific patient, such as a photo, name, address, date of birth, next of kin or responsible relative, medical record identifier, social security number, driver's license num ber, health beneficiary, account num ber, em ployer, finger, or voice prints. The law spe cifies that some information tha t is not individually iden tifiable can re main. Age that is reported as 60+ if t he patient is older than 60, zip code if the patient lives within a zip code with greater than 20,000 people in it, race, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and the year on ly of the health care occurrence are not considered individually identifi able infor mation and these data may be used in t he aggregate. All facilities must limit acc ess to infor mation only to those who have a need to know. A nurse who seeks infor mation about a patient not under her care is violating the HIPAA rules. Si milarly, health infor mation can only be used for health purposes. E mployers cannot use t he infor mation to screen candi dates for hire or promotion. Financial institut ions may not use it to deter mine lendi ng practice. O nly the patient can ex plicitly authorize em ployers, banks, and individu als to have access to his/her medical infor mation. HIPAA also estab lished the \" minimum necessary rule\" which stipulates t hat only the minimum necessary infor mation may be shared, even with the patient authorization. A classic exam ple would involve treat ment for a case of child or dom estic abuse; the provider would, rather than providing an entire medical record, furnish the pertinent data furnishe d in the form of an abstract outlining the inf ormation tha t is necess ary to prov ide treat ment and protect the victi m(s). The abstracted infor mation could be provided to legal and law enforcem ent entities. Health providers involved in the treat ment of patients are not subject t o the minimu m necessary rule and can have full access to all in formation that is needed to provide patient care. Health in formation that ha s implications for the public health and safety can be shared without consent. There are several situations where medical infor mation can be shared: In Emer gency 911 situations, when communicable diseases are in volved, when law enforcem ent agencies participate, or if national defense or security is a factor. The public health depart ment is deem ed a legiti mate recipi ent of certain personal health information and providers may, in fact in some instances, must report som e findings to the proper public health agency. Inclu ded are: 1. cause of death even when the patient dies at home 2. reportable com municable diseases 3. child ab use 4. reporting an adverse drug reaction to the Federal Drug Admi nistration 5. occurrence of cancer in a state wi th a cancer registry 6. meningitis, and 7. immunizatio ns for children. These exam ples are thoug ht to be i mportant to the health of the public (Cam pos-Outcalt 2004). PAGE 37 PATI ENT CONSENT AND AUTHORIZ ATION HIPAA makes a distinction between inform ed consent and patient authorization. Patient s are entitled to know exactly how an entity plans to use the infor mation. Informed consent is signed at the f irst encounter the patient has with the provider/health care facility; the con sent cov ers treatment, pay ment, and other health care inform ation. The meaning and use of the patient's consent must be carefully ex plained to t he patient. F acilities must explicate their disclosure process in a docum ent called Infor mation Practices. The A merican Hospital Association published a sample consent and explanation docum ent that was 10 pages long. The docume nt explains patient rights, as well as a description of how patient information is collected and used. Facilities must decide how and when the infor mation concerning consent is presented to patients and h ow patients can use their right to revoke consent. Patients must also be advised about the agency's policy t hat covers conditions for admi ssion that are related to consent. Patients may also sign authorizations. These are required when infor mation is used by the agency for purposes outside of treatment. Agencies must assess their policies and procedures to assure that they are always using an authorization when it is needed; som e agencies may not realize that information s haring policies violate the patient's right to restrict release of data ( Cichon, 2002). Patients must be fully infor med about the way agencies use a signed authorizati on and are en titled to receive a free accounting every twelve months describing how their health infor mation has been used. PAGE 38 HIPAA privacy regulations also mandate s pecific patient rights tha t include the following: 1. Right to privacy notice requires disclosure and reasonable effort to assure that the patient understand s the agency's p olicy concerning privacy of informa tion. 2. Right to request restrictions means that patients may specify health infor mation that cannot be released and/or, they may restrict to whom infor mation can be released. 3. Right to access of PHI means that pati ents must be allowed to inspect and copy information contained in the agency's record. 4. Right to know what disclosures have been made means the age ncy must track all information rel eased and be able to provide docum entation to the patient. 5. Right to am end the PHI means that while patients may request am endme nts to the PHI and the agency must allow a mendments, the agency may deny so me requests. All cove red entities are required to comply with certain procedural rules. Most have had to develop new policies and p rocedures to address the many aspects covered under these rules. The foll owing are s ome of the rules: 1. Agencies must appoint a privacy officer who will monitor and audit com pliance. 2. Agencies must dev elop an int ernal compliance process that will ass ure no patient rights are violated, com plaints a re addressed and investigated, and that a process for remediati on is in place. 3. Training must be provided to em ployees to assure that they are infor med about patient rights and disclosure of infor mation. 4. HIPAA requires that agencies docum ent any and all violations and that sanctions parallel other disciplinary policies. 5. Agencies must have a process for mitigating any harmful eff ect of disclosure. 6. All for ms of communication must be addressed in admi nistrative safeguards. 7. Agencies must agree an d have polici es that spec ify no ret aliation for an em ployee or consum er who files a complaint. PRACTICAL IMPL ICATIONS Questions about the i mplications HI PAA rules have been num erous. Can an office or laboratory have a patient sign in sheet? Can you use a patient's nam e to call him into a treatment room? Can the patient's nam e be pos ted outside the hospital door? At this point, there is som e agreement about som e of these. As long as personal information regarding the patient's care or procedures to be done rem ain confidential, nam es can be outside hospital room doors, patients can be ver bally called to treatment room s, etc. New questions will undoubtedly arise in the future. Staying infor med about the rules and regulations concerning HIPAA will be every health care worker's ob ligation. Sign-in sheets, once disallowed, can now be used along with bedside charts as long as reasonable precautions are taken to safeguard patient infor mation. Sign in sheets can only have the nam e and ti me; no infor mation about the nature of the appoint ment can be included. The patien t can give consent or may decline to have information given to f amily membe rs; facility staff is not obli gated to veri fy the i dentity of relatives. HIPAA retains the rights of parents as the personal representative for minor chil dren. T here are exceptions, however. Parents may decide that the child and provider have a confidential relations hip that excludes the parent from receiving infor mation. A provider may choose to exclude the parent when abuse is suspected or when incl uding the parent would endanger the child. Patients have the right to restrict clergy visits and r eligious infor mation. If the patient does want the clergy to visit, health care indi viduals should provide only the nam e and location of the patient. They should not pr ovide any infor mation about the patie nt's medical cond ition. Furthe patient s have the right to restrict inf orming call ers or visitors t hat the y are in the hospit al. Most patients are asked on admi ssion to the facility if they want such restrictions and, if they do, hospital workers may not acknowledge that a patient is in the hospital even including visitors, florists delivering flowers, etc. Some infor mation can be provided to law enforcem ent without patient consent. E mergency technicians can contact t he police at a cri me scene and convey nature and location of the cri me. Information about a suspicious death may also be reported to the police. HIPAA has a one call rule that per mits contacting an organ procurem ent agency following a death. Repositories that store hum an tissue and fluids for future s cientific an alysis, i.e., genotyping, cell lines, other bi otechn ologies, ex press concern that HIPAA will fund amentally change how these commercial repositories function. At question is whether property rights continue to apply to human tissue after rem oval from the body. Prior to HIP AA, the Suprem e Court in California ruled on the side of future research and deter mined that property rights end when tissue is rem oved from the body (Allen 2004). However, depending on how HIPAA rules are interpreted, inform ed consent may be required in order for research to be conducted on rem oved tissue. PAGE 1 HIPAA AND RE SEARCH Patie nts must sign an authoriz ation to allow their inform ation to be included in research pr ojects. Information can only be di sclosed in acc ordance with a research protocol approved by an institutional review bo ard. All ide ntifying individual info rmation must be rem oved. One difficulty researchers may experience is the lack of spec ific guidance from HIPAA regarding construction of co mpliant, de -identified data s ets, at this po int researchers are developin g strategies that they believe com ply with the intent of privacy under HIPAA. Ongoing analysis of medical information is critical for developing strategies to i mprove patient outcom es and reduce medical errors be used in compliance with HIPAA includes: gender, race, ethnicity marital status, dates of treatment if reported in years, age (for indi viduals older than 60, one must us e 60+), and zip code if more than 20,000 reside in that zip code (Erlen, J.A. 2004) PAGE 2 CONCL USION HIPAA regulations require new behavior from health care professional and health care facilities. Clo se coordi nation with other partners in health care delivery and rei mbursement is mandatory to assure a continuous process of patient privacy. Restrictio ns and the ab ility to a mend II HI give patients new control over their health infor mation. Health care professionals may be challenged. Involving patient s as active participants in t heir care will dispel and av oid poten tial problem s. Administrators are advised to be sure staff is well -trained and knowledgeable about the requirem ents of HIPAA. Si milarly, they many want to scrutinize day - to-day practices to ev aluate whether violations of patient rights are occurring. PAGE 3 Infection Control PAGE 4 The patient receiving home care services may have less clinical \"acuity\" (i.e.; intensity or degree of care needed) but may have substantial host risk factors, including advanced age, chronic illness, or immunosuppression. Much of home care is provided by family members in a setting that is less structured and controlled than the hospital environment. Plumbing, sanitation and ventilation may be poor or absent. The Agency shall ensure that patients with potential for occupational exposure will be instructed in the following: a. Personal hygiene b. Exposure to blood borne pathogens c. Infection control procedures d. Hazards of TB transmission e. Isolation precautions f. Signs and symptoms of TB g. Aseptic technique h. Medical surveillance and therapy i. Standard precautions j. Protocol for tuberculosis care k. Transmittable infections l. Other topics as required. Standard precautions will be followed for all home acquired infections. Material appropriate in content and vocabulary to educational level, literacy and language of patient shall be used to teach the patient and family the prevention, control, symptoms and treatment of home acquired infections. a. An accessible copy of the regulatory text of this standard and an explanation of its contents. b. An explanation of modes of transmission of these diseases. c. An explanation of the Agency's exposure control plan. d. An explanation of the appropriate methods for recognizing tasks and other activities that may involve exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials. e. An explanation of the use and limitations of methods that will prevent or reduce exposure including appropriate engineering controls, work practices and personal protective equipment. f. Information on the appropriate actions to take and persons to contact in an emergency involving blood or other potentially infectious materials. PAGE 5 Standard Precautions for Direct Care Employees 1. Standard Precautions shall be observed by every health care worker for all patients receiving care. Standard Precautions is a system of infection control developed and based on the degree of exposure, not diagnosis. Assume that blood and all body fluids, with or without visible blood, from all patients are potentially infectious. Therefore, the need to use personal protective equipment must focus on health care worker's interaction with the patient's blood and/or body fluids at the time of treatment or procedure, rather than on the diagnosis. Standard Precautions are utilized to prevent reasonably anticipated parenteral, skin, eye and mucous membrane exposure to blood and other potentially infectious body fluids that may result during the performance of a health care worker's duties. 2. WASH HANDS - Hands must be washed before and after contact with each patient, if hands become soiled with body fluids, before the donning (putting on) of sterile gloves, after the removal of all gloves, after contact with non- intact skin and wound dressings and if moving from a contaminated area to a clean area. This is completed following the Agency handwashing policy. 3. GLOVES, such as vinyl or latex medical gloves, must be worn when cleaning reusable equipment, when having direct contact with blood, body fluids, mucous membrane or non- intact skin, when handling items soiled with blood, or when handling equipment contaminated with blood or body fluids. This includes, but is not limited to the following: a. Suctioning procedures. b. Dressing changes. c. Providing oral hygiene. d. Cleaning patient rooms, bathrooms, emptying trash or changing linens on patient's bed. e. Handling of contaminated linen. f. Catheter care and removal of catheters. g. Starting and stopping intravenous infusions. h. Enema administration. i. Collection and emptying of all suction and drainage devices, e.g., Foley catheter bags, Gomcos, and Hemovacs. j. Venipuncture/other vascular access procedures. 4. Gloves should be changed after each patient contact. When gloves are removed, thorough hand washing (per Agency policy) is required. Gloves do not take the place of hand washing. 5. GOGGLES or protective glasses should be worn when there is a potential for a splash with blood or body fluids. Examples include dental cleaning, venipunctures, arterial punctures, catheter or nasogastric tube insertions, and intubation. 6. GOWNS or APRONS should be worn when there is a potential for blood or body fluid splatters or sprays. Examples include venipunctures, arterial punctures, catheter or nasogastric tube insertions, and intubation. 7. MASKS are usually not necessary if contact is only casual but should be worn if there is a chance of splash or splatters or the patient is on respiratory precautions. 8. AIRWAYS - Although saliva has not been implicated in HIV transmission, a one- way airway, mouthpiece, resuscitation bag or other ventilation device should be in the home when resuscitation is predictable for use during actual resuscitation. PAGE 6 9. To prevent needle stick injuries, needles should never be recapped, bent, broken or manipulated by hand. These items and other sharp items such as scalpels, razor blades, etc. should be considered potentially infectious and handled with extraordinary care. Used needles should be placed intact into puncture resistant containers which are provided by the Agency. The containers, when three quarters full, are to be returned to the Agency for proper disposal or disposed of in accordance with state or local regulations. 10. In the event of contamination with blood or body fluids, body surfaces should be washed immediately with soap and water. 11. All laboratory specimens should be treated as if they were contaminated with either HIV or HBV. All specimens should be labeled with patient information, placed in sealable plastic bags and transported in an appropriate secured container. 12. For disposal of contaminated supplies other than needles, double bagging technique should be used as described in the Infection Control Policy. Areas and equipment contaminated with blood should be cleaned immediately with 1:10 bleach solution (10%). Equipment can also be cleaned thoroughly and soaked in isopropyl alcohol for ten minutes to inactivate HIV. A fresh solution must be used daily. 13. Soiled linens should be handled as little as possible and with minimum agitation to prevent gross microbial contamination of the air and of persons handling the linens. Linens soiled with blood or body fluids should be placed and transported to the Agency or disposal container in bags that prevent leakage. 14. Personnel cleaning biological spills or contaminated equipment should wear gloves and take care not to contaminate clothing. Disinfectant -detergent formulations registered by EPA can be used for cleaning environmental surfaces, but the actual physical removal of microorganisms by scrubbing is probably at least as important as any antimicrobial effect of the cleaning agent used. 15. Employees will be prohibited from eating, drinking, smoking and storage of food in any area where patient care is performed or in an area where lab testing is performed. 16. Health care workers with exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis should refrain from all direct patient care and from handling patient care equipment until the condition resolves. 17. As indicated, the Agency shall maintain a log describing the collection, transportation and disposition of hazardous waste. 18. Corrective actions are implemented and evaluated as indicated and necessary . PAGE 7 Reportable Diseases Purpose: To comply with state law and support public health policy. Policy: Patients with reportable infections occurring in the home will be reportable to the local health department in accordance with state law, if they have not been previously reported. Procedure: 1. The Agency will obtain a list of infectious diseases which are reportable to the public health department and reporting forms from the state department of health. 2. When an Agency staff member becomes aware of a reportable infection in a patient, he/she informs the Agency's Director of Nursing or Director of Quality Improvement. 3. After confirming the reportable infection via clinical record review, interview, and/or discussion with the physician, the Director of Nursing or the Director of Quality Improvement completes a reporting form and forwards it to the health department. 4. A copy of the reporting form is sent to the patient's physician. 5. A log is kept of all reported infections. 6. The Director of Nursing or the Director of Quality Improvement maintains reporting forms and current information to assure compliance with most recent state reporting regulations. PAGE 8 HAND WASHING POLICY -IN PATIENT'S HOMES Policy: It is the practice of this agency to assure that every effort is made to reduce the risk for infection in clients and staff members. Thorough hand washing/hand antisepsis is required of all employees. The agency has established guidelines for all staff and will provide education and direction on accepted practices. Purpose: To improve hand- hygiene practices of agency staff and reduce transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to clients and personnel in the home care setting. Special Instructions: 1. Use of alcohol -based hand sanitizer is preferred (until dry). If antimicrobial hand soap is used, it must be for a period of at least 15 seconds. (www.cdcgov/handhygiene/training/interactiveEducation). a. Before and after caring for clients, or when coming in contact with inanimate objects/equipment in the immediate vicinity of the client. b. Between tasks on the same cli ent and particularly when there is prolonged or intense contact with client; i.e. bathing, c. After removing gloves, d. After touching objects that are potentially contaminated, e. After caring for a client who is infected with drug resistant organisms; i.e. C -Diff and MRSA ( CDC recommendation for C -Diff: In a setting in which there is an outbreak or an increased CDI rate, visitors and healthcare workers must wash hands with soap (or antimicrobial soap) and water after caring for or contacting patients with CDI (B -III). f. After using the toilet, blowing the nose or covering a sneeze, g. After assisting client with using the bathroom, h. Before eating, drinking, handling food, or serving food, i. When hands are visibly dirty/soiled or contaminated with proteinaceous material and/or blood or other body fluids soap and water should be used first, (1) An alcohol -based hand rub for routinely decontaminating hands all other clinical situations is acceptable. j. Before donning sterile gloves to insert urinary catheters, vascular catheters or other invasive devices, k. Before eating and after using a restroom. 2. Antimicrobial impregnated wipes (towelettes) may be used as an alternative to washing hands with non- antimicrobial soap and water. They are not as effective as alcohol based hand rubs or washing hands with antimicrobial soap and water. 3. Paper towels should be used to dry hands after soap and water washing; paper towel used to turn off faucet then discarded in trash. OTHER ASPECTS OF HAND HYGIENE: 1. Caregivers are not to wear artificial fingernails or extenders when having direct contact with client at risk (i.e. immunosuppressed, etc.). 2. Natural nail tips are to be kept less than 1/4-inch long. 3. Gloves are to be worn during client care when there is risk of contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, mucus membranes, and non- intact skin could occur. 4. Rings are discouraged with the exception of a plain wedding band. PAGE 9 BAG TECHNIQUE Policy: The Agency provides guidelines for use of the bag used to carry equipment and supplies into the client's home. It is the policy of this Agency that all staff shall utilize proper bag technique, following the agency procedure, when conducting home visits. This procedure is reviewed during Agency orientation and with competency evaluations. Purpose: To maximize infection control and minimize potential for cross contamination of infectious microorganisms. ALL FIELD STAFF ARE EXPECTED TO: 1. Select and prepare adequate work space from which to use the bag. Since floors are considered to be highly contaminated, bags are never to be placed on floor. 2. In order to keep the bag as clean as possible, bag is to be kept zipped and in a clean protected area in home and car. 3. When carrying bag into the home it is to be kept on the shoulder until a barrier can be placed on a table or a hard chair. Barrier is discarded after use. 4. When virulent organism infection or vermin are present, place the supplies you will need in 2 plastic bags to take into the home. After caring for the patient/client, take your supplies by pulling the inside bag out of the outside one. The outside bag becomes \"dirty\" and is discarded in the home. 5. The most effective form of infection control is good hand washing. Employees must cleanse hands before entering/removing supplies from bag, before examination and place on clean side of barrier . 6. To minimize the need for rummaging through the bag and decreasing the potential for the introduction of organisms, the bag is to be kept as orderly as possible, with a minimum of necessary items, so that items can be easily found and reached (such as tape measure or flashlight). 7. If additional supplies are needed during the visit, hands are to be cleansed before re-entering bag. Alcohol - based hand sanitizer gel may be used. Careful planning limits this occurrence. 8. Thermometer technique: In order to minimize cross infection, thermometer covers are always used. The thermometer is cleansed with disinfectant wipe in between patients/clients. 9. All equipment is cleansed with disinfectant after use and before returning to the bag. Example: scissors after removal of a dressing and bell of stethoscope. A disposable tape measure is used if part measured is an open wound. 10. It is recommended to use plastic measuring sheets to measure pressure sores, etc. and that these sheets should be left in the home. 11. In order to keep the bag as clean as possible, once a week (or as indicated), the outside of the bag is wiped with a disinfectant solution such as Lysol wipes. 12. Once a month (or as indicated), all supplies are removed from the bag and the bag is thoroughly cleansed, dried and clean equipment returned. 13. When breaks in technique occur all staff will be instructed by the Director regarding proper bag technique and will be required to perform a return demonstration of correct bag technique. A joint visit with the Director is required. An additional joint visit is made in six months to ensure continued compliance. PAGE 10 Communication Barriers PAGE 11 Communication is a process beginning with a sender who encodes the message and passes it through some channel to the receiver who decodes the message. Communication is fruitful if and only if the messages sent by the sender is interpreted with same meaning by the receiver. If any kind of disturbance blocks any step of communication, the message will be destroyed. Due to such disturbances, managers in an organization face severe problems. Thus the managers must locate such barriers and take steps to get rid of them. Effective communication requires messages to be conveyed clearly between communicators, but along the way there are many communication barriers that can create misunderstandings and misinterpretations of your message. There are several barriers that affects the flow of communication in an organization. These barriers interrupt the flow of communication from the sender to the receiver, thus making communication ineffective. It is essential for managers to overcome these barriers. The main barriers of communication are summarized below. Successful communication requires knowing what barriers to communication exist and how to navigate around these roadblocks. Physical Barriers - These barriers are those that separate people from each other and mark territories. This type of barrier can often be seen in the workplace where offices and closed doors stop communication. Language Barriers - Not using words another can understand will certainly stop your message from being conveyed. This not only applies to actual languages, but that of expressions, buzz words, and other jargon. If one is not familiar with your language, m isinterpretation will occur. Gender Barriers - Variation exists among masculine and feminine styles of communication. While women often emphasize politeness, empathy, and rapport building, male communication is often more direct. Meshing these two styles without awareness could be become a barrier. Interpersonal Barriers - These are barriers are created to distance themselves from others. These can be done through withdrawal, meaningless rituals which keep one devoid of real contact, superficial activities through pastimes, and more. Perceptual Barriers - Different world views can create misunderstanding. Without thinking, one might only view a message from their mindset rather than looking to see it from another viewpoint. PAGE 12 Cultural Barriers - Ethnic, religious, and social differences can often create misunderstandings when trying to communicate. These differences can also affect perceptual factors, as mentioned above. Emotional Barriers - Trouble listening can occur if one is consumed with emotion. Hostility, anger, fear, and other emotions make it hard to hear outside of one's self. Overcoming these barriers to communication is no easy task. It takes great awareness and a willingness to adapt and look at communication from new perspectives. But, if you begin to focus on how these communication barriers are affecting your everyday conversation, you will be well on your way to becoming an effective communicator. WRITTEN COMMUNICATION Written communication has great significance in today's business world. It is an innovative activity of the mind. Effective written communication is essential for preparing worthy promotional materials for business development. Speech came before writing. But writing is more unique and formal than speech. Effective writing involves careful choice of words, their organization in correct order in sentences formation as well as cohesive composition of sentences. Also, writing is more valid and reliable than speech. But while speech is spontaneous, writing causes delay and takes time as feedback is not immediate. Advantages of Written Communication Written communication helps in laying down apparent principles, policies and rules for running of an organization. It is a permanent means of communication. Thus, it is useful where record maintenance is required. It assists in proper delegation of responsibilities. While in case of oral communication, it is impossible to fix and delegate responsibilities on the grounds of speech as it can be taken back by the speaker or he may refuse to acknowledge. Written communication is more precise and explicit. Effective written communication develops and enhances an organization's image. It provides ready records and references. Legal defenses can depend upon written communication as it provides valid records. Disadvantages of Written Communication Written communication does not save upon the costs. It costs huge in terms of stationery and the manpower employed in writing/typing and delivering letters. Also, if the receivers of the written message are separated by distance and if they need to clear their doubts, the response is not spontaneous. PAGE 13 Written communication is time -consuming as the feedback is not immediate. The encoding and sending of message takes time. Effective written communication requires great skills and competencies in language and vocabulary use. Poor writing skills and quality have a negative impact on organization's reputation. Too much paper work and e -mails burden is involved. Non Verbal Communication Non- verbal communications are the communication of feelings, emotions, attitudes, and thoughts through body movements / gestures / eye contact, etc. The components of non-verbal communication include: Kinesics: It is the study of facial expressions, postures & gestures. Did you know that while in Argentina to raise a fist in the air with knuckles pointing outwards expresses victory, in Lebanon, raising a closed fist is considered rude? Oculesics: It is the study of the role of eye contact in non-verbal communication. Did you know that in the first 90 secs - 4 min you decide that you are interested in someone or not. Studies reveal that 50% of this first impression comes from non- verbal communication which includes oculesics. Only 7% of comes from words - that we actually say. Haptics: It is the study of touching. Did you know that acceptable level of touching vary from one culture to another? In Thailand, touching someone's head may be considered as rude. Proxemics: It is the study of measurable distance between people as they interact. Did you know that the amount of personal space when having an informal conversation should vary between 18 inches - 4 feet while, the personal distance needed when speaking to a crowd of people should be around 10- 12 feet? Chronemics: It is the study of use of time in non-verbal communication. Have you ever observed that while AN employee will not worry about running a few minutes late to meet a colleague, a manager who has a meeting with the CEO, a late arrival will be considered as a nonverbal cue that he / she does not give adequate respect to his superior? Paralinguistics: It is the study of variations in pitch, speed, volume, and pauses to convey meaning. Interestingly, when the speaker is making a presentation and is looking for a response, he will pause. However, when no response is desired, he will talk faster with mini mal pause. Physical Appearance: Your physical appearance always contributes towards how people perceive you. Neatly combed hair, ironed clothes and a lively smile will always carry more weight than words. Remember, \"what we say\" is less important than \"how we say it\" as words are only 7% of our communication. Understand and enjoy non-verbal communication as it helps forming better first impressions. Language Barriers Language barrier is a figurative phrase used primarily to indicate the difficulties faced when people who have no language in common attempt to communicate with each other. More than 46 million people in the United States do not speak English as their primary language, and more than 21 million speak English less than \"very well.\" Persons who have limited English proficiency are less likely to have a regular source of primary care and are less likely to receive preventive care. They also are less satisfied with the care that they do receive are more likely to report overall problems with care and may be at increased risk of experiencing medical errors. PAGE 14 Since federal laws stipulate no one can be denied or forced to wait for medical care due to language barriers, some healthcare providers resort to secondary strategies like drawings and hand signals to compensate for gaps in communication. Still, the possibility for error is simply too high. To help alleviate these issues, patients are often urged to bring a bilingual friend or familiar member to explain their medical problems. Hospitals and healthcare facilities, based on the population they serve, translate documents to ensure patients complete all required paperwork properly. Brochures and resources are provided to those who speak limited English to help facilitate their participation in American society and encourage them to take ownership of their health. Because most health care organizations provide either inadequate interpreter services or no services at all, patients who have limited English proficiency do not receive needed health care or quality health care. Often, persons enlisted to help patients communicate with health care providers are not trained interpreters; instead, they are fellow patients or are family members, friends, untrained nonclinical employees, or non- fluent health care professionals. Reliance on such ad hoc services has been shown to have negative clinical consequences. Many health care providers do not provide adequate interpreter services because of the financial burden such services impose. However, these providers fail to take into account both the consequences of not providing the services and the potential cost benefits of improving communication with their patients. The failure of health care providers to consider these issues is at least partially attributable to t he paucity of data documenting the full costs and benefits of interpreter services. To acquire a better understanding of these costs and benefits, we assessed the impact of implementing a new interpreter service program on the cost and utilization of health care services among patients with limited English proficiency. Tips for Communicating with Deaf and Hard -of-Hearing People Deafness is a fact of many people's lives ... more than 22 million Americans have some form of hearing loss. Like their hearing counterparts, deaf people build successful careers, have families, watch television, go to the movies, talk on the telephone, play sports, and travel throughout the world. Most deaf people don't view their deafness as a disability or as a problem that should be fixed. For many of them, it's a natural part of a cultural experience that they share with friends, both deaf and hearing. Deaf culture is a sense of community among deaf people. Cultural activities can include communicating in American Sign Language (ASL), sharing information about resources that can enhance deaf people's lives, performing and attending theatrical events with no spoken language, joking about the experience of being deaf, and reflecting on role models and events important to deaf people. All of us have our own way of doing things, and deaf people are no different. Deaf people communicate in different ways, depending on several factors: age at which deafness began; type of deafness; language skills; amount of reading skills; speech abilities; personality; family environment; educational background; and personal preference. Some deaf people use speech or sign language only ... or a combination of sign language, Finger spelling, and speech ... or writing ... or body language and facial expression. You can communicate with deaf people in several ways. The key is to find out which combination of techniques works best with each deaf person. Keep in mind that it is not how you exchange ideas, but that you do. To Communicate with a Deaf Person in a One \u2014to- One Situation: Get the deaf person's attention before speaking . Call out the person's name; if that is not successful, a tap on the shoulder, a wave, or another visual signal usually does the trick. Key the deaf person in to the topic of discussion . Deaf people need to know what subject matter will be discussed in order to pick up words that help them follow the conversation. This is especially important for deaf people who depend on speechreading. PAGE 15 Speak slowly and clearly, but do not yell, exaggerate, or over pronounce. Exaggeration and overemphasis of words distort lip movements, making speechreading more difficult. Try to enunciate each word without force or tension. Short sentences are easier to understand than long ones. Look directly at the deaf person when speaking. Avoid turning away to write on the board, look at a computer screen, or pull something from a file while speaking. Do not place anything in your mouth when speaking. Mustaches that obscure the lips, smoking, pencil chewing, and putting your hands in front of your face all make it difficult for deaf people to follow what is being said. Maintain eye contact with the deaf person. Eye contact conveys the feeling of direct communication. Even if an interpreter is present, continue to speak directly to the deaf person. He/she will turn to the interpreter as needed. Use the words I and you when communicating through an interpreter, not \"Tell him...\" or \"Does she understand?\" Avoid standing in front of a light source, such as a window or bright light. The glare and shadows created on the face make it almost impossible for the deaf person to speech read. First repeat, then try to rephrase a thought if you have problems being understood, rather than repeating the same words again. If the person only missed one or two words the first time, one repetition usually helps. Don't hesitate to communicate by pencil and paper if necessary, as particular combinations of lip movements sometimes are difficult to speech read. Getting the message across is more important than the medium used. Use pantomime, body language, and facial expression to help supplement your communication. A lively speaker always is more interesting to watch. Be courteous to the deaf person during conversation. If the telephone rings or someone knocks at the door, excuse yourself and tell the deaf person that you are answering the phone or responding to the knock. Do not ignore the deaf person and carry on a conversation with someone else while the deaf person waits. Use open -ended questions that must be answered by more than \"yes\" or \"no\". Do not assume that deaf people have understood your message if they nod their heads in acknowledgement. A coherent response to an open- ended question ensures that your information has been communicated. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guarantees equal opportunities in the workplace for people with disabilities. Accommodations made will vary depending on deaf employees' job responsibilities, technical skills, and communication preferences as well as the characteristics of the organization. It generally is not necessary to make major modifications in the work area to accommodate a deaf employee. There are some things you can do, however, to make the work area more accessible and therefore more comfortable for a deaf employee. Consider the deaf person's sensitivity to noise. It is a myth that deaf people can work in noisy environments that hearing people cannot tolerate. Most deaf people have some residual hearing and are bothered by loud noises. A noisy environment may create a barrier to communication for someone who wears a hearing aid. Loud or background noises can interfere with and distort the sound amplification of a person's hearing aid, m aking speech discrimination difficult. Loud noises also may further damage whatever residual hearing the deaf person has. Consider the buddy system for a new deaf employee. This can make the job transition much easier for the deaf person. A co- worker can be asked to check a deaf employee's awareness of emergency situations; such as fires or evacuation. PAGE 16 Use signaling devices if a deaf employee works alone in an area. Most of these devices are inexpensive and can be incorporated easily into existing alarm systems. Alarms to warn of fire or gas leaks by use of a flashing light and audio signal can plug into regular electrical outlets. Other devices indicate machine malfunction, doorbells, and ringing telephones. Minimize vibration in the work area. Vibration can distort the sound being received by a hearing aid, making it difficult for the deaf person to concentrate on work or a conversation. Since it is not always possible to eliminate vibration, it is best to arrange meetings in a location where vibration can be minimized. Use visual clues to enhance communication. Use of a round or oval table during meetings will facilitate the line of sight between people, as will semicircular seating arrangements. Open doors or panels in offices allow deaf people to see into rooms before entering. A good line of sight between the deaf employee and the secretary also will facilitate telephone communication. Use paging devices to contact deaf employees in the field. Radio frequencies have been set aside by the Federal Communications Commission to permit the use of \"tactile pagers\" vibrating paging devices that can be used to contact or warn deaf employees in the field or in remote locations. Such pagers usually can be incorporated into existing security paging systems. Always ask deaf people if they prefer written communication. Do not assume that this is the preferred method. When using writing as a form of communication with deaf people, take into consideration English reading and writing skills. Their skills may depend on whether they were born deaf or became deaf later in life, what teaching method was used in their education, and which communication method they prefer. Keep your message short and simple. Establish the subject area, avoid assumptions, and make your sentences concise. It is not necessary to write out every word. Short phrases or a few words often are sufficient to transfer the information. Do not use yes or no questions. Open- ended questions ensure a response that allows you to see if your message was received correctly. Face the deaf person after you have written your message. If you can see each other's facial expressions, communication will be easier and more accurate. Use visual representations if you are explaining specific or technical vocabulary to a deaf person. Drawings and diagrams can help the person comprehend the information. PAGE 17 COMMUNICATIONS BARRIERS AND CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS In order to provide optimal quality care to our patients/clients, the Agency will facilitate communication with sensory -impaired patients/clients and patients/clients with limited formal education. The Agency shall attempt to arrange for bilingual staff members or an interpreter to work with non- English speaking patients/clients. 1. When the Agency assigns a staff member who does not speak the patient/client's language, the Agency will provide the services of a qualified interpreter at no charge to the patient at any hom e visit. The Limited English Proficiency (LEP) person may prefer or request to use a family member, friend or significant other. Children and other patients will not be used to interpret in order to ensure confidentiality of information and accurate comm unication. 2. Interpreters will be used when no one is available in the home to provide interpretive services. 3. Cultural considerations for all patients/clients shall be respected and observed. Where such considerations impede the provision of prescribed health care or treatment, personnel shall notify the supervisor and physician in an effort to accommodate the patient/client. 4. Every effort will be made to obtain the services of an available interpreter when necessary for persons using sign language. The Agency will advise/refer regarding telecommunications devised for the deaf. 5. Educational materials, visual aids and/or special devices will be used as needed to facilitate communication. 6. Written and verbal communication will be at an educational level that the patient/client will understand. 7. When a significant portion of the caseload does not speak English, written materials are provided in a language understandable to patients/clients. 8. Obtaining an outside interpreter if a qualified interpreter on staff is not available. An interpreter will be obtained from one of the following: Accredited Language Services - 1-800-322-0284 Verbatim Solutions 1- 800-575-5702 www.languageline.com 9. Communicating with persons who are deaf or hard of hearing the agency will use the state relay system. PAGE 18 Workplace/Patient Safety (OSHA) PAGE 19 What is OSHA? The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) of 1970 was passed to prevent workers from being killed or seriously harmed at work. The law requires employers to provide their employees with working conditions that are free of known dangers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was created, as a result, to set and enforce protective workplace safety and health standards. OSHA provides information, training and assistance to workers and their employers. Workers may file a complaint to have OSHA inspect their workplace if they believe that their employer is not following OSHA standards or that there are serious hazards (1- 800-321-6742). Workers are entitled to working conditions that do not pose a risk of serious harm. To help assure a safe and healthful workplace, OSHA also provides workers with the right to: Ask OSHA to inspect their workplace' Use their rights under the law without retaliation and discrimination' Receive information and training about hazards, methods to prevent harm and OSHA standards that apply to their workplace; Get copies of test results done to find hazards in the workplace; Review records of work -related injuries and illnesses; Get copies of their medical records. The Agency is responsible for implementing a formal, comprehensive and active safety program with written records of program activities. 1. Every safety program shall include as a minimum the following elements: (Reference the Safety Manual for appropriate management techniques and examples) a. New employee hiring practices, which include: i. Completion of an employment application. ii. A check of listed references. iii. Completion of a voluntary medical questionnaire. b. The assignment of responsibility and accountability for employee safety to appropriate supervisors who are responsible for: i. Operating procedures and job safety rules for tasks that are written within each department and will include guarding procedures and rules regarding the use of required personal protective equipment. ii. Training of all new and transferred employees with respect to safe job procedures and rules. iii. Safety training will be continually refreshed for all employees as needed. iv. A self -inspection program by responsible supervisors to detect and correct unsafe conditions or acts. 2. Safety management is the responsibility of each employee at all times in the work place, and when in the patient's home. All appropriate employees and patients/caregivers shall receive instruction in safety management including but not limited to: a. Electrical safety b. Environmental c. Bathroom safety d. Hand washing e. Infection control f. Refrigeration g. Use of gloves PAGE 20 h. Trans -filling of medical gases i. Transfers and ambulation safety j. Use of medical equipment k. Disposal of needles in a non- penetrable non- glass container l. Double boxing and bagging m. Hazardous waste handling and disposal n. Storage, handling, delivery and access to supplies, medical gases and drugs, especially chemotherapeutic agents, controlled substances, parenteral and enteral nutrition solutions and needles. 3. Patients/caregivers shall acknowledge in writing the receipt of verbal and written instructions regarding safety management. Patient care employees shall monitor the patient/caregiver's understanding and compliance with safety management on an ongoing basis. Appropriate instructions will be provided. All patient care employees will attend in service education on safety management upon employment, annually and as the need for further instruction is identified by their supervisor. 4. Patient related safety hazards will be documented in the clinical record and brought to the attention of the supervising nurse. All accidents or injuries will be reported to the supervising nurse and documented on an incident report. If the accident involves the patient, appropriate actions will be initiated and the physician will be notified to obtain specific follow -up orders. A report of safety related incidents will be presented to the Advisory Committee and governing body including the causal factors and actions to prevent a similar incident. 5. If an accident or incident involves equipment malfunction and serious injury, illness or death, the incident will be r eported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within 10 days of notification of the incident. 6. An annual report summarizing incidents occurring in the previous 12 months must be filed with the FDA. The form 3419 is located on your USB. Employers have the responsibility to provide a safe workplace that does not have serious hazards and to follow all relevant OSHA safety and health standards. Employers must find and correct safety and health problems. OSHA further requires employers to try to eliminate or reduce hazards first by making changes in working conditions rather than relying on masks, gloves or other types of personal protective equipment (PPE). Employers MUST also: Inform employees about hazards through training, labels, alarms, color -coded systems, chemical information sheets and other methods; Keep accurate records of work -related injuries and illnesses; Perform tests in the workplace, such as air sampling required by some OSHA standards; Provide hearing exams or other medical tests required by OSHA standards; Post OSHA citations, injury and illness data, and the OSHA poster in the workplace where workers will see them; Notify OSHA within 8 hours of a workplace incident in which there is a death or when three or more workers go to a hospital; Not discriminate or retaliate against a worker for using their rights under the law. Recordkeeping Requirements for the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses As in the past, OSHA requires that all recordable work -related injuries and illnesses information be reported, utilizing Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII) recordkeeping requirements annually. These forms (OSHA 300, Log of Work -Related Injuries and Illnesses) have changed to include an additional column on (M5) on Hearing Loss. PAGE 21 As of January 1, 2015, all employers must report: a. All work -related fatalities within 8 hours. b. All work -related inpatient hospitalizations, all amputations and all losses of an eye within 24 hours. OSHA Hazardous Communication Standard OSHA has revised its Hazard Communication Standard, March 2012, 77 FR 17574, (HCS) concerning classification and labeling of chemicals. This is recognized by health care providers as Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and will now be called Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). Two significant changes contained in the revised standard require the use of new labeling elements and a standardized format for Safety Data Sheets (SDS). Effective December 1, 2013, employers must have trained their workers on the new label elements and SDS format. It is important that employees understand the new label and SDS formats. The specific requirements of the revised standard will be phased in over several years (December 1, 2013 to June 1, 2016) Minimum Topics for Training: Product Identifier: This can be the chemical name, code number or batch number. The manufacturer decides the identifier and must print the identifier on both the label and in Section 1 of SDS (Identification). Signal Word: This will be used to indicate the relative level of severity of hazard and alert the reader to a potential hazard on the label. There are only 2 signal words, \"Danger\" and \"Warning\". Only one will appear on the label. Danger - used for the more severe hazards Warning - less severe hazards Pictogram: The required pictograms will be in the shape of a square set at a point and will include a black hazard symbol on a white background with a red frame. A square red frame without a hazard symbol is not a pictogram and is not permitted on the label. OSHA has designated 8 pictograms which can be used under this standard. Hazard Statements(s): This will describe the nature, and where appropriate, the degree of the hazard(s). i.e. \"Causes damage to kidneys through prolonged or repeated exposure when absorbed through the skin\". The hazard statements are specific to the hazard classification categories, and chemical users should always see the same statement for the same hazards, no matter what the chemical s or who produces it. Precautionary Statement(s): A phrase that describes recommended measures to be taken to minimize or prevent adverse effects resulting from exposure to or improper handling/storage of a hazardous chemical. Name, address and phone number of the chemical manufacturer, distributor, or importer: How the employee might use the labels in the workplace, for example, o How information on the label can be used to ensure proper storage o How the information might be used to quickly locate information on first aid when needed by employees or emergency personnel. General understanding of how the elements work together. For example, PAGE 22 o That where a chemical has multiple hazards, different pictograms are used to identify various hazards. o When precautionary statements are similar, the one providing the most protective information will be included on the label. The Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors, or importers to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDSs, formerly known as MSDSs) to communicate the hazards of hazardous chemical products. Employers must ensure that SDSs are readily accessible to employees. By June 1, 2015, the HCS will require new SDSs to be in a uniform format and include the section numbers, the headings, and associated information under the headings below: Hazard Communication Safety Data Sheets Section 1, Identification, includes product identifier; manufacturer or distributor name, address, phone number; emergency phone number; recommended use; restrictions on use. Section 2, Hazard(s) identification includes all hazards regarding the chemical; required label elements. Section3, Composition/information on ingredients includes information on chemical ingredients; trade secret claims. Section 4, First -aid measures includes important symptoms/effects, acute, delayed; required treatment. Section 5, Fire- fighting measures lists suitable extinguishing techniques, equipment; chemical hazards from fire. Section 6, Accidental release measures lists emergency procedures; protective equipment; proper methods of containment and cleanup. Section 7, Handling and storage lists precautions for safe handling and storage, including incompatibilities. Section 8, Exposure controls/personal protection lists OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs); Threshold Limit Values (TLVs); appropriate engineering controls; personal protective equipment (PPE). Section 9, Physical and chemical properties lists the chemical's characteristics. Section 10, stability and reactivity lists chemical stability and possibility of hazardous reactions. Section 11, Toxicological Information includes routes of exposure; related symptoms, acute and chronic effects; numerical measures of toxicity. *OSHA will not be enforcing sections 12 -15 as other agencies are responsible Section 16, other information includes the date of preparation or last revision NOTE: Training on the format of the SDS must include: o Standardized 16- section format, including the type of information found in the various sections (see previous example) For example, the employee should be instructed that with the new format, Section 8 will always contain information about exposure limits, engineering controls and ways to protect self, including personal protective equipment, o Section 8, Exposure controls/Personal Protection will always contain information about exposure limits, engineering controls and ways to protect self, including personal protective equipment, o Precautionary statements on label would be the same on the SDS. OSHA requires employers to present information in a manner and language that their employees can understand. If the employee speaks/reads a language other than English, the employer will PAGE 23 need to provide safety and health training in that language. OSHA's Hazard Communication website ( http://www.oshagov/dsg/hazcom/index.html ) has the following \"quick cards\" and OSHA briefs in English and Spanish to assist employers with training: o Label QuickCard o Pictogram QuickCard o Safety Data Sheet QuickCard o Safety Data Sheet OSHA Brief o Label/;Pictogram OSHA Brief Safety Committee 1. An Ad Hoc Safety committee will be organized within the agency to establish a network for communication of safety information pertaining to the work environment. 2. The Committee will be organized to distribute safety information, observe and monitor compliance with OSHA standards, determine safety needs, review problems and develop means to improve or resolve those problems. 3. The Committee will be composed of representatives appointed by the Professional Advisory Committee. 4. The Safety Committee will be responsible for distributing safety related information, monitoring compliance, maintaining and updating OSHA compliance as per OSHA standards. 2. The Safety Committee will be knowledgeable in safety subject matter and conduct training in-services. 3. Safety Committee meetings will be scheduled once yearly and as needed to address special issues or situations. 4. The Administrator sets the dates and times for the meetings of the Safety Committee and plans the agendas for the meetings. 5. The minutes of the Safety Committee meetings are reported to the Pr ofessional Advisory Committee and to the Governing Body. They are filed by the Administrator along with any and all safety reports, papers, and written recommendations. They are maintained for a minimum of five (5) years and made available upon request. 6. The Administrator is responsible for informing the employees of the decisions, actions, and recommendations of the Safety Committee. 7. Each employee of the Agency may submit suggestions, complaints, or questions to his/her supervisor to submit to the Safety Committee. 8. The Safety Committee discusses all such suggestions, complaints, and questions and takes actions when necessary. 9. The Safety Committee reviews as required, all reports of work -related injuries and loss reports in order to design, develop and implem ent corrections as needed, to eliminate and prevent injuries at work. 10. The Safety Committee reviews every work -related injury to determine what caused the injury, what could have been done to prevent it and what has been done to prevent a recurrence. PAGE 24 Patient Rights and Responsibilities PAGE 25 Patient Rights and Responsibilities Patient Rights are an integral part of healthcare today. All clients come to our Agency with different healthcare experiences and may or may not be aware of their rights. Protections are afforded by federal and state legislation and as health care providers we must educate our client about their rights and the manner in which they may exercise them. For ease of access and teaching, the patient's rights are clearly stated in one document that is called The Patient's Bill of Rights. Accessibility and Education The Bill of Rights must always be accessible to the client, family, public and staff. It can be found posted in the office and in the client's admission packet. If a client would like an additional copy, they are located in the office. Upon admission, the nurse will explain the Bill of Rights to the client and/or caregiver. The client/caregiver must be given the opportunity to ask questions. Receipt of the Bill of Rights is documented in the clinical record. The client must also be informed that he/she has the right to excursive the rights at any time without fear of reprisal. Any questions about the protections afforded by the Bill of Rights may be directed to the Administrator if the employee/ contractor cannot answer it. Key Areas Key things to remember about the Bill of Rights are: The rights can be exercised at anytime. Clients are to receive the best quality care without regard to race, creed, nationality/origi n, lifestyle choice and diagnosis. The client/caregiver ALWAYS has the right to refuse care. The client/caregiver must be informed of care prior to initiation. Privacy, including protection of PHI is paramount. The client/caregiver must be informed of charges prior to initiating service. The client has the right to be safe. The client has the right to be treated with respect. The client has the right to make concerns/ grievances known without the fear of reprisal. Specific questions about patients' rights may be directed to the Administrator. Interacting with Clients Client rights not only govern what the client may do and when, but how Agency staff interacts with the client and their environment. Appropriate and professional interaction can increase client confidence and overall satisfaction. When you are in a client's home, remember: Address the client using his or her name and the appropriate title. Nicknames like sweetie and honey are well meaning but it can come across as demeaning. Terms of endearment should never be used and nicknames should only be used if and when the client gives permission. Treat the client's property with respect. Remember although you are working, you are in someone's home! Observe cultural considerations and do not slam doors or damage personal property. Clients have the right to know who you are and what you are doing. Always introduce yourself when you enter into a client's environment and at the beginning of telephone conversations. ALWAYS wear your ID badge. Explain procedures prior to starting them . Answer questions honestly. PAGE 26 Be professional and smile. Complaints/ Grievances The client has the right to make concerns known. The Agency has a responsibility to investigate the problem and resolve the issue to the client's satisfaction in a timely manner. Upon admission the client is given a copy of the grievance process and rights pertaining to having problems resolved. If a client is upset, it is important to remember: Remain calm and objective. Respond to questions and problems promptly Do not take complaints personally Remain professional Do not yell Do not name call Do not make accusations Do not accept or assign blame Responsibilities For every right, there is a responsibility to assure that the right is exercised in a safe manner. As a healthcare provider you have the responsibility to: Listen to you patient when they tell you what they need. Do not assume you know what they need or want. Explain what you are going to do with the patient prior to starting in language that is appropriate for his/her level of development/ national origin. Be honest. If you do not know the answer to a question, redirect the question to the office. Remember client privacy! Do Secure documents with client information. Use the assigned number in place of identifying information when you can. Don't Gossip about clients . Hold conversations with or about clients in public . Encourage independence. Statement of Purpose: It is anticipated that observance of these rights and responsibilities will contribute to more effective care and greater satisfaction for the patient as well as the staff. The rights will be respected by all personnel and integrated into all Home Care programs. A copy of these rights will be given to patients and their families or designated representative. If the patient or his/her designated representative is unable to read the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, it will be read to them. If the patient or his/her representative does not speak English, a copy of these rights will be provided in a language that is understood. The patient or his/her designated representative has the right to exercise these rights. In the case of a patient adjudged incompetent, the rights of the patient are exercised by the person appointed by law to act on the patient's behalf. In the case of a patient who has not been adjudged incompetent, any legal representative may exercise the patient's rights to the extent permitted by law. Each patient receives a copy of the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities on or before admission to the agency. The Bill of Rights are based on payers and state specific requirements. Included are the some of the rights below: PAGE 27 1. To be fully informed in advance about care/service to be provided, including the disciplines that furnish care and the frequency of visits, as well as any modifications to the plan of care. 2. To choose a health care provider. 3. To access necessary professional services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This care will be appropriate and professional care relating to physician orders. 4. Be informed, both orally and in writing in advance of care being provided, of the charges, including payment for care/service expected from the third parties including Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federally funded or aided program known to the organization, Charges for services that will not be covered by the payer. 5. Receive information about the scope of services that the HHA will provide and specific limitations on those services. 6. Participate in the development and periodic revision of the plan of care. 7. Refuse care or treatment after the consequences of refusing care or treatment are fully presented. 8. To be advised that the agency complies with Subpart 1 of 42 CFR 489 and receive a copy of the organization's written policies and procedures regarding advance directives, including a description of an individual's right under applicable state law and to know that the Agency will honor the patient's advance directives in providing care. 9. Be informed of patient rights under state law to formulate an Advance Directive. 10. Have one's property and person treated with respect, consideration, and recognition of patient dignity and individuality. 11. Have patient's family or guardian exercise the patient's rights when the patient has been judged incompetent. 12. Be able to identify visiting personnel members through proper identification. 13. Be free of mistreatment, neglect, or verbal, mental, sexual and physical abuse, including injuries of unknown source, and misappropriation of patient property. 14. Voice grievances/complaints regarding treatment or care that is (or fails to be) furnished, lack of respect of property or recommend changes in policy, personnel, or care/service without restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination or reprisal and to know that grievances will be resolved and the patient notified of the resolution within 30 days. 15. Have grievances/complaints investigated regarding treatment or care that is (or fails to be) furnished, or lack of respect of property. 16. Confidentiality and privacy of all information contained in the patient record and of Protected Health Information. PAGE 28 Corporate Compliance PAGE 29 What is a Corporate Compliance program? A Corporate Compliance program is a system which is designed to detect and prevent violations of law by the agents, employees, officers and directors of a business. Although we use the general term \"corporate compliance\", the need for an effective compliance program is not limited to corporations. Any form of business entity is well served by having an effective compliance program. Why does my organization need one? In 1991, the federal government enacted the Organizational Sentencing Guidelines (Chapter 8 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines), in an effort to make the penalties for corporate crime both uniform and predictable, so as to encourage \"good corporate citizenship\". Penalties under the guidelines include fines and imprisonment, as well as \"corporate probation\", which is mandatory in the case of a business which does not have an effective compliance program in place. Probation involves intrusive federal monitoring of the organization and adoption of a government authored compliance program, which can be far more expensive and invasive than a voluntary compliance program could have been. The Guidelines take a carrot and stick approach in order to encourage businesses to police themselves. Each crime or violation is assigned a base fine, which is either increased or decreased based upon the presence of certain aggravating and mitigating factors. One such mitigating factor is the existence of an effective corporate compliance program. Under the Guidelines, an organization which has such a program may receive a substantially reduced fine, and maybe able to avoid corporate probation and criminal prosecution altogether. What Are the Potential Penalties Companies Face? Among the penalties which apply to organizations are: prison fines restitution sanctions forfeiture Corporate probation An effective corporate compliance program is designed to prevent and detect violations of law and that the organization exercised due diligence in seeking to prevent and detect criminal conduct by its employees and other agents. Due diligence requires at a minimum that the organization has a policy that is implemented and monitored for compliance. Employees can report fraud, waste and abuse to the OIG in HHS programs and be protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The agency must post information for the employee in the office. PAGE 30 PAGE 31 Corporate Compliance Policy Purpose: The Agency is committed to conducting its business in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, be they state or Federal. Interpretation unlike many laws that effect our daily lives, the laws and regulations by which the Agency must abide, cannot always be clearly interpreted by using the concept of right versus wrong. Misinterpretation, even it is unintentional, can subject the Agency to fines and other penalties and also impact its reputation in the marketplace. In such, the purpose of the Corporate Compliance Plan is to provide a corporate culture under which the Agency and its employees, from the President/CEO to the Home Health Aide, will not conduct themselves in a manner, be it wittingly or unwittingly, that would violate applicable laws and regu lations. At a minimum the Corporate Compliance Program will address the following areas: 1. Implementation of written policies, procedures and standards of conduct 2. Designation of a Compliance Officer and Compliance Committee 3. Conducting effective training and education programs 4. Develop open lines of communication between the Compliance Officer or Committee and Agency personnel for receiving complaints and protecting callers from retaliation 5. Performing internal audits to monitor compliance 6. Establishing and publicizing disciplinary guidelines for failing to comply with Agency standards and policies and applicable statutes and regulations 7. Prompt response to detected offenses through corrective action. Policy: Clearly, the policy of this Agency is to obey all laws, regulations and guidelines and the Agency's existing Policies and Procedures manuals do set forth and address the issues include in a corporate compliance plan. However, while these subjects are in virtually all cases already addressed in the sect ions of Policies listed below, the need for a distinct Corporate Compliance Plan is an obvious one and that is to assure that Corporate Compliance has its own individual focus so it can be made to work effectively. Further, it is the Agency's goal to have its Corporate Compliance Program adhere to the \"best practices\" of its industry The sections of the Policies and Manuals that address corporate compliance issues include but are not limited to: 1. ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES 2. PATIENT CARE POLICIES 3. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES 4. PERSONNEL POLICIES 8. QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT POLICY (QAPI) - all sections are pertinent. PAGE 32 Responsible Personnel 1. While it is the responsibility of all staff to implement the Agency's Corporate Compliance Plan, monitoring its compliance is the responsibility of senior staff, in particular the Administrator and the Board of Directors. 2. Further, as it has been noted above, the interpretation of laws and regulations is often complicated. While lower ranking staff will be able to make clear cut determinations, they cannot be expected to make those interpretations which are complicated or \"lie in a gray area.\" 3. It therefore becomes important to instruct staff not only on which matters they are allowed to resolv e on their own but also to report to their supervisors any instances which they come across that involve matters of law or regulation that are not entirely clear cut. 4. Such \"interpretive cases\" must be reported up the chain of command until they are resolved and when appropriate brought to the attention of the Board of Directors. 5. The Corporate Compliance Plan will be implanted under the direction of the Administrator, but the Board of Directors, itself has ultimate responsibility. The Administrator will be the Corporate Compliance Officer (CCO), or the position may be designated. 6. The Board of Directors/Governing Body will appoint a committee (The Corporate Compliance Committee) to oversee corporate compliance. It members will include: a. The Board of Directors/Governing Body or a representative b. The Administrator c. The Chief Executive Officer or a designee d. Regional Managers (if any) or designees e. The Chief Financial Officer or a consultant f. The Director of Human Resources, if such position has been established g. Ad Hoc Members as necessary. 7. The Corporate Compliance Committee will meet at least annually. Ad Hoc meetings may take place with a two- week notice given to the members. Emergency Ad Hoc meetings may be called if necessary. Telephone conferencing for absent Board members is permissible. 8. The Corporate Compliance Committee agenda for its scheduled meetings: a. A review of the report of the Corporate Compliance Officer (CCO). b. Review of fraud alerts issued by the Officer of the Inspector General. c. Review of topical issues with respect to corporate compliance in the health care industry in general and in the Home Health Care industry in particular. d. Review of \"Hot -line referrals\" made to the CCO. e. It will make recommendations with respect to the improvement of compliance efforts, which will be subject to final approval by the Board of Directors. f. It will review the effectiveness of recommendations that were implemented as the result of previous meetings. 9. The CCO will be the Administrator or a designee. His/her duties will be discussed below under the sections devoted to principle and the section devoted to procedures in greater detail but broadly will consist of efforts to assure that individual policies established by the Agency with respect to corporate compliance topics are considered to \"best practice\" that they are being obeyed consistently. PAGE 33 Principles The basic principle of the Agency's Corporate Compliance Plan is that it should always act as a good corporate citizen. It will do this by: 1. Maintaining honesty and integrity in all of its operations by adhering to a high standard of conduct. 2. Maintaining confidentiality of Agency and patient records. 3. Avoiding unauthorized use of Agency assets. 4. Maintaining job accountability at every level. 5. Avoiding conflicts of interest. 6. Refraining from patient abuse and reporting too appropriate authorities any abuse that does occur, regardless of who perpetrates it. 7. Maintaining appropriate communication with patients by assuring the integrity of patient satisfaction surveys and assuring that patients are aware of their rights and know who to call inside and outside the Agency if they feel their rights have been violated or if their care has been inadequate. 8. Adhering to the Patient's Plan of Care and following all regulations and guidelines concerning the administration of that care. 9. Adhering strictly to policies concerning the control of medication. 10. Refraining from misrepresentation in any manner be it with a patient, a contractor or any government agency or third party. 11. Refraining from the engagement in illegal or unfair trade practices such as the solicitation of patients. 12. Complying with all standards regarding billing. 13. Preparing all financial reports in a manner consistent with accepted accounting practices. 14. Complying with all l abor and employment laws, including those involving job discrimination and providing for Workman's Compensation and Unemployment Insurance, when required by law. 15. Complying with all payroll practices including those involved with withholding tax and avoiding improper withholding as detailed in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and other statutes. 16. Maintaining employee privacy. 17. Maintaining a working environment that is both safe and free of abuse and harassment. 18. Investigating promptly any abuse or violation of policy or complaint and taking corrective action. 19. Preventing individuals who have been involved in illegal activities from exercising any discretionary authority by screening them at the time they submit an employment application. With respect to The Medical Director and other applicable professional staff, the Agency will check the National Practitioner Data Bank and Cumulative Sanction Report. Members who have been sanctioned or excluded by the any federal health program or who have been debarred from contracting with any other federal agency will not be hired or contracted. 20. Committing the Agency and it contractors to abide by all state and Federal laws and regulations including, but not limited to the following: PAGE 34 a. The Federal False Claims Act b. The Stark Bill c. State licensure requirements d. Federal, state and local Civil Rights Laws PAGE 35 Procedure It is the duty of the CCO to assure adherence to all of the principles laid out in the previous paragraph. He/she will do this by: 1. Assuring that each staff member has been advised by his/her supervisor of the existence and importance of the Agency's Corporate Compliance Plan as well as their responsibilities to assure adherence to the policy. 2. Assuring that each supervisor and each and every person that the supervisors report to (together, \"Senior Staff\") fully understand the Corporate Compliance Plan and sign a statement (copy provided below) attesting to their understanding and agreement to obey it. 3. Reviewing all existing Agency policies which relate to corporate compliance to include those noted in the Policy section, above, paragraphs 1- 4. The CCO will: a. Assure that the policies are adequate, up to date and are of \"best standards quality\". b. Coordinate additions or corrections to policies as needed, report such changes t o the Corporate Compliance Committee and arrange for their presentation to Board of Directors for approval. c. The CCO will also assure that the policies are being adhered to, by noting exceptions and asking randomly questioning staff members, their supervisors and Senior Staff. d. The CCO will act as a focal point for all matters concerning corporate compliance: i. Any violation of law, regulation or Agency policies will be reported to the CCO by the supervisor of Senior Staff person promptly, once that person becomes aware of the violation. 1. The CCO will make his view known as to the appropriate action that should be taken once a violation has been discovered. If the CCO feels that the corrections are inadequate, he/she will notify the Corporate Compliance Committee and/or the Board of Directors. ii. All inquiries with respect to the interpretation of specific policies made by staff to their supervisors will also be reported to the CCO. The CCO will track and record these inquires (as well as the violations) to ascertain if there is a trend among employees as it relates to the understanding of laws, rules and policies: 1. To the extent that trends do exist the CCO will hold discussions with appropriate Senior Staff and if necessary coordinate the preparation of policies additions, as in 3.b above. iii. The Agency will encourage its Senior Staff to provide any and all input with respect to compliance to the CCO. The CCO will track all such information and any suggestions made by staff. 4. In addition to advising the CCO of violations and staff inquires with respect to corporate compliance, each department and subsidiary shall submit a well- documented status report to the Compliance Committee as part of the annual evaluation. The status report should also contain a self-assessment addressing the department or subsidiary's corporate compliance posture and experience as well as any other matters concerning corporate compliance that are relevant. 5. The CCO will prepare reports for the Corporate Compliance Committee at the time of each meeting. The report will make note of the violations that have occurred and the staff inquires and suggestions that have been made. It will include any other observations that the CCO has made with respect to Agency procedures as they affect compliance. The CCO will also make note of experiences of other Agencies as well as industry developments. PAGE 36 6. CCO reports will be more frequent when necessary. Such reports can be made to be coincident with AD Hoc meetings of the Corporate Compliance Committee or they can be completely separate if dictated by urgency. 7. The CCO reports will include recommended changes to policy subjects in the Agency's manuals. It will also include any other recommendations for changes in the Agency's procedure or in the Corporate Compliance Program itself. PAGE 37 Training and Continuing Education 1. All employees, agents representing this Agency and independent contractors providing health care services on behalf of the Agency shall receive a copy of the Corporate Compliance Policy and have an opportunity to review the program along with specific policies contained in other manuals that relate to their job functions. 2. All new employees, agents and independent contractors will likewise be so oriented, within two weeks of hiring contract date. 3. Any of th e individuals listed above who have questions regarding the program or his/her obligation under it should contact the CCO. 4. All employees, agents or independent contractor must sign and return an acknowledgment form. This acknowledgment form will become part of the personnel folder or agent/ independent contractor file. 5. Employee, agent and independent contractor training is as follows: a. Initial Training: All employees, agents and independent contractors providing health care services will be required to com plete an orientation of this program within one month following their employment or engagement. b. Certain company employees, agents or independent contractors may receive specialized training if their job activity requires it. This specialized training may focus on complex areas or on areas in which the CCO or the Corporate Compliance Committee has identified as high risk with respect to misconduct or error. c. As new developments or concerns arise with respect to corporate compliance issues the CCO or the Corporate Compliance Committee may require additional training for some individuals. d. All persons in supervisory positions are responsible for ensuring that each employee, agent and independent contractor reporting to them has attended the orientation/training sessions applicable to that person's job duties. e. Medical Directors shall be strongly encouraged to attend training sessions and review all relevant compliance policies and sign an Acknowledgment form affirming their understanding of the Program policy. PAGE 38 Compliance Statement The Corporate Compliance Statement provided below is to be acknowledged and signed by every Agency employee as well as every employee working for the Agency on a contractual basis.

Employee's printed name: Employee's signature: Date: PAGE 39 Ethics PAGE 40 Ethical Issues in Healthcare Healthcare ethics involves making well researched and considerate decisions about medical treatments, while taking into consideration a patient's beliefs and wishes regarding all aspects of their health. The healthcare industry, above any other, has a high regard for the issues surrounding the welfare of their patients. Doctors, nurses, and other professionals who have the ability to affect a patient's health are all forced to make ethical decisions on a daily basis. This power over a patient's wellbeing creates a mandatory need for all healthcare organizations to develop an ethics committee. Health care professionals practice in an environment that is complex, with many regulations, laws and standards of practice. Performing an abortion is legal but may not be considered ethical by other health care professionals or members of the public at large. Other ethical dilemmas arise at the end of life, when a decision must be made to turn off life- support machines and allow death to occur. Other common ethical issues a health care professional might face are confidentiality, relationships with patients and matters related to consent, especially in the treatment of minors. The agency's goal is to establish a written code of ethics that details the policies and procedures that determine proper conduct for all employees. The Ethics committee meets and gives direction to assist the staff, patients and their families; all working together cohesively to identify, understand, and resolve difficult ethical decisions. There are many ethical issues that may arise in regards to a patient's healthcare. These major issues as well as ways to manage them are as follows: Confidentiality - Confidentiality is both an ethical and a legal issue. Keeping information about a patient confidential is a way of showing respect for the person's autonomy; releasing information can damage the patient. There are also specific laws regarding the release of information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. The laws define exactly what information can be released and to whom. Insurance companies, for example, may not have the right to certain aspects of a patient's medical record. However, if there is risk to a third party, an ethical health care professional may need to break confidentiality to prevent harm. The Administrator needs to make sure that its patients' medical records are safeguarded. Transmission of diseases - The risk posed to healthcare professionals of acquiring a communicable disease from patients is a concern to those serving on ethical committees. This is especially true if a patient's health history is not made available to the providers. While healthcare providers do not want to make the patient uncomfortable by taking obvious protective measures, they still have every right to protect themselves from any pathogens that may be able to spread by direct or indirect contact. Aggressive marketing practices - Certain guidelines, ethics, and standards need to be adhered to when promoting and marketing an agency's services. It is extremely inappropriate for agencies to recommend unnecessary services to a patient just for the sake of profit. The main goal of the agency should be patient care, not marketing schemes. Ethical committees should always be involved in the agency's marketing practices in some way so that the result of any marketing campaign is tasteful and sincere. PAGE 41 Provided information- The information that an agency provides to advertising needs to be 100% accurate and honest. It is important that the advertisements for the agency and its services are not misleading or false. Again, the patients' welfare is most important. Patient welfare - A doctor, nurse, and any other type of healthcare professional involved in the care of a patient needs to remember their main motive: safeguarding the welfare of their patients. All personal information needs to be kept private. It is also important that physicians are honest with their patients. No matter what the healthcare provider's personal beliefs are; a patient should never be discriminated against based on race, income, or sex. Reports of such discrimination should be taken very seriously. Elde rly patients - Dealing with patients of advanced age may sometimes pose problems in regards to ethical decision making since they are not capable of making rational decisions on their own. As a result, their families are left with the responsibility of making difficult choices. This task can be incredibly difficult when the patient is terminally ill and wants to end their life in order to avoid unnecessary suffering. Even if the ethical committee has a difference of opinion regarding such matters, proper ethical protocol needs to be adhered to at all times. It is always best to check if the patient has a living will so that unnecessary confusion can be avoided. Terminally ill patients - As with elderly patients, terminally ill patients may have specific wishes for the manner in which they want their lives to end. Dealing with an issue such as euthanasia is very difficult and therefore requires a deep understanding of ethical processes. Sexual harassment - The ethical committee should be very strict about sexual harassment of any kind at the healthcare facility. There is a risk of occurrence not only between a patient and a doctor, but also between two medical practitioners. When such situations arise, the ethical committee should involve a branch of ethics called sexual ethics, which involves any issue regarding sexuality and sexual behavior. Therapies - There are different techniques and therapies that can be performed with a patie nt or victim so that any trauma or stress related to an offending incident can be alleviated. Hearings and investigations into the incident may also occur. Relationships - Relationships with patients, particularly sexual relationships, are forbidden by both the medical and nursing code of ethics. Such actions are considered serious misconduct and can result in expulsion from the profession and losing the license to practice. A sexual relationship is considered to be an abuse of power on the part of the physician or nurse, as patients are dependent and vulnerable. A sexual relationship with a patient can be very harmful, and an ethical practitioner will avoid even the appearance of sexual interest in a patient. Malpractice- Health care practitioners of all sorts face the risk of being sued for malpractice. A lawsuit may be brought from an injury related to surgery, defective equipment or medical products, care that was omitted or a deliberate act that caused harm to a patient. The risk of litigation is such that many health care professionals practice what is called defensive medicine -- for example, ordering a test or performing a procedure primarily to ensure that the patient cannot allege negligence. Consent- Patients must provide informed consent for treatment to be legal. A surgery performed without proper consent is generally considered assault, according to a 2009 article in the \"Internet Journal of Surgery.\" When treating an adolescent, the health care professional faces potential conflict between ethics and the law in certain situations. The professional might believe that parents should be kept informed of their child's health issues. In California, however, a 12- year-old can consent to medical care and counseling related to the treatment of a drug or alcohol problem, the National Center for Youth Law reports. The treating doctor cannot disclose information to the parents without the child's consent except in very specific circumstances, such as risk to another person. Discrimination - Discrimination is also another very serious issue in medical ethics. Discrimination can be because of race, gender, color, or even religion. This may happen between a patient and a medical practitioner or between a medical practitioner and another member of the healthcare team. All members of the team must always protect the welfare of the patients and of themselves as well. PAGE 42 Honesty - Being honest and giving out authentic pieces of information to the concerned parties are also common ethical issues in healthcare. When results of diagnostic tests are available, these pieces of information must be relayed to the patients and their families. Their diagnosis and other important data should also be discussed properly by the physician and the nurses so that there will be transparency in the treatment process. Giving false hopes and false reassurances are strictly discouraged. The Code of Ethics is intended to serve as a guideline to the agency in the following areas: A. Patient Rights and Responsibilities B. Relationships to Other Provider Agencies C. Fiscal Responsibilities D. Marketing and Public Relations E. Personnel Patient Rights and Responsibilities It is anticipated that observance of these rights and responsibilities will contribute to more effective patient care and greater satisfaction for the patient as well as the agency. The rights will be respected by all Agency personnel and integrated into all home care agency programs. A copy of these rights will be prominently displayed within the agency and made available to patients upon request. The patient is fully informed of all patient rights and responsibilities. The patient has the right to appropriate and professional care relating to physician orders. The patient has the right of choice of care providers. The patient has the right to receive information necessary to give informed consent prior to the start of any procedure or treatment. The patient has the right to refuse treatment within the confines of the law and to be informed of the consequences of his action. The patient has the right to privacy. The patient has the right to receive a timely response from the agency to his request for service. A patient will be admitted for service only if the agency has the ability to provide safe professional care at the level of intensity needed. The patient has the right to reasonable continuity of care. The patient has the right to be informed within reasonable time of anticipated termination of service or plans for transfer to another agency. The patient has the right to voice grievances and suggest changes in service or staff without fear of restraint or discrimination. The patient has the right to be fully informed of agency policies and charges for services, including eligibility for third- party reimbursements. The patient denied service solely on his inability to pay shall have the right of referral. The patient and the public have the right to honest, accurate, and forthright information regarding the home care industry in general and his chosen agency in particular, (e.g., cost per visit, employee qualifications, etc.). Relationship to Other Provider Agencies The principle objective of home care and hospice agencies is to provide the best possible service to patients. Agencies shall honestly and conscientiously cooperate in providing information about referrals and shall work together to assure comprehensive services to patients and their families. Staff shall engage in ethical conduct of their affairs so that maximum fair trade occurs. PAGE 43 Fiscal Responsibilities The amount of service billed is consistent with amount and type of service provided. The cost per visit includes only legitimate expenses. The medical equipment sold or rented to a patient is provided at the lowest possible cost consistent with quality, quantity, and timeliness. The salaries and benefits of the provider and administrative staff shall be consistent with the size, responsibility, and geographical location of the agency. The provider shall not engage in \"kick -backs\" and \"pay -offs.\" Marketing and Public Relations Oral and written statements will fairly represent service, benefits, cost, and agency capability. Agencies that promote their service to the public through the media shall include information descriptive of home care and hospice in general, as well as agency specific information. Personnel The agency shall be an equal opportunity employer and comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The agency shall have written personnel policies available to all employees and uniformly applied to all employees. The agency shall provide an ongoing evaluation process for all employees. The agency shall hire qualified employees and use them at the level of their competency. The agency shall provide supervision to all employees. The agency s hall provide continuing education and in- service training for all employees to update knowledge and skills needed to give competent patient care. The agency shall hire adequate staffing to meet the needs of the patients to whom they render care. The agency shall have a pay scale that is consistent with the area and pay only for those expenses for travel and business that are within a reasonable norm. PAGE 44 ETHICAL ISSUES POLICY 1. The Agency recognizes that issues of an ethical nature related to the patient/client, Agency and the provision of services may develop. Such issues may include but are not limited to: a. Informed Consent b. Decision making c. High technology and medical experimentation d. Patient/client safety e. Accepting or refusing care f. Standards of care g. Advance Directives h. Confidentiality i. Care for persons with inadequate reimbursement for services j. Right to freedom of choice, dignity and movement 2. It is the policy of the Agency to: a. Provide care within an ethical framework established by the professional disciplines provided by the Agency, established in Agency policy and procedure, and as established by law and standards of care. b. Allow the patient/client or his/her representative the right to participate in any discussion concerning ethical issues and to document such involvement. c. Have Agency staff and the patient/client's physician participate in the consideration and resolution of ethical issues. d. Furnish staff with education regarding ethics and the mechanisms available to assist them with consideration and resolution of ethical issues. 3. Patient/Client Ethical Issues a. Ethical issues for patient/clients include but are not limited to the following: i. The patient/client has a Do Not Resuscitate or Do Not Intubate order but there is conflict among the family members. ii. The patient/client and/or family is participating in and/or conducting rituals, religious healing activities or other behaviors that are disturbing to the employee and/or causing the employee to be concerned for the patient/client's well -being. iii. The family and physician are concealing from the patient/client true information about his condition. iv. The physician does not respond to requests for care that the nurse believes is necessary, i.e. an increase or decrease in pain medication, testing for TB, to be seen by the physician, etc. PAGE 45 v. The patient/client refuses to accept assistance the employee feels are necessary, i.e. bathing, food stamps, companion, homemaker, ALF placement, etc. vi. The patient/client refuses part of the ordered care (i.e., nursing) but chooses to accept another part of the ordered care (i.e., pharmacy). vii. There is obvious drug use or other unusual or illegal activity in the patient/client's home which jeopardizes the employee's safety. b. The Agency will convene an Ad Hoc Committee of the Pr ofessional Advisory Committee to discuss and attempt to resolve ethical issues that arise. This committee will meet for ethical issues arise. The Agency's Medical Director/Advisor and the Agency employees involved in the patient/client's care will be inclu ded in the Ethics Committee. c. The patient/client's physician (or if unavailable, the Agency's Medical Director/Advisor), and the Agency employees involved in the patient/client's care will be included in the Ethics Committee. d.

Minutes shall be kept of the meeting, and as appropriate, staff, the patient/client and the patient/client's physician shall be advised of the results of the meeting in a manner appropriate to the individual situation. 4. Ethical Issues For Employees a. The Agency recognizes that from time to time staff members' personal values and beliefs enter into their ability to provide care. Such issues include but are not limited to: i. Working or traveling on certain religious holidays ii. Right to life issues iii. Administering blood transfusions iv. Respecting an individual decision not to seek medical care because of their religious beliefs v. Ethnic and sexual orientation issues for care vi. Termination of life support systems and participation in certain advanced directive decisions vii. Conflicting ethical, cultural or religious beliefs b. It is the Agency policy that: i. Refusal of an individual staff member to participate in certain aspects of care based upon personal values and beliefs will not disrupt the patient/client's care. PAGE 46 ii. When a situation arises for care that is in conflict with individual staff values and beliefs there is an alternative method of care. iii. Individual performance evaluations will appropriately reflect the manager's consideration of motives related to refusal to participate based upon cult ural values or religious beliefs. PAGE 47 TB/Blood borne Pathogens PAGE 48 What are blood borne pathogens? Blood borne pathogens are infectious microorganisms in human blood that can cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Needlesticks and other sharps -related injuries may expose workers to blood borne pathogens. Workers in many occupations, including first responders, housekeeping personnel in some industries, nurses and other healthcare personnel, all may be at risk for exposure to blood borne pathogens. What can be done to control exposure to blood borne pathogens? In order to reduce or eliminate the hazards of occupational exposure to blood borne pathogens, an employer must implement an exposure control plan for the worksite with details on employee protection measures. The plan must also describe how an employer will use engineering and work practice controls, personal protective clothing and equipment, employee training, medical surveillance, hepatitis B vaccinations, and other provisions as required by OSHA's Blood borne Pathogens Standard ( 29 CFR 1910.1030 ). Engineering controls are the primary means of eliminating or minimizing employee exposure and include the use of safer medical devices, such as needleless devices, shielded needle devices, and plastic capillary tubes. How do I find out about employer responsibilities and workers' rights? Workers have a right to a safe workplace. The law requires employers to provide their employees with safe and healthful workplaces. The OSHA law also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for exercising their rights under the law (including the right to raise a health and safety concern or report an injury). For more information see www.whistleblowers.gov or Workers' rights under the OSH Act. OSHA can help answer questions or concerns from employers and workers. To reach your regional or area OSHA office, go to the OSHA Offices by State webpage or call 1- 800-321-OSHA (6742). Small businesses may contact OSHA's free On-site Consultation services funded by OSHA to help determine whether there are hazards at their worksites. To contact free consultation services, go to OSHA's On-site Consultation webpage or call 1- 800-321-O SHA (6742) and press number 4. Workers may file a complaint to have OSHA inspect their workplace if they believe that their employer is not following OSHA standards or that there are serious hazards. Workers can file a complaint with OSHA by calling 1 -800-321-OSHA (6742), online via eComplaint Form , or by printing the complaint form and mailing or faxing it to the local OSHA area office. Complaints that are signed by a worker are more likely to result in an inspection. If you think your job is unsafe or if you have questions, contact OSHA at 1- 800-321-OSHA (6742). Your contact will be kept confidential. We can help. For other valuable worker protection information, such as Workers' Rights, Employer Responsibilities, and other services OSHA offers, visit OSHA's W orkers' page. Blood borne pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, are present in blood and body fl uids and can cause disease in humans. The blood borne pathogens of primary concern are hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. These and other blood borne pathogens are spread primarily through: Direct contact . Infected blood or body fl uid from one person enters another person's body at a correct entry site, such as infected blood splashing in the eye. Indirect contact. A person's skin touches an object that contains the blood or body fluid of an infected person, such as picking up soiled dressings contaminated with an infected person's blood or body fluid. PAGE 49 Respiratory droplet transmission. A person inhales droplets from an infected person, such as through a cough or sneeze. Vector -borne transmission . A person's skin is penetrated by an infectious source, such as an insect bite. Follow standard precautions to help prevent the spread of blood borne pathogens and other diseases whenever there is a risk of exposure to blood or other body fluids. These precautions require that all blood and other body fl uids be treated as if they are infectious. Standard precautions include maintaining personal hygiene and using personal protective equipment (PPE), e ngineering controls, work practice controls, and proper equipment cleaning and spill cleanup procedures. TO PREVENT INFECTION, FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES: Avoid contact with blood and other body fluids. Use CPR breathing barriers, such as resuscitation masks, when giving ventilations (rescue breaths). Wear disposable gloves whenever providing care, particularly if you may come into contact with blood or body fluids. Also wear protective coverings, such as a mask, eyewear and a gown, if blood or other body fluids can splash. Cover any cuts, scrapes or sores and remove jewelry, including rings, before wearing disposable gloves. Change gloves before providing care to a different patient. Remove disposable gloves without contacting the soiled part of the gloves and dispose of them in a proper container. Thoroughly wash your hands and other areas immediately after providing care. Use alcohol - based hand sanitizer where hand- washing facilities are not available if your hands are not visibly soiled. When practical, wash your hands before providing care. TO REDUCE THE RISK 0F EXPOSURE, FOLLOW THESE ENGINEERING AND WORK PRACTICE CONTROLS: Use biohazard bags to dispose of contaminated materials, such as used gloves and bandages. Place all soiled clothing in marked plastic bags for disposal or cleaning. Biohazard warning labels are required on any container holding contaminated materials. Use sharps disposal containers to place sharps items, such as needles. FACT SHEET PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS Clean and disinfect all equipment and work sur faces soiled by blood or body fluids. Use a fresh disinfectant solution of approximately 1\u00bd cups of liquid chlorine bleach to 1 gallon of water ( 1-part bleach per 9 parts water, or about a 10% solution) and allow it to stand for at least 10 minutes. Scrub soiled boots, leather shoes and other leather goods, such as belts, with soap, a brush and hot water. If worn, wash and dry uniforms according to the manufacturer's instructions. IF YOU ARE EXPOSED, TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS IMMEDIATELY: Wash needlestick injuries, cuts and exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. If splashed with blood or potentially infectious material aroun d the mouth or nose, fl ush the area with water. PAGE 50 If splashed in or around the eyes, irrigate with clean water, sal ine or sterile irrigants for 20 minutes. Report the incident to the appropriate person identi ed in you r employer's exposure control plan immediately. Additionally, report the incident to emergency medical services (EMS) personnel who take over care. Record the incident by writing down what happened. Include the date, time and circumstances of th e exposure; any actions taken after the exposure; and any other information required by your employer. Seek immediate follow -up care as identi ed in your employer's exposure control plan. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations require employers to have an exposure control plan, a written program outlining the protective measures the employer will take to eliminate or minimize employee exposure incidents. The exposure control plan guidelines should be made available to employees and should speci cally explain what they need to do to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Additionally, OSHA requires that a hepatitis B vaccination series be made available to all employees who have occupational exposure within 10 working days of initial assignment, after appropriate training has been completed. However, employees may decide not to have the vaccination. The employer must make the vaccination available if an employee later decides to accept the vaccination. Post Exposure Evaluation and Follow -up Procedures will be as follows: 1. Following a report of an exposure incident, the Agency shall refer the employee for consultation, serologic testing, treatment and counseling, if necessary, and follow up. 2. The Agency will make immediately available to the exposed employee a confidential report of: a. Documentation of the route(s) of exposure and the circumstances under which the exposure incident occurred. 3. Identification and documentation of the source individual, unless the employer can establish identification is not feasible or prohibited by state or local law. 4. The Agency will assist in obtaining the source individual's consent for serologic testing to determine HBV and HIV infectivity. If consent cannot be obtained, it will be established that legally required consent cannot be obtained. 5. When the source individual is already known to be infected with HBV or HIV, testing for the source individual's known HBV or HIV status need not be repeated. 6. Results of the source individual's testing shall be made available to the exposed employee and the employee shall be informed of applicable laws and regulations concerning disclosure of the identity and infectious state of the source ind ividual. 7. The exposed employee's blood shall be collected as soon as feasible and tested after consent is obtained. If the employee consents to baseline blood collection, but does not give consent at that time for HIV serologic testing, the sample must be preserved for 90 days. If, within 90 days of the exposure incident, the employee elects to have the baseline sample tested, such testing should be ordered as soon as possible. 8. When post -exposure prophylaxis is determined by the physician to be medically indicated as per the standards of the U.S. Public Health Service, counseling and evaluation of the reported illness will be given. PAGE 51 9. The Agency will ensure that the physician evaluating an employee after an exposure incident is provided with the following inf ormation: a. A copy of OSHA regulation 29 CFR. b. A description of the exposed employee's duties as they relate to the exposure incident. c. Documentation of the route(s) of exposure and circumstances under which exposure occurred. d. Results of the source individual's blood testing, if available. e. All medical records relevant to the appropriate treatment of the employee including vaccination status. 10. The Agency shall obtain and provide the employee with a copy of the written opinion for post - exposure and follow -up withi n 15 days of the completion of the evaluation. The physician's written opinion for post -exposure evaluation and follow -up will be limited to the following information: a. That the employee has been informed of the results of the evaluation. b. That the employee has been told about any medical conditions resulting from exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials which require further evaluation or treatment. c. All other findings of diagnosis shall remain confidential and shall not be included in the written report. PAGE 52 TB INFECTIOUS CONTROL POLICY Policy It shall be the policy of this agency to adhere to the OSHA standards related to respiratory protection and the current CDC guidelines for tuberculosis infection control. The agency does not admit TB patients to service and per CDC guidelines considers to be at low to medium risk. Yearly the agency as part of the annual evaluation and Infection control assessment will re- evaluate the risk based on current CDC guidelines, the risk definitions below and the local health department TB reported statistics. This evaluation will determine if the policy requirements for employee TB testing will be adjusted. Purpose: This plan is designed to prescribe practices relating to the management of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis in an effort to minimize the risk of exposure and transmission of this disease to home care staff, patients and others. It shall be available for review by all staff. Definitions : 1. High Risk: a. The Agency PPD test conversion rate is significantly greater than previous conversion rates and epidemiological investigation suggests Agency acquired transmission or M. Tuberculosis, or b. A cluster of PPD conversions has occurred and epidemiological investigation suggests Agency acquired transmission of M. Tuberculosis, or c. Evidence of ongoing transmission of M. Tuberculosis. 2. Intermediate Risk: a. The Agency cares for three (3) or more TB patients per year, b. The PPD test conversion rate is the same as previous conversion rates for the Agency, c. No clusters of PPD test conversions have occurred, and d. No person- to-person transmission of M. Tuberculosis has been detected. 3. Low Risk: a. The Agency cares for less than three (3) TB patients per year, b. The PPD test conversion rate is the same as previous conversion rates for the Agency, c. No clusters of PPD test conversions have occurred, and d. No person- to-person transmission of M. Tuberculosis has been detected. 4. Very Low Risk: a. The Agency does not admit patients with active TB; patients who may have active TB are referred to a collaboratively agency, and b. The Agency provides services to communities of counties where TB cases have been reported during the previous year. PAGE 53 5. Minimal Risk: a. The Agency does not admit TB patients; patients who may have active TB are referred to a collaborative agency and b. The agency provides services to communities or counties where no TB cases have been reported during the previous year. Procedures and Responsibilities: 1. The administration of this plan shall be the responsibility of the Agency Administrator and/or the most appropriate designee. 2. Agency will follow current CDC guidelines for TB monitoring & testing. a. The 2 step Mantoux PPD test shall be required for all Agency field staff with patient contact upon hire (or a negative 2 step test completed within 12 months of hire) and a TB questionnaire every year, unless they have a positive result from the Mantoux test, in which case a chest x -ray is conducted. In accordance with CDC guideline, no follow up chest X -Ray is required, only an annual TB Verification/Attestation/ TB questionnaire 3. Agency staff and patients will be screened for exposure to TB. a. All Agency staff members who have not previously converted to a positive Mantoux PPD, will be screened for exposure to TB when being hired and as indicated by CDC guidelines, using the Mantoux 2 step PPD test administered and interpreted by a physician, ARNP or trained personnel. b. If the Agency staff being screened for exposure to TB when being hired does not have documentation of a PPD within the past six (12) months, a 2 step Mantoux test will be administered. c. Agency staff members who have converted to a positive Mantoux PPD will not be given a Mantoux PPD test on hire, but will be requested to submit a baseline negative chest x -ray report.

PAGE 59 Medical Device Act PAGE 60 MDR Overview Each year, the FDA receives several hundred thousand medical device reports of suspected device- associated deaths, serious injuries and malfunctions. Medical Device Reporting (MDR) is one of the post market surveillance tools the FDA uses to monitor device performance, detect potential device- relate d safety issues, and contribute to benefit -risk assessments of these products. Mandatory reporters (i.e., manufacturers, device user facilities, and importers) are required to submit certain types of reports for adverse events and product problems to the FDA about medical devices. In addition, the FDA also encourages health care professionals, patients, caregivers and consumers to submit voluntary reports about serious adverse events that may be associated with a medical device, as well as use errors, product quality issues, and therapeutic failures. These reports, along with data from other sources, can provide critical information that helps improve patient safety. Mandatory Medical Device Reporting Requirements: The Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation ( 21 CFR 803) contains mandatory requirements for manufacturers, importers, and device user facilities to report certain device- related adverse events and product problems to the FDA. Manufacturers: Manufacturers are required to report to the FDA when they learn that any of their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA when t hey become aware that their device has malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Importers: Importers are required to report to the FDA and the manufacturer when they learn that one of their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. The importer must report only to the manufacturer if their imported devices have malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Device User Facilities: A \"device user facility\" is a hospital, ambulatory surgical facility, nursing home, outpatient diagnostic facility, or outpatient treatment facility, which is not a physician's office. User facilities must report a suspected medical device- related death to both the FDA and the manufacturer. User facilities must report a medical device- related serious injury to the manufacturer, or to the FDA if the medical device manufacturer is unknown. A user facility is not required to report a device malfunction, but can voluntarily advise the FDA of such product problems using the voluntary MedWatch Form FDA 3500 under FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program. Healthcare professionals within a user facility should familiarize themselves with their institution's procedures for reporting adverse events to the FDA. Voluntary Medical Device Reporting: The FDA encourages healthcare professionals, patients, caregivers and consumers to submit voluntary reports of significant adverse events or product problems with medical products to MedWatch, the FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program or through the MedWatcher mobile app. PAGE 61 MEDICAL DEVICE/SAFETY HAZARDOUS DEVICE REPORTING 1. Definitions: a. Health hazard means a chemical for which there is statistically significant evidence based on at least one study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles that acute or chronic health effects may occur in exposed employees. b. Safety Data Sheet (SDS) means written or printed material concerning a hazardous chemical (OSHA 500:1131 CH 510 ATT 4 subpart Z). SDS is an OSHA approved method to make readily available to employees, current information and protective measures for chemical health hazards present in the work place. c. \"MDR reportable events\" are the adverse events or problems that the medical device regulation requires to be reported. For facilities, MDR reportable events include patient deaths and serious injuries that medical devices have or may have caused or contributed to, i.e., the devices may have directly caused the events or played a role in the events. d. Serious Injury*- There are three (3) possible types of serious injuries, and they are not mutually exclusive: i. Life threatening injuries; ii. Injuries that result in permanent damage or impairment; and iii. Injuries that require medical intervention to preclude permanent damage or impairment is defined as irreversible damage or impairment that is not trivial. e. Adverse events include: i. Death. ii. Life-threatening events. iii. Hospitalization- initial or prolonged. iv. Disability. v. Congenital Anomaly. vi. Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage. f. Malfunction is the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or to perform as intended. A malfunction is reportable when it is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. The regulation assumes that a malfunction will recur. 2. The Agency chooses to rely upon the evaluation of hazards provided by the chemical manufacturer or importer. 3. Procedures are implemented to document the reporting of medical device safety hazards and the subsequent corrective action taken, or to prevent the reoccurrence of an unsafe act. 4. The Agency understands the importance of communication of hazards for the protection of patients and staff. 5. The reporting of medical device and safety hazards is the specific responsibility of all employees of the Agency. The Administrator has the responsibility for ensuring compliance with reporting requirements. PAGE 62 6. A report is required when the agency has information that reason- ably suggest that a device has or \"may have\" caused or contributed to a death or serious injury of a patient. If the chance that a device may have caused or contributed to an event is very remote or very unlikely, the event should not be reported. 7. A report is required when a reporting entity receives information that \"reasonably suggest\" that a device may have caused or contributed to an MDR reportable event. This includes any information such as professional, scientific or medical facts and observations or opinions that would reasonable suggest a device has caused or may have caused or contributed to a MDR reportable event. 8. All medical devices and safety hazards related to patients, personnel and visitors shall be reported immediately to assure that corrective action is taken. 9. An employee report of medical device /safety hazard occurrence should be submitted by an employee as soon as possible, listing the exact location and nature of the hazard. Upon completion, the report should be forwarded to the Administrator. 10. Upon receipt of the employee report of medical device/safety hazard, the Administrator shall conduct an investigation of the reported condition/act and document any action taken or suggested to eliminate the hazard. The manufacturer, if known, will be notified. 11. The Administrator will then forward the report to the Chairman of the QAPI Committee for further review and analysis. Summaries of all such reported hazards shall be documented in the minutes of the committee meeting. 12. All records will be retained for audit and reporting purposes. They will be retained for a minimum of five years. 13. The FDA will be notified by the Administrator when incidents result in serious injury, illness or death or manufacturer unknown. The manufacturer will be notified, if known. Reports must be submitted on FDA Form 3500A (mandatory MedWatch form) within 10 days from the time that any employee or person affiliated with the agency becomes aware that the device may have caused or contributed to a death or injury. 14. The report is to include the following: a. Information about the patient. b. Type of adverse event. c. Description of the event. d. Relevant laboratory/test data and patient history. e. Manufacturer and identification of the suspect device and certain other information about the device. f. Initial reporter of the event. g. User facility/distributor name, address and contact. h.
