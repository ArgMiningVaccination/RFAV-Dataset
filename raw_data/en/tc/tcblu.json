Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine that uses very small concentrations of organic substances to cure disease. It is a pseudoscience (a belief or practice that is presented as scientific), based on concepts about how diseases work. It was created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on the doctrine of \"like cures like\", in which a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people will cure similar symptoms in sick people. Various medical groups have shown that homeopathic remedies are not fully effective at treating disease, but instead, yield results similar to those of a placebo. Some also consider that homeopathy discourages the use of real medicine.

Homeopathy is used to relieve ailments. According to the proponents of the therapy, it is indicated for any disease: chronic, acute, infectious, emotional, or psychological.
