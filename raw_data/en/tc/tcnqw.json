Also, there have been times where I nearly bought a homeopathic product myself because it looked extremely similar to a real drug and was placed on a shelf with other real drugs. How many consumers look at the active ingredients? It's doubtful many of these people intend to purchase alternative treatment. Their sale should simply be banned. I don't understand why the market for these products is protected in any way.

I don't believe in that nonsense about cannabis oil being a miracle cure but I have found certain alternatives to work. My wife has horrendous eczema on her hands and at one stage after we had our first child it flared up really badly (likely due to all the bottle washing as washing up liquids seem to set it off). We tried her usual prescription and that didn't help, got another daily use prescription and that didn't help. She was even given a prescription for a steroid cream and that made it worse. I went to a health store and they advised an alovera gel and it cleared her hand within a week. My daughter has bad constipation and is on a daily prescription of Molvacol but still had a regular cycle of her stools drying up (she had a healthy diet and enjoyed cucumbers, grapes, carrots, raisins, etc). The same health store advised I get her some chocolate probiotic balls and she's had no problems since. I don't support the homeopathy \"movement\" but equally don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water. Neither of those involve highly diluted bath water. Your wife's hands needed more moisturizer. I had the same problem, and I swear by cocoa-butter containing lotion. Regular Johnson's, or store-brand generic works for me. Aloe... not so much. Hydrocortisone cream can help for immediate symptoms and cut down eczema outbreak intensity, but it doesn't treat the underlying cause, such as dryness. As for you daughter, I suspect yogurt would've helped just as much. Perhaps what's more shocking was Glasziou's open-mindedness going into the review: [url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30688135#p30688135:1j65uria said:Blue Adept[/url]\":1j65uria]Homeopathy is patently insane, but \"like cures like\" isn't an entirely crazy idea.

Unfortunately, like chiropractic manipulation, supporters are difficult to convince otherwise. I spent 2 years occasionally crying with pain when tying my shoes - nothing like starting your day with \"I don't think I'm up to tying my shoes today\"-, unable to pick anything from the floor, nor to lift my legs .... whatever doctors they sent me to did hurtful things to me that didn't fix me. I then went to a chiropractor and in 1 session I was fixed. I cried again -for joy this time- getting out of his office and back on the street, and actually did a crazy dance on the sidewalk, got home, the rest is X-rated. I'm all for the scientific approach. Chiropaxy fixed me, and Homeopathy kept me healthy for years (we do it differently in France though, Homeopaths are also \"real\" doctors, mine switched to allopathy several times, though less than once/yr). I know both shouldn't work. But they did and do for me.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) of 1938 recognized homeopathic preparations as drugs, but with significant exceptions. A principal sponsor of the Act was New York Senator and homeopathic physician Royal Copeland, who ensured that homeopathy's own Homopathic Pharmacopia of the United States (HPUS) be included, as it expressed the \"self-professed quality standards\" of the homeopathic profession. The finished Act thus created loopholes for the regulation of homeopathic drugs, and they are thus exempted from many of the rules regulating other drugs. The inclusion of HPUS in the Act has since been questioned by \"lawyers, doctors, homeopaths, historians, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials.\" [url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30687201#p30687201:2opxv4rn said: [url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30689349#p30689349:13o3nmhg said:bickle2[/url]\":13o3nmhg][url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30687563#p30687563:13o3nmhg said:ChrisSD[/url]\":13o3nmhg]I'd agree it's fraud only if the person doesn't believe in what they're selling.

Thus, its practitioners claim that if you take a substance that causes a sickness or similar symptoms of a sickness, then dilute it [...] you create a cure. These are centuries-old ideas, and we now know they defy basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, and biology. Homeopathy is nonsense, but I don't get how people (scientists even) are always using this reasoning to explain how homeopathy is the obvious bullshit it is. because you've just explained how the science behind vaccines doesn't work. Why would you do such a thing? The \"like cures like\" law, which Ars just dismissed as \"questionable\", is the only part of homeopathy that has any scientific merit. It's the only thing that it has in common with modern medicine. It's the very basis of vaccination: take a tiny, tiny amount of the very thing you're trying to prevent, and induce the body to make antibodies for it. That basic idea is demonstrably true. Saying it defies basic biology is simply not true, and by saying so you're making people believe that vaccines don't work, which is the last thing we need. The part where homeopathy fails is the (scientifically demonstrable as false) idea that water will take on the disease's characteristics, NOT the idea that like cures like. Well, the target of treatment is not to cure the cause, or the symptoms. It's to cure the perception of symptoms. Of course, usually the best, long term way to do that is obviously treating the symptoms, or even better treating the cause. But you cannot always do that, and that's typically true for the common cold.[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30687381#p30687381:15bdpq12 said:Ricardo Cristof Remmert-Fontes[/url]\":15bdpq12]Oh well...
