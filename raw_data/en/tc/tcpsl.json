Scientific research has revealed that Acupuncture can help regulate and support our immune systems. It can boost the immune system and help to keep the body's defences strong. A healthy immune system is essential, as it protects the body from unhealthy substances, such as bacteria, germs and damaged cells, that in turn, may make you unwell or manifest as fatigue or disease. [Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://www.hatfieldpractice.co.uk/blog/2013/02/02/acupuncture-at-the-hatfield-practicewhy-visit-us/) helps to stimulate your immune system and treats the disease's underlying cause. Acupuncture treatment quickly reduces symptoms, speeds up infection healing, and normalises the body's immune response. Your immune system relies on each individual's vital health and well-being to maintain effectiveness. Poor lifestyle factors such as nutrition, stress, and exposure to disease-causing pathogens may increase the risk of becoming sick. How can Acupuncture help the immune system? Most conventional medical treatments focus on relieving symptoms rather than solving the underlying issues. Western medical treatment often aims to suppress the immune system rather than work with it. Partly because Western medicine believes presenting symptoms are due to overactivity in our immune response. Although medication helps limit symptoms and manage pain, it does not result in a cure. Side effects and other negative symptoms may present after long-term use of immune suppressive medication. Traditional Acupuncture theory believes that treating the root cause of diseases and bringing the body back to balance is essential. Experience shows that prevention before any disease onset and having Acupuncture in the early stage of a disease process is much better than treating after the disease has progressed. Restoring the immune function So how would someone suffering from an immune disorder find relief? Acupuncture can regulate immune function and treat the underlying cause of the disease by reducing symptoms, speeding up the healing of infection, and normalising the body's immune response. Acupuncture stimulates specific portions of the autonomic nervous system through carefully selected points. Research has shown that Acupuncture causes positive responses within the immune system. It can also cause a rise in [interferon levels](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1147718/full), one of the immune system's messenger hormones. Acupuncture is not a cure-all, although regular Acupuncture treatment can effectively treat [hay fever](https://www.hatfieldpractice.co.uk/blog/2020/02/28/hay-fever-relief/), asthma, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, colds, and infections well. Experience shows that prevention before any disease onset and having Acupuncture in the early stage of a disease process is much better than treating after the disease has progressed. Acupuncture and Immune Cells Acupuncture helps increase the amount of your body's immune cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and, importantly, [T-cells](https://www.britannica.com/science/T-cell). These specialised immune cells are an essential part of the immune system. They develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. They help protect the body from infection, germs and help fight cancer. They are also called T lymphocytes and thymocytes. Acupuncture also enhances and boosts the [immunity](https://acupuncture-practice.com/how-acupuncture-can-help-your-immune-system/) of those with immune-related illnesses by encouraging these cells to reproduce and strengthen the body's defences. Regular Traditional Acupuncture therapy can effectively treat asthma, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, colds, and infections. What is and how does the immune system work? Your immune system is your body's security system. You could compare it to millions of tiny hungry sharks swimming around your body, searching through the bloodstream, cells, tissues, and organs, looking for food ( damaged cells, bacteria and viruses) to consume. The immune system helps destroy and repel foreign invaders like microbes, bacteria and other parasites that can cause infections and, in some instances, like Covid 19 death. Disorders of the immune system vary from everyday frustrations like seasonal allergies to severe illnesses such as leukaemia. Lifestyle factors such as physical and emotional stress, lack of sleep, poor diet and other stressors can weaken the immune system, making you vulnerable to infections and, in the long run, disease. What effects does a weakened immune system have on the body? A weakened immune system is, without a doubt, a significant component of most long-term, chronic diseases. It is not hard to see why poor diet, lifestyle, and exposure to harmful substances harm and weaken the immune system. Once compromised, a weakened immune system results in frequent colds, Flu, allergies, and potentially reoccurring infections. Acupuncture treatments primarily help people to relax and reduce stress. Emotional and physical exhaustion is a significant factor in the immune system's ability to fight off infection. Traditional Acupuncture balances and stimulates cell production within the immune system helping to create a strong line of defence against any viruses and pathogens you may encounter. Immunity-related disorders include - Common colds [Hay Fever](https://www.hatfieldpractice.co.uk/acupuncture/hayfever-and-block-sinuses/) - Covid 19 - Many types of allergies, including eczema - Asthma and all its related factors - The immune system is at the heart of chronic fatigue - Hepatitis - AIDS - Lupus - Autoimmune disease - Many types of cancer - Rheumatoid arthritis - Multiple sclerosis - Psoriasis Traditional Acupuncture Traditional Chinese Acupuncture can treat various health conditions, including the immune system and chronic fatigue. Acupuncture stimulates and balances the immune system by normalising and calming the body's stress response. Acupuncture can boost a weakened immune system by increasing red and white cell counts, and T-cell counts in patients with immune-related illnesses. Conventional treatments used in traditional Western medicine for overactive immune system disorders, such as allergies and autoimmune diseases like arthritis, often include therapies aimed at suppressing the immune system through medication. Although that method helps limit symptoms and manage pain, it does not result in a cure. "}
