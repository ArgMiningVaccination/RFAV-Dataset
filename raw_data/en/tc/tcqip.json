However, previous studies in this area have focused on childhood immunizations, and it is unknown whether and to what extent CAM practitioners may influence the vaccina tion behavior of their adult patien ts. The purpose of this study was to describe vaccination coverage levels of adults aged 18 years according to their CAM use status and determine if there is an association between CA M use and adult vaccination coverage. Methods: Data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey, limited to 30,617 adults that provided at least one valid answer to the CAM supplement, were analyzed. Receipt of influenza vaccine during the past 12 months, pneumococcal vaccine (ever), and 1 dose of hepatitis B va ccine was self-reported. Coverage levels for each vaccine by CAM use status were determ ined for adults who were considered high priority for va ccination because of the presence of a high risk condition and for non- priority adults. Multivariable analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between CA M users and vaccination status, adju sting for demographic and healthcare utilization characteristics. Results: Overall, 36% were recent CAM users. Among priority adults, adjusted vaccination covera ge levels were significantly different between rece nt and non-CAM users for influenza (44% p-value < 0.001) vaccines but we re not significantly differ ent for hepatitis B (60% vs 56%; p-value = 0.36). Among non-priority adults, recent CAM users had significantly higher unadjusted and adjusted vaccination coverage leve ls compared to non-CAM users for all three vaccines (p-values < 0.001). Conclusion: Vaccination coverage levels am ong recent CAM users were found to be higher than non-CAM users. Because CAM use has been increasing over time in the U.S., it is important to continue monitoring CAM use and its possible influence on receipt of immunizati ons among adults. Since adult vaccination coverage levels remain below Healthy People 2010 goals, it may be benefici al to work with CAM practitioners to promote adult vaccines as preventive services in keeping with their commitment to maintaining good health.Published: 22 February 2008 BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2008, 8:6 doi:10.1186/1472-6882-8-6Received: 7 August 2007 Accepted: 22 February 2008 This article is available from: http ://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/8/6 \u00a9 2008 Stokley et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

This broad definitionencompasses a range of both provider and non provider-based interventions, from chiropractic and homeopathy to herbs and nutritional supplements. A recent analysis of the Alternative Health/Complementary and AlternativeMedicine supplement of the 2002 National Health Inter-view Survey (NHIS) found that 75% of adults in the U.S.have ever used some type of CAM therapy, includingprayer specifically for health reasons [2]. There is also evi- dence to suggest that the proportion of U.S. adults who report CAM use has been increasing over time [3]. Reasons for CAM use vary, but generally fall into two cat- egories which reflect both the complementary and alter-native nature of these therapies. Some people use CAM asa complement to their regular medical care, either to improve general health and wellness or as an adjunct to treatment for chronic illnesses like back pain [4]. Othersprefer CAM as an alternative to mainstream medicine, cit-ing dissatisfaction with mainstream medicine as their pri-mary reason for use [4]. Whatever the reason for its use,many of those who use CAM in addition to conventional medical care do not report CAM use to their primary care physician [3,5]. This creates the potential for conflict, asCAM therapies may negatively interact with treatment, orcontradictory advice from CAM practitioners may influ-ence acceptance of or adherence to medical advice. Influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines are all recommended for certain segments of the adult popula-tion, depending on age and risk factors for each disease[6]. These illnesses represent a substantial burden of vac-cine-preventable disease in the United States; however,influenza and pneumococcal immunization rates for tar- get groups remain below Healthy People 2010 goals, and achievement of high hepatitis B vaccination rates amonghigh risk adults remains a challenge [7,8]. Poor access tohealthcare, low awareness of recommendations, andsafety concerns are all reasons for undervaccinationamong adults, while physician recommendation has beencited as an important factor in acceptance of adult immu- nization [9-11]. It has been suggested that while many CAM practitioners do not object to immunization, some discourage or evenactively oppose vaccination among their patients [12-14].However, previous studies in this area have focused on childhood immunizations, and it is unknown whether and to what extent CAM practitioners may negativelyinfluence the vaccination behavior of their adult patients.Conversely, adult CAM users may be more likely to acceptvaccination, as CAM use may act as a signal that an indi- vidual is highly engaged in maintaining their health, and therefore more motivated to accept preventive services.Determining which is the most likely of these two scenar-ios is of significant public health importance given thegrowing popularity of CAM therapies and the continuedburden of vaccine-preventable disease among U.S. adults. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: 1) describe the influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B immuniza-tion coverage levels of adults 18 years and older in theUnited States according to their CAM use status and 2)determine if there is an association between CAM use andimmunization coverage among priority and non-priority adults for each vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first nationally representative study to examine the associationbetween CAM use and immunization behavior amongadults in the U.S. Methods National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) The NHIS is an annual survey conducted by the NationalCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) that collects health infor-mation on the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized house-hold population. The sampling design employs amultistage area probability design; non-Hispanic black and Hispanic populations are oversampled to allow for more precise estimates of health status in these groups. In2002, the Alternative Health/Complementary and Alter-native Medicine (CAM) supplement was administered toone randomly selected adult per family. The supplemen-tal questionnaire included questions on 27 types of CAM therapies commonly used in the United States. A com- plete description of the supplement can be found else-where [2,15]. The final sample adult response rate was73.4%. Alternative Health/Complem entary and Alternative Medicine Analysis was limited to the 30,617 adults that provided at least one valid answer to the CAM supplement [16]. CAMtherapies were classified according to Barnes ther- apy/Reiki) and non-practitioner-based (i.e. natural herbs such as ginger, Echinacea, or black cohosh; homeopathictreatment; high dose or megavitamin as meditation, guided progres- sive relaxation, and deep breathing exercises). Respond- ents who indicated they had used any of the previouslylisted CAM therapies during the past 12 months were con-sidered 'Recent' CAM users; respondents who indicatedBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2008, 8:6 http://www.biomedcent ral.com/1472-6882/8/6 Page 3 of 8 (page number not for citation purposes)they have used one or more CAM therapies but not in the past 12 months were considered 'Past' CAM users; 'Never' CAM users included persons who indicated they havenever used any CAM therapies. Vaccination Status The 2002 NHIS included questions in the adult question- naire about three vaccines: influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B. Respondents were asked if they had received a'flu shot' during the past 12 months, if they had everreceived a 'pneumonia shot', and if they had ever receiveda dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. Vaccination status wasself reported by the respondent and was not verified by a provider. Respondents who answered \"Don't know\" or refused to answer the vaccine; 2.7% for pneumococcal vaccine; 5.6%for hepatitis B vaccine) were excluded from the analysisfor the vaccine of interest. For each vaccine, respondents were categorized as 'prior- ity' or 'non-priority' adults according to vaccine recom- mendations from the Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices [17-19]. A list of the criteria usedto categorize adults as 'priority' can be seen in Table 1. Allresponses to NHIS questions regarding health care condi-tions and occupation are self reported by the respondent. Data analysis Statistical analysis included estimating the proportionand 95% confidence intervals of adults who are recent,past, or never CAM users by demographic characteristics.Estimated vaccination coverage levels for priority and non-priority adults for influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines were also assessed by CAM use status(unadjusted coverage levels). To evaluate the associationbetween CAM use and vaccination status, multivariableanalyses were conducted which adjusted for the demo-graphic and healthcare utilization characteristics listed in Table 2. Separate models were created for priority and non-priority adults for each of the three vaccines of inter-est (adjusted coverage levels). Independent variables weretested for joint collinearity using condition indices, a measure of multi-collinearity. Evaluation of condition indices indicated little collinearity among variables in thelogistic regression models. Because previous studies havesuggested that some Chiropractors oppose vaccination[14], we also evaluated vaccination coverage levels amongChiropractic users. Because NHIS is a complex survey that involves clustering, stratification, and multistage sampling techniques toobtain nationally representative information on thehealth of the nation, all analyses were conducted usingSAS, release 8.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, 2001) and SUDAAN, release 9 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, 2001) to account for the survey sampledesign in calculating the standard errors and confidenceintervals. The data file obtained from the NCHS includedthe sample weights used in the analysis [16]. Categoricalindependent variables were compared using the Chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression and computation of predictive margins were used to estimate the probabil- ity of vaccination when controlling for all other independ-ent variables. The predictive margin for each variableincluded in the model along with the corresponding 95%confidence interval was reported. Predictive margins are atype of direct standardization that allows for the compar- ison of group outcomes while controlling for the covariate distribution in the population. They are best used whenthe outcome is not rare (i.e. > 10%). They are easier tointerpret than odds ratios and allow for different compar-isons to be made, as no referent group is designated[20,21]. Results CAM Use Overall, 35.7% (\u00b1 0.7%) of adults 18 years and older wererecent (\u00b1 0.7%) were past CAM users,and 21.7% (\u00b1 0.7%) CAM users.

Demographic characteristics ofrecent, past, and never CAM users can be seen in Table 2.Recent CAM users had a higher frequency of being female,of being non-Hispanic white, living in the West Censusregion, having greater than a high school education level, living at or above 200% of the federal poverty level, mak- ing 10 or more visits to the doctor during the past 12months, being in the priority group for hepatitis B vac-cine, and having only private health insurance. Immunization Status Unadjusted vaccination coverage Among priority adults, overall vaccination coverage levels were 43.1% (\u00b1 for vac-cines. Unadjusted vaccination coverage levels by CAM usecan be seen in Table 3. Never CAM users had significantlylower vaccination coverage levels for influenza, pneumo- coccal, and hepatitis B vaccines compared to recent and past CAM users. Past CAM users had significantly highervaccination coverage levels for influenza and pneumococ-cal vaccines when compared to recent CAM users.Among non-priority adults, overall vaccination coverage levels were Bvaccines. Unadjusted vaccination coverage levels by CAMuse can be seen in Table 3. Recent CAM users had signifi-cantly higher pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccinationcoverage levels compared to past CAM users and signifi- cantly higher coverage for all three vaccines compared to never CAM users. The largest difference in coverage wasobserved for the hepatitis B vaccine, where recent CAMusers had coverage levels 8.3 percentage points higherthan never CAM users. Adjusted vaccination coverage In multivariable analyses adjusting for demographic andhealth care utilization characteristics, the difference inhepatitis B coverage levels for priority adults betweenrecent and never CAM users was no longer statistically sig-nificant (Table 3). For non-priority adults, adjusted differ-ences between recent, past and never CAM users remained significant for influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines.Table 3: Unadjusted and adjusteda vaccination coverage leve ls among priority and non-priority adults by CAM use, 2002 National Health Interview Survey Influenza % (95% CI) Pneumococcal % (95% CI) Hepatitis B % (95% CI) Priority Adults (n = 14,595) (n = 9,596) (n = 2,848) Unadjusted results CAM use Recent 42.1 (40.6, 43.6) results CAM use (n = 20,328) (n = 26,179) Unadjusted results CAM use Recent 17.3 (16.1, 18.5) 8.0 (7.2, 8.7) 25.7 (24.6, 26.9)Past 16.4 (15.4, 17.5) 6.0 (5.4, 6.6)* 20.9 (19.8, 21.9)*Never 10.3 (9.2, 11.4)* + 4.1 (3.5, 4.8)*+ 17.4 (16.0, 18.7)*+ Adjusted results CAM use Recent 16.1 (14.9, 17.3) 7.6 (6.8, 8.4) 27.5 (26.1, 28.9)Past 16.3 (15.3, 17.3) 6.0 (5.4, 6.6)* 25.6 (24.4, 26.8)*Never 12.0 (10.6, 13.4)* + 4.4 (3.6, 5.2)*+ 21.1 (19.5, 22.7)*+ * denotes significantly differ ent than recent cam users; + denotes significantly different than past cam users aMultivariable model adjusts for age, gender, race/ethnicity, ed ucation level, federal poverty level, region, having a usual sou rce of care other than the emergency department, number of visits to a physician du ring the past 12 months, health insurance status, and smoking statu s.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2008, 8:6 http://www.biomedcent ral.com/1472-6882/8/6 Page 6 of 8 (page number not for citation purposes)Vaccination coverage among Chiropractic users Overall, 19.8% (\u00b1 0.6%) of respondents reported ever using Chiropractic services; 7.5% (\u00b1 0.4%) reported visit- ing a chiropractor in the past 12 months and 12.3% (\u00b10.5%) reported visiting a chiropractor more than 12months ago. Because of the small sample sizes among therecent and past chiropractic use categories, we combinedthe groups for the vaccination coverage analysis which can be seen in Table 4. In general, persons who have reported ever using chiropractic services had lower vaccination cov-erage levels than non-chiropractic CAM users. However,among priority adults, chiropractic users had significantlyhigher vaccination coverage levels for influenza and pneu-mococcal vaccines compared to never CAM users. Among non-priority adults, chiropractic users had significantly higher vaccination coverage levels for all vaccines com-pared to never CAM users. Discussion Results from a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults have shown that after adjusting for demographic and healthcare utilization characteristics, coverage levelsfor influenza and pneumococcal vaccines were signifi-cantly higher among priority adults who were recent orpast CAM users compared to adults who had never used aCAM therapy. Among non-priority adults, adjusted cover-age levels for influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines were significantly higher among recent or past CAM users when compared to never CAM users. Addition-ally, adults using chiropractic services had higher vaccina-tion coverage levels compared to never CAM users. Results from this study are somewhat unexpected consid- ering findings from previous studies have shown that par- ents with an alternative medical orientation weresignificantly less accepting of immunizations for theirchildren [22,23]. A national survey of parents of childrenaged 6 years found that when compared to parents with a conventional medical orientation, parents with an alter- native medical orientation were significantly less likely to believe immunizations are important (89.4% vs. 75.5%,respectively) and more likely to choose to opt out of animmunization for their child (11.2% vs. 24.9%, respec-tively) [22]. In a study of parents of school children, par-ents claiming vaccine exemptions for their children were more likely than parents of vaccinated children to report use of CAM professionals by their immediate familymembers (79.6% vs. 51.2%, respectively) [23]. It could bethat parents are more cautious of vaccination for theirchildren because the hypothesized risks for children'simmunizations are more publicized and more severe [24] than those for adult immunizations. Also, parents may be more averse to risks that are involuntary (e.g., school entrylaws), and risks to children (that cause greater fear ordread than risks to adults) [25,26]. Our results suggest that, similar to previous studies, respondents use CAM as supplemental rather than alter- native health care [4,27]. Recent and past CAM users inour study were significantly more likely to have more doc-tor visits than non-CAM users. Because CAM users tend tohave more doctor visits, they likely have more contactwith physicians which provide more opportunities to beimmunized. The positive association between CAM use and immunization coverage among priority adults also suggests that even if CAM users are receiving negativeinformation regarding immunizations from their CAMproviders, it is not affecting their receipt of immuniza-tions at this time. The difference in hepatitis B vaccination coverage levels between recent and non-CAM users was relatively small(i.e. 4-6 percentage points for priority and non-priorityadults) and remained significant among non-priorityTable 4: Adjusteda vaccination coverage levels of priority and non-priority adults by Chirop ractic therapy use, 2 002 National Health Interview Survey Influenza % (95% CI) Pneumococcal % (95% CI) Hepatitis B % (95% CI) Priority Adults (n = 14,595) (n = 9,596) (n = 2,848) Chiropractic use Use Chiropractic therapy 41.7 (39.9, 43.5 ) 40.3 (39.3, 42.7) .1)* 40.7 (39.3, 42.1) 60.1 (57.6, used CAM (36.1, 40.5)*+ 32.6 (30.2, 35.0)*+ 56.7 (51.2, 62.2) Non-Priority Adults (n = 15,927) (n = 20,328) (n = 26,179) Chiropractic use Use Chiropractic therapy 15.8 (14.2, 17 .4) 6.9 (6.1, 7.7) 25.7 (23.9, 27.4) CAM user, non-chiropractic 16.3 (15.3, 17.3) 6.7 (6.1, 6.7) 26.8 (25.8, 27.8) Never used CAM 12.0 (10.6, 13.4)*+ 4.5 (3.7, 5.3)*+ 21.2 (19.6, 22.8)*+ * denotes significantly differen t than chiropractic users; + de notes significantly different th an non-chiropractic CAM users aMultivariable model adjusts for age, gender, race/ethnicity, ed ucation level, federal poverty level, region, having a usual sou rce of care other than the emergency department, number of visits to a physician du ring the past 12 months, health insurance status, and smoking statu s.BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2008, 8:6 http://www.biomedcent ral.com/1472-6882/8/6 Page 7 of 8 (page number not for citation purposes)adults after adjusting for demographic and healthcare uti- lization characteristics. The finding that CAM users had higher vaccination coverage levels for hepatitis B has sev-eral possible explanations. First, CAM users might bemore concerned about their general health and wellness[4] and therefore more likely to get all immunizations.Another possible reason could be that CAM providers request their patients to receive the hepatitis B vaccination to protect themselves from liability in light of publicizedhepatitis B outbreaks among alternative medicine prac-tices in which CAM procedures required injections[28,29]. Notably, many CAM therapies are available forpersons with hepatitis B or hepatitis C disease, and HIV. Thus populations at high risk for hepatitis B infection might already be aware of the healing opportunities CAMtherapies may provide. In addition, hepatitis B is a sexu-ally transmitted disease and thus those at risk for hepatitisB may also be at risk for other STDs (e.g., HIV, chronicvaginal symptoms). Studies have shown that persons withsome STDs use CAM therapies to alleviate symptoms before they are diagnosed [30,31]. This study was subject to several limitations. The defini- tion of CAM use was wide and included therapies thatsome may consider mainstream and not alternative, suchas yoga or special diets like Atkins. The inclusion of these more common and mainstream therapies could have less- ened the difference seen in vaccination coverage betweenCAM users and non-CAM users. Thus, the actual differ-ence may be larger than observed. Immunization statuswas self-reported and not verified by a medical provider;however, a previous study found that self-report of influ- enza and pneumococcal vaccinations are highly sensitive, with moderate to low specificity, respectively [32]. Due tothe cross sectional nature of the study we could not assessa temporal relationship and therefore we are not able toestablish causal relationships. It is unknown if vaccinatedrespondents received their vaccines prior to or after initi- ating a CAM therapy. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first nationally representa- tive study to investigate a potential association of CAMuse among adults and the receipt of vaccination. BecauseCAM use has been increasing over time in the U.S., it is important to continue to monitor CAM use and its possi- ble influence on receipt of immunizations among adults.Since one-third of CAM users receive practitioner-basedtherapies, and adult vaccination coverage levels remainbelow Healthy People 2010 goals, it may be beneficial towork with CAM practitioners to promote adult vaccines as preventive services in keeping with their commitment to maintaining good health. However, before this is under-taken, a thorough understanding of the attitudes andbeliefs of CAM practitioners regarding adult vaccination should be assessed.
