WHEREAS, Mexican drug cartels are responsible for trafficking hun- dreds of millions of lethal doses of fentanyl into Texas and the United States; and WHEREAS, over 1,600 Texans were fatally poisoned by drugs con- taining fentanyl in 2021, representing an increase of more than 680 percent since 2018, and fentanyl's death toll continues to rise in 2022; and WHEREAS, Mexican drug cartels also smuggle humans across the Texas-Mexico border and subject them to sexual assault, human trafficking, assault, extortion, and other dehumanizing, violent, and heinous acts; and WHEREAS, deadly violence is associated with the Mexican drug car- tels, who are fighting for the territory needed to expand their influence in the United States; and WHEREAS, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, issued a disaster proclamation on May 31, 2021, which has been amended and renewed in each subsequent month effective through today, certifying under Section 418.014 of the Texas Government Code that the surge of individuals unlawfully crossing the Texas-Mexico border posed an ongoing and imminent threat of disaster for a number of Texas counties and for all state agencies affected by this disaster; and WHEREAS, through Operation Lone Star, I have deployed thousands of brave men and women from the Texas National Guard and the Texas Department of Public Safety to secure the border, and they have seized over 336 million lethal doses of fentanyl trafficked through Texas since March 2021; and WHEREAS, the head of the federal Drug Enforcement Administra- tion has declared that \"[f]entanyl is the single deadliest drug threat our nation has ever encountered,\" and that the \"[f]entanyl available in the United States is primarily supplied by two criminal drug networks, the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel\"; and WHEREAS, even though President Biden has declared a national emergency due to \"trafficking into the United States of illicit drugs, including fentanyl and other synthetic opioids,\" his Administration still has not designated the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189; and WHEREAS, designating the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations will target them for enhanced apprehension, prosecution, and disruption, while heightening awareness of their deadly activities for our citizens and the international community; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas, do hereby designate as foreign terrorist organiza- tions the Sinaloa Cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and any similarly situated Mexican drug cartels who may be identified in sub- sequent proclamations. I further order that the Texas Department of Public Safety shall do the following: Order No. 1: Establish a Mexican Cartel Division within the Texas Fu- sion Center to collect and analyze intelligence that will enable further apprehension, prosecution, and disruption of these foreign terrorist or- ganizations. Order No. 2: Identify, arrest, and impede the gangs in Texas that sup- port the drug and human smuggling operations of these foreign terrorist organizations. Order No. 3: Conduct multi-jurisdictional investigations of foreign terrorist organizations operating in Texas to support criminal prosecu- tions here and in other States. Order No. 4: Conduct multi-jurisdictional investigations of transna- tional and Texasbased gangs that support the smuggling operations of foreign terrorist organizations. Order No. 5: Target, seize, and dismantle the infrastructure, assets, ve- hicles, and buildings used by foreign terrorist organizations to smuggle drugs and people into and throughout Texas. Order No. 6: Enhance southbound criminal interdiction operations resulting in the seizure of bulk cash and other assets being smuggled into Mexico. Order No. 7: Intensify efforts under Operation Lone Star focused on detecting and interdicting transnational criminal activity between the ports of entry. This executive order shall remain in effect and in full force unless it is modified, amended, rescinded, or superseded by the governor. This executive order may also be amended by proclamation of the governor. Given under my hand this the 21st day of September, 2022. Greg Abbott, Governor TRD-202203847 Proclamation 41-3932 TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME: WHEREAS, I, GREG ABBOTT, Governor of Texas, do hereby certify that the shooting that occurred on May 24, 2022, at Robb Elementary School in the City of Uvalde has caused widespread and severe damage, injury, and loss of life in Uvalde County, Texas; and WHEREAS, those same conditions continue to exist in Uvalde County; NOW, THEREFORE, in accordance with the authority vested in me by Section 418.014 of the Texas Government Code, I do hereby renew the disaster proclamation for Uvalde County. GOVERNOR October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6521 Pursuant to Section 418.017, I authorize the use of all available re- sources of state government and of political subdivisions that are rea- sonably necessary to cope with this disaster. Pursuant to Section 418.016(a), any regulatory statute prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business or any order or rule of a state agency that would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with this disaster shall be suspended upon written approval of the Office of the Governor. However, to the extent that the enforce- ment of any state statute or administrative rule regarding contracting or procurement would impede any state agency's emergency response that is necessary to protect life or property threatened by this declared disaster, I hereby authorize the suspension of such statutes and rules for the duration of this declared disaster. In accordance with the statutory requirements, copies of this proclama- tion shall be filed with the applicable authorities. IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto signed my name and have officially caused the Seal of State to be affixed at my office in the City of Austin, Texas, this the 24th day of September, 2022.

TRD-202203891 Austin Kinghorn General Counsel Office of the Attorney General Filed: September 27, 2022 Opinions Opinion No. KP-0412 Ms. Amy F. Cook Executive Director Texas Racing Commission Post Office Box 12080 Austin, Texas 78711-2080 Re: Permissible uses and distributions of escrowed purse funds by the Texas Greyhound Association under section 2028.202 of the Occupa- tions Code (RQ-0442-KP) SUMMARY The Texas Racing Act requires horse racetracks to distribute to the Texas Greyhound Association certain funds derived from interstate cross-species simulcasting. Section 2028.202(c)(2) of the Occupations Code requires the funds distributed to the Texas Greyhound Associa-tion be \"for use at racetracks in this state.\" Consistent with this statute, a court would likely conclude that the Texas Racing Commission's rules require the Texas Greyhound Association to pay escrowed interstate cross-species simulcasting funds to greyhound racetracks. Opinion No. KP-0413 Ms. Jackie Skinner Tyler County Auditor Post Office Box 2039 Woodville, Texas 75979 Re: Whether a payment to county officials from funds received under the American Rescue Plan Act required notice as set forth in section 152.013 of the Local Government Code (RQ-0446-KP) SUMMARY A court could conclude that \"premium pay\" funds given to elected county officials by Tyler County in 2021 through the federal Ameri- can Rescue Plan Act under an interim final rule were akin to hazard pay and thus did not constitute salary increases requiring advance pub- lic notice under section 152.013 of the Local Government Code. Opinion No. KP-0414 The Honorable Dee Hobbs Williamson County Attorney 405 M.L.K. Street #7 Georgetown, Texas 78626 Re: Meaning of the term \"salary\" as used in article XVI, subsection 40(b) of the Texas Constitution (RQ-0447-KP) SUMMARY Article XVI, subsection 40(b) expressly permits a state employee or an individual who receives compensation from the state to serve as a member of the governing body of a city but prohibits the person from receiving a salary for the latter unless the person receives compensation from the state for work performed in certain capacities. Because of the multiple possible meanings of these terms, we cannot predict with certainty whether a court would conclude the Legislature equates the term \"salary\" with \"compensation\" in subsection 40(b). Whether the per meeting payment provided under section 3.04 of the Hutto City Charter may be construed to constitute the reimbursement of expenses rather than \"salary\" for purposes of subsection 40(b) is left ATTORNEY GENERAL October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6523 to the discretion of the appropriate City officials in the first instance, subject to judicial review. Opinion No. KP-0415 The Honorable Jaime A. Iracheta Maverick County Attorney 208 Converse Street Eagle Pass, Texas 78852 Re: Whether section 51.221 of the Water Code authorizes a represen- tative of a limited liability company to vote in an election conducted by Maverick County Water Control & Improvement District No. 1 (RQ-0448-KP) SUMMARY Section 51.221 of the Water Code authorizes a person who meets cer- tain qualifications to vote in an election conducted by the Maverick County Water Control & Improvement District No. 1. A court would likely conclude that section 51.221 of the Water Code does not autho- rize the representative of a limited liability company to vote on behalf of the company in an election conducted by that District. To vote in such an election, a person must meet the eligibility requirements of section 51.221 in the person's individual capacity. Opinion No. KP-0416 The Honorable Todd Dillon San Jacinto County District Attorney 1 State Highway 150, Room 21 Coldspring, Texas 77331-0403 Re: A commissioners court's authority to increase salaries of employ- ees in a sheriff's department in the middle of the budget year (RQ-0451- KP) SUMMARY A county commissioners court generally may not amend its budget to grant a salary increase to the employees in the sheriff's office in the mid- dle of a budget year in the absence of a finding of an emergency. But a commissioners court may amend the budget without an emergency to transfer funds from one budget item to another, subject to limitations in other law. To adopt a midyear budget amendment due to an emergency, the com- missioners court must make a finding of fact about the existence of a \"grave public necessity to meet an unusual and unforeseen condition that could not have been included in the original budget through the use of reasonably diligent thought and attention.\" Section 111.0106 of the Local Government Code authorizes a commis- sioners court to adopt a special budget for grant or aid money that is available for disbursement in the fiscal year but was not included in the budget for that fiscal year, for the limited purpose of spending the grant or aid money for its intended purpose. Whether funds from a particular grant may be used to give a prospective raise to employees of the sher- iff's office will depend on the \"intended purpose\" of the grant itself, as well as its terms and conditions. Opinion No. KP-0417 The Honorable Martin Placke Lee County Attorney 200 South Main, Room 305 Giddings, Texas 78942 Re: Whether a magistrate has authority to modify a bond set by a mag- istrate in a different county where the accused was arrested (RQ-0452- KP) SUMMARY A court would likely conclude that a magistrate who issued an arrest warrant executed in another county may, until charges are filed in the appropriate court, modify a bond set by a magistrate from the arresting county pursuant to article 17.09, section 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Article 17.09 does not expressly condition the authority to modify bonds on whether new bond conditions sought are mandatory or discretionary under the law.

TRD-202203894 Austin Kinghorn General Counsel Office of the Attorney General Filed: September 27, 2022 47 TexReg 6524 October 7, 2022 Texas Register TITLE 1. ADMINISTRATION PART 12. COMMISSION ON STATE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS CHAPTER 255. FINANCE 1 TAC \u00a7255.3 The Commission on State Emergency Communications (CSEC) proposes an amendment to 1 TAC \u00a7255.3, concerning requests by an Emergency Communication District (ECD) for equalization surcharge (surcharge) funding. QUESTIONS FOR COMMENT In approving the proposed amendments for Texas Register pub- lication and comment, CSEC's board proposed questions for comment: 1. Is the \"not more than 40 percent\" 9-1-1 surcharge funding limit in Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7771.072(d) (see below) applicable to an ECD's request for surcharge? 2. If your comment to question 1 is \"no,\" should CSEC adopt and apply as a matter of policy the 9-1-1 surcharge funding limit to an ECD's request for surcharge? Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7771.072 provides in relevant part: (d) From the revenue received from the surcharge imposed un- der this section, not more than 40 percent of the amount de- rived from the application of the surcharge shall be allocated to regional planning commissions or other public agencies desig- nated by the regional planning commissions for use in carrying out the regional plans provided for by this chapter. The alloca- tions to the regional planning commissions are not required to be equal, but should be made to carry out the policy of this chap- ter to implement 9-1-1 service statewide. Money collected under this section may be allocated to an emergency communication district regardless of whether the district is participating in the applicable regional plan. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The proposed amendment to \u00a7255.3 clarifies the process for an ECD to request surcharge by submitting an administratively complete request; directs CSEC staff to provide a surcharge funding request form and make a recommendation to CSEC re- garding an ECD's surcharge request; and clarifies that CSEC will consider an ECD's surcharge request during open meeting as a standalone agenda item. SECTION-BY-SECTION EXPLANATION Section 255.3(a) is amended to add the requirement that an ad- ministratively complete ECD funding request will be considered by CSEC at an open meeting. The section is further amended to delete the requirements CSEC will consider in deliberating ECD surcharge funding requests. The requirements, as revised, are in section 252.3(b). Section 255.3(b) is deleted and replaced in its entirety with new section 255.3(b) setting forth the requirements ECD must ad- dress in an administratively complete surcharge funding request. Section 255.3(c) is new and establishes as a condition prece- dent that an ECD's administratively complete surcharge funding request must be submitted in time for CSEC to consider the re- quest at an open meeting prior to the meeting at which CSEC considers its biennial Legislative Appropriations Request (LAR). The condition precedent is waived for an ECD emergency sur- charge funding request. Section 255.3(d) is new and requires staff to provide a surcharge funding request form containing the requirements in section 255.3(b) and be based on the budget components in CSEC's LAR. Section 255.3(e) is new and requires CSEC staff to review, clar- ify, and make a recommendation to CSEC on whether to ap- prove or disapprove an ECD's administratively complete sur- charge funding request. Included in section 255.3(e) is staff's consideration of the impact on funding Regional Planning Com- mission regional plans and the surcharge account balance, and CSEC's 9-1-1 service funding priorities. FISCAL NOTE Ms. Kelli Merriweather, CSEC Executive Director, has deter- mined that for each year of the first five fiscal years (FY) that amended \u00a7255.3 is in effect there will be no foreseeable fiscal implications to the state or local governments as a result of en- forcing or administering the amended section. PUBLIC BENEFITS AND COSTS Ms. Merriweather has determined that for each year of the first five years the amended section is in effect, the public benefits anticipated because of the proposed amendments will be to pro- vide ECDs and CSEC staff a clarified process for submitting and reviewing equalization surcharge funding requests, including de- liberation of a request by the CSEC board during open meeting. The condition precedent regarding CSEC's LAR ensures that, if included in the LAR and funds are appropriated by the Texas Legislature, CSEC will have sufficient surcharge funds to con- sider an ECD's request for surcharge without having to use sur- charge appropriations earmarked for use in the State 9-1-1 pro- gram and by CSEC. The condition precedent is waived by CSEC for an ECD's emergency request for surcharge funding. PROPOSED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6525 COSTS TO REGULATED PERSONS Under Government Code \u00a72001.0045, a state agency may not adopt a proposed rule if the fiscal note states that the rule imposes a cost on regulated persons, including another state agency, a special district, or a local government, unless the state agency: (a) repeals a rule that imposes a total cost on regulated persons that is equal to or greater than the total cost imposed on regulated persons by the proposed rule; or (b) amends a rule to decrease the total cost imposed on regulated persons by an amount that is equal to or greater than the cost imposed on the persons by the rule. There are exceptions for certain types of rules under \u00a72001.0045(c). Texas Government Code \u00a72001.0045 does not apply to this rule because the rule does not impose a cost on regulated persons. LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENT CSEC has determined that this proposal does not directly affect a local economy and therefore has not drafted a local employment impact statement as otherwise required by Texas Government Code \u00a72001.022. GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT CSEC has determined that during the first five years the pro- posed rule would be in effect it does not: (a) create or eliminate a government program; (b) require the creation of new employee positions or the elimination of existing employee positions; (c) require an increase or decrease in future legislative appropria- tions to the agency-but may result in an increase in requested equalization surcharge appropriations; (d) require an increase or decrease in fees paid to the agency; (e) does not create a new regulation; (f) expand, limit, or repeal an existing regula- tion; (g) increase or decrease the number of individuals subject to the rule's applicability; and (h) positively or adversely affect this state's economy. REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL RULES CSEC has determined that this proposal is not a \"major environ- mental rule\" as defined by Texas Government Code \u00a72001.0225. SMALL, MICRO-BUSINESS, AND RURAL COMMUNITY IM- PACT ANALYSIS In accordance with Texas Government Code \u00a72006.002(c), CSEC has determined that there will be no adverse eco- nomic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities. The rule as amended clarifies current practice for consideration of an ECD's request for surcharge funding. Accordingly, CSEC has neither prepared an economic impact statement or regulatory flexibility analysis, nor has it contacted legislators in any rural communities regarding this proposal. TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT CSEC has determined that the proposal does not restrict or limit an owner's right to his or her property that would otherwise exist in the absence of government action and, therefore, does not constitute a taking under Texas Government Code \u00a72007.043. PUBLIC COMMENT Comments on the proposal, including the two additional questions for comment, may be submitted in writing to Patrick Tyler, Commission on State Emergency Communi- cations, 333 Guadalupe Street, Suite 2-212, Austin, Texas 78701-3942, by facsimile to (512) 305-6937, or by email to patrick.tyler@csec.texas.gov. Please include \"Rulemaking Comments\" in the subject line of your letter, fax, or email. Comments will be accepted for 30 days following publication of the proposal in the Texas Register. STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY This amendment is authorized by Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7771.072(d), which authorizes CSEC to allocate surcharge to an ECD; and \u00a7771.051, CSEC's powers and duties including the authority to administer statewide 9-1-1 service. The proposed amendment provides a process for implement- ing Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7771.072(d). Except as de- scribed herein the proposed amendment affects no other code, article, or statute. \u00a7255.3. Emergency Communication District Equalization Surcharge Funding Policy. (a) The Commission will consider requests for equalization surcharge (the surcharge) funding assistance from an Emergency Com- munication District (ECD) as authorized by Health and Safety Code \u00a7771.072. Administratively complete ECD funding requests [Funding requests] will be [evaluated and] considered for approval at an open meeting. [based upon the Commission's established statewide funding priorities and needs, available surcharge appropriations, and consis- tency with funding policies regarding the financial needs of Regional Planning Commission regional plans.] [(b) To be considered for surcharge funding, an ECD must no- tify the Commission of its intent to request surcharge, the reasons for the request, and the estimated amount of the surcharge request in time for the Commission to consider including in its biennial Legislative Appropriations Request (LAR). Inclusion of an ECD's estimated sur- charge funding in the Commission's LAR is a condition precedent to an ECD submitting a request for surcharge funding. For an emergency surcharge funding request, the Commission will waive the condition precedent.] (b) An administratively complete funding request must ad- dress: (1) the reasons for the request, including but not limited to demonstrated need for surcharge funding (i.e., financial viability); annual 9-1-1 service fee revenues; current wireline/VoIP fee includ- ing the last change to that fee; why existing ECD financial resources (including any federal funds awarded for Next Generation 9-1-1) are insufficient; estimated date of exhaustion of 9-1-1 service fee revenues; to what extent the ECD uses 9-1-1 service fee revenues to pay telecom- municators/dispatchers; (2) the amount of the surcharge request; (3) specific description of how the ECD will use surcharge funding (including whether such use is for one-time or recurring costs); (4) for an emergency request, details about the nature and cause(s) of the emergency including ECD efforts to avoid or mitigate the effects of the emergency and how the requested surcharge addresses the emergency; and (5) for a municipal ECD (including the Dallas County Sheriff's Office), compliance with Local Government Code Ch. 365, Enforcement of Public Camping Bans, and Comptroller of Public Accounts Rule 20.600 (34 Tex. Admin. Code Ch. 20, Subch. I, \u00a720.600). (c) A condition precedent for Commission consideration of an ECD's administratively complete surcharge funding request is that it be submitted sufficiently in advance to allow the Commission to consider 47 TexReg 6526 October 7, 2022 Texas Register during an open meeting in advance of Commission consideration of its biennial Legislative Appropriations Request (LAR). For an emergency surcharge funding request the condition precedent is waived. (d) Commission staff will provide a surcharge funding request form that includes the requirements identified in subsection (b) of this section. The form is based on the budget components included in the instructions for completing the Commission's LAR. (e) Upon receipt of an ECD's request for surcharge, Commis- sion staff will clarify the request with the ECD as necessary; notify the requesting ECD in writing when its request is administratively com- plete, and recommend to the Commission approval or disapproval of the request based on the requirements in subsection (b) of this section, plus the impact of the request on funding of RPC regional plans and the surcharge account balance, and the Commission's 9-1-1 service fund- ing priorities. (f) The Commission will consider an ECD's non-emergency surcharge funding request for approval or disapproval during an open meeting held prior to the meeting at which the Commission considers its biennial LAR. An ECD's emergency surcharge funding request will be considered by the Commission at the first open meeting following submission by the ECD of an administratively complete request. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the pro- posal and found it to be within the state agency's legal authority to adopt. Filed with the Office of the Secretary of State on September 19, 2022.

AGRICULTURE PART 1. TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE CHAPTER 1. GENERAL PROCEDURES The Texas Department of Agriculture (Department) proposes amendments to 4 Texas Administrative Code, \u00a7\u00a71.1 - 1.5, 1.10 - 1.13, 1.15, 1.17 - 1.21, 1.23 - 1.27, 1.30, and 1.41 and the repeal of \u00a71.8 and \u00a71.22. The proposed amendments and repeals are collectively referred to as the proposal. The Department identified the need for the proposal during its rule review conducted pursuant to Texas Government Code \u00a72001.039, the adoption for which can be found in the Review of Agency Rules section of this issue. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.1 remove the definition of \"Act\" and substitute it with \"APA\" for clarity. Accordingly, \"Act\" is changed to \"APA\" throughout these rules. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.1 also add a definition for \"deputy commis- sioner,\" which is used frequently in Title 4, Part 1. In addition, definitions of acronyms associated with the Texas Rules of Civil Evidence and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure are deleted and will be reflected directly in rules where such acronyms are used. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.2 clarify that these rules do not apply to Food and Nutrition appeals, which have separate procedures. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.3 represent non- substantive changes to incorporate conforming changes to re- flect new definition of APA and to reflect an updated organiza- tional job title in the Department's hearing office. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.4 clarify the requirements to petition the De- partment for the adoption of a rule. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.5 provide for service by email and to reflect an updated organizational job title in the Depart- ment's hearing office. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.10 pro- vide clarifying information, and the proposed amendments to \u00a71.11 require pleadings to contain email addresses, if available; eliminate the requirement for a physical inked signature, and re- move duplicative language. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.12 adds language to reflect an updated organizational job title in the Department's hearing office and for purposes of completeness to list all documents by which a ruling may be issued. The pro- posed amendments to \u00a71.13 add clarifying language. The pro- posed amendments to \u00a71.15 remove redundant language and allow prehearing conferences to take place via videoconference. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.17 remove language related to motions to withdraw so that the rule only addresses motions for extension of time for clarity and include other nonsubstan- tive changes to clarify and reflect current Department business practices. Relevant language related to motions to withdraw is proposed to be added to \u00a71.10(g). The proposed amendments to \u00a71.18 clarify where the author- ity of administrative law judges (ALJs) employed by the Depart- ment differs from that of ALJs employed by the State Office of Administrative Hearings, as do proposed amendments to \u00a71.23, and grant ALJs the authority to conduct hearings by videocon- ference. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.25 clarify when an ALJ order becomes final. The proposed amendments to \u00a71.27 remove ref- erences to the rules of evidence, as \u00a71.20 already addresses the rules of evidence. The proposed amendments also correct typographical errors and make various editorial changes to \u00a7\u00a71.19 -1.21, 1.23, 1.24, 1.26, 1.30 and 1.41. The repeal of \u00a71.8 and \u00a71.22 is proposed because the Depart- ment determined the rules are not necessary. LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENT: Susan Maldon- ado, Lead Deputy General Counsel has determined that the pro- posal will not affect a local economy, so the Department is not required to prepare a local employment impact statement under Government Code \u00a72001.022. GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT: Pursuant to Government Code \u00a72001.0221, the Department provides the fol- lowing Government Growth Impact Statement for the proposal. For each year of the first five years the proposal will be in effect, Ms. Maldonado has determined the following: (1) the proposal will not create or eliminate a government pro- gram; (2) implementation of the proposal will not require the creation of new employee positions or the elimination of existing employee positions; (3) implementation of the proposal will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative appropriations; PROPOSED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6527 (4) the proposal will not require an increase or decrease in fees paid to the Department; (5) the proposal does not create a new regulation; (6) the proposal will repeal an existing regulation; (7) the proposal will not change the number of individuals subject to the rules; and (8) the proposal will not affect the state's economy. FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Ms. Maldonado has determined that enforcing or administering the proposal does not have foreseeable implications relating to cost or revenues to state or local governments. PUBLIC BENEFITS: Ms. Maldonado has determined that for each year of the first five-year period the proposal is in effect, the public benefit will be improved clarity and readability of rules related to contested hearings and department procedures. PROBABLE ECONOMIC COSTS TO PERSONS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSAL: Ms. Maldonado has deter- mined that for each year of the first five-year period the proposal is in effect, there will be no costs to persons who are required to comply with the proposal. FISCAL IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES, MICRO-BUSI- NESSES, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES: Ms. Maldonado has determined there will be no adverse economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities as a result of the proposal, therefore preparation of an economic impact statement and a regulatory flexibility analysis, as detailed under Texas Government Code \u00a72006.002 is not required. Comments on the proposal may be submitted by mail to Skyler Shafer, Assistant General Counsel, P.O. Box 12847, Austin, Texas 78711, or by email to skyler.shafer@texasagriculture.gov. The deadline for comments is 30 days after publication in the Texas Register. SUBCHAPTER A.

PUBLIC GRAIN WAREHOUSES [GRAIN WAREHOUSE] 4 TAC \u00a7\u00a713.1 - 13.4, 13.6 - 13.15, 13.17, 13.18, 13.20 The Texas Department of Agriculture (Department) proposes amendments to 4 Texas Administrative Code \u00a713.1, concerning Definitions; \u00a713.2, concerning General Requirements; \u00a713.8, concerning \u00a713.9, concerning Voluntary Surrender of License (Voluntary Close- out); Going out of Business; \u00a713.10, concerning Full Transfer or Sale of Warehouse Assets (New Owner); \u00a713.11, concerning Record Retention; \u00a713.12, concerning \u00a713.15, concerning Shortage of Grain; \u00a713.17, concerning Delivery of Stored Grain (Satisfaction of Storage Obligations); \u00a713.18, concerning Depositor Claims on Warehouse Operator's Bond; and \u00a713.20, concerning Sus- pension of a Grain Warehouse License. The Department identified the need for the proposed amend- ments during its rule review conducted pursuant to Texas Gov- ernment Code, \u00a72001.039, the adoption for which can be found in the Review of Agency Rules section of this issue. The proposed amendments include a change to the chapter's title to \"Public Grain Warehouses,\" to use terminology contained in Chapter 14 of the Texas Agriculture Code (Code). The proposed amendments to \u00a713.1 remove several unneces- sary definitions, add definitions for \"open storage grain\" and \"ter- minal storage\" to account for the use of these terms in this chap- ter, modify the definition of \"temporary storage\" to describe a particular location where grain might be stored, and make edito- rial changes to improve the rule's readability. The proposed amendments to \u00a713.2 remove redundant language involving requirements related to Department inspec- tions, clarify compliance requirements for warehouse operators, and correct grammatical and spelling errors. The proposed amendments to \u00a7\u00a713.3 and 13.4 make editorial changes to improve the rules' readability and remove unneces- sary or redundant language. The proposed amendments to \u00a713.6 removes outdated lan- guage on financial statement requirements for licensees. The proposed amendments to \u00a713.7 clarify that the fee for ad- ditional locations under combination public grain warehouse li- censes applies to locations that have only one public grain ware- house, not just facilities, as facility is defined by section 14.022 of the Code as two or more public grain warehouses located in close proximity on the same general location. The proposed amendments to \u00a7\u00a713.8 - 13.15, \u00a713.17, and \u00a713.18 make editorial changes, remove unnecessary or redun- dant language, and correct spelling errors. The proposed amendments to \u00a713.20 clarify what would lead to the suspension of a grain warehouse license. In addition, \"warehouse receipt\" and \"grain warehouse receipt\" are changed to \"receipt\" throughout the rules to standardize ter- minology and use a term defined in Chapter 14 of the Code. Sim- ilarly, the term \"warehouse\" and \"grain warehouse\" is changed to \"public grain warehouse\" throughout. The term \"title\" is also changed to \"chapter\" when referring to sections in this chapter, and rule headings are capitalized where they are not currently. Mr. Philip Wright, the Administrator for Regulatory Affairs, has determined that for the first five-year period the proposed amendments are in effect, there will be no fiscal implications for the state or local governments as a result of enforcing or administering the rules. Mr. Wright has also determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed amendments are in effect, the public 47 TexReg 6534 October 7, 2022 Texas Register benefit will be increased consumer protection through improved readability and clarity of the rules. Mr. Wright has determined there are no anticipated economic costs to persons required to comply with the proposed amend- ments. Mr. Wright has provided the following government growth impact statement, as required pursuant to Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0221. During the first five years the proposed amend- ments are in effect: (1) no government programs will be created or eliminated; (2) no employee positions will be created or eliminated; (3) there will be no increase or decrease in future legislative ap- propriations to the Department; (4) there will be no increase or decrease in fees paid to the De- partment; (5) no new regulations will be created by the proposal; (6) there will be no expansion, limitation, or repeal of existing regulation; (7) there will be no increase or decrease in the number of indi- viduals subject to the rules; and (8) there will be no positive or adverse effect on the Texas econ- omy. The Department has determined the proposed rules will not af- fect a local economy within the meaning of Government Code, \u00a72001.022, and will not have an adverse economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities. Written comments on the proposal may be submitted by mail to Mr. Morris Karam, Assistant General Counsel, Texas Depart- ment of Agriculture, P.O. Box 12847, Austin, Texas 78711, or by email to morris.karam@texasagriculture.gov. Comments must be received no later than 30 days from the date of publication of the proposal in the Texas Register.

TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION CHAPTER 38. TRICHOMONIASIS 4 TAC \u00a7\u00a738.1 - 38.4, 38.6, 38.8 The Texas Animal Health Commission (commission) proposes amendments to Title 4, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 38, \u00a7\u00a738.1 -38.4, 38.6 and 38.8, concerning \"Trichomoniasis\". 47 TexReg 6538 October 7, 2022 Texas Register BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF PROPOSED AMEND- MENTS The commission proposes amendments to Chapter 38 to clarify, correct and update information and procedures regarding the Tri- chomoniasis program and testing requirements. Bovine Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease of cattle caused by the organism Trichomonas foetus. The trichomonia- sis organism is found on the surface of an infected bull's penis and on the inside of the prepuce. Once a bull is infected, it is infected for life and is a reservoir for the organism. An infected bull will not show symptoms but will physically transmit the or- ganism to female cattle during the breeding process. Clinical indications of the presence of trichomoniasis in female cattle in- clude reduced pregnancy rates, changes in pregnancy pattern (shift towards more late calving cows), pus in the uterus (pyome- tras) and higher rates of abortion throughout the pregnancy. Unlike bulls, Trichomoniasis infected females will show an im- mune response to the presence of the Trichomonas foetus or- ganism in their reproductive tract. Antibodies are produced both within the reproductive tract and blood which helps in the clear- ance of the infection in many exposed females. The immunity is short-lived and cattle that have previously cleared the infec- tion can become re-infected if exposed to the organism during a following breeding. Infected female cattle can remain infected throughout their pregnancy, deliver a live calf and be a potential threat in spreading the disease in the next breeding season. The Bovine Trichomoniasis Working Group (TWG) had an an- nual review on May 24, 2022, to evaluate the effectiveness of the current program. The TWG discussed the program overview to date, the management of infected herds, and the need for pos- sible revisions to the program. The TWG recommends that five changes be made in the Tri- chomoniasis control program. The first is to require all bulls that are part of a herd one year after the date the hold order or quarantine on the herd was re- leased shall be officially tested for Trichomoniasis. This recom- mendation addresses the issue of repeat Trichomoniasis posi- tive herds. Through May 2022, 6 of the 31 herds, for calendar year 2022, testing positive for Trichomonas foetus are herds with repeat infections. Since 2020, 33 of the 209 Trichomoniasis pos- itive herds are herds with repeat infections. The second recommendation is to increase the transit timeframe for certified veterinarians to submit the Trichomoniasis sample submitted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) from 96 hours to 120 hours after collection. Studies have shown that the extended travel time for samples submitted in PBS did not significantly affect the sensitivity of Reverse Transcriptase PCR tests con- ducted on these samples. TAHC staff also recommend that ster- ile saline be added as a medium that can be used for submitting Trichomoniasis samples and recommends transit times match those of phosphate buffered saline. Sterile saline is readily avail- able in veterinary clinics and is a more cost-effective solution The third recommendation was to approve pooling of samples submitted in phosphate buffered saline. Experts from Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) re- ported that PCR testing conducted on samples submitted in phosphate buffered saline was found to be a more sensitive test than the traditional PCR test conducted on samples submitted via In-Pouch. Pooled sample results with a Cycle Threshold (CT) value of 38 or lower are interpreted as positive. The cutoff for single samples is a CT value of 35. According to data presented, raising the cutoff by three cycles compensates for the reduction in sensitivity when samples are pooled. If a pooled sample comes up positive, PCR testing is conducted on each individual sample in the pool using the cutoff of 35. TAHC staff also recommend that sterile saline be added as a medium that can be used for submitting Trichomoniasis samples that can be pooled by the diagnostic laboratory. Pooling is often more cost effective for producers and it is an adequate way to screen herds. Some sensitivity is lost when pooling samples, but if a disease is detected, individual tests can be conducted. The fourth recommendation would clarify the current rule and set a definitive timeframe for untested bulls that are purchased to change status from a cull/slaughter bull to a breeding bull. These bulls are moved under a Hold Order for testing to change the animal's slaughter bull status to a breeding bull. The recom- mendation is that these bulls must be tested within seven days of the purchase date. The fifth recommendation was to change terminology from \"Tri- chomoniasis approved feedyard\" to \"Trichomoniasis certified fa- cility\" to reduce confusion. The term \"approved feedyard\" has a different application and requirements that are more commonly associated with disease control efforts related to Tuberculosis and Brucellosis. SECTION-BY-SECTION DISCUSSION The proposed amendment to \u00a738.1, inition samples.\" The term \"Certified Veterinarian\" was amended to add that a certified veterinarian must meet the requirements and have authorized personnel status as listed in 4 Tex. Admin. Code Chapter 47. The term \"Official Laboratory Pooled Trichomoniasis test samples\" was updated to clarify that the laboratory can pool samples for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing only. Other non-substantive updates were made to the section to improve understanding and readability. The proposed amendments to \u00a738.2, General Requirements, clarifies Trichomoniasis testing requirements and timeframes. The amendments to \u00a738.2(c) specify that requests for confir- matory testing be in writing to the TAHC Region Director and that confirmatory testing must be conducted within 30 days after the date of the original test, Other non-substantive organizational changes to improve readability were made to the subsection. To reduce confusion, the amendment to \u00a738.2(d)(2) changes the term \"approved feedlot\" to \"Trichomoniasis certified facility\" be- cause the term \"approved feedyard\" has a different application and requirements that are more commonly associated with dis- ease control efforts related to Tuberculosis and Brucellosis. The amendment to \u00a738.2(d)(3) specifies a timeframe, seven days, to initiate the test for untested bulls purchased to change status from a slaughter bull to a breeding bull. The proposed amendments to \u00a738.3, Infected Herds, corrects and clarifies terminology, and requires additional testing for bulls that are part of an infected herd. The amendment to \u00a738.3(a) corrects terminology and clarifies that breeding bulls \"which test positive for Trichomoniasis\" as opposed to \"have been disclosed as reactor\" may be retested under certain conditions. The same provision clarifies that to be released from hold order or quaran- tine, a bull that is retested must have two consecutive negative tests by PCR within 30 days of the initial test. The proposal adds \u00a738.3(e) to require all bulls that are part of a herd one year after the date the hold order or quarantine on the herd was released PROPOSED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6539 to be officially tested for Trichomoniasis. The provisions that fol- low the addition were renumbered accordingly. Multiple amend- ments to Chapter 38, including \u00a738.2, clarifies that PCR testing is conducted as opposed to RT PCR. Other non-substantive up- dates or grammatical corrections were made to the section to improve readability. The proposed amendments to \u00a738.4, Certified Veterinary Practi- tioners, changes \u00a738.4(a) to align with the amended definition of \"Certified Veterinarians\" in \u00a738.1 and authorized personnel sta- tus requirements in 4 TAC Chapter 47. The proposed amendments to \u00a738.6, Official Trichomoniasis Tests, changes \u00a738.6(1)(B) to (1) allow Trichomoniasis sam- ples to be submitted in sterile saline, in addition to phosphate buffered saline, (2) increases transport time to the laboratory from 96 to 120 hours, and (3) recognizes that Trichomonia- sis samples pooled at the laboratory at a ratio of up to five individually collected samples pooled for one test may qualify as official tests. To promote understanding and compliance, the amendment specifies that veterinary practitioners may not submit pooled samples for an official test. The proposed amendments to \u00a738.8, Herd Certification Pro- gram--Breeding Bulls, provides and italicizes the full scientific name of Trichomoniasis, Trichomonas foetus. The proposed amendments update the term throughout Chapter 38. FISCAL NOTE Ms. Myra Sines, Chief of Staff of the Texas Animal Health Com- mission, determined for each year of the first five years the rules are in effect, there will be no additional fiscal implications for state or local government because of enforcing or administer- ing the proposed rules as commission employees currently allo- cated to these activities will continue to administer and enforce these rules as part of their current job duties and resources. The effect on state government for each year of the first five years the proposed amendments are in effect is null. Ms. Sines has determined that there is no estimated increase or loss in revenue to the state or local government as a result of enforcing or administering the rule amendments. PUBLIC BENEFIT NOTE Ms. Sines determined that for each year of the first five years the rules are in effect, the anticipated public benefit is reduced incidence of trichomoniasis reinfection in Texas cattle herds and added flexibility and cost efficiencies for regulatory testing pro- cedures. TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT The commission determined that the proposal does not restrict, limit, or impose a burden on an owner's rights to his or her private real property that would otherwise exist in the absence of gov- ernment action. Instead, the proposed amendments relate to the handling of animals, including requirements concerning testing, movement, inspection, identification, reporting of disease, and treatment pursuant to 4 TAC \u00a759.7. Therefore, the proposed rules are compliant with the Private Real Property Preservation Act in Texas Government Code \u00a72007.043 and do not constitute a takings. SMALL BUSINESS, MICRO-BUSINESS, AND RURAL COM- MUNITY IMPACT ANALYSIS Ms. Sines has determined that there will be a cost for producers with Trichomoniasis infected herds to test all bulls one year after the date the quarantine or hold order was released for the herd. Ms. Sines has also determined that there may be an adverse economic effect on small businesses, or micro-businesses. Those impacts are the same as adverse economic impacts to the persons that are required to test all bulls in their herd one year after the date the Trichomoniasis quarantine or hold order was released. However, most herd owners with previously infected bulls are conducting yearly PCR testing prior to rein- troducing them to the herd. There are currently 144,000 herds within the State of Texas and Commission data indicates there are 108 herds currently under quarantine or hold order as of the preparation of this analysis. The proposed rule requiring an annual retest may have an adverse impact on these livestock owners. The commission believes that most if not all of these livestock owners qualify as a small or micro-business. It is difficult to predict the economic impact the proposed rule would have on the herds because herd size, facility size, equip- ment, animal husbandry, handling practices and business mod- els vary per facility. Because veterinary pricing varies signifi- cantly (flat rate, graduated rates and herd call rates) the agency cannot quantify how much it will cost a livestock owner to test the owner's bulls. However, based on TVMDL costs of $25 per individual sample or $30 for a pooled sample of five, plus ac- cession fees, and information obtained from private veterinary practitioners, the commission estimates that each test will cost approximately $75 to $125. This is an assurance test for the producer and the producer's neighbor to ensure that the herd is clean and the disease has been eradicated. The cost of testing at 12 months is offset by the cost of having Trichomoniasis in the herd. Assessment of the cost of keeping a chronic Trichomonia- sis infection in a herd shows that 14% of the total pounds sold at weaning was lost due to effects of the disease, such as reduced pregnancy rates, later calving cows, and higher rates of abortion in infected herds. As such, alternatives were considered to achieve the goals of the proposed new rules while reducing potential adverse impacts on small and micro-businesses and persons required to comply. One alternative was to do nothing. This alternative was rejected because the current rules and science associated with Trichomo- niasis indicate there is an increased risk for herd reinfection and disease spread if previously positive herds are not actively mon- itored and tested for Trichomoniasis following the release of a disease quarantine or hold order. The limitation of treatments and testing for female cattle requires additional surveillance for herds where the disease was detected. Another alternative was to consider alternative testing time- frames after the quarantine release. The commission consid- ered 6, 12 and 18 months. To control Trichomoniasis in an infected herd, positive bulls must be identified and removed and sexual rest must be enforced for suspected and exposed female cattle following the current breeding season. The gestation period of a cow ranges from 279 to 287 days. After gestation or an abortion, open cows cannot be considered a lower risk until the female has had 120 to 150 days or more of sexual rest. Given this timeframe and management practices of typical herds, testing at 12 months coincides with the time period when bulls are handled to prepare them for the breeding season. Moreover, 6 months was too short of a timeframe to allow for po- tential reinfection of bulls from a positive female and 18 months 47 TexReg 6540 October 7, 2022 Texas Register would likely occur in the middle of a typical breeding season. As such, the 6-and 18-month timeframes were rejected. Another alternative was to require herds to test each bull and not allow pooled samples due to the previous infection. The pro- posed rule allows for pooled sampling because of the cost sav- ings associated with pooled samples. A single test at TVMDL cost $25 plus accession fees. As such, five individual tests would cost $125 plus fees. Alternatively, five pooled tests cost $30 plus fees. The proposed rule allows for pooled samples because a $95 savings is more cost effective for livestock owners, espe- cially for those with herds that are negative. Another alternative considered by the TWG was to require two annual tests following release. While two annual tests may be preferred, this alternative would increase testing costs and was rejected because the gestation term plus the 120-150 days of sexual rest for female cattle would provide a balanced approach to disease mitigation. The commission determined that there will be a minimal effect on rural communities, since the economic contribution of Trichomo- niasis infected cattle herds is not a significant driver of economic activities. As the number of herds with infected bulls is less than .00075, in an effort to maintain this low impact and the low per- centage, the agency has decided to move forward to contain and minimize the spread of Trichomoniasis from infected and re-in- fected herds. REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL RULES The commission has determined that this proposal is not a \"major environmental rule\" as defined by Government Code \u00a72001.0225. \"Major environmental rule\" is defined to mean a rule the specific intent of which is to protect the environment or reduce risk to human health from environmental exposure and that may adversely affect, in a material way, the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment or the public health and safety of a state or a sector of the state. This proposal is not specifically intended to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure. LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENT The proposed amendments will not affect a local economy. GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT In compliance with the requirements of Texas Government Code \u00a72001.0221, the commission prepared the following Gov- ernment Growth Impact Statement. For each year of the first five years the proposed rules would be in effect, the commission determined the following: 1. The proposed rules will not create or eliminate a government program; 2. Implementation of the proposed will not require the creation of new employee positions or the elimination of existing employee positions; 3. Implementation of the proposed rules will not increase future legislative appropriations to the Commission; 4. The proposed rules will not increase or decrease the fees paid to the Commission; 5. The proposed rules will create a new regulation as it requires testing and a specified time frame for completion; 6. The proposed rules will expand existing rules, but will not otherwise limit or repeal an existing regulation; 7. The proposed rules will not increase the number of individuals subject to the regulation; and 8. The proposed rules will not adversely affect this state's econ- omy. COST TO REGULATED PERSONS The proposed amendments to Chapter 38 may impose a cost on a regulated person, if the person is regulated because con- firmation of a sexually transmitted disease, Trichomoniasis, in the person's herd. The proposed rules will increase costs for these herds by requiring an annual test on bulls one year after movement restrictions are released, however, the proposal also reduces costs by approving the use of phosphate buffered saline for pooled samples and by approving the use of sterile saline for collection of samples for both individual and pooled diagnostic laboratory testing. Approving the addition of sterile saline as an option for sample submission and the allowance of pooled sam- ples, allows for cost savings as compared to the addition of a test without these allowances. Although these cost-savings amendments are not required by Texas Government Code \u00a72001.0045 because the proposed rules are necessary to protect cattle from Trichomoniasis, which is a disease the Commission determined requires control or eradication pursuant to Texas Agriculture Code Section 161.041, they are important to note. The rules do not otherwise impose a direct cost on a regulated person, state agency, a special district, or a local government within the state. Pursuant to Section 2001.0045 of the Texas Government Code, therefore, it is unnecessary to amend or repeal any other existing rule. There is a potential for $95 in savings in testing five head us- ing pooling versus not pooling. The savings from use of PBS over InPouch is due to the higher cost of the In Pouch. We anticipate that the use of sterile saline will be well received by most veterinarians and cattle producers due to the availability and lower cost as compared to the In Pouch and PBS. Informa- tion reviewed by TAHC staff showed InPouch testing is $110.67 per box of 10 equating to $11.07 per sample, Sterile saline is $4.80 per 1000mL bottle, with five mL per sample equates to $0.19 per sample. The testing prices do not include shipping and handling costs.

STATUTORY AUTHORITY The amendments are proposed under the following statutory au- thority as found in Chapter 161 of the Texas Agriculture Code. The commission is vested by statute, \u00a7161.041(a), with the re- quirement to protect all livestock, domestic animals, and domes- tic fowl from disease. The commission is authorized, through \u00a7161.041(b), to act to eradicate or control any disease or agent of transmission for any disease that affects livestock. PROPOSED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6541 Pursuant to \u00a7161.005, entitled \"Commission Written Instru- ments\", the commission may authorize the executive director or another employee to sign written instruments on behalf of the commission. A written instrument, including a quarantine or written notice signed under that authority, has the same force and effect as if signed by the entire commission. Pursuant to \u00a7161.006, entitled \"Documents to Accompany Ship- ment\", if required that a certificate or permit accompany animals or commodities moved in this state, the document must be in the possession of the person in charge of the animals or commodi- ties, if the movement is made by any other means. Pursuant to \u00a7161.0417, entitled \"Authorized Personnel for Dis- ease Control\", a person, including a veterinarian, must be autho- rized by the commission in order to engage in an activity that is part of a state or federal disease control or eradication program for animals. Pursuant to \u00a7161.046, entitled \"Rules\", the commission may adopt rules as necessary for the administration and enforcement of this chapter. Pursuant to \u00a7161.048, entitled \"Inspection of Shipment of Ani- mals or Animal Products\", the commission may require testing, vaccination, or another epidemiologically sound procedure be- fore or after animals are moved. An agent of the commission is entitled to stop and inspect a shipment of animals or animal products being transported in this state in order to determine if the shipment originated from a quarantined area or herd; or de- termine if the shipment presents a danger to the public health or livestock industry through insect infestation or through a com- municable or noncommunicable disease. Pursuant to \u00a7161.054, titled \"Regulation of Movement of An- imals; Exception\", the commission, by rule, may regulate the movement of animals. The commission may restrict the in- trastate movement of animals even though the movement of the animals is unrestricted in interstate or international commerce. The commission may require testing, vaccination, or another epidemiologically sound procedure before or after animals are moved. The commission is authorized, through \u00a7161.054(b), to prohibit or regulate the movement of animals into a quarantined herd, premises, or area. The Executive Director of the commis- sion is authorized, through \u00a7161.054(d), to modify a restriction on animal movement, and may consider economic hardship. Pursuant to \u00a7161.056(a), titled \"Animal Identification Program\", the commission, to provide for disease control and enhance the ability to trace disease-infected animals or animals that have been exposed to disease, may develop and implement an an- imal identification program that is no more stringent than a fed- eral animal disease traceability or other federal animal identifica- tion program. Section 161.056(d) authorizes the commission to adopt rules to provide for an animal identification program more stringent than a federal program only for control of a specific an- imal disease or for animal emergency management. Pursuant to \u00a7161.061, titled \"Establishment\", if the commission may establish a quarantine against all or the portion of a state, territory, or country in which a disease listed in rules adopted un- der Section 161.041. Section 161.061(b), a quarantine estab- lished may extend to any affected area, including a county, dis- trict, pasture, lot, ranch, farm, field, range, thoroughfare, build- ing, stable, or stockyard pen. Section 161.061(c), the commis- sion may establish a quarantine to prohibit or regulate the move- ment of infected animals and the movement of animals into an affected area. Section 161.061(d) allows the commission to del-egate its authority to establish a quarantine to the Executive Di- rector. Pursuant to \u00a7161.065, titled \"Movement from Quarantined Area; Movement of Quarantined Animals\", the commission may pro- vide a written certificate or written permit authorizing the move- ment of animals from quarantined places. If the commission finds animals have been moved in violation of an established quarantine or in violation of any other livestock sanitary law, the commission shall quarantine the animals until they have been properly treated, vaccinated, tested, dipped, or disposed of in accordance with the rules of the commission. Pursuant to \u00a7161.101, entitled \"Duty to Report\", a veterinarian, a veterinary diagnostic laboratory, or a person having care, cus- tody, or control of an animal shall report the existence of the dis- eases, if required by the commission, among livestock, exotic livestock, bison, domestic fowl, or exotic fowl to the commission within 24 hours after diagnosis of the disease. Pursuant to \u00a7161.113, entitled \"Testing or Treatment of Live- stock\", if the commission requires testing or vaccination under this subchapter, the testing or vaccination must be performed by an accredited veterinarian or qualified person authorized by the commission. The state may not be required to pay the cost of fees charged for the testing or vaccination. The commission may require the owner or operator of a livestock market to fur- nish adequate equipment or facilities or have access to essential equipment or facilities within the immediate vicinity of the live- stock market. Pursuant to \u00a7161.114, entitled \"Inspection of Livestock\", an au- thorized inspector may examine livestock consigned to and de- livered on the premises of a livestock market before the livestock are offered for sale. If the inspector considers it necessary, the inspector may have an animal tested or vaccinated. Any testing or vaccination must occur before the animal is removed from the livestock market. Pursuant to \u00a7161.148, titled \"Administrative Penalty\", the com- mission may impose an administrative penalty on a person who violates Chapter 161 or a rule or order adopted under Chapter 161. The penalty for a violation may be in an amount not to ex- ceed $5,000, effective September 1, 2021.

General Requirements. (a) Test Requirements. All Texas origin bulls sold, leased, gifted, exchanged or otherwise changing possession for breeding pur- PROPOSED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6543 poses in the State of Texas shall meet the following testing or certifica- tion requirements prior to sale or change of ownership in the state: (1) Be certified as virgin, by the breeder or his representa- tive, on and accompanied by a breeder's certificate of virgin status; or (2) If from a herd of unknown status (a herd that has not had a whole herd test), be tested negative on three consecutive culture tests conducted not less than seven days apart or one PCR [RT-PCR] test conducted within 60 days of sale or movement, be held separate from all female cattle since the test sample was collected, and be ac- companied by a Trichomoniasis test record showing the negative test results. (b) Identification of Bulls. All bulls certified as virgin bulls shall be identified by an official identification device or method on the breeder's certification of virgin status. All bulls tested for Trichomo- niasis shall be officially identified at the time the initial test sample is collected. That official identification shall be recorded on the test doc- uments prior to submittal. (c) Confirmatory Test. The owner of any bull which tests pos- itive for Trichomoniasis may request in writing to the TAHC Region Director, within five days of the positive test, that the commission allow a confirmatory test be performed on the positive bull. The confirmatory test must be conducted within 30 days after the date of the original test. [If the confirmatory test is positive the bull will be classified as infected with Trichomoniasis. If the confirmatory test is negative the bull shall be retested in not less than seven days to determine its disease status. If the confirmatory test reveals that the bull is only infected with fecal trichomonads, the test may be considered negative.] (1) If the confirmatory test is positive, the bull will be clas- sified as infected with Trichomoniasis. (2) If the confirmatory test is negative, the bull shall be retested in not less than seven days to determine its disease status. (3) If the confirmatory test reveals that the bull is only in- fected with fecal trichomonads, the test may be considered negative. (d) Untested Bulls. Bulls presented for sale without a breeder's certification of virgin status for registered breeding cattle or a Trichomoniasis test record showing negative test results may: (1) Be sold for movement only directly to slaughter; or (2) Be sold for movement to a [an] Trichomoniasis certified facility [approved feedlot ]and then moved to slaughter or transported back to a livestock market under permit, issued by commission person- nel, to be sold in accordance with this chapter; or (3) Be sold and moved under a Hold Order to such place as specified by the commission for testing to change status from a slaugh- ter bull. Such bulls shall be officially individually identified with a permanent form of identification prior to movement, move to the des- ignated location on a movement permit, and be held in isolation from female cattle at the designated location where the bull shall undergo three consecutive culture tests at least seven days apart or one PCR [RT- PCR] test. Testing shall be conducted within seven days of the purchase date. If the results of any test are positive, all bulls in the herd of origin of the positive bull shall be placed under hold order and tested as provided by subsection (e) of this section. The positive bull shall be classified as infected and be permitted for movement only di- rectly to slaughter or to a livestock market for sale directly to slaughter; or (4) Be sold and moved to another physical location under permit issued by commission personnel, and then to a livestock market or location to be resold within seven days from the date of issuance. The bull cannot be commingled with female cattle during the seven days. (e) Herd of Origin or Unit Testing. (1) All bulls that are part of a herd of origin from which a bull is sold in accordance with subsection (d)(3) of this section and is found to be infected with Trichomoniasis shall be placed under hold order and officially tested for Trichomoniasis. (2) All bulls that are part of a unit of origin, as epidemio- logically determined by the commission, from which a bull becomes separated and that bull is found to be positive for Trichomoniasis shall be placed under a hold order and officially tested for Trichomoniasis. All bulls that are part of the unit on which the separated positive bull was located, as epidemiologically determined by the commission, shall also be placed under hold order and officially tested for Trichomonia- sis. (3) Officially tested, as used in this subsection, requires at a minimum three official culture tests conducted not less than seven days apart, or one official PCR [RT-PCR] test. If the results of any test that are required by this subsection are positive, the herd shall be tested as provided by \u00a738.3 of this chapter (relating to Infected Herds). \u00a738.3. Infected Herds. (a) Bulls that have been determined to be infected by culture or by PCR [RT-PCR] test and/or by confirmatory PCR [RT-PCR] test shall be placed under hold order along with all other non-virgin bulls in the bull herd. Infected bulls must be isolated from all female cattle from the time of diagnosis until final disposition or as directed by the com- mission. Breeding bulls which test positive for Trichomoniasis [have been disclosed as reactors] may be retested provided: the owners, or their agents initiate a written request to the TAHC Region [Regional] Director where the bull is located within five business days of the pos- itive test; that retests are conducted within 30 days after the date of the original test; test samples for retests are submitted to the TVMDL for testing; and the positive bull is held under quarantine along with all other exposed bulls on the premise. If they are retested, they must have two consecutive negative tests by PCR [RT-PCR] [to be released] within 30 days of the initial test to be released from hold order or quar- antine. (b) Positive bulls may be moved directly to slaughter or to a livestock market for sale directly to slaughter.

All bulls remaining in the herd from which an infected bull(s) has been identified must be tested two more times by culture or one more time by PCR [RT-PCR] test. Any bull positive on the second or third test shall be classified as positive. All bulls negative to all three culture tests or both PCR [RT-PCR] tests shall be classified as negative and could be released for breeding. (d) Breeding bulls that are part of a quarantined herd or a herd that is under a hold order and tests negative to the first official Tri- chomoniasis test may be maintained with the herd if the owner or care- 47 TexReg 6544 October 7, 2022 Texas Register taker of the bulls develops a Trichomoniasis herd control plan with a certified veterinarian. The Trichomoniasis herd control plan shall require all breeding bulls to be tested annually with an official Tri- chomoniasis test and [aand] include other best management practices to control, eliminate and prevent the spread of Trichomoniasis. The Trichomoniasis herd control plan, unless otherwise approved or disap- proved by the commission, expires three years from the date the plan is signed by the herd owner or caretaker and the authorized veterinar- ian. Breeding bulls that are part of a Trichomoniasis herd control plan that expires or that is disapproved must be tested for Trichomoniasis as required by subsection (c) of this section. (e) All bulls that are part of a herd one year after the date the hold order or quarantine on the herd was released shall be officially tested for Trichomoniasis. (f) [(e)] When Trichomoniasis is diagnosed in female cattle or fetal tissue, all breeding bulls associated with the herd will be restricted under a Hold Order for testing in accordance with this section. (g) [(f)] If male or female cattle are found to be infected with Trichomoniasis, then bulls that are located or were located on property adjacent to the infected animal within 30 days from the date the infected animal was removed from such property shall be officially tested for Trichomoniasis. Such bulls shall be tested within a timeframe as de- termined by the commission. The commission shall provide written notification to the owner or caretaker of the bulls specifying the time- frame in which the bulls must be tested. The commission may waive this testing requirement if it is epidemiologically determined by the commission that testing is not required. \u00a738.4. Certified Veterinary Practitioners. (a) Only certified veterinarians [certified through the Commis- sion] may perform Trichomoniasis program procedures, including but not limited to, collection of samples for official tests for Trichomoni- asis within the state of Texas, submission of samples to official labo- ratories, identification of tested bulls and virgin bulls, management of Trichomoniasis infected bull herds, movement of infected bulls, and reporting of test results. In order to collect and submit Trichomo- niasis samples a veterinary practitioner shall be certified to perform Trichomoniasis program procedures.

Official Trichomoniasis Tests. Approved Tests. Approved tests for Trichomoniasis testing within the State of Texas shall include the culture or [Real Time] Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR [RT-PCR]) testing of samples collected by cer- tified veterinarians following approved collection, handling and ship- ping protocols, then tested in approved laboratories. (1) Official Culture Tests. An official test is one in which the sample, collected in an InPouch, is received in the official labora- tory, in good condition, within 48 hours of collection or is incubated in an InPouch by the collecting veterinarian for 48 hours after collection, and such sample is submitted to be tested according to the \"Official Protocol for Culture of Trichomoniasis.\" Samples in transit for more than 48 hours will not be accepted for official culture testing. Dur- ing transportation, the organisms should be protected from exposure to daylight and extremes of temperature, which should remain above 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit) and below 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). (2) Official Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Tests. PCR [Polymerase Chain Reaction ]is accepted as an official test or an official confirmatory test when completed by a qualified laboratory, approved by the Executive Director, and meets the following requirements: (A) A Trichomoniasis sample submitted in an InPouch must be received in the official laboratory, in good condition, within 48 hours of collection or incubated by the collecting veterinarian for 48 hours after collection and submitted to arrive at the laboratory within 96 hours of collection. Trichomoniasis samples pooled at the laboratory may qualify as official tests at a ratio of up to five individually collected samples pooled for one test. Veterinary practitioners may not submit pooled samples for an official test. (B) A Trichomoniasis sample submitted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or sterile saline must be received in the offi- cial laboratory, in good condition, within 120 [96] hours of collection. Trichomoniasis samples pooled at the laboratory may qualify as offi- cial tests at a ratio of up to five individually collected samples pooled for one test. Veterinary practitioners may not submit pooled samples for an official test. (3) Other Official Tests. Other tests for Trichomoniasis may be approved by the Commission, as official tests, after the tests have been proven effective by research, have been evaluated suffi- ciently to determine efficacy, and a protocol for use of the test has been established. \u00a738.8. Herd Certification Program--Breeding Bulls. Enrollment Requirements. Herd owners who enroll in the Trichomo- niasis Herd Certification Program shall sign a herd agreement with the commission and maintain the herd in accordance with the herd agree- ment and following conditions: (1) All non-virgin breeding bulls shall be tested annually for Trichomonas foetus [T. foetus] for three consecutive years as re- quired by the herd agreement. (2) During the three year inception period, all non-virgin breeding bulls that are sold, leased, gifted, exchanged or otherwise change possession shall be tested for Trichomonas foetus [T. foetus] within 30 days prior to such change in possession.

EDUCATION PART 1. TEXAS HIGHER EDUCATION COORDINATING BOARD CHAPTER 22. STUDENT FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS SUBCHAPTER J. FUTURE OCCUPATIONS & RESKILLING WORKFORCE ADVANCEMENT TO REACH DEMAND (FORWARD) LOAN PROGRAM 19 TAC \u00a7\u00a722.175 - 22.189 Brief Explanation and Justification The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (Coordinating Board) proposes new rules in Texas Administrative Code, Title 19, Part 1, Chapter 22, Subchapter J, \u00a7\u00a722.175 - 22.189, con- cerning Future Occupations & Reskilling Workforce Advance- ment to Reach Demand (FORWARD) Loan Program (Program). Specifically, this new section will establish rules relating to the administration of the FORWARD Loan Program. The program provides access to low interest loans to cover ed- ucational expenses, with the goal of accelerating the ability of employers throughout the State of Texas to fill high-demand jobs while providing students with high-value credentials. The sub- chapter creates a revolving fund in the state treasury funded by bond financed loan repayments for which the Board authorizes the agency to provide student loans. Repayment of funds under this program shall be deposited in the same account from which these loans originate. The Program aligns with the State's objec- tives in its newly revised master plan for higher education, Build- ing a Talent Strong Texas, by increasing the number of students who obtain high value credentials in high demand occupations without increasing student debt beyond the relative value of the credential. Sections 22.175 and 22.176 identify the authority for these pro- visions, the purpose of the program, and definitions used in the rules. Section 22.177 identifies the means by which high-demand cre- dentials will be identified by the Coordinating Board, in consul- tation with the Texas Workforce Commission, Texas Workforce Investment Council, and the Governor's Office of Economic De- velopment and Tourism or their delegates. Eligible credentials shall be selected based on current and projected workforce de- mands and the ability of students to graduate from identified pro- grams with manageable debt as defined by the Board's long- term strategic plan for Texas higher education. The purpose of this program is to fill high-demand jobs as quickly as possible while providing a path to a high-value credential for students. Sections 22.178 and 22.179 identify the institutions and students eligible for the program, respectively. Institutions of higher edu- cation or private or independent institutions of higher education, as defined by Texas Education Code \u00a761.003, are eligible to par- ticipate in the program. Texas residents enrolled at eligible insti- tutions may receive loans through the program when they are enrolled in an eligible high-demand credential so that the stu- dent will be able to complete the credential in two years or less while meeting other eligibility criteria. These criteria will increase the likelihood that a student will complete the program and pro- vide loans akin to last-mile support. This limits the risk of default. Students in both credit and non-credit programs will be eligible, which is important because not all unfilled high-demand jobs will require an academic associate degree or higher. Students en- rolled in these programs traditionally have less access to loans and are at greater risk of taking on high-interest debt or not en- rolling and completing their programs at all, which then leads to unfilled jobs. Section 22.180 identifies the discontinuation of eligibility, includ- ing the two-year limit on receiving loans through the program. Section 22.181 identifies hardship provisions that allow an insti- tution to provide a loan through the program to the student in the event that hardship or other good cause results in the student being ineligible for the program based on the time limit restric- tions or the satisfactory academic progress requirements. This 47 TexReg 6546 October 7, 2022 Texas Register allows students to complete once enrolled so they can continue to gainful employment and repay their debt. Sections 22.182 - 22.185 identify characteristics of the loan. Section 22.182 identifies individuals who are eligible to cosign the loan, which aligns with practices currently in place for other loans through the Hinson-Hazlewood loan program (Texas Education Code, Title 19, Section 1, Chapter 22, Subchapter C). The cosigner process helps ensure adequate collection of the loans. To better align the determination of loan amounts with the expectation that student loans should never be more than the borrower can reasonably be expected to repay, Section 22.183 includes a limitation based on the manageable debt level for the student's academic program, as defined by the Coordinating Board, in addition to the industry practice that limits student loans to the student's cost of attendance minus other financial resources, which are defined in the section. Section 22.184 authorizes the Commissioner to set the interest rate for the program. Loans borrowed through the Program during the Program's initial year shall have an interest rate of 3.35% to cover the expenses related to the operation of the loan program. Section 22.185 identifies the promissory note requirements to receive funds through the program. Sections 22.186 - 22.188 identify characteristics of loan repay- ment. Section 22.186 identifies the loan term, which will be ten years, the grace period, which will be six months, and the Com- missioner's authority to determine the methodology for calculat- ing the monthly repayment amount for the program, taking into consideration the borrower's income, monthly interest accrual, and cumulative outstanding student loan principal balance. Loan repayments for loans borrowed through the program during the program's initial years will take into consideration 10% of the bor- rower's annual income and will not drop below the monthly inter- est accrual. Section 22.187 identifies the impact of deceased or disabled borrowers and cosigners, and Section 22.188 identifies how collection of the loans will be enforced. To ensure appro- priate treatment of deceased or disabled individuals, as well as ensure necessary collection efforts, Sections 22.188 and 22.189 align with the relevant practices currently in place for other loans through the Hinson-Hazlewood loan program. Section 22.189 allows the Coordinating Board to delegate to the Commissioner the authority necessary to carry out the program. Fiscal Notes, Regulatory Flexibility Analyses, and Local Employ- ment Impact Dr. Charles W. Cont\u00e9ro-Puls, Assistant Commissioner for Stu- dent Financial Aid Programs, has determined that for each of the first five years the sections are in effect there would be limited fiscal implications for state government and no impact for local governments as a result of enforcing or administering the rules. The program may require additional employees to administer the program, however, those costs will be borne by proceeds gen- erated by the program. There are no estimated reductions in costs to the state and to local governments as a result of enforc- ing or administering the rule. There are no estimated losses or increases in revenue to the state or to local governments as a result of enforcing or administering the rule. There is no impact on small businesses, micro businesses, and rural communities. There is no anticipated impact on local em- ployment. Public Benefit and Cost to Comply Dr. Charles W. Cont\u00e9ro-Puls, Assistant Commissioner for Stu- dent Financial Aid Programs, has also determined that for each year of the first five years the section is in effect, the public benefit anticipated as a result of administering the section will be providing low interest loans to students pursuing high-de- mand, high-value credentials. The program also benefits Texas employers who need additional skilled participants in the Texas workforce. There are no anticipated economic costs to persons who are required to comply with the sections as proposed. Government Growth Impact Statement (1) the rules will not create or eliminate a government program; (2) implementation of the rules will require the creation or elimi- nation of employee positions; (3) implementation of the rules will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency; (4) the rules will not require an increase or decrease in fees paid to the agency; (5) the rules will create a new rule; (6) the rules will not limit an existing rule; (7) the rules will change the number of individuals subject to the rule; and (8) the rules may affect this state's economy.

TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY CHAPTER 74. CURRICULUM REQUIRE- MENTS SUBCHAPTER C. OTHER PROVISIONS 19 TAC \u00a774.27 The State Board of Education (SBOE) proposes an amendment to \u00a774.27, concerning innovative courses and programs. The amendment would update the rule to require that applicants for innovative courses must have piloted the proposed course in a Texas school prior to seeking approval. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND JUSTIFICATION: After the SBOE adopted new rules concerning graduation require- ments, the experimental courses previously approved were phased out as of August 31, 1998. As a result of the adoption of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS), school dis- tricts now submit new requests for innovative course approval for courses that do not have TEKS. The process outlined in \u00a774.27 provides authority for the commissioner of education to approve discipline-based courses but reserves for SBOE review and approval those courses that do not fall within any of the subject areas of the foundation or enrichment curriculum. Each year, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) provides the op- portunity for school districts and other entities to submit applica- tions for proposed innovative courses. At the June 2022 SBOE meeting, the Committee on Instruction requested that an item be placed on the September 2022 agenda for the board to consider requiring that an applicant for an innovative course pilot the pro- posed course in a Texas school prior to seeking approval from the SBOE. The proposed amendment would specify that innovative courses cannot be approved unless they have been piloted in a Texas school prior to seeking approval. The SBOE approved the proposed amendment for first reading and filing authorization at its September 2, 2022 meeting. FISCAL IMPACT: Monica Martinez, associate commissioner for standards and programs, has determined that there are no addi- tional costs to state or local government required to comply with the proposal LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT: The proposal has no effect on local economy; therefore, no local employment impact statement is required under Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.022. SMALL BUSINESS, MICROBUSINESS, AND RURAL COMMU- NITY IMPACT: The proposal has no direct adverse economic im- pact for small businesses, microbusinesses, or rural communi- ties; therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis specified in Texas Government Code, \u00a72006.002, is required. COST INCREASE TO REGULATED PERSONS: The proposal does not impose a cost on regulated persons, another state agency, a special district, or a local government and, therefore, is not subject to Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0045. TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT: The proposal does not im- pose a burden on private real property and, therefore, does not constitute a taking under Texas Government Code, \u00a72007.043. GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT: TEA staff prepared a Gov- ernment Growth Impact Statement assessment for this proposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking would expand an existing regulation by modifying the requirements for approval of innova- tive courses to require that an applicant for an innovative course pilot the proposed course in a Texas school prior to seeking ap- proval from the SBOE. The proposed rulemaking would not create or eliminate a gov- ernment program; would not require the creation of new em- ployee positions or elimination of existing employee positions; would not require an increase or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency; would not require an increase or decrease in fees paid to the agency; would not create a new reg- ulation; would not limit or repeal an existing regulation; would not increase or decrease the number of individuals subject to its ap- plicability; and would not positively or adversely affect the state's economy. PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COST TO PERSONS: Ms. Martinez has determined that for each year of the first five years the proposal is in effect, the public benefit anticipated as a result of enforcing the proposal would be providing districts and entities that submit applications for innovative courses clearer guidance regarding requirements for approval. There is no anticipated economic cost to persons who are required to comply with the proposal. DATA AND REPORTING IMPACT: The proposal would have no new data and reporting impact. PRINCIPAL AND CLASSROOM TEACHER PAPERWORK RE- QUIREMENTS: TEA has determined that the proposal would not require a written report or other paperwork to be completed by a principal or classroom teacher. PUBLIC COMMENTS: The public comment period on the proposal begins October 7, 2022, and ends at 5:00 p.m. on November 14, 2022. A form for submitting public com- ments is available on the TEA website at https://tea.texas- .gov/About_TEA/Laws_and_Rules/SBOE_Rules_(TAC)/Pro- posed_State_Board_of_Education_Rules/. The SBOE will take registered oral and written comments on the proposal at the appropriate committee meeting in November 2022 in accor- dance with the SBOE board operating policies and procedures. A request for a public hearing on the proposal submitted under the Administrative Procedure Act must be received by the commissioner of education not more than 14 calendar days after notice of the proposal has been published in the Texas Register on October 7, 2022. 47 TexReg 6550 October 7, 2022 Texas Register STATUTORY AUTHORITY. The amendment is proposed under Texas Education Code, \u00a728.002(f), which authorizes local school districts to offer courses in addition to those in the required cur- riculum for local credit and requires the State Board of Education to be flexible in approving a course for credit for high school grad- uation. CROSS REFERENCE TO STATUTE. The amendment imple- ments Texas Education Code, \u00a728.002(f). \u00a774.27. Innovative Courses and Programs. (a) A school district may offer innovative courses to enable students to master knowledge, skills, and competencies not included in the essential knowledge and skills of the required curriculum. (1) The State Board of Education (SBOE) may approve any course that does not fall within any of the subject areas listed in the foundation and enrichment curricula when the applying school district or organization demonstrates that the proposed course is academically rigorous and addresses documented student needs. (2) The commissioner of education may approve a disci- pline-based course in the foundation or enrichment curriculum when the applying school district or organization demonstrates that the pro- posed course is academically challenging and addresses documented student needs. (3) Applications shall not be approved if the proposed course significantly duplicates the content of a Texas Essential Knowl- edge and Skills (TEKS)-based course or can reasonably be taught within an existing TEKS-based course. (4) To request approval from the SBOE or the commis- sioner, the applying school district or organization must submit a re- quest for approval at least six months before planned implementation that includes: (A) a description of the course and its essential knowl- edge and skills; (B) the rationale and justification for the request in terms of student need; (C) data that demonstrates successful [implementation or] piloting of the course in Texas; (D) a description of activities, major resources, and ma- terials to be used; (E) the methods of evaluating student outcomes; (F) the qualifications of the teacher; (G) any training required in order to teach the course and any associated costs; and (H) the amount of credit requested. (5) To request approval from the commissioner for a career and technical education innovative course, the applying school district or organization must submit with its request for approval evidence that the course is aligned with state and/or regional labor market data. (6) To request approval of a new innovative course, the ap- plying school district or organization must submit with its request for approval evidence that the course has been successfully piloted in its entirety in at least one school in the state of Texas. (7) [(6)] With the approval of the local board of trustees, a school district may offer, without modifications, any state-approved innovative course. (b) (No change.) The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the pro- posal and found it to be within the state agency's legal authority to adopt.

ASSESSMENT SUBCHAPTER EE. COMMISSIONER'S RULES CONCERNING THE STATEWIDE TESTING CALENDAR AND UIL PARTICIPATION 19 TAC \u00a7101.5001 The Texas Education Agency (TEA) proposes an amendment to \u00a7101.5001, concerning the statewide testing calendar. The pro- posed amendment would provide clarification to existing statu- tory provisions and reflect changes made to the statewide as- sessment program by House Bill (HB) 3261, 87th Texas Legisla- ture, Regular Session, 2021, which required state assessments to be administered online beginning with the 2022-2023 school year. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND JUSTIFICATION: With changes made to the statewide assessment program introduced by HB 3906, 86th Texas Legislature, 2019, and amended by HB 3261, 87th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2021, TEA determined that conforming amendments to its assessment rules needed to be made. Texas Education Code (TEC), \u00a739.02341, as amended by HB 3261, requires that TEA administer the State of Texas Assess- ments of Academic Readiness (STAAR\u00ae) online beginning not later than the 2022-2023 school year. Section 101.5001, Commissioner's Rules Concerning the Statewide Testing Calendar and UIL Participation, addresses the primary administration of statewide assessments and out- lines University Interscholastic League scheduling criteria. With the implementation of primarily online administrations for STAAR\u00ae, TEA has modified the testing calendar to allow more flexibility in scheduling assessments. The proposed amendment to \u00a7101.5001 would modify the language regarding the admin- istration windows to provide that same flexibility. The previous one-week online and paper primary administration plus a one- week optional online administration would be adjusted to a two- week administration for both online and paper. The proposed amendment would also clarify that the first week of the two-week testing window would be the week of primary administration. FISCAL IMPACT: Lily Laux, deputy commissioner for school pro- grams, has determined that there are no additional costs to state or local government, including school districts and open-enroll- ment charter schools, required to comply with the proposal. PROPOSED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6551 LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT: The proposal has no effect on local economy; therefore, no local employment impact statement is required under Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.022. SMALL BUSINESS, MICROBUSINESS, AND RURAL COMMU- NITY IMPACT: The proposal has no direct adverse economic impact for small businesses, microbusinesses, or rural commu- nities; therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis, specified in Texas Government Code, \u00a72006.002, is required. COST INCREASE TO REGULATED PERSONS: The proposal does not impose a cost on regulated persons, another state agency, a special district, or a local government and, therefore, is not subject to Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0045. TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT: The proposal does not im- pose a burden on private real property and, therefore, does not constitute a taking under Texas Government Code, \u00a72007.043. GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT: TEA staff prepared a Gov- ernment Growth Impact Statement assessment for this proposed rulemaking. During the first five years the proposed rulemaking would be in effect, it would expand an existing regulation by pro- viding additional flexibility to public schools in connection with STAAR\u00ae assessment administration periods. The previous one- week online and paper primary administration plus a one-week optional online administration will change to a two-week adminis- tration for both online and paper. The first week of the two-week testing window would be the primary administration period. The proposed rulemaking would not create or eliminate a gov- ernment program; would not require the creation of new em- ployee positions or elimination of existing employee positions; would not require an increase or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency; would not require an increase or decrease in fees paid to the agency; would not create a new reg- ulation; would not limit or repeal an existing regulation; would not increase or decrease the number of individuals subject to its ap- plicability; and would not positively or adversely affect the state's economy. PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COST TO PERSONS: Mr. Laux has determined that for each year of the first five years the proposal is in effect, the public benefit anticipated as a result of enforc- ing the proposal would be aligning rules with recent legislation and allowing more flexibility in testing windows by clarifying the language regarding the administration periods. There is no an- ticipated economic cost to persons who are required to comply with the proposal. DATA AND REPORTING IMPACT: The proposal would have no data and reporting impact. PRINCIPAL AND CLASSROOM TEACHER PAPERWORK RE- QUIREMENTS: TEA has determined that the proposal would not require a written report or other paperwork to be completed by a principal or classroom teacher. PUBLIC COMMENTS: The public comment period on the proposal begins October 7, 2022, and ends November 7, 2022. A request for a public hearing on the proposal submit- ted under the Administrative Procedure Act must be received by the commissioner of education not more than 14 calen- dar days after notice of the proposal has been published in the Texas Register on October 7, 2022.A form for sub- mitting public comments is available on the TEA website at https://tea.texas.gov/About_TEA/Laws_and_Rules/Com- missioner_Rules_(TAC)/Proposed_Commissioner_of_Educa- tion_Rules/. STATUTORY AUTHORITY. The amendment is proposed under Texas Education Code (TEC), \u00a733.0812, which prohibits Uni- versity Interscholastic League participation on Monday through Thursday of the school week during the primary test adminis- tration period and provides the commissioner of education with related rulemaking authority; TEC, \u00a739.001, which provides the commissioner of education with rulemaking authority as neces- sary to administer TEC, Chapter 39; and TEC, \u00a739.023(c-3), which prohibits the scheduling of state assessments for students in Grades 3-8 and end-of-course assessments on the first in- structional day of a week. CROSS REFERENCE TO STATUTE. The amendment im- plements Texas Education Code, \u00a7\u00a733.0812, 39.001, and 39.023(c-3). \u00a7101.5001. Testing Calendar. (a) In accordance with Texas Education Code (TEC), \u00a733.0812, the commissioner of education shall determine the school week during the school year in which the primary administrations of assessment instruments are administered. The primary administrations of assessments occur during the first week of each testing window when [school week when both the paper and online] assessments are scheduled for the state. For the purpose of scheduling assessment instruments during the primary administration week under TEC, \u00a739.023(a) and (c), the first instructional day of a week is Monday. [The commissioner may provide local education agencies (LEAs) an optional extension of assessment administrations for online testing. An LEA may choose the optional extension by registering to test online. Once registered, the LEA may administer online assessments on any school day during the extended testing window.] (b) Through publication on the Texas Education Agency website, the commissioner shall provide the University Interscholastic League (UIL) with a three-year calendar of dates, beginning with the 2006-2007 school year, reserved for testing on or before May 1 of the year preceding the three-year cycle of reserved testing dates. (c) The commissioner may change the dates reserved for test- ing as necessary. The commissioner shall notify the UIL of any changes to the schedule for the primary administrations of the statewide assess- ments. (d) If a change to the primary administration testing calendar creates a scheduling conflict between a UIL area, regional, or state competition and the statewide assessments, the commissioner shall de- termine whether those UIL events must be cancelled or rescheduled. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the pro- posal and found it to be within the state agency's legal authority to adopt.

TEXAS ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS FOR SCIENCE 47 TexReg 6552 October 7, 2022 Texas Register SUBCHAPTER C. HIGH SCHOOL 19 TAC \u00a7112.41 The State Board of Education (SBOE) proposes an amendment to \u00a7112.41, concerning implementation of Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for high school science courses adopted in 2020. The proposed amendment would update the rule to move the implementation year for the TEKS for Biology, Chemistry, Integrated Physics and Chemistry, and Physics to the beginning of the 2024-2025 school year to align with the instructional materials timeline. The proposed amendment would also align with the implementation timeline for the Kinder- garten-Grade 8 science TEKS and the TEKS for all other high school science courses. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND JUSTIFICATION: In ac- cordance with statutory requirements that the SBOE identify by rule the essential knowledge and skills of each subject in the re- quired curriculum, the SBOE follows a board-approved cycle to review and revise the essential knowledge and skills for each subject. In late 2019, the SBOE began the process to review and revise the TEKS for Kindergarten-Grade 12 science. At the recommendation of Work Group A, the SBOE directed the work groups to follow a backwards-by-design approach to the revisions to the Kindergarten-Grade 12 science TEKS. Conse- quently, work groups started first with recommendations for re- visions to the high school science TEKS. In June and July 2020, Work Group B was convened virtually to develop recommen- dations for four high school science courses: Biology, Chem- istry, Physics, and Integrated Physics and Chemistry. At the November 2020 SBOE meeting, the SBOE approved for sec- ond reading and final adoption proposed new 19 TAC \u00a7\u00a7112.41- 112.45. The proposed new sections revised standards for Biol- ogy, Chemistry, Physics, and Integrated Physics and Chemistry as well as related implementation language. The new rules in- cluded an implementation date of the 2023-2024 school year. At the June 2021 SBOE meeting, the board approved for sec- ond reading and final adoption new TEKS for Specialized Topics in Science and revised standards for Aquatic Science, Astron- omy, Earth Science Systems (formerly titled Earth and Space Science), and Environmental Systems. At that time, the SBOE discussed the timeline for future instructional materials adop- tions and made the determination to move the implementation of the new Kindergarten-Grade 12 science TEKS to the 2024-2025 school year. The board indicated that it would change the imple- mentation date for the high school science courses that were adopted in 2020 at a future meeting. At the November 2021 SBOE meeting, the board approved for second reading and final adoption new science TEKS for Kinder- garten-Grade 8 with an implementation date of the 2024-2025 school year. The proposed amendment would update \u00a7112.41(a), (b), and (c) to reflect the revised implementation date for the high school science courses. The SBOE approved the proposed amendment for first reading and filing authorization at its September 2, 2022 meeting. FISCAL IMPACT: Monica Martinez, associate commissioner for standards and programs, has determined that there are no addi- tional costs to state or local government required to comply with the proposal LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT: The proposal has no effect on local economy; therefore, no local employment impact statement is required under Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.022. SMALL BUSINESS, MICROBUSINESS, AND RURAL COMMU- NITY IMPACT: The proposal has no direct adverse economic im- pact for small businesses, microbusinesses, or rural communi- ties; therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis specified in Texas Government Code, \u00a72006.002, is required. COST INCREASE TO REGULATED PERSONS: The proposal does not impose a cost on regulated persons, another state agency, a special district, or a local government and, therefore, is not subject to Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0045. TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT: The proposal does not im- pose a burden on private real property and, therefore, does not constitute a taking under Texas Government Code, \u00a72007.043. GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT: TEA staff prepared a Gov- ernment Growth Impact Statement assessment for this proposed rulemaking. During the first five years the proposed rulemaking would be in effect, it would limit an existing regulation by delay- ing implementation of new TEKS. The proposed rulemaking would not create or eliminate a gov- ernment program; would not require the creation of new em- ployee positions or elimination of existing employee positions; would not require an increase or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency; would not require an increase or decrease in fees paid to the agency; would not create a new reg- ulation; would not expand or repeal an existing regulation; would not increase or decrease the number of individuals subject to its applicability; and would not positively or adversely affect the state's economy. PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COST TO PERSONS: Ms. Martinez has determined that for each year of the first five years the proposal is in effect, the public benefit anticipated as a result of enforcing the proposal would be aligning the implementation of the TEKS for science so that the science TEKS for Kindergarten through high school would be implemented at the same time. There is no anticipated economic cost to persons who are required to comply with the proposal. DATA AND REPORTING IMPACT: The proposal would have no data and reporting impact. PRINCIPAL AND CLASSROOM TEACHER PAPERWORK RE- QUIREMENTS: TEA has determined that the proposal would not require a written report or other paperwork to be completed by a principal or classroom teacher.

Code the Texas State Board of Examiners of Marriage and Family Therapists previously voted and, by a majority, approved to propose this rule to the Executive Council. The rule is specifically authorized by \u00a7502.1515 of the Tex. Occ. Code which states the Board shall propose to the Executive Council rules regarding the qual- ifications necessary to obtain a license; the scope of practice, standards of care, and ethical practice; continuing education re- quirements for license holders; and a schedule of sanctions for violations of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter. The Executive Council also proposes this rule in compliance with \u00a7507.153 of the Tex. Occ. Code. The Executive Council may not propose and adopt a rule regarding the qualifications neces- sary to obtain a license; the scope of practice, standards of care, and ethical practice for a profession; continuing education re- quirements; or a schedule of sanctions unless the rule has been proposed by the applicable board for the profession. In this in- stance, the underlying board has proposed this rule to the Ex- ecutive Council. Therefore, the Executive Council has complied with Chapters 502 and 507 of the Texas Occupations Code and may propose this rule. Lastly, the Executive Council proposes this rule under the au- thority found in \u00a72001.004 of the Tex. Gov't Code which requires state agencies to adopt rules of practice stating the nature and requirements of all available formal and informal procedures. No other code, articles or statutes are affected by this section. \u00a7801.143. Supervisor Requirements. (a) To apply for supervisor status, an LMFT in good standing must submit an application and applicable fee as well as documentation of the following: (1) completion of at least 3,000 hours of LMFT practice over a minimum of 3 years; and (A) successful completion of a 3-semester-hour, gradu- ate course in marriage and family therapy supervision from an accred- ited institution; or (B) a 40-hour continuing education course in clinical supervision; or (2) designation as an approved supervisor or supervisor candidate by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT).

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY PART 1. TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY CHAPTER 36. SUSPENSION OR ADJUSTMENT OF WATER RIGHTS DURING DROUGHT OR EMERGENCY WATER SHORTAGE 30 TAC \u00a7\u00a736.1 - 36.8 PROPOSED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6559 The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ, agency, or commission) proposes the repeal of 30 Texas Ad- ministrative Code (TAC) Chapter 36, \u00a7\u00a736.1 -36.8. Background and Summary of the Factual Basis for the Proposed Rules During severe drought in 2013, The Dow Chemical Company (TDCC), as a senior water right holder, made a priority call in the Brazos River Basin. In response to the call, the executive direc- tor (ED) issued orders suspending junior water rights. The ED, however, chose to suspend only specific rights, which he was allowed to do under 30 TAC \u00a736.5(c). Texas Farm Bureau was among those with rights junior to TDCC's that were suspended under the ED's orders; and in response, Texas Farm Bureau, and other individual plaintiffs, filed a lawsuit against the TCEQ challenging the validity of TCEQ's drought rules found in 30 TAC Chapter 36. The 53rd District Court, Travis County, declared the drought rules invalid. TCEQ appealed; and the 13th Court of Ap- peals, Corpus Christi, affirmed the District Court's decision. As these rules are no longer valid, 30 TAC Chapter 36 should be repealed. This repeal will also improve the overall organization of TCEQ rules related to the Water Rights Program. Section by Section Discussion This rulemaking would repeal 30 TAC Chapter 36 in its entirety. Fiscal Note: Costs to State and Local Government Jen\u00e9 Bearse, Analyst in the Budget and Planning Division, has determined that for the first five-year period the proposed repeals are in effect, no fiscal implications are anticipated for the agency or for other units of state or local government as a result of ad- ministration or enforcement of the proposed repeal. Public Benefits and Costs Ms. Bearse determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed repeal is in effect, the public benefit anticipated will be compliance with the ruling of the 53rd District Court, Travis County, affirmed by the 13th Court of Appeals, Corpus Christi, which repealed drought rules found in the 30 TAC Chapter 36. The proposed rulemaking is not anticipated to result in fiscal im- plications for businesses or individuals. Local Employment Impact Statement The commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and deter- mined that a Local Employment Impact Statement is not required because the proposed rulemaking does not adversely affect a local economy in a material way for the first five years that the proposed repeal is in effect. Rural Communities Impact Assessment The commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and deter- mined that the proposed rulemaking does not adversely affect rural communities in a material way for the first five years that the proposed repeal is in effect. The amendments would apply statewide and have the same effect in rural communities as in urban communities. Small Business and Micro-Business Assessment No adverse fiscal implications are anticipated for small or micro- businesses due to the implementation or administration of the proposed repeal for the first five-year period the proposed repeal is in effect. Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and deter- mined that a Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required because the proposed repeal does not adversely affect a small or micro-business in a material way for the first five years the proposed repeal is in effect. Government Growth Impact Statement The commission prepared a Government Growth Impact State- ment assessment for this proposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking does not create or eliminate a government program and will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency. The proposed rulemaking does not require the creation of new employee positions, eliminate current employee positions, or require an increase or decrease in fees paid to the agency. The proposed rulemaking repeals an existing regulation; however, the proposed rulemaking does not increase or decrease the number of individuals subject to its applicability because the rules were previously ruled invalid by a court. During the first five years, the proposed repeal should not impact positively or negatively the state's economy. Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination The commission reviewed the proposed rulemaking in light of the regulatory analysis requirements of Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0225 and determined that the rulemaking is not subject to Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0225. Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0225 applies to a \"Major environmental rule,\" which is defined in Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0225(g)(3) as a rule with a specific intent \"to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure and that may adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.\" First, the proposed rulemaking does not meet the statutory defi- nition of a \"Major environmental rule\" because its specific intent is not to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure. The purpose of this rulemaking is to repeal 30 TAC Chapter 36 in its entirety because the chap- ter was declared void in a lawsuit challenging the validity of the rules. Second, the proposed rulemaking does not meet the statutory definition of a \"Major environmental rule\" because the proposed repeal would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the envi- ronment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state. It is not anticipated that the cost of complying with the proposed repeal will be significant with respect to the economy as a whole or with respect to a sector of the economy; therefore, the proposed repeal will not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, competition, or jobs. Finally, the proposed rulemaking does not meet any of the four applicability requirements for a \"Major environmental rule\" listed in Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0225(a). Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0225 only applies to a major environmental rule, the result of which is to: 1) exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is specifically required by state law; 2) exceed an express requirement of state law, unless the rule is specifically required by federal law; 3) exceed a requirement of a delega- tion agreement or contract between the state and an agency or representative of the federal government to implement a state and federal program; or 4) adopt a rule solely under the gen- eral powers of the agency instead of under a specific state law. This proposed rulemaking does not meet any of the four preced- 47 TexReg 6560 October 7, 2022 Texas Register ing applicability requirements because this rulemaking: 1) does not exceed any standard set by federal law for the regulation of water rights; 2) does not exceed any express requirements of state law related to the regulation of water rights; 3) does not exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or contract be- tween the state and an agency or representative of the federal government to implement a state and federal program; and 4) is not proposed solely under the general powers of the agency as the commission adopts the rulemaking action under Texas Water Code, \u00a7\u00a75.013, 5.102, 5.103, 5.105, and 5.120. Therefore, the commission does not adopt this rulemaking action solely under the commission's general powers. Since this proposed rulemaking does not meet the statutory def- inition of a \"Major environmental rule\" and does not meet any of the four applicability requirements for a \"Major environmental rule,\" this rulemaking is not subject to Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.0225. The commission invites public comment regarding the Draft Reg- ulatory Impact Analysis Determination during the public com- ment period. Written comments on the Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination may be submitted to the contact person at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this preamble. Takings Impact Assessment The commission evaluated this rulemaking and performed an analysis of whether the proposed repeal would constitute a tak- ing. Texas Government Code, \u00a72007.002(5), defines a taking as either: 1) a governmental action that affects private real property, in whole or in part or temporarily or permanently, in a manner that requires the governmental entity to compensate the private real property owner as provided by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend- ments to the United States Constitution or Sections 17 or 19, Article I, Texas Constitution; or 2) a governmental action that af- fects an owner's private real property that is the subject of the governmental action, in whole or in part or temporarily or per- manently, in a manner that restricts or limits the owner's right to the property that would otherwise exist in the absence of the governmental action and is the producing cause of a reduction of at least 25% in the market value of the affected private real property, determined by comparing the market value of the prop- erty as if the governmental action is not in effect and the market value of the property determined as if the governmental action is in effect. The commission determined that the proposed re- peal would not constitute a taking as that term is defined under Texas Government Code, \u00a72007.002(5). Specifically, the pro- posed repeal would not affect any landowner's rights in private real property, and there are no burdens that would be imposed on private real property by the proposed repeal; the proposed repeal is solely procedural and does not impact real property. Consistency with the Coastal Management Program The commission reviewed the proposed repeal and found that it is neither identified in Coastal Coordination Act implementa- tion rules, 31 TAC \u00a7505.11(b)(2) or (4), nor would it affect any action/authorization identified in Coastal Coordination Act imple- mentation rules, 31 TAC \u00a7505.11(a)(6). Therefore, the proposed repeal is not subject to the Texas Coastal Management Program. Written comments on the consistency of this rulemaking with the Texas Coastal Management Program may be submitted to the contact person at the address listed under the Submittal of Com- ments section of this preamble. Announcement of Hearing The commission will hold a hybrid virtual and in-person public hearing on this proposal in Austin on November 10, at 10:00 a.m. in Building E, Room 201S, at the commission's central office lo- cated at 12100 Park 35 Circle.

USE OF RECLAIMED WATER SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 30 TAC \u00a7210.5 The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ, agency, or commission) proposes amendments to \u00a7210.5. Background and Summary of the Factual Basis for the Proposed Rules The Office of Water is initiating rule changes to 30 Texas Admin- istrative Code (TAC) Chapter 210 (Use of Reclaimed Water) to clarify that an application to obtain an authorization under Chap- ter 210 may be submitted concurrently or any time after submittal of an application for a permit to treat and dispose of wastewater. Section by Section Discussion The proposed rulemaking would amend \u00a7210.5 (Authorization for the Use of Reclaimed Water), which contains the require- ments to obtain an authorization for the use of reclaimed water. This change would clarify under \u00a7210.5(a) that an application to obtain an authorization under Chapter 210 may be submitted concurrently or any time after submittal of an application for a permit to treat and dispose of wastewater. The executive director (ED) is clarifying the timing of the appli- cation for efficient processing and as an incentive to promote reuse. Fiscal Note: Costs to State and Local Government Jen\u00e9 Bearse, Analyst in the Budget and Planning Division, has determined that for the first five-year period the proposed rules are in effect, no fiscal implications are anticipated for the agency or for other units of state or local government as a result of ad- ministration or enforcement of the proposed rule. Public Benefits and Costs Ms. Bearse determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed rules are in effect, the public benefit anticipated would be clarification that the application may be submitted con- currently or at any time after submittal of an application for a permit to treat and dispose of wastewater. The proposed rulemaking is not anticipated to result in fiscal im- plications for businesses or individuals. Local Employment Impact Statement The commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and deter- mined that a Local Employment Impact Statement is not required because the proposed rulemaking does not adversely affect a local economy in a material way for the first five years that the proposed rule is in effect. Rural Communities Impact Assessment The commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and deter- mined that the proposed rulemaking does not adversely affect rural communities in a material way for the first five years that the proposed rules are in effect. The amendments would apply statewide and have the same effect in rural communities as in urban communities. Small Business and Micro-Business Assessment No adverse fiscal implications are anticipated for small or micro- businesses due to the implementation or administration of the proposed rule for the first five-year period the proposed rules are in effect. Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and deter- mined that a Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required because the proposed rule does not adversely af- fect a small or micro-business in a material way for the first five years the proposed rules are in effect. Government Growth Impact Statement The commission prepared a Government Growth Impact State- ment assessment for this proposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking does not create or eliminate a government program and would not require an increase or decrease in future leg- islative appropriations to the agency. The proposed rulemak- ing does not require the creation of new employee positions, eliminate current employee positions, nor require an increase or decrease in fees paid to the agency. The proposed rulemak- ing does not create, expand, repeal or limit an existing regula- tion, nor does the proposed rulemaking increase or decrease the number of individuals subject to its applicability. During the first five years, the proposed rule should not impact positively or neg- atively the state's economy. Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination The TCEQ reviewed the proposed rulemaking in consideration of the regulatory analysis of major environmental rules required by Texas Government Code (TGC), \u00a72001.0225 and determined that the rulemaking is not subject to TGC, \u00a72001.0225(a) be- cause it does not meet the definition of a \"Major Environmental Rule\" as defined in TGC,\u00a72001.0225(g)(3). The following is a summary of that review. 47 TexReg 6562 October 7, 2022 Texas Register Section 2001.0225 applies to a \"Major Environmental Rule\" adopted by a state agency, the result of which is to exceed standards set by federal law, exceed express requirements of state law, exceed requirements of delegation agreements between the state and the federal government to implement a state and federal program, or adopt a rule solely under the general powers of the agency instead of under a specific state law. A \"Major Environmental Rule\" is a rule, the specific intent of which is to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure and that may adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector or the state. The ED's Office of Water is initiating rule changes to 30 TAC Chapter 210 (Use of Reclaimed Water) to clarify that an applica- tion to obtain an authorization under Chapter 210 may be sub- mitted concurrently or any time after submittal of an application for a permit to treat and dispose of wastewater. The proposed rulemaking would amend the requirements in 30 TAC \u00a7210.5 for obtaining an authorization for the use of reclaimed water. This change would clarify under \u00a7210.5(a) that an application to obtain an authorization under Chapter 210 may be submitted concurrently or any time after submittal of an application for a permit to treat and dispose of wastewater. Certain aspects of the TCEQ's rules for use of Reclaimed Wa- ter are intended to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure. However, the pro- posed rulemaking would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, or jobs; nor would the proposed rulemaking adversely affect in a material way the environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state. Therefore, the proposed rulemaking does not fit the TGC, \u00a72001.0225 definition of \"Ma- jor Environmental Rule.\" Even if this rulemaking was a \"Major Environmental Rule,\" this rulemaking meets none of the criteria in \u00a72001.0225 for the re- quirement to prepare a full Regulatory Impact Analysis. First, this rulemaking is not governed by federal law. Second, it does not exceed state law but rather adds clarity to the rules that im- plement state law, as the ED is making clear the timing of and application for use of Reclaimed Water to promote efficient pro- cessing and as an incentive to promote reuse. Third, this rule- making does not come under a delegation agreement or contract with a federal program, and finally, is not being proposed under the TCEQ's general rulemaking authority. This rulemaking is be- ing proposed under existing state law found in the Texas Water Code Chapter 26 (Water Quality Control) and \u00a711.1271(e) that gives the commission authority to establish and regulate water quality, set standards to prevent the disposal of waste that is inju- rious to the public health, to control plans and specifications for treatment facilities, sewer systems, and disposal systems that transport, treat, or dispose of primarily domestic wastes, and specifically with \u00a711.1271(e), requires the commission, in con- junction with the Texas Water Development Board, to develop model water conservation programs for different types of water suppliers that suggest best management practices for achiev- ing the highest practicable levels of water conservation and ef- ficiency achievable for each specific type of water supplier. Be- cause this proposal does not constitute a major environmental rule, a regulatory impact analysis is not required. Therefore, the commission does not adopt the rule solely under the commission's general powers. The commission invites pub-lic comment on the draft regulatory impact analysis determina- tion. Written comments may be submitted to the contact person at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this preamble. The commission invites public comment regarding the Draft Reg- ulatory Impact Analysis during the public comment period. Writ- ten comments on the Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis may be submitted to the contact person at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this preamble. Takings Impact Assessment The TCEQ evaluated the proposed rulemaking and performed an analysis of whether it constitutes a taking under Texas Gov- ernment Code (TGC), Chapter 2007. The following is a summary of that analysis. Under TGC, \u00a72007.002(5), \"taking\" means a governmental ac- tion that affects private real property, in whole or in part or tem- porarily or permanently, in a manner that requires the govern- mental entity to compensate the private real property owner as provided by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or Section 17 or 19, Article I, Texas Consti- tution; or a governmental action that affects an owner's private real property that is the subject of the governmental action, in whole or in part or temporarily or permanently, in a manner that restricts or limits the owner's right to the property that would oth- erwise exist in the absence of the governmental action and is the producing cause of a reduction of at least 25% in the market value of the affected private real property, determined by com- paring the market value of the property as if governmental action is not in effect and the market value of the property determined as if the governmental action is in effect. The specific purpose of the proposed rulemaking is to amend 30 TAC Chapter 210 (Use of Reclaimed Water) to clarify that an ap- plication to obtain an authorization under Chapter 210 may be submitted concurrently or any time after submittal of an appli- cation for a permit to treat and dispose of wastewater. Promul- gation and enforcement of the proposed rule amendments will not be a statutory or constitutional taking of private real property because, as the commission's analysis indicates, TGC, Chap- ter 2007 does not apply to these proposed rules because these rules do not impact private real property in a manner that would require compensation to private real property owners under the United States Constitution or the Texas Constitution. Specifi- cally, the proposed rulemaking does not apply to or affect any landowner's rights in any private real property because it does not burden (constitutionally), restrict, or limit any landowner's right to real property and reduce any property's value by 25% or more beyond that which would otherwise exist in the absence of the regulations. These Chapter 210 rule amendments do not regulate property but instead regulate the use of Reclaimed Wa- ter. The primary purpose of the proposed rule amendments is to amend 30 TAC \u00a7210.5(a), to clarify that an application to obtain an authorization under Chapter 210 may be submitted concur- rently or any time after submittal of an application for a permit to treat and dispose of wastewater. The proposed rulemaking is reasonably taken to fulfill requirements of state law. Therefore, the proposed rulemaking would not cause a taking under TGC, Chapter 2007. Consistency with the Coastal Management Program The commission reviewed the proposed rules and found that they are neither identified in Coastal Coordination Act implemen- tation rules, 31 TAC \u00a7505.11(b)(2) or (4), nor will they affect any PROPOSED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6563 action/authorization identified in Coastal Coordination Act imple- mentation rules, 31 TAC \u00a7505.11(a)(6).

Statutory Authority The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ, agency, or commission) proposes these amendments to TCEQ rules under Texas Water Code (TWC) Chapters 5, 11, and 26. TWC, \u00a75.013 establishes the general jurisdiction of the commission, while TWC \u00a75.102 provides the commission with the authority to carry out its duties and general powers under its jurisdictional authority as provided by TWC, \u00a75.103. TWC, \u00a75.103 requires the commission to adopt any rule necessary to carry out its powers and duties under the TWC and other laws of the state. TWC, \u00a75.120 requires the commission to administer the law so as to promote judicious use and maximum conserva- tion and protection of the environment and the natural resources of the state. TWC, \u00a726.011, provides the commission with the authority to establish the level of quality to be maintained in, and to control the quality of, the water in the state. TWC, \u00a726.027, authorizes the commission to issue permits for the discharge of waste or pollutants into or adjacent to water in the state. TWC, \u00a726.0271 allows, at the request of an Applicant in any permit or amendment to a permit issued under Chapter 26, for the commission to authorize a wastewater treatment facility to contribute treated domestic wastewater, produced by the facility as reclaimed water, to a reuse water system if the commission has approved the use of reclaimed water from the wastewater treatment facility. TWC, \u00a726.034, provides the commission with the authority, on a case-by-case basis, to review and approve plans and specifications for treatment facilities, sewer systems, and disposal systems that transport, treat, or dispose of primar- ily domestic wastes. TWC, \u00a726.041, gives the commission the authority to set standards to prevent the disposal of waste that is injurious to the public health; and TWC, \u00a726.121, gives the commission the authority to set standards to prohibit unautho- rized discharges into or adjacent to water in the state. Finally, TWC, \u00a711.1271(e), requires the commission, in conjunction with the Texas Water Development Board, to develop model water conservation programs for different types of water suppliers that suggest best management practices for achieving the highest practicable levels of water conservation and efficiency achievable for each specific type of water supplier. The proposed amendments the Use of Reclaimed Water. (a) Prior to discharging any reclaimed water to the waters in the state, the provider or user shall obtain a permit from the commis- sion in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 305 of this title (relating to Consolidated Permits) except as provided for by \u00a7210.22(e) of this title (relating to General Requirements). The application for the required permit authorization to discharge reclaimed water may be sub- mitted concurrently or after the permit application to treat and dispose of wastewater in accordance with the requirements of 30 TAC Chapter 305. (b) The executive director may require a reclaimed water user to apply for and obtain a permit to utilize reclaimed water if the re- claimed water use poses potential or actual adverse impacts upon hu- man health, soil and ground water resources, or aquatic life. (c) For purposes of this chapter, no permit issued pursuant to Chapter 305 of this title (relating to Consolidated Permits) will be re- quired for additional treatment required to meet the quality standards of \u00a7210.33 of this title (relating to Quality Standards for Using Re- claimed Water), unless such additional treatment results in a discharge of wastewater into waters in the state. 47 TexReg 6564 October 7, 2022 Texas Register (d) A reclaimed water provider or user who accepts effluent meeting the Type II quality criteria and that must also meet the Type I quality criteria for a proposed use must provide additional treatment for the proposed new use. The additional manner of treatment must be authorized by the executive director. The provider or user must no- tify and be granted an authorization from the executive director prior to engaging in such activity. Examples of such additional treatment may include processes for disinfection or filtration of the reclaimed water. Such authorization may be granted by the executive director after re- view of the proposed plans and specifications submitted to the execu- tive director for the additional treatment. This request for authorization may be submitted to the executive director along with the notification required by \u00a7210.4 of this title (relating to Notification). (e) If a provider or user elects to treat reclaimed water sup- plied by the provider or producer, respectively, to a quality better than the minimum standards of this chapter for the same use, such treatment does not require a permit or other additional authorization by the exec- utive director. (f) Any sewage sludge generated as a result of reclaimed wa- ter treatment undertaken pursuant to this section shall be managed in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 312 of this title (relating to Sludge Use, Disposal and Transportation). The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the pro- posal and found it to be within the state agency's legal authority to adopt.

ADMINISTRATION PART 3 OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CHAPTER 52. ADMINISTRATION The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) adopts new \u00a752.2 which addresses the new Family Leave Pool program. The cre- ation of the Family Leave Pool provides eligible state employees more flexibility in bonding with and caring for children during a child's first year following birth, adoption, or foster placement and assists employees who are caring for a seriously ill family mem- ber of the employee. In addition, to implementing the new Family Leave Pool, the OAG adopts the reorganized sections in Chapter 52, Subchapter A (General Provisions), which implement a more logical order for the chapter's rules. Current \u00a752.2 (Employee Education and Training) is repealed and replaced with new \u00a752.2 (Family Leave Pool). In addition, repealed \u00a752.2 (Employee Ed- ucation and Training) is now new \u00a752.3 (Employee Education and Training). This reorganization puts Chapter 52's provisions in a more logical format as the adopted new \u00a752.2 (Family Leave Pool) is similar to \u00a752.1 (Sick Leave Pool). These rules are adopted with minor non-substantive edits to the proposed text as published in the July 29, 2022 issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4397) and will be republished. EXPLANATION AND JUSTIFICATION OF RULES The Legislature, in the 87th Regular Session (2021), added subchapter A-1 to Texas Government Code Chapter 661 (H.B. 2063), which requires state agencies to establish a Family Leave Pool program. Specifically, the law states that the \"gov- erning body of the state agency shall adopt rules and prescribe procedures relating to the operation of the agency family leave pool.\" Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7661.022(c). The program provides leave for state employees for family-care needs that do not necessarily fall under the existing Sick Leave Pool or the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Generally, the Family Leave Pool authorizes any state employee to contribute one or more days of the employee's accrued sick or vacation leave for use by another state employee. Any state employee may also apply to the pool administrator to withdraw time from the Family Leave Pool. Adopted \u00a752.2 implements this program. Specifically, the adopted rules designate the pool administrator, authorize the administrator to recommend a policy for approval by the First Assistant Attorney General, and require that the program operate in compliance with Texas Government Code, Chapter 661. The OAG adopts the reorganized Chapter 52 of the Texas Ad- ministrative Code, Title 1, Part 3. Current \u00a752.2 (Employee Ed- ucation and Training) is repealed and replaced with new \u00a752.2 (Family Leave Pool). In addition, repealed \u00a752.2 (Employee Ed- ucation and Training) is now new \u00a752.3 (Employee Education and Training). This reorganization puts Chapter 52's provisions in a more logical format as the adopted new \u00a752.2 (Family Leave Pool) is similar to \u00a752.1 (Sick Leave Pool). SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY Adopted new \u00a752.2 addresses the Family Leave Pool adminis- tration and requirements. This adopted section is nearly iden- tical to \u00a752.1, which addresses the Sick Leave Pool. Similar to the Sick Leave Pool, the statutory provisions for the Family Leave Pool require that a state agency establish the program and designate an individual as the pool administrator. The OAG has designated the Director of Human Resources as its Family Leave Pool administrator. Operation of the pool will be consis- tent with Chapter 661 of the Texas Government Code. Adopted \u00a752.3 addresses employee education and training. This adopted new section is identical to current \u00a752.2. Under this section, the agency may use state funds to provide educa- tion and training for its employees relating to the employees' position and its benefits to the agency. FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS Henry De La Garza, Division Chief for Human Resources, has determined that for the first five-year period the adopted rules are in effect, enforcing or administering the rules does not have foreseeable implications relating to cost or revenues of the state or local governments. Should a large number of donations or a significant amount of leave be donated to the Family Leave Pool, there may be costs to the OAG for additional resources, such as human capital and updated software, which may be necessary to address the administrative challenges stemming from the potential tax implications to both donating and receiving employees. This increase in needed resources would result from possible tax im- plications that may arise, as briefed by the Texas Comptroller's Office (https://fmx.cpa.texas.gov/fmx/payper/family_leave/). Specifically, certain donations to the Family Leave Pool may be considered taxable income and subject to withholding and other requirements. But at this time, the OAG is unable to estimate the amount of leave that will be donated to the Family Leave Pool; thus, the OAG is unable to estimate any associated state government costs. PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COST NOTE Mr. De La Garza has determined that for the first five-year pe- riod the adopted rules are in effect, the public will benefit by hav- ing flexibility in bonding with and caring for children during the child's first year following birth, adoption, or foster placement; and caring for a seriously ill family member or themselves, in- cluding pandemic-related illnesses or complications caused by ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6577 a pandemic. Even though this program is only available for state employees, all persons, children or otherwise, who are impacted by the Family Leave Pool, will benefit from the Pool by receiving additional care from the state-employee family member. Mr. De La Garza has also determined that for each year of the first five-year period the adopted rules are in effect, there are potential economic costs to persons who are required to comply with the adopted rules. As briefed by the Texas Comptroller's Office (https://fmx.cpa.texas.gov/fmx/payper/family_leave/), an employee that donates leave to the Family Leave Pool may incur costs via increased taxes. The costs will vary for each donating employee and will be impacted by factors including the amount of leave donated as well as the type. For these reasons, the OAG is unable to estimate any potential public costs at this time. IMPACT ON LOCAL EMPLOYMENT OR ECONOMY The Human Resources Division has determined that the adopted rules do not have an impact on local employment or economies because the adopted rules impact state agencies and their em- ployees only. Therefore, no local employment or economy im- pact statement is required under Tex. Gov't Code \u00a72001.022. ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT AND REGULATORY FLEX- IBILITY ANALYSIS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, MICROBUSI- NESSES, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES The Human Resources Division has determined that for each year of the first five-year period the adopted rules are in effect, there will be no foreseeable adverse fiscal impact on small busi- ness, micro-businesses, or rural communities as a result of the adopted rules. The adopted rules only impact state agencies under Texas Government Code, Chapter 661. Therefore, Texas Government Code Chapter 2006 does not apply. Since the adopted rules will have no adverse economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities, preparation of an Economic Impact Statement and a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, as detailed under Texas Government Code \u00a72006.002, is not required. TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT The OAG has determined that no private real property interests are affected by the adopted rules, and the adopted rules do not restrict, limit, or impose a burden on an owner's rights to the owner's private real property that would otherwise exist in the absence of government action. As a result, the adopted rules do not constitute a taking or require a takings impact assessment under Texas Government Code \u00a72007.043. GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT In compliance with Texas Government Code \u00a72001.0221, the agency has prepared a government growth impact statement. During the first five years the adopted rules are in effect, the adopted rules: - will create a government program; - will not require the creation or elimination of employee posi- tions, however, if there are a large number of donations, as dis- cussed in the fiscal note, additional employee positions may be required; -will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative ap- propriations to the agency, however, if there are a large number of donations, as discussed in the fiscal note, additional appropri- ations may be required; - will not lead to an increase or decrease in fees paid to a state agency; - will create a new regulation; - will repeal an existing regulation; -will not result in an increase or decrease in the number of indi- viduals subject to the rule; and -will not positively or adversely affect the state's economy. REQUEST FOR PUBLIC COMMENT The rule proposal was published in the July 29, 2022 issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4397). The deadline for public comment was August 29, 2022. The OAG did not receive any comments from interested parties on the rule proposal during the 30-day public comment period. SUBCHAPTER A.

EDUCATION PART 2. TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY CHAPTER 66. STATE ADOPTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS SUBCHAPTER C. LOCAL OPERATIONS 19 TAC \u00a766.105 The State Board of Education (SBOE) adopts an amendment to \u00a766.105, concerning state adoption and distribution of instruc- tional materials. The amendment is adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the July 22, 2022 issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4250) and will not be repub- lished. The adopted amendment adds a certification require- ment to align with Senate Bill (SB) 1, 87th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. REASONED JUSTIFICATION: Section 66.105 addresses local education agency certification for providing each student with instructional materials covering of all elements of the essential knowledge and skills adopted by the SBOE for each subject and each grade level, other than physical education. SB 1, 87th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2021, directed the SBOE to ensure that recipients of funds from the state in- structional materials and technology fund meet the requirements for certification under 47 USC \u00a7254(h)(5)(B) and (C), Children's Internet Protection Act, when using those funds to purchase in- structional materials or technology. The adopted amendment to \u00a766.105 adds new subsection (b) to clarify the instructional mate- rials certification requirements for school districts and open-en- rollment charter schools regarding children's internet safety in accordance with SB 1. The SBOE approved the amendment for first reading and filing authorization at its June 17, 2022 meeting and for second read- ing and final adoption at its September 2, 2022 meeting. In accordance with TEC, \u00a77.102(f), the SBOE approved the amendment for adoption by a vote of two-thirds of its members to specify an effective date earlier than the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year. The earlier effective date will allow the SBOE to comply with the requirements in Rider 8 of the General Appropriations Act. The effective date is 20 days after filing as adopted with the Texas Register.

EXAMINING BOARDS PART 11. TEXAS BOARD OF NURSING CHAPTER 217. LICENSURE, PEER ASSISTANCE AND PRACTICE 22 TAC \u00a7217.2 Introduction. The Board adopts amendments to \u00a7217.2, relating to Licensure by Examination for Graduates of Nursing Educa- tion Programs Within the United States, its Territories, or Pos- sessions, without changes to the proposed text published in the August 19, 2022, edition of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4931) and will not be republished. Reasoned Justification. The adopted amendments make non- substantive, editorial changes to the section and correct typo- graphical errors. How the Section Will Function. Adopted \u00a7217.1(a)(4) makes editorial changes to the paragraph to more clearly identify the types of programs that the paragraph is referring to. Adopted \u00a7217.1(a)(4)(C) corrects an incorrect statutory citation. Adopted \u00a7217.1(a)(4)(D) and (E) make editorial changes for additional clarity and better readability within the paragraphs. Finally, adopted \u00a7217.1(a)(4)(E)(ii) corrects a punctuation error. Public Comment. The Board did not receive any comments on the proposal. Statutory Authority. The adopted amendments are adopted un- der the authority of the Occupations Code \u00a7301.151, which per- mits the Board to regulate the practice of professional nursing and vocational nursing; establish standards of professional con- duct for licensees; and determine whether an act constitutes the practice of professional nursing or vocational nursing, and \u00a7301.157(d-4), which requires the Board to adopt rules to en-sure that other state's standards are substantially equivalent to the Board's standards and develop a process for students en- rolled in a school of nursing or educational program operated in another state that does not meet standards substantially equiv- alent to the Board's standards to apply for an initial license. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority. Filed with the Office of the Secretary of State on September 23, 2022. TRD-202203856 Jena Abel Deputy General Counsel Texas Board of Nursing Effective date: October 13, 2022 Proposal publication date: August 19, 2022 For further information, please call: (512) 305-6822 22 TAC \u00a7217.5 Introduction. The Board adopts amendments to \u00a7217.5, relating to Temporary License and Endorsement, without changes to the proposed text published in the August 19, 2022, edition of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 4933) and will not be republished. Reasoned Justification. The amendments are necessary to clar- ify the Board's existing educational requirements for endorse- ment applicants who graduated from an out of state nursing ed- ucation program. In 2017, the Sunset Advisory Committee recommended amend- ments to the Occupations Code \u00a7301.157(d-4), (d-8), (d-9), (d-11), and (d-12). These changes related to substantially equivalent education standards for out of state nursing educa- tion programs and were codified in House Bill (HB) 2950. HB 2950 became effective September 1, 2017. Pursuant to \u00a7301.157(d-4), the Board is required to adopt rules to ensure that out of state nursing education programs are sub- stantially equivalent to the Board's education standards. In the event that an out of state nursing education program's standards are not substantially equivalent to the Board's education stan- dards, the statute requires the Board to develop a process for students graduating from such programs to still apply for an ini- tial license in Texas. At the April 2017 regularly scheduled Board meeting, the Board charged the Advisory Committee on Education (ACE) with rec- ommending rules to: (1) define substantially equivalent educa- tion standards for the purpose of ensuring out of state nursing education programs are substantially equivalent to Board stan- dards for licensure purposes; and (2) provide a pathway for ini- tial licensure for graduates of out of state programs that are not substantially equivalent to Board standards for Texas education programs. ACE met on June 22, 2017; July 25, 2017; and September 25, 2017, to consider the Board's charge. The Board reviewed ACE's recommendations at the October 2017 regularly sched- uled Board meeting and approved rule amendments to \u00a7217.2 for publication in the Texas Register for public comment. The Board considered written comments at its January 2018 regu- larly scheduled Board meeting and voted to adopt the proposed ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6581 amendments to \u00a7217.2 with changes. The adopted rule amend- ments to \u00a7217.2 were published in the Texas Register and be- came effective on February 28, 2018. The adopted amendments to \u00a7217.5 are necessary to clarify that the amendments previously adopted by the Board in February 2018 apply not only to applicants for initial licensure by exami- nation, but also to applicants for initial licensure by endorsement. Initial licensure in Texas may occur either through examination by successfully passing the National Council Licensure Exami- nation for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN\u00ae) or National Council Licensure Examination for Practical/Licensed Vocational Nurses (NCLEX-PN\u00ae) or through endorsement of a nursing license is- sued from another state. When the Board originally adopted the rules regarding substantially equivalent education standards in February 2018, they were placed in \u00a7217.2. Section 217.2 contains the Board's requirements that generally apply to initial licensure by examination. Section 217.5 contains the require- ments that generally apply to initial licensure by endorsement. Even though the amendments that were adopted in February 2018 also apply to applicants for initial licensure by endorse- ment, they were not also placed in \u00a7217.5 when the Board orig- inally adopted them in 2018. The adopted amendments, there- fore, place those requirements in \u00a7217.5 to provide additional clarity and congruency among the Board's rules. How the Section Will Function. Pursuant to adopted \u00a7217.5(a)(1)(A), an endorsement applicant must have graduated from an approved Texas nursing educa- tion program or a program with substantially equivalent educa- tion standards to a Texas approved nursing program. A profes- sional nursing education program operated in another state may be determined to have substantially equivalent education stan- dards to a Texas approved nursing program if: (i) the program is approved by a state board of nursing or other governmental en- tity to offer a pre-licensure professional nursing program of study that awards a nursing diploma or degree upon completion; (ii) the program includes general education courses providing a sound foundation for nursing education for the level of preparation; (iii) the program's nursing courses include didactic content and su- pervised clinical learning experiences in medical-surgical, ma- ternal/child health, pediatrics, geriatrics, and mental health nurs- ing that teach students to use a systematic approach to clinical decision-making and safe patient care across the life span; and (iv) for baccalaureate degree nursing programs, nursing courses must also include didactic content and supervised clinical learn- ing experiences, as appropriate, in community, research, and leadership. These requirements are the same requirements that currently appear in \u00a7217.2(a)(4)(A). Pursuant to adopted \u00a7217.5(a)(1)(B), a vocational nursing edu- cation program operated in another state may be determined to have substantially equivalent education standards to a Texas ap- proved nursing program if: (i) the program is approved by a state board of nursing or other governmental entity to offer a pre-licen- sure vocational/practical nursing program of study that awards a vocational/practical nursing certificate, diploma, or degree upon completion; (ii) the program's nursing courses include didactic and supervised clinical learning experiences in medical-surgical, maternal/child health, pediatrics, geriatrics, and mental health nursing that teach students to use a systematic approach to clinical decision-making and safe patient care across the life span; and (iii) the program includes support courses providing a sound foundation for nursing education for the level of prepa-ration. These requirements are the same requirements that cur- rently appear in \u00a7217.2(a)(4)(B). Pursuant to adopted \u00a7217.5(a)(1)(D), if an applicant does not have substantially equivalent education as set out in amended paragraphs (A) or (B), the applicant may become eligible for li- censure if the applicant enrolls in an approved Texas program and completes the necessary educational requirements. These requirements are the same requirements that currently appear in \u00a7217.2(a)(4)(D). Pursuant to adopted \u00a7217.5(a)(1)(C), a clinical competency assessment program shall be deemed substantially equivalent to a Texas approved nursing program while compliant with the requirements of the Occupations Code \u00a7301.157(d-8) and (d-9). However, a clinical competency assessment program will be deemed to not be substantially equivalent to a Texas approved nursing program if the program fails to meet applicable require- ments of the Occupations Code \u00a7301.157(d-11) and (d-12). These requirements are the same requirements that currently appear in \u00a7217.2(a)(4)(C) and are consistent with the statutory requirements of \u00a7301.157(d-8), (d-9), (d-11), and (d-12). Pursuant to adopted \u00a7217.5(a)(1)(E), if an applicant for licen- sure as a registered nurse has completed a clinical competency assessment program which is deemed not to be substan- tially equivalent to Board standards for Texas programs under amended paragraph (C), the Board may issue a provisional license to the applicant once the applicant has passed the NCLEX-RN\u00ae. The applicant will be eligible for full licensure if the applicant completes 500 hours of clinical practice under the direct supervision of an approved preceptor. The applicant, prior to beginning practice, must submit the name and license num- ber of a potential preceptor for Board approval. After completion of 500 hours of clinical practice under direct supervision of the approved preceptor and the preceptor's signature that the ap- plicant is competent and safe to practice nursing, the applicant may be eligible for full licensure. These requirements are the same requirements that currently appear in \u00a7217.2(a)(4)(E)(i). The applicant may also be eligible for full licensure if the appli- cant completes an educational program at an approved Texas program which is designed to assess and improve clinical skills for applicants who have not completed supervised clinical expe- riences in their prior educational program. The applicant must seek and receive the Board's approval prior to entering into the program to ensure that the program will allow the applicant may be eligible for full licensure. The applicant must provide the Board evidence of completion of the approved program. These requirements are the same requirements that currently appear in \u00a7217.2(a)(4)(E)(ii). Finally, adopted \u00a7217.5(a)(1)(F) allows an applicant for licen- sure as a registered nurse who has completed a clinical compe- tency assessment program which is deemed not to be substan- tially equivalent to Board standards for Texas programs under amended paragraph (C), in lieu of completing the requirements of amended paragraph (E), to submit proof, for Board review and approval, of at least 500 hours of clinical practice as a nurse in a single employment setting that is verified by a licensed nursing supervisor. The licensed nursing supervisor's signature shall ev- idence that the applicant is competent and safe to practice nurs- ing. This is the only adopted provision that was not in \u00a7217.2. This provision only applies to endorsement applicants because they will have received a nursing license previously issued by an- 47 TexReg 6582 October 7, 2022 Texas Register other state, and the Board recognizes that they may have al- ready practiced nursing successfully in that state of licensure. This would not apply to applicants applying for initial licensure by examination because they will not have been issued a nurs- ing license by any other state since they have not yet passed the NCLEX-RN\u00ae. For endorsement applicants, however, the adopted amendment is intended to provide them with an alterna- tive method of demonstrating nursing competency that may be less onerous. Public Comment. The Board did not receive any comments on the proposal. Statutory Authority. The amendments are adopted under the au- thority of the Occupations Code \u00a7301.151, which permits the Board to regulate the practice of professional nursing and vo- cational nursing; establish standards of professional conduct for licensees; and determine whether an act constitutes the prac- tice of professional nursing or vocational nursing. Further, the Occupations Code \u00a7301.157(d-4) requires that the Board adopt rules to ensure that the other state's standards are substan- tially equivalent to the Board's standards and develop a process for students enrolled in a school of nursing or educational pro- gram operated in another state that does not meet standards substantially equivalent to the Board's standards to apply for an initial license. The Occupations Code \u00a7301.157(d-8) sets forth the criteria under which a nursing program will be consid- ered to meet standards substantially equivalent to the Board's standards. The Occupations Code \u00a7310.157(d-11) sets forth re- quirements for clinical competency programs in other states that graduate students who pass the NCLEX-RN\u00ae at a rate lower than the Board's required passage rate for graduating students of approved in-state programs. Finally, the Occupations Code \u00a7301.157(d-12) establishes the criteria under which a clinical competency assessment program operated in another state is not considered to meet standards substantially equivalent to the Board's standards. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

HEALTH SERVICES PART 1. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES CHAPTER 229. FOOD AND DRUG The Executive Commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), on behalf of the Department of State Health Services (DSHS), adopts amendments to \u00a7229.661, concerning Cottage Food Production Operations, and \u00a7229.702, concerning Definitions, \u00a7229.703, concerning Permits, and \u00a7229.704, concerning Temperature Requirements, relating to Farmers' Markets. The amendments to \u00a7229.661 and \u00a7229.702 are adopted with changes to the proposed text, as published in the June 10, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3416). These amendments will be republished. The amendments to \u00a7229.703 and \u00a7229.704 are adopted without changes to the proposed text and will not be republished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The amendments are necessary to comply with amendments to Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 437, Regulation of Food Service Establishments, Retail Food Stores, Mobile Food Units, And Roadside Food Vendors as promulgated in Senate Bill (S.B.) 617, 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. S.B. 617 clarifies who may sell products at a farmers' market by changing the definition of \"farmers' market\" at Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7437.020(a)(1) and adding a new definition for \"food pro- ducer\" at Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7437.020(a)(3). The two definitions effectively prohibit a jurisdiction from construing the statute to exclude non-farmers or non-farm-related vendors and products from farmers' markets within its jurisdiction. S.B. 617 also amends Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7437.0065, which clarifies which food vendors may be permitted to sell food at a farmers' market and necessitates amendment of the statutory parameters for permitting in \u00a7229.703. This includes a $100/per annum cap on a single permit that is valid at any farmers' market in the jurisdiction of the permitting authority. In addition, it is necessary to make editorial changes to the rules due to the changes of the Retail Food Establishment rules in 25 TAC, Chapter 228, which includes the adoption by reference of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Food Code 2017 (Food Code). Rule citations in Chapter 229, Subchapters EE and FF are changed from Chapter 228 to the Food Code. The revisions update the definition of \"food establishment\" in \u00a7229.661(b)(9); change cooking times and requirements; and update references to \"time and temperature control for safety food (TCS food)\" in \u00a7229.704. Other editorial changes are made for consistency and clarity throughout the subchapters. COMMENTS The 31-day comment period ended July 11, 2022. During this period, DSHS received comments regarding the proposed rules from twenty-one commenters, including Harris County Public Health, Farm and Ranch Freedom Alliance, Bay Area Farmers' Market, Galveston's Own Farmers' Market, Homemade Texas, Victoria Farmers' Market, Canyon Farmers' Market, Southern Sunny Acres, R&R Farm, Dripping Springs Farmers' Market, These Bites, LLC, Natural Pasture Farms, The Greene Grille, and eight individual farmers and consumers. A summary of comments relating to the rules and DSHS's responses follows. Comment: Four commenters expressed support for the clear language in S.B. 617 to support local farmers' markets and re- quested regulations that are clear and unambiguous, as much in the spirit of S.B. 617 as possible. Response: DSHS agrees, and the rules are reflective of S.B. 617. DSHS made several changes to both the draft rules and proposed rules that are based on comments pointing out oppor- tunities for more clarity and inclusion. ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6583 Comment: Nine \"farmers' market\" at \u00a7229.661(b)(7) and \u00a7229.702(3) in order to specify a minimum number of farmers and add language allowing vendors besides \"farmers\" and \"food producers\" in the farmers' market as long as the \"farmers\" and \"food producers\" constitute the majority. Response: DSHS agrees and revises the rules as suggested. Comment: Ten commenters objected to the deletion of rule text in \u00a7229.661(b)(9)(C)(iv) stating that a kitchen preparing non-TCS foods for sale at a religious or charitable bake sale is not a food establishment. Response: DSHS agrees and revises the rule as requested. Comment: One commenter suggested that the requirement at \u00a7229.661(d)(1)(A) for a cottage food production operation to place the physical address of the operation, i.e., the operator's home address, is a safety issue. The commenter suggests that, instead, all cottage food production operations should be \"registered\" with DSHS and be issued an Identification Number. Response: DSHS disagrees and declines to make the sug- gested change. The address of the cottage food production operation is required on the label by Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7437.0193(b)(1). A requirement for registration of cot- tage food production operations goes beyond the scope of the statute, which indicates in Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7437.0191 that the operation is not to be considered a \"food establishment.\" DSHS has no authority to regulate or \"register\" cottage food operations. Comment: Nine commenters requested revision of the definition of \"farmer\" at \u00a7229.702(2) in order to provide examples of the \"agricultural arts\" and clarify the word \"control.\" Other comments suggested additional clarifying language. Response: DSHS agrees and revises the rule as requested to clarify the definition. Comment: Three commenters suggested, in a general way, that \u00a7229.703, concerning permits, places an undue burden on farm- ers and food producers at farmers' markets by requiring more permitting and should be changed. Response: DSHS disagrees and declines to make the sug- gested change. The wording in the rule text follows S.B. 617, which amended Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7437.0065. Comment: One commenter suggested that, in \u00a7229.703, a farm- ers' market should be required to become certified through state guidelines with Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) to better ensure they are operating according to the rules defined by the State. Response: DSHS disagrees and declines to revise the rule in response to this comment. Requirement for certification as a farmers' market with TDA is beyond the scope of the statute as set forth in Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 437. Comment: Nine commenters suggested that lack of clarity in the wording of proposed \u00a7229.703 may allow some jurisdictions to require a farmers' market permit of vendors selling cottage food products and raw produce. The commenters requested lan- guage that exempts these sellers from the requirement to obtain a permit from the regulatory authority for sales at farmers' mar- kets. Response: DSHS disagrees and declines to revise the rule as a result of the comments. DSHS does not require permits of cot- tage food operators or vendors of uncut, raw produce at farmers' markets under DSHS jurisdiction. DSHS thinks that exemption from permitting for these two groups is inherent in Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7437.0191(a) and \u00a7437.0192(a) for cottage foods and 25 TAC \u00a7228.2(14)(C)(ii) for produce vendors. On the other hand, DSHS does not have authority to mandate per- mit exemptions at farmers' markets in areas under the jurisdic- tion of local and county health departments. These jurisdictions are, however, subject to the limitations placed on farmers' mar- ket permits for farmers and food producers by Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7437.0065(c) and \u00a7229.703. Comment: One commenter suggested that \u00a7229.703 be changed to allow farmers' market permits that are valid through- out the state of Texas. Response. DSHS disagrees and declines to make the sug- gested change. The current rule text corresponds with Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7437.0065, which clearly indicates that the \"permitting authority\" lies with DSHS or with local and county jurisdictions.

LICENSING 26 TAC \u00a7553.35 The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) adopts amendments to \u00a7553.35, concerning Change of Owner- ship and Notice of Changes. The amendments to \u00a7553.35 are adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the May 20, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 3024). This rule will not be repub- lished. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The amendments authorize HHSC to issue a temporary change of ownership license in the name of the new owner of an assisted living facility (ALF) and to complete a health inspection while the new owner holds this temporary change of ownership license. The amendments also authorize HHSC to extend the duration of the temporary change of ownership license to allow HHSC additional time to perform the health inspection of the ALF. The amendments allow HHSC, under certain circumstances, to waive the requirement for an applicant to submit a complete application at least 30 days before the anticipated date of the change of ownership. In addition, the amendments update the licensure process relat- ing to change of ownership and address the process for a license holder to change its name when the facility does not undergo a change of ownership; make non-substantive changes to add clarity, remove redundant language, change the lettering of the subsections to account for the addition of provisions, and reorga- nize some provisions so that related topics are grouped together to facilitate navigation within the rule; and make edits to improve readability. COMMENTS The 31-day comment period ended June 20, 2022. During this period, HHSC received comments regarding the proposed rule from the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman. A summary of the comments relating to \u00a7553.35 and HHSC's re- sponse follows. Comment: The commenter recommended adding the following language to \u00a7553.35 to require an ALF to notify residents and resident representatives 30 days prior to an ownership change: \"Within 5 days of submitting all items described in subsection (c) of this section to HHSC, the facility must notify residents and resident representatives of the intent to transfer facility owner- ship from the current license holder to the applicant. The notice must include the anticipated date of the change of ownership.\" The commenter stated that when the owner of an ALF changes, facility policies, services offered, and charges for services also ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6589 change. Requiring ALFs to inform residents about changes of ownership will help ensure facilities are transparent about changes and residents are given a reasonable timeframe to make informed decisions about their services. Response: HHSC declines to make the suggested change at this time. HHSC will address issues of transparency and ALF changes to policies, services, and charges in a future rule project to ensure the public can comment on the proposed changes. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The amendment is adopted under Texas Government Code \u00a7531.0055, which provides that the Executive Commissioner of HHSC shall adopt rules for the operation and provision of services by the health and human services agencies, and Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7247.025, which requires the Executive Commissioner to adopt rules necessary to implement Chapter 247, Assisted Living Facilities.

In addition, the amendments address the process for a license holder to change its name when the facility does not undergo a change of ownership, and make non-substantive changes to add clarity; correct obsolete references from the legacy agency, Department of Aging and Disability Services, to HHSC; update rule references in response to the administrative transfer of the chapter from Texas Administrative Code (TAC), Title 40, Chapter 98, to 26 TAC, Chapter 559; change the lettering of the subsec- tions to account for the addition of provisions; reorganize some provisions so that related topics are grouped together to facilitate navigation within the rule; and make edits to improve readability. COMMENTS The 31-day comment period ended June 20, 2022. During this period, HHSC did not receive any comments regarding the pro- posed rule. STATUTORY AUTHORITY The amendments are adopted under Texas Government Code \u00a7531.0055, which provides that the Executive Commissioner of HHSC shall adopt rules for the operation and provision of ser- vices by the health and human services agencies, and Texas Human Resources Code \u00a7103.004, which provides that the Ex- ecutive Commissioner shall adopt rules for implementing Chap- ter 103, Day Activity and Health Services. The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the adop- tion and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal au- thority.

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY PART 1. TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY CHAPTER 307. TEXAS SURFACE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS 30 TAC \u00a7\u00a7307.2 307.3, 307.6, 307.7, 307.10 Editor's note: The Texas Commission adopted amendments to 30 TAC \u00a7\u00a7307.2 307.3, 307.6, 307.7, and 307.10 in the September 23, issue of the Texas Regis- ter (47 TexReg 6216). Due to an error by the Texas Register, the rule text for the adopted amendments was not published. The complete adopted rulemaking including the rule text follows. In accordance with Texas Government Code, \u00a72002.014, which permits the omission of material which is \"cumbersome, expen- sive, or otherwise inexpedient,\" the figures in 30 TAC \u00a7307.6 and 47 TexReg 6590 October 7, 2022 Texas Register 30 TAC \u00a7307.10 are not included in the print version of the Texas Register. The figures are available in the on-line version of the September 23, 2022, issue of the Texas Register. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ, agency, or commission) adopts amendments to 307.10 are adopted with changes to the proposed text as published in the March 25, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 1588) and, therefore, will be republished. Amended \u00a7307.7 is adopted without changes to the proposed text and will not be republished. Amendments to \u00a7307.4 have been withdrawn in this issue of the Texas Register. Background and Summary of the Factual Basis for the Adopted Rules The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or federal Clean Water Act (CWA), \u00a7303 (33 United States Code (USC), \u00a71313) requires all states to adopt water quality standards for surface water. A water quality standard consists of the designated beneficial uses of a water body or a segment of a water body and the water quality criteria that are necessary to protect those uses. Water quality standards are the basis for establishing effluent limits in wastewater permits, setting instream water quality goals for total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), and providing water quality tar- gets used to assess surface water quality monitoring data. The states are required under the CWA to review their water quality standards at least once every three years and revise them, if appropriate. States review the standards because new scientific and technical data may be available that have a bear- ing on the review. Environmental changes over time may also warrant the need for a review. Where the standards do not meet established uses, they must be periodically reviewed to see if uses can be attained. Additionally, water quality standards may have been previously established for the protection and propa- gation of aquatic life and recreation in and on the water without sufficient data to determine whether the uses were attainable. Finally, changes in the Texas Water Code (TWC), CWA, or reg- ulations issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may necessitate reviewing and revising standards to ensure compliance with current statutes and regulations. Following the adoption of revised Texas Surface Water Quality Standards (TSWQS) by the commission, the Governor or their designee must submit the officially adopted standards to the EPA Region 6 Administrator for review. The Regional Administrator reviews the TSWQS to determine compliance with the CWA and implementing regulations. The TSWQS are not applicable to regulatory actions under the CWA until approved by EPA. The TSWQS were last amended in March 2018. EPA began approving portions of the state's revised standards in November 2018. Reviews and revisions of the TSWQS address many provisions that apply statewide, such as criteria for toxic pollutants. They also address the water quality uses and criteria that are applica- ble to individual water bodies. An extensive review of water qual- ity standards for individual water bodies is often initiated when the existing standards appear to be inappropriate for water bod- ies that are listed as impaired under the CWA, \u00a7303(d) or po- tentially affected by permitted wastewater discharges or other permitting actions. States may modify existing designated uses or criteria when it can be demonstrated through a use-attainability analysis (UAA) that attaining the current designated uses or criteria is not appro- priate. Most changes in designated uses or criteria are based on a demonstration that natural characteristics of a water body can- not attain the currently designated uses or criteria. Natural char- acteristics include temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, diversity of aquatic organisms, amount of streamflow, physical conditions such as depth, and natural background pollutant levels. Con- versely, a UAA might demonstrate that the currently designated uses and criteria are appropriate, or even that they should be more stringent. A UAA can require several years of additional sampling studies, or it may focus on a long-term evaluation of existing historical data. For UAAs on water bodies that are potentially impacted by pollutant loadings above natural background levels, sampling and evaluation are often conducted on similar but relatively unim- pacted water bodies to determine reference conditions that can be applied to the water body of concern. The focus of UAAs depends on the uses and criteria that need to be reevaluated. The applicable aquatic life use is determined by repeatedly sampling fish or invertebrates in relatively unim- pacted areas and applying quantitative indices, such as indices of biotic integrity, to the sampling data of the biological com- munities. UAAs to assign aquatic recreational uses include as- sessing physical and hydrological conditions, observing exist- ing recreation, and collecting information on current and histor- ical recreational activities. Dissolved oxygen criteria are eval- uated by monitoring dissolved oxygen over numerous (usually ten) 24-hour periods in relatively unimpacted areas. Site-spe- cific criteria for toxic pollutants are evaluated by placing selected small aquatic organisms in water samples from the site and ex- posing them to different doses of the toxic pollutant of concern. The commission is adopting editorial revisions as well as sub- stantive changes. Editorial revisions are adopted to improve clarity, make grammatical corrections, and renumber or reletter subdivisions as appropriate. Numerous revisions of toxic criteria are adopted to incorporate new data on toxicity effects. Another adopted change provides clarity regarding the use of temporary standards. Numerous re- visions are also adopted for the uses and criteria of individual water bodies to incorporate new data and the results of recent UAAs. Section by Section Discussion \u00a7307.2, Description of Standards The commission adopts amended \u00a7307.2 to include language regarding temporary standards to improve consistency with federal rules listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u00a7131.14. These revisions allow the expression of the temporary standard as an interim effluent condition when adopted for per- mittees or water bodies. Revisions also clarify that a temporary standard must preclude degradation of existing water quality as opposed to impairing an existing use. Other revisions are editorial and adopted to improve overall clarity. In response to comments regarding \u00a7307.2(g), language was modified in \u00a7307.2(g)(1) to specify that the options listed therein are the only options for expressing a temporary standard, the in- terim effluent condition that reflects the greatest pollutant reduc- tion achievable with pollutant control technologies can be used if no additional feasible pollutant control technology can be iden- tified, and a temporary standard can be expressed as the high- ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6591 est attainable interim criterion. Additional \u00a7307.2(g) edits were adopted to improve overall clarity. \u00a7307.3, Definitions and Abbreviations The commission adopts amended \u00a7307.3 to include a definition and acronym for \"bioaccumulation factor,\" and the addition of an acronym for \"municipal utility district.\" The definition for \"method detection limit\" has also been amended to match the current fed- eral definition in 40 CFR Part 136. Other revisions are editorial and adopted to improve overall clarity. The proposed definition for \"pre-production plastics\" has been removed from this rule- making for further consideration and, therefore, is not part of adopted \u00a7307.3. \u00a7307.4, General Criteria The proposed addition of subsection (b)(8) explicitly prohibiting the discharge of visible pre-production plastic and providing a compliance mechanism has been removed from this rulemak- ing for further consideration; therefore, the commission does not adopt amendments to \u00a7307.4. The proposed rule has been with- drawn. \u00a7307.6, Toxic Materials The commission adopts amended \u00a7307.6(c)(1), Table 1, which lists numeric criteria for the protection of aquatic life, to include revisions to the existing cadmium acute and chronic criteria for both freshwater and saltwater based on EPA's issuance of an updated national criteria document. In response to comments regarding \u00a7307.6(c)(1), Table 1, the freshwater chronic criterion for cadmium was corrected, and the analytical method for free cyanide analysis has been incorpo- rated into footnote 2. Adopted changes to the human health criteria in \u00a7307.6(d)(1), Table 2, include the revision of oral slope factors that led to revised criteria for the following five carcinogens: benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, chrysene, 1,2-dichloro- propane, and 1,3-dichloropropene. Reference dose updates also led to revisions of criteria for the following two carcinogens: dichloromethane and tetrachloroethylene. Criteria revisions to one carcinogen, dicofol, were based on a revision to the animal body weight used to calculate the cancer potency factor from the oral slope factor. No criteria changes are adopted for noncarcinogens. Other revisions are editorial and adopted to improve overall clarity. In response to comments regarding \u00a7307.6(d)(1), Table 2, hu- man health criteria for chrysene and 1,2-dichloropropane were corrected, and the analytical method for free cyanide analysis has been incorporated into footnote 3. \u00a7307.10, Appendices A - E and G The commission adopts amended \u00a7307.7 to include the addi- tion of a geometric mean criterion for Enterococci of 54 colonies per 100 milliliters (mL) for high saline inland waters with primary contact recreation 2. Other revisions are editorial and adopted to improve overall clarity. \u00a7307.10, Appendices A - E and G The commission adopts amendments to \u00a7307.10 to revise Ap- pendices A -E and G. The adopted amendments to \u00a7307.10(1), Appendix A, include the addition of a footnote to Brushy Creek (Segment 1244) restricting the public water supply designation to within the Edwards Aquifer zones based on a lack of public wa- ter supply intakes. A footnote addition for Upper North Bosque River (Segment 1255) is also adopted to clarify that the portion of the segment from the confluence with Dry Branch upstream to the confluence with the North/South Forks North Bosque River in Erath County is intermittent with perennial pools based on a 1991 UAA. The UAA resulted in the creation of classified Seg- ment 1255, which was adopted as part of the 1992 revisions to the TSWQS and approved by EPA in an action letter dated June 16, 1993. Adopted changes also include the deletion of a foot- note that describes Mid Cibolo Creek (Segment 1913) as being an intermittent stream with perennial pools. This footnote, added in the 2018 revision to the TSWQS, had not been approved by EPA and was removed because further data evaluation is nec- essary. Additional adopted changes include revising the desig- nated use of primary contact recreation 1 with a corresponding bacteria criterion of 126 colonies per 100 mL to a secondary con- tact recreation 1 use with a corresponding bacteria criterion of 630 colonies per 100 mL for San Miguel Creek (Segment 2108). This adopted change is based on the results from a recreational UAA. Other revisions are editorial and adopted to improve over- all clarity. The adopted amendments to \u00a7307.10(2), Appendix B, include the addition of the San Marcos River (Segment 1808) and Choke Canyon Reservoir (Segment 2116) because they qualify as sole-source drinking water supplies in accordance with TWC, \u00a726.0286. Other adopted changes include the removal of Greenbelt Lake (Segment 0223) and Lake Brownwood (Segment 1418) because they no longer qualify as sole-source drinking water supplies. In response to comments regarding \u00a7307.10(2), Granger Lake (Segment 1247) is no longer being deleted from Appendix B, and Caldwell and Guadalupe counties were added to the \"County\" column for the new entry, San Marcos River, to better describe the general location of the water body. Other revisions are edi- torial and adopted to improve overall clarity. The adopted amendments to \u00a7307.10(3), Appendix C, include reverting the segment descriptions for Lower Cibolo Creek (Seg- ment 1902), Upper Cibolo Creek (Segment 1908), and Mid Ci- bolo Creek (Segment 1913) back to the most recent EPA-ap- proved descriptions due to further data evaluation being neces- sary. The adopted amendments to \u00a7307.10(4), Appendix D, include the addition of two water bodies along with their designated aquatic life uses and dissolved oxygen criteria. These additions are due to the results of extensive investigations via UAAs. All the water bodies are tributaries within the listed segment numbers as follows: Piney Creek (Segment 0604) and Little Pine Island Bayou (Segment 0607). A UAA also led to the replacement of an existing Appendix D entry for Buckners Creek (Segment 1402), which was replaced with two new entries for this water body to account for intermittent with pools and perennial flow regimes and to designate aquatic life uses and dissolved oxygen criteria for the two stream reaches based on the UAA. The segment number for the existing entry for County Relief Ditch was changed from Segment 0502 to Segment 0501 due to recent EPA approval of the revised boundaries for both segments in the 2018 TSWQS. Other revisions are editorial and adopted to improve overall clarity. The adopted amendments to \u00a7307.10(5), Appendix E, include the addition of eight new site-specific copper water-effect ratios in the watersheds 0702, 2429, site-specific copper biotic ligand models (BLMs) are also adopted for Segments 0202 and 47 TexReg 6592 October 7, 2022 Texas Register 0827. One existing entry for Segment 1001 has been reordered to arrange all table entries in numeric order by segment and per- mit numbers. In response to comments for \u00a7307.10(5), Appendix E, the phrase \"site-specific criteria\" has been added to the second and fifth sentences of the introductory paragraph of the appendix for clarification purposes. Footnotes in the \"Parameter\" column were also revised for two existing entries in the watershed of Segment 0901 for Enterprise Products Operating, LLC (Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES) Permit No. WQ0002940000) to clarify that the site-specific criteria are applicable to the area near the outfall as opposed to the entire water body. Other revisions are editorial and adopted to improve overall clarity. The adopted amendments to \u00a7307.10(7), Appendix G, include changing the presumed use of primary contact recreation 1 with a corresponding bacteria criterion of 126 colonies per 100 mL to a secondary contact recreation 1 use with a corresponding bac- teria criterion of 630 colonies per 100 mL for South Lilly Creek in the Cypress Creek Basin (Segment 0409). This adopted change is based on the result of a recreational UAA. Due to construc- tion activities that filled in much of Bullhead Bayou in the Brazos River Basin and rerouted the water body into a different water- shed, adopted changes to Bullhead Bayou include delineations of the East and West reaches and updates to segment numbers (from Segment 1245 to Segment 1202) in order to reflect cur- rent conditions for both Bullhead Bayou and Unnamed tributary of Bullhead Bayou. Adopted changes also include a revised de- scription of the unnamed tributary of Bullhead Bayou to reflect the delineation of Bullhead Bayou East. Other revisions are ed- itorial and adopted to improve overall clarity. In response to comments regarding \u00a7307.10(7), Appendix G, ed- itorial changes were made to the description of Bullhead Bayou East. Final Regulatory Impact Determination The commission reviewed the adopted rulemaking in light of the regulatory analysis requirements of Texas Government Code (TGC), \u00a72001.0225, and determined the rulemaking is not sub- ject to \u00a72001.0225 because it does not meet any of the four appli- cability criteria listed in TGC, \u00a72001.0225(a). According to sub- section (a), \u00a72001.0225 only applies to a major environmental rule, the result of which is to exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is specifically required by state law; exceed an express requirement of state law, unless the rule is specifically required by federal law; exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or contract between the state and an agency or rep- resentative of the federal government to implement a state and federal program; or adopt a rule solely under the general powers of the agency instead of under a specific state law. This rulemak- ing does not meet any of these four applicability criteria because it does not exceed a standard set by federal law; does not exceed an express requirement of state law; does not exceed a require- ment of a delegation agreement or contract between the state and an agency or representative of the federal government to im- plement a state and federal program; and is not adopted solely under the general powers of the agency but, rather, specifically under 33 USC, \u00a71313(c), which requires states to adopt wa- ter quality standards and review them at least once every three years; and TWC, \u00a726.023, which requires the commission to set water quality standards and allows the commission to amend them. Therefore, this adopted rulemaking does not fall under any of the applicability criteria in TGC, \u00a72001.0225. The commission invited public comment regarding the draft reg- ulatory impact analysis determination during the public comment period. Comments were received, and they are addressed in the Response to Comments section. Takings Impact Assessment The commission evaluated this adopted rulemaking and per- formed an analysis of whether it constitutes a taking under TGC, Chapter 2007. The specific purpose of this rulemaking is to in- corporate changes to the TSWQS deemed necessary based on the commission's triennial review of the standards, which mainly consist of incorporating new data on toxicity effects and from re- cent UAAs and clarifying the use of temporary standards. The adopted rulemaking will substantially advance this stated pur- pose by revising toxic criteria, individual water bodies' uses and criteria, and the temporary standards requirements in Chapter 307 of the commission's rules. The commission's analysis indicates that TGC, Chapter 2007 will not apply to this adopted rulemaking because this is an action that is reasonably taken to fulfill an obligation mandated by fed- eral law, which is exempt under TGC, \u00a72007.003(b)(4). CWA, \u00a7303 requires the State of Texas to adopt water quality stan- dards, review those standards at least once every three years, and revise the standards as necessary based on the review. TWC, \u00a726.023 delegates the responsibility of adopting and re- vising the standards to the commission. Nevertheless, the commission further evaluated this adopted rulemaking and performed an assessment of whether it con- stitutes a taking under TGC, Chapter 2007. Promulgation and enforcement of this adopted rulemaking will be neither a statu- tory nor constitutional taking of private real property. Specifically, the adopted regulations do not affect a landowner's rights in private real property because this rulemaking does not burden, restrict, or limit an owner's right to property and reduce its value by 25% or more beyond that which will otherwise exist in the absence of the regulations. In other words, this rulemaking makes necessary revisions to the TSWQS without burdening, restricting, or limiting an owner's right to property and reducing its value by 25% or more. Therefore, the adopted rulemaking does not constitute a taking under TGC, Chapter 2007. Consistency with the Coastal Management Program The commission reviewed the adopted rulemaking and found that the adoption is subject to the Texas Coastal Management Program (CMP) in accordance with the Coastal Coordination Act, Texas Natural Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a733.201 et seq.,and there- fore must be consistent with all applicable CMP goals and poli- cies. The commission conducted a consistency determination for the adopted rules in accordance with Coastal Coordination Act implementation rules, 31 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) \u00a7505.22, and found the adopted rulemaking is consistent with the applicable CMP goals and policies. CMP goals applicable to the adopted rules include protecting, preserving, restoring, and enhancing the diversity, quality, quan- tity, functions, and values of coastal natural resources by estab- lishing standards and criteria for instream water quality for Texas streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries, wetlands, and other water bod- ies. These adopted water quality standards will provide parame- ters for permitted discharges that will protect, preserve, restore, and enhance the quality, functions, and values of coastal natural resources. ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6593 CMP policies applicable to the adopted rules include 31 TAC \u00a7501.21. The adopted rulemaking will require wastewater dis- charge permit applicants to provide information and monitoring data to the commission so the commission may make an in- formed decision in authorizing a discharge permit, ensuring that the authorized activities in a wastewater discharge permit com- ply with all applicable requirements, thus making the rulemaking consistent with the administrative policies of the CMP. The adopted rulemaking considers information gathered through the biennial assessments of water quality in the commission's Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality to prioritize coastal waters for studies and analysis when reviewing and revising the TSWQS. The TSWQS are established to protect designated uses of coastal waters, including protecting uses for recreational purposes and propagating and protecting terrestrial and aquatic life. The adopted rulemaking is consistent with the CMP's policies for discharges of municipal and industrial wastewater to coastal waters and how they relate to specific activities and coastal natural resource areas. Promulgation and enforcement of these adopted rules will not violate or exceed any standards identified in the applicable CMP goals and policies because the adopted rules are consistent with these CMP goals and policies, and these adopted rules do not create or have a direct or significant adverse effect on any coastal natural resource areas. The commission invited public comment regarding the consis- tency with the CMP during the public comment period. No com- ments were received regarding the CMP. Public Comment The commission held a public hearing on May 2, 2022. The comment period closed on May 2, 2022. The commission received timely public comments from American Chemistry Council (ACC), Bayou City Waterkeeper (BCW), Carrizo/Come- crudo Tribe of Texas (C/C Tribe), Cibolo Creek Municipal Authority (CCMA), City of Round Rock (Round Rock), Coastal Alliance to Protect Our Environment (CAPE), Coastal Bend Council of Governments (CBCG), Coastal Bend Sierra Club Group (CBSCG), Coastal Conservation Association (CCA), Dow Chemical Company (Dow), Environment Texas (ET), Environ- mental Integrity Project (EIP), EPA, Environmental Stewardship (ES), Friends of the Brazos River (FBR), Friends of Padre (FP), Greater Edwards Indivisible TX (ITL), Ingleside on the Bay Coastal Watch Association (IBCWA), Inland Ocean Coalition (IOC), Jacob & Terese Hershey Foundation (JTHF), Lower Brazos Riverwatch (MesoAM), National Patrol (NP), San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper (SABEW), Save Buffalo Bayou (SBB), SPLASh/American Bird Conservancy (SABC), Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter (Sierra Club), Surfrider Foundation Texas Coastal Bend Chapter (Surfrider), Texas Campaign for the Environment (TCE), Texas A&M Univer- sity-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC), Texans for Clean Water (TCW), Texas Chemical Council (TCC), Texas Industry Project (TIP), Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN), and 516 individuals. Comments were also received from Tischler/Kocurek Environ- mental Engineers (T/K). Response to Comments General Comments Unrelated to TSWQS Changes Comment Twelve individuals provided general comments related to a va- riety of topics, including whether a business owner is allowed to pump out their own business septic tank as opposed to being required to use an approved service; ozone reduction, stronger enforcement on air pollution, and alternative fuels development to combat climate change; the need to better regulate a surface radioactive waste dump in West Texas; the ability to make it ille- gal to not recycle single-use plastic; the need for the world to stop using plastic; concerns that the state is turning into a desert; the need for infrastructure repairs to remove lead pipes; concerns regarding toxic sunscreen lotions contaminating rivers; the need for more information regarding recycling, along with more places to recycle; the burden placed on homeowners to purchase ex- pensive water filters because municipal water suppliers cannot be trusted; the need to audit the City of Laredo Utilities Depart- ment because subdivisions stay without service for weeks; and how a robust plan to recycle plastics would go far to control mi- croplastic pollution in waterways. Response The commission responds that these topics are outside the scope of this rulemaking. General Comments Related to TSWQS Changes Comment Two hundred thirty-eight individuals encouraged the protection of waters in the state by providing general comments related to a variety of topics, including eliminating and cleaning up pollu- tion; leading the way as a state; protecting humans, animals, and the environment; enacting stricter requirements and penalties; planning for the future; enforcing requirements; restoring animal habitat; protecting uses; encouraging wastewater reuse; pre- venting disease; adhering to federal requirements; protecting the economy; documenting pollution; finding wastewater disposal alternatives; providing environmental protection education; and enacting effective requirements. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that, through this rulemaking, it is the commission's intention to strengthen the TSWQS's effectiveness when it comes to protecting human health and the environment. Comment ACC noted its deep commitment to creating a circular economy for plastics. Response The commission acknowledges this comment. Comment Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, and FBR commented that the commission needed to extend the comment period for this rulemaking to May 15, 2022, because a correction to the initial publication of the proposed rulemaking was published in the Texas Register on April 15, 2022. According to the commenters, the extension was especially needed because the correction included underlining the new pre-production plastics language in \u00a7307.4(b)(8). Response 47 TexReg 6594 October 7, 2022 Texas Register The commission responds that an extension of the comment pe- riod was not necessary for several reasons. First, there is no le- gal requirement that a state agency extend its rulemaking com- ment period if it corrects the original Texas Register version of the proposed rulemaking. Second, there is no legal requirement that the commission's rulemaking comment period be a certain length. The statute cited by the commenters, TGC, \u00a72001.023, requires thirty days' notice of an agency's intention to adopt a rule before it adopts the rule, not thirty days between the begin- ning and end of a comment period. The public comment statute, TGC, \u00a72001.029(a), just requires that \"a reasonable opportunity\" be provided for the public to comment on a proposed rulemaking. And finally, the underlining required by TGC, \u00a72001.024(b)(3) is not a substantive part of a rulemaking; it is a tool used to make it easier for someone to identify new language. Even without the underlining, the public still received notice of the proposed lan- guage in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) through the preamble, which stated that an explicit prohibition on the discharge of pre-production plas- tics had been added to \u00a7307.4 and referred to facilities subject to the prohibition under \u00a7307.4(b)(8). As paragraph (8) was en- tirely new, there was no question as to what language was new versus old. Also, the underlining in the proposed rule language maintained on TCEQ's website was always correct, so anyone who accessed that version of the rulemaking through the link provided in the preamble and rulemaking notice was able to see the underlining. Therefore, even before the Texas Register cor- rection was published, the public received sufficient notice of the proposed language in \u00a7307.4(b)(8). Comment Sierra Club, TCE, ET, FBR, and 504 individuals noted the recently denied petition for rulemaking regarding pristine streams and recommended the commission take action on numeric nutrient criteria during this triennial review. All 504 individuals noted the importance of monitoring nutrient pollution and commented that monitoring alone is insufficient to protect pristine streams from harmful algal blooms and losses of eco- nomic development due to decreases in tourism. Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, FBR the TSWQS do adequately protect the state's waters from nutrient pol- lution, and the existing Nutrient Criteria Development Advisory Work Group has not been successful in implementing numeric criteria for nutrient pollution. The commenters recommended the adoption of a new designated use focused on pristine streams and prohibiting wastewater discharges into waters with that des- ignated use. They provided additional recommendations for ap- proaches towards developing criteria, including an example of how the Florida Department of Environmental Protection used the latest EPA guidance and stakeholder input to adopt numeric nutrient criteria for Florida. Response The commission responds that, as stated in the April 8, 2022, TCEQ commissioners' order with regard to the denial of the petition for rulemaking, TCEQ already addresses the concerns raised in the petition with a legally adequate program for as- sessing and protecting stream segments under the TSWQS and the agency's TPDES permitting program. No changes were made in response to these comments. Comment Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, FBR, and 504 individuals commented that past recreational use category changes were not supported by the Clean Water Act, and the E. coli criteria are not sufficient to protect human health and the environment. They requested that the contact categories be consolidated using the more stringent bacteria criteria. Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, FBR also com- mented that by adding recreational use categories in previous revisions to the TSWQS, TCEQ has allowed additional bacte- rial contamination, prevented segments from being listed as im- paired, and therefore not moved forward with the subsequently required TMDL action. Response The commission responds that it expanded the categories for recreational uses in previous TSWQS revisions to better char- acterize the different levels of water recreation activities that can occur in Texas. In the late 1980s and 1990s, a contact recreation use was broadly presumed for all surface waters in Texas, with the exception of eight site-specific classified segments, such as ship channels. As a result of these presumptions, there may be numerous water bodies with inappropriate recreational uses. These additional uses provide the commission the ability to bet- ter assign appropriate recreational uses to water bodies. Federal regulations in 40 CFR \u00a7131.10(c) allow States to \"adopt sub-categories of a use and set the appropriate criteria to re- flect varying needs of such sub-categories of uses.\" The sub- categories of recreational uses and associated criteria in the TSWQS, which are protective of the recreational use categories and based on acceptable illness rates, were approved by EPA for Clean Water Act purposes and are based on EPA's 1986 Am- bient Water Quality Criteria for Bacteria. The commission evaluates water bodies on a site-specific ba- sis to establish the appropriate recreation use following estab- lished recreational UAA processes. Some site-specific recre- ational standards in \u00a7307.10(7), Appendix G, of the TSWQS have been approved by EPA and others are pending EPA's re- view. For the biennial assessments of water quality in the com- mission's Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality, a water body's presumed, designated, or site-specific recreational use is used in the assessment. The commission continues to develop TMDLs as a management tool to address bacteria impairments in Texas. No changes were made in response to these comments. Comment Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, and FBR commented that it is not clear that marine bacterial standards are sufficiently protecting human health and requested that the commission evaluate the utility and sufficiency of using Enterococci as an indicator to mea- sure fecal pollution in saline environments and move to adopt standards that are clearly related to protecting human health and the environment. Response The commission responds that Enterococci is the EPA-recom- mended fecal bacteria indicator for marine water. Enterococci was first recommended as the fecal indicator for bacteria in ma- rine water in EPA's 1986 Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Bac- teria. EPA later conducted the National Epidemiological and En- vironmental Assessment of Recreational Water (NEEAR) study. ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6595 Based on the NEEAR study and past studies utilized in develop- ing EPA's 1986 Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Bacteria, EPA developed the 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria (RWQC) recommendations. In the 2012 recommendations, Enterococci continued to be EPA's recommended fecal indicator bacteria for marine water. EPA also provided a geometric mean of 35 colony forming units per 100 milliliters (cfu/100 mL) for Enterococci as one recommended criterion in the 2012 RWQC, which is con- sidered protective of primary contact recreation in marine wa- ters. The commission's geometric mean criterion for primary contact recreation 1 for saltwater is consistent with this EPA-rec- ommended geometric mean. Comment Sierra Club, TCE, rapidly adopt numerical salinity gradient criteria. The commenters stated that establishing a baseline for salinity gradients along the Texas coast is critical because climate change-induced sea level rise and coastal erosion will likely increase the salinity content in the Texas Gulf Coast. They noted that the Texas Gulf Coast has a high biodiversity of species, including the endangered smalltooth sawfish, which may be affected by changes in salinity. The com- menters acknowledged the existing provision in \u00a7307.4(g)(3) re- garding activities completed towards establishing salinity criteria in estuaries, but the commenters expressed concern on the rate of progress for criteria development. Response The commission responds that long-term salinity monitoring is still ongoing in accordance with \u00a7307.4(g)(3). The commission also notes that impacts to state and federally listed endangered species are considered in the commission's water quality man- agement programs. \u00a7307.2, Description of Standards Comment TPWD expressed support for the efforts to change language re- garding temporary standards to improve consistency with the federal rules listed in 40 CFR \u00a7131.14. However, TPWD recom- mended that the proposed language distinguish how temporary standards are expressed for permittees versus water bodies and provided suggested edits to that effect. Response The commission considers the current organizational structure of \u00a7307.2(g)(1) to be sufficient. No changes were made in re- sponse to this comment. Comment EPA recommended revising \u00a7307.2(g)(1) from \"When a tempo- rary standard is adopted for permittees or water bodies, the tem- porary standard may be expressed as one of the following\" to \"When a temporary standard is adopted for permittees or water bodies, the temporary standard must be expressed as one of the following.\" This change would clarify that there are no other allowable options under the federal water quality standard regu- lation for expressing the highest attainable condition. EPA and TPWD also recommended the addition of language to \u00a7307.2(g)(1) to specify that a temporary standard may be ex- pressed as \"the highest attainable interim criterion.\" EPA stated that although language in the 2018 TSWQS can be interpreted to include this approach, presenting all three options under para- graph (1) would provide clarity for stakeholders. Response The commission agrees with these comments, and the recom- mended changes to the language in \u00a7307.2(g)(1) are adopted. Comment EPA recommended revising \"pollution\" in \u00a7307.2(g)(1)(A) to \"pol- lutant,\" which is already included in subparagraph (B). Response The commission agrees with the comment, and the recom- mended change to the language is adopted. Comment EPA recommended prefacing \u00a7307.2(g)(1)(B) with \"If no addi- tional feasible pollutant control technology can be identified,\" for consistency with the federal water quality standard regulation. Response The commission agrees with the comment, and the recom- mended change to the language is adopted. Comment EPA recommended adding clarification in \u00a7307.2(g)(1)(B) that the remediation plan would need to be adopted and imple- mented, noting that the remediation plan would need to meet the requirements of a pollution minimization program under 40 CFR \u00a7131.3. Response The commission responds that requirements regarding imple- mentation of a remediation plan are specified in the Procedures to Implement the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards (RG- 194). No changes were made in response to this comment. Comment EPA recommended revising the proposed language in \u00a7307.2(g)(4) to read \"within 30 days of completion, the under- lying designated use or criterion will become applicable and must be used when implementing subsequent federal CWA activities.\" The proposed language could be misinterpreted as the \"existing water quality standards\" being the temporary standard. Response The commission agrees that additional clarity would be helpful in the rule language. To that end, the word \"underlying\" has been added before the phrase \"water quality standards\" in the last sentence of \u00a7307.2(g)(4). Comment EPA recommended including a reference to the federal regula- tion at 40 CFR \u00a7131.14 to cover any requirements that are not specifically identified in \u00a7307.2(g). Response The commission responds that inclusion of the federal regulation reference was discussed in a Surface Water Quality Standards Advisory Work Group (SWQSAWG) meeting with stakeholders in preparation for this revision, and the decision was made to not incorporate \u00a7131.14 by reference into the rule. No changes were made in response to this comment. 47 TexReg 6596 October 7, 2022 Texas Register \u00a7307.3, Definitions and Abbreviations Comment TPWD recommended that the term \"effluent condition\" be de- fined in \u00a7307.3(a). Response The commission responds that the term \"effluent condition\" is not defined in federal regulations. However, for clarity and consis- tency with federal regulations, the commission revised the provi- sion at \u00a7307.2(g)(1)(A) as part of this rulemaking to specify \"the interim effluent condition that reflects the greatest pollutant re- duction achievable.\" Comment An individual commented that the proposed definition of \"bioac- cumulation factor\" in \u00a7307.3(a)(9) is essentially the same as the existing definition for \"bioconcentration factor\" in \u00a7307.3(a)(10) and may misrepresent actual processes in the aquatic ecosys- tem by discounting the importance of biomagnification. Response The commission responds that unlike the definition for biocon- centration factor, which only accounts for exposure directly from water, the definition for bioaccumulation factor accounts for all routes of exposure, including food sources. No changes were made in response to this comment. Comment Surfrider, SABEW, CAPE, LBR, SBB, and support for the definition of \"pre-production plastic\" in \u00a7307.3(a)(50). Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes the proposed definition has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment SABEW and one individual recommended revising the definition of pre-production plastic in \u00a7307.3(a)(50) to include fragments or broken pieces of a pellet (nurdle). Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes the proposed definition has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment Surfrider, SABEW, CAPE, LBR, CBSCG, JTHF, and four individuals recommended revising the proposed definition of pre-production plastic in \u00a7307.3(a)(50) by replacing \"organic polymers\" with \"petroleum and biologically derived polymers\" since EPA has documented that bioplastics can be designed to be structurally identical to petroleum-based plastics and can last in the environment for the same period of time as petroleum-based plastics. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes the proposed definition has been removed from this rulemaking. \u00a7307.4, General Criteria Comment Sierra Club, TCE, EPA, TPWD, CCA, and ten individuals expressed general support for the prohibition on discharging pre-production plastic, which was proposed in \u00a7307.4(b)(8). SABEW and one individual asserted that the fact that the rule applies to both stormwater and wastewater discharges is important. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment CCA noted the presence of pollution from pre-production plas- tics as a global and local concern, including impacts to marine life and human health. An individual noted the presence of pollution from pre-production plastics as a concern in Texas and nation- ally, including impacts to aesthetics and bioaccumulative toxins (including mercury, DDT, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) adsorbing to plastic pollution. TPWD noted the importance of keeping plastics out of the environment. An individual also noted the prevalence of nurdles collected by the citizen science project Nurdle Patrol from Texas beaches in areas of manufacturing and transportation, such as railroads, nurdle distribution sites, and molding factories. Sierra Club, TCE, ET, risks associated with pre-production plastic pollution, includ- ing that pellets can act as vessels for toxic pollutants and cause issues up and down the food chain through bioaccumulation. SABEW and one individual noted that other contaminants in the water column may sorb onto plastics, and plastics may contain additives that have an additional negative effect on the environ- ment. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC, ACC, TIP, Dow, and T/K opposed the proposed provision in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) or urged the commission not to adopt the prohibition on discharges of pre-production plastic detailed in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) since there is no federal or state requirement and/or statutory authority to do so. TIP noted it has significant concerns regard- ing the proposed prohibition and recommended either rewording the proposed language to constitute a clarification of the existing narrative standard or withdrawing the prohibition from the pro- posal. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment ACC and Dow noted their support of the industry stewardship program Operation Clean Sweep. ACC recommended Opera- tion Clean Sweep as an alternative to the prohibition proposed in \u00a7307.4(b)(8), which was summarized by ACC as an alternative to zero-discharge regulations. ACC also urged the commission to promote best practices programs, such as Operation Clean Sweep, to help improve water quality. Response ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6597 The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment Sierra Club, TCE, ET, mended that the prohibition on the discharge of pre-production plastic, as proposed in \u00a7307.4(b)(8), should address all plastic pollution, including other microplastics that may not be visible to the naked eye. Surfrider, SABEW, CAPE, LBR, SBB, CBSCG, JTHF, and eight individuals expressed concern that inclusion of the term \"visible\" will allow regulated facilities to ignore micro- and nano-plastics, which they note have been proven to be harmful to the environment and human health, including DNA damage, endocrine disruption, cancer, and diabetes when ingested or inhaled. SABEW and one individual also noted that microplastics are harmful to the environment and that plastics can be small enough to be transported by wind and rain into stormwater. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment Surfrider, SABEW, CAPE, LBR, individuals recommended the term \"visible\" in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) to be further defined as \"able to see with the naked eye without special equipment, from a distance of three (3) feet. If a person requires prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses to achieve normal vision, those must be worn while monitoring for potential discharges.\" The commenters also provided recommendations for locating discharged plastics. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment Regarding the proposed revision in \u00a7307.4(b)(8), one individual commented that additional language is needed so that \"feasible\" does not become \"easily done\" and suggested a reference to practices for other particulates or practices at other plants around the country. Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, noted \"where determined feasible\" should be removed from the prohibition. Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, and FBR is necessary because determining feasibility, economic practica- bility, and what is achievable in light of best industry practices are contrary to the public interest. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment One individual noted the need for assurances that an offending company will not be able to evade responsibility for discharging pre-production plastic just because it sends a note from the plant engineer that complains compliance with the proposed prohibi- tion in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) would be hard. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment SABEW and one individual recommended that proposed \u00a7307.4(b)(8) should make it clear that the use of BMPs does not in any way absolve the permittee of the prohibition on discharg- ing pre-production plastic. The commenters also suggested the commission provide specific suggestions for the BMPs to be used by facilities and in permit requirements. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment Surfrider, SABEW, CAPE, LBR, individuals recommended revisions in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) to clar- ify that sweeping or washing plastics into stormwater or waste- water is not a BMP. SABEW and one individual recommended revisions to \u00a7307.4(b)(8) to further clarify that BMPs should pro- hibit permittees from sweeping spilled plastics into stormwater drainage areas unless the structures have mechanisms to re- move pre-production plastic prior to discharge. SABEW and one individual also recommended a separate stormwater system from the normal stormwater system and BMPs such as retention ponds. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC, ACC, TIP, Dow, and T/K expressed concern that feasible technologies do not currently exist to comply with the proposed pre-production plastic prohibition located in \u00a7307.4(b)(8). ACC noted that the proposal would impose significant costs on stake- holders. T/K asserted that the prohibition is a technology-based effluent standard, and if TCEQ is proposing it as such, TCEQ would have to provide technical supporting analyses demon- strating the standard is achievable and estimating the cost for compliance. TCC noted that the costs provided in the rule pre- amble's fiscal note associated with changes to 30 TAC \u00a7307.4 were conservative cost estimates that will likely increase signif- icantly during design and implementation, and there would be ongoing operational and maintenance costs. TCC noted it is not currently aware of any current technology that can assure absolute compliance with this proposed prohibition, and each facility has a unique footprint that will require control technolo- gies tailored to the individual facility. TCC recommended that if TCEQ considers adopting the prohibition, the language should be revised to focus on the implementation of feasible BMPs as defined in 30 TAC \u00a7307.3(a)(7), similar to the guidelines in Op- eration Clean Sweep practices, instead of a strict no-discharge prohibition of visible pre-production plastic. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment 47 TexReg 6598 October 7, 2022 Texas CBSCG, JTHF, and nine individuals recommended that spilled or discharged pre- production plastic must be regulated as a Class 2 industrial solid waste. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment Surfrider, SABEW, CAPE, LBR, individuals provided specific recommendations for require- ments derived from House Bill 3814 by Representative Hunter, which was filed during the regular 87th Legislative Session, to be included in conjunction with the language proposed in \u00a7307.4(b)(8). These included requirements for reporting spills to the commission within two days after detection of a discharge or release and ensuring cleanups are completed without harm to the ecosystem; containment systems to be designed and maintained to capture floating and sinking plastics that have a capacity to handle precipitation from 100-year, 24-hour storm events as determined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and, for facilities that discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity, inspecting a facility for eligi- bility before granting an applicant's Conditional No Exposure Exclusion for TCEQ's MSGP. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TPWD supported the prohibition on discharging visible pre-pro- duction plastic in \u00a7307.4(b)(8), the inclusion of questions in TPDES permit applications to identify facilities that handle plas- tic, and including prohibitions in final industrial TPDES permits regarding the release of plastic particulates of any size into the environment. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC, TIP, and Dow asserted the prohibition on discharging pre- production plastic in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) is a new, more stringent regu- lation than what currently exists for floating debris that is pre-pro- duction plastic, and the commenters requested that the com- mission grant compliance schedules for facilities as authorized by \u00a7307.2(f). TCC requested that TCEQ not only allow for the full three-year compliance period specified in \u00a7307.2(f) but also provide allowances for site-specific schedules for more complex control technologies, which could require a lengthy period of time to implement. Dow asserted that facilities would require signifi- cant time to implement control technologies and recommended that, at a minimum, TCEQ allow a multiyear implementation plan and provide a mechanism for evaluating longer-term implemen- tation projects on a case-by-case basis. TCC recommended that TCEQ provide sufficient time to allow for research and develop- ment of new control technologies that do not currently exist and for the implementation of these technologies. TIP recommended that if TCEQ proceeds with the prohibition, the agency should adopt an express statement that compliance periods would be available for water quality-based effluent limitations based on the new standard. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC, TIP, and Dow recommended the commission further clar- ify the proposed prohibition on discharging pre-production plas- tic in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) by specifying the point of compliance as the final permitted outfall. Dow recommended the commission spec- ify the prohibition only applies to water bodies outside the fence line of affected facilities and provide guidance to ensure consis- tent application throughout industry. SABEW and one individual commented that plastics should be considered discharged if they leave the final discharge point or outfall gate, even if on the prop- erty of the permittee. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment Surfrider, SABEW, CAPE, LBR, JTHF, and ten individuals expressed concern that \u00a7307.4(b)(8) contains no obligations to conduct monitoring or reporting of discharges of pre-production plastic or specifications of punishment for failure to do so. The commenters stated that enforcement penalties issued for violations must be large enough to deter future vio- lations and recommended that TCEQ consider the wealth and size of a violator when calculating the penalty. An individual recommended a strict enforcement policy, including BMPs and meaningful fines appropriate for the size of the company hav- ing the violation. An individual also recommended that permit- tees should be required to report and clean up any spills inside and outside their fence line within 24 hours after plastics are recorded and make all reporting of plastic pellet, flake, and pow- der violations, spills, and cleanups open to the public. An indi- vidual also noted the utility of auto-sampling devices to monitor wastewater discharges for plastics. SABEW and one individ- ual expressed concern that the proposed rule does not contain sufficient accountability mechanisms to ensure compliance and recommended that permittees that produce, handle, transport, or use microplastics should be required to obtain a permit and monitor outside all their discharge points, including outside their outfalls and at least 50 feet in all directions from the discharge location. SABEW and one individual also recommended that monitoring should be required the day after every 1-year, 1-hour storm event, for a 1-year/24-hour storm event or more, and at least once a month within 24 hours of a discharge, with additional monitoring requirements if plastics are detected. SABEW and one individual also recommended that monthly reports contain specific requirements and be made available to the public within a week of completion and that permittees impounding stormwa- ter behind structural barriers obtain certification twice annually. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6599 SABEW and two individuals recommended the commission en- courage citizen scientists to monitor around plastic facilities and facilitate the reporting of incidents by citizens using tools such as phone applications or a reporting form. SABEW and one indi- vidual recommended articulating standards for accepting citizen monitoring information and compensation for citizen scientists who document unauthorized discharges that result in violations or cleanups and suggested a process to allow the citizen scien- tists to direct compensation funds toward a local environmental project or the commission. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment SABEW and one individual expressed concern that the prohibi- tion on discharging pre-production plastic in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) does not specify requirements for reporting a discharge, cleaning up the discharge, and providing details about the cleanup. The commenters requested that the prohibition be revised to require documented reporting of discharge events, including the loca- tion of the discharge and volume of discharged plastics. The commenters also stated that cleanup reports should be made publicly available and recommended that the use of high-pres- sure hydraulic flushing of pellets from vegetation should not be allowed without TCEQ approval. The commenters also recom- mended that \u00a7307.4(b)(8) include a requirement that a person conducting monitoring must exercise reasonable efforts to locate discharged plastics along shorelines and under vegetation that may obscure the person's view of the ground. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC, TIP, and Dow expressed concern that the prohibition on discharging pre-production plastic proposed in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) could be used to penalize existing facilities for historical plastic discharges that may not have been released by the existing facility. TCC suggested the commission adopt, through guid- ance, a specification that the discharge prohibition is applicable only to new discharges with a direct and traceable link to the facility. T/K asserted the discharge prohibition is unenforceable because finding pellets near a permitted outfall is no guarantee they are present due to a discharge from that outfall. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC, TIP, and Dow requested that the commission revise the proposal located in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) to clarify that a regulated entity will have the opportunity to remediate the release of any visible plastic by cleaning them up before the commission classifies any release as a violation. TCC also recommended that the commis- sion include reasonable and appropriate remediation timelines that take into consideration elements such as property access, waterway access, waterway traffic, and permitting requirements. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC, TIP, and Dow requested that the commission include in guidance the conditions under which the proposed prohibition on discharging pre-production plastic in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) will apply, such as those specified at \u00a7\u00a7307.4(a) and 307.9(b). Dow re- quested that the commission include a mechanism for excluding extreme weather conditions from these requirements. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment SABEW and one individual expressed concern with the commis- sion's enforcement process as it related to historical experiences with the Formosa facility. The commenters recommended that the commission consider the wealth of the violator and costs for- gone by violators when assessing fines. The commenters also asserted that fines for violators are grossly underestimated. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC and Dow expressed concern that the prohibition on dis- charging pre-production plastic in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) would cause con- fusion rather than clarification, is not a criterion at all, and would be more appropriate as an implementation mechanism. TCC, TIP, and T/K asserted the prohibition is more than a clarification because the no-discharge prohibition is a zero-discharge stan- dard. TIP considered the prohibition to be a new numeric cri- terion. TCC asserted additional confusion regarding the imple- mentation and applicability of mixing zones and zones of initial dilution due to the prohibition. TIP expressed concern that the prohibition on discharging visible pre-production plastic conflicts with existing narrative criteria in \u00a7307.4(b)(2), which do not cur- rently include a zero-discharge standard. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC, ACC, TIP, Dow, and T/K expressed concern that the zero- discharge standard in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) for a non-toxic material has not been scientifically justified, and TCEQ has not followed re- quirements in TWC, \u00a726.023 regarding the use of quality as- sured data to develop standards. The commenters requested that TCEQ share the scientific rationale utilized to justify the proposed revision. TCC recommended that TCEQ could have developed a proposal based on the results of a scientific study and taken into account what can be accomplished through en- forcement of the existing requirements for floating debris. TIP asserted that TCEQ did not and cannot articulate a sound sci- entific rationale for the plastics provision to impose a zero-dis- charge standard. Dow urged TCEQ to reconsider the proposed revisions to ensure that an appropriate administrative record is developed. Response 47 TexReg 6600 October 7, 2022 Texas Register The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment ACC expressed concern that the prohibition on discharging visible pre-production plastic located in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) requires a robust stakeholder process to ensure the commission gains a deeper understanding of the needs, interests, concerns, and experiences of all stakeholders. ACC urged the commission to initiate a robust stakeholder process to ensure all views and knowledge are taken into account. ACC also noted that the decision-making process should be fully transparent and informed through public engagement and review. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TCC, TIP, Dow, and ACC asserted that the discharge prohibition for visible pre-production plastic in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) is more than a clarification and requested that the commission explain the ratio- nale for considering the changes as only a clarification. TIP as- serted that the existing standard applicable to visible pre-produc- tion plastic has been in place for decades; reimagining its mean- ing by purporting to make a clarification is inconsistent with its plain language and not a sound precedent for how water quality standards have been, or should be, adopted. T/K asserted that the prohibition is not a clarification and that existing \u00a7307.4(b)(2) is not a zero-discharge standard. T/K also asserted that if the clarification was applied to existing \u00a7307.4(b)(2), it would affect every municipal and industrial discharger in the state, and the \"essentially free\" specification in the existing regulation provides TCEQ sufficient authority to enforce this rule on plastics. T/K also recommended adding a single sentence to \u00a7307.4(b) stat- ing that the provision applies to pre-production plastic as floating and suspended materials would be a clarification and would not constitute a major environmental rule change. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TIP, Dow, and T/K expressed concern that the proposed pro- hibition in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) on discharging pre-production plastic is being promulgated by the commission in response to a specific court ruling and settlement agreement, San Antonio Bay Estu- arine Waterkeeper v. Formosa. TIP asserted that the court did not purport to remake law, interpret existing permit conditions, or otherwise prescribe the proposed rulemaking. T/K asserted that the existing regulations in \u00a7307.4(b)(2) are sufficient for TCEQ to control wastewater discharges of pre-production plastic and need to be adequately enforced. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TIP and Dow provided alternative language to further clarify the prohibition language in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) by specifying there shall be essentially no discharges of pre-production plastic that are con- ducive to producing adverse responses in aquatic organisms or putrescible sludge deposits or sediment layers that adversely af- fect benthic biota or any lawful uses. TIP recommended that the BMP language in proposed \u00a7307.4(b)(8) be removed because it may be more appropriate to implement it as a permit condition. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment EPA recommended amending the prohibition on discharging pre- production plastic in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) by including an expression of the desired condition of waters in the state, should the commis- sion intend for the prohibition to be used for all CWA purposes, including assessment under CWA, \u00a7303(d). Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TIP expressed concern that the plastic provisions in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) had not been properly noticed under the Texas Administrative Procedure Act, TGC, \u00a72001.024. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment T/K expressed concern that the prohibition proposed in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) is substantially more restrictive than the existing rule and is a major new environmental rule subject to the regu- latory analysis requirements of TGC, \u00a72001.0025. TIP asserted that the plastics provision would \"exceed a standard set by federal law\" and constituted a major environmental rule. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. Comment TIP asserted that the first sentence of the newly proposed lan- guage in \u00a7307.4(b)(8) is unqualified. Response The commission acknowledges these comments and notes that proposed \u00a7307.4 has been removed from this rulemaking. \u00a7307.5, Antidegradation Comment FBR commented that provisions regarding Tier 2 in \u00a7307.5(b)(2) are inconsistent with federal reg- ulations, and current language undermines the purpose of the Tier 2 review. The commenters recommended that the commis- sion remove or define \"de minimis\" in \u00a7307.5(b)(2) and require a meaningful alternatives analysis in TPDES permitting. Response The commission responds that the existing antidegradation pol- icy in \u00a7307.5 has been approved by EPA and meets federal re- quirements at 40 CFR \u00a7131.12. The Procedures to Implement the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards (RG-194) provide ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6601 guidance on how the antidegradation policy is implemented in TPDES permits. No changes were made in response to this comment. \u00a7307.6, Toxic Materials Comment T/K commented on two footnotes in \u00a7307.6(c)(1), Table 1. Footnote 2 specifies that compliance with the standard for free cyanide will be determined with the analytical method for available cyanide. T/K noted that there is also an analytical method for free cyanide approved at 40 CFR Part 136. T/K recommended that footnote 2 include that the method for free cyanide analysis is also acceptable for determining compliance. T/K noted that without this change to footnote 2, the result would be that a method specific for free cyanide would not be authorized to demonstrate compliance. Regarding footnote 3, T/K questioned whether the current nu- meric criteria for PCBs, which is based on EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database, justifies the standard be- ing set based on the sum of all congeners, isomers, homologs, or Aroclors. T/K noted that review of the data in IRIS suggests that almost all toxicology data are based on the Aroclors, not on the much longer list of congeners, isomers, and homologs that is now identifiable using EPA's proposed analytical method. Fur- thermore, T/K noted that EPA's proposed analytical method that would measure dozens or more congeners has never been ap- proved at 40 CFR Part 136. Therefore, T/K recommended that TCEQ reevaluate footnote 3 to determine if it is scientifically jus- tified at this time. Response The commission responds that the inclusion of the analytical method for free cyanide analysis has been incorporated into footnote 2 of \u00a7307.6(c)(1), Table 1 as well as footnote 3 of \u00a7307.6(d)(1), Table 2 for consistency. The commission may consider alterations to footnote 3 of \u00a7307.6(c)(1), Table 1, which regards analytical methods for PCBs, in a future revision of the TSWQS. Comment EPA expressed support for the adoption of the updated cadmium aquatic life criteria in \u00a7307.6(c)(1), Table 1, but noted a typo- graphical error in the formula for the proposed chronic freshwater criterion. EPA commented that for consistency with the current nationally recommended criterion, the slope of the chronic fresh- water criterion should be 0.7977 rather than 0.7997 as included in the proposed TSWQS. Response The commission agrees with this comment, and the recommen- dation to correct the typographical error has been incorporated into the adopted aquatic life criteria in \u00a7307.6(c)(1), Table 1. Comment T/K commented that the language in \u00a7307.6(c)(6) includes the following sentence: \"There must be no lethality to aquatic organisms that move through a ZID, and the sizes of ZIDs are limited in accordance with \u00a7307.8 of this title.\" T/K noted that in a recent administrative hearing before the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH), the contention was made by protestants to a draft permit that this sentence must be inter- preted as zero lethality, which in fact is scientifically impossible to prove. T/K asserted that the quoted sentence directly con-flicts with \u00a7307.6(e)(1), which states, \"Acute total toxicity levels may be exceeded in a ZID, but there must be no significant lethality to aquatic organisms that move through a ZID.\" T/K noted that when the commissioners acted on SOAH's proposal for decision, they concluded the meaning of the no lethality provision in \u00a7307.6(c)(6) should be interpreted as no significant lethality as specified at \u00a7307.6(e)(1). T/K requested that TCEQ revise the no lethality provision in \u00a7307.6(c)(6) by adding the word \"significant\" to make it consistent with \u00a7307.6(e)(1) and the commissioners' decision. Response The commission responds that the issue decided by the com- missioners at their May 19, 2021, agenda with regard to lethality was that the correct standard to apply in the case in question was \u00a7307.6(e)(1) rather than \u00a7307.6(c)(6) or 307.8(b)(2), not how to interpret \u00a7307.6(c)(6). The commissioners actually referred to \u00a7307.6(e)(1) as the less stringent standard of the three. The commission also notes that the language in \u00a7307.6(c)(6) relates to specific numerical acute criteria for toxic substances, while the language in \u00a7307.6(e)(1) addresses total toxicity of permit- ted dischargers. As such, these two paragraphs of the rule are not discussing the same issue in relation to lethality. No changes were made in response to this comment. Comment EPA expressed support for the use of updated toxicity values and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for calculating human health criteria in \u00a7307.6(d)(1), Table 2. Response The commission acknowledges this comment. Comment Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, FBR commented that TCEQ should provide sufficient justification for weakening human health numeric criteria for carcinogens in \u00a7307.6(d)(1), Table 2, especially if TCEQ can already protect human health with the current numeric standards. The commenters stated that TCEQ explained that proposed changes to the human health criteria for carcinogens are based on a revision of oral slope factors for benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, chrysene, 1,2-dichloropropane, and 1,3-dichloropropene, but despite these explanations, the concentrations are alarming without adequate justification. The commenters also commented that it remains unclear from both the background and the proposed standards how these changes in method were ascertained, including whether they came from EPA, TCEQ, or elsewhere. The commenters also stated that any change to the oral slope factor in measuring the amount of permissible carcinogenic pollution is intended to be used as a minimum basis, and if TCEQ can regulate such carcinogens at a lower and safer amount (such as at present), the justification to permit more carcinogenic pollution that risks human health should be better reasoned than simply because it is allowable. Response The commission responds that triennial revisions of the TSWQS are performed in part to include new scientific data on the effects of chemicals and pollutants, and updates to the human health criteria found in \u00a7307.6(d)(1), Table 2, are based on new information and studies on the potential toxic effects of chemicals of concern on human health. Revisions to Table 47 TexReg 6602 October 7, 2022 Texas Register 2 were presented to the SWQSAWG on March 9, 2020. To prepare stakeholders for the March 2020 SWQSAWG meeting, a handout explaining the basis for the changes to Table 2 and a spreadsheet showing all the inputs, equations, and changes to numeric criteria were posted on the agency's SWQSAWG webpage (www.tceq.texas.gov/waterquality/standards/stake- holders/swqsawg.html) before the meeting occurred. Both the handout and the spreadsheet remain available on the SWQ- SAWG webpage. Updates to the factors used for toxic numeric criteria were conducted in accordance with the sources cited in \u00a7307.6(d)(3)(A), and it is not unusual for criteria values to be updated based on new data. No changes were made in response to this comment. Comment EPA commented that the proposed fish consumption criteria for dichloromethane (75-09-2) and tetrachloroethylene (127-18-4) included in revisions to \u00a7307.6(d)(1), Table 2, are based on up- dated reference doses for non-carcinogenic effects. EPA noted these criteria were calculated using reference doses available in EPA's IRIS and the state's assumptions for childhood exposure factors. EPA published updated procedures for calculating hu- man health criteria in Methodology for Deriving Ambient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health in 2000. Un- der CWA, \u00a7304(a), EPA published updated human health criteria recommendations in June 2015 based on the 2000 methodology and other information. EPA commented that these updated rec- ommendations include revised cancer slope factors and refer- ence doses (RfDs); use of relative source contributions (RSCs) in criteria for non-carcinogens to account for other sources of exposure (e.g., food or air); use of BAFs instead of bioconcen- tration factors; and derivation of BAFs using aquatic trophic lev- els. EPA noted that several components of the revised human health methodology, such as BAFs and use of a scaling factor of 3/4 to adjust doses in toxicity studies from animal weight to hu- man weight, have been incorporated during previous revisions of the TSWQS. EPA recommended using exposure factors based on updated information located in the 2011 Exposure Factors Handbook (with updated chapters available online) to calculate human health criteria. When deriving human health criteria for noncarcinogens and nonlinear carcinogens, EPA recommended including an RSC factor to account for sources of exposure other than drinking water and consumption of fish and shellfish from inland and nearshore waters. EPA noted that using an RSC en- sures the level of a chemical allowed by a water quality criterion, when combined with other exposure sources, will not result in ex- posures that exceed the RfD and helps prevent adverse health effects from exposure to a given chemical over a person's life- time. EPA noted that chapter four of EPA's 2000 human health methodology includes an approach for determining an appropri- ate RSC for a given pollutant ranging in value from 0.2 to 0.8 to ensure drinking water and fish consumption alone are not appor- tioned the entirety of the RfD. Response The commission responds that when updating the cancer slope factor and RfD inputs for this revision, the commission used the latest information found in EPA's IRIS assessment in accordance with \u00a7307.6(d)(3)(A). The commission supports using information located in IRIS to have a consistent, peer-reviewed source for toxicity factors that can be used throughout the agency and to create consistency among all program areas. The commission began using childhood consumption factors for noncarcinogen criteria calculations and BAFs, where available, for all human health criteria calculations during the 2010 revision of the TSWQS, in accordance with EPA's Methodology for Deriv- ing Ambient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health (2000). EPA's recommended RSC factors have not been utilized in the human health calculations, and this deviation from federal guidance has been consistently employed by the com- mission as documented in the EPA-approved 2010, 2014, and 2018 revisions to human health criteria. No changes were made in response to these comments. Comment EPA commented that the calculations for chrysene (218-01-9) in TCEQ's 2020 spreadsheet, which was used to derive the revised human health criteria for this substance in \u00a7307.6(d)(1), Table 2, included a conversion of the 2/3 scaling factor to the 3/4 scaling factor to adjust doses in toxicity studies from animal weight to human weight. EPA noted this conversion was appropriate for the cancer slope factor previously used for benzo(a)pyrene. However, EPA stated that the updated slope factor for benzo(a)pyrene uses the 3/4 scaling. With this change, EPA calculated a water and fish criterion of 9.96 \u00b5g/L and fish consumption criterion of 10.26 \u00b5g/L. EPA also commented that a similar error with the scaling fac- tor appears to have occurred in the calculation of human health criteria for 1,2-dichloropropane (78-87-5). With removal of the conversion of the scaling factor for criteria calculations, EPA ob- tained a water and fish criterion of 9.17 \u00b5g/L and a fish con- sumption criterion of 301.98 \u00b5g/L (for carcinogens). However, EPA noted that EPA's maximum criterion level for 1,2-dichloro- propane in the current TSWQS is more stringent than EPA's re- calculated water and fish criterion of 9.17 \u00b5g/L. Response The commission agrees with these comments. The scaling fac- tor corrections for chrysene and 1,2-dichloropropane have been made in the calculations, and the revised human health criteria for both chrysene (water and fish criterion and fish consump- tion criterion) and 1,2-dichloropropane (fish consumption crite- rion) have been incorporated into \u00a7307.6(d)(1), Table 2. \u00a7307.7, Site-Specific Uses and Criteria Comment EPA commented that in \u00a7307.7(b)(1)(A)(vi), an Enterococci cri- terion of 54 cfu/100 mL (geometric mean) is proposed for ap- plication to the primary contact recreation 2 use in inland high saline waters. EPA recommended that the proposed geometric mean Enterococci criterion for primary contact recreation 2 in in- land high saline waters be revised to 30 or 35 cfu/100 mL. EPA also recommended the adoption of a statistical value threshold of either 110 or 130 cfu/100 mL Enterococci for primary contact recreational uses. Response The commission responds that the illness rate associated with the geometric mean criterion of 54 cfu/100 mL for primary con- tact recreation 2 for high saline inland water bodies is consistent with the illness rate associated with the commission's primary contact recreation 2 geometric mean criterion in freshwater, which was approved by EPA. The proposed geometric mean Enterococci criterion of 54 cfu/100 mL was derived using EPA's ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6603 1986 guidance, Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Bacteria, which is based on an accepted risk of illness of 10/1000, or 1%. The commission has previously adopted single sample criteria for primary contact recreation 1 in freshwater, high saline inland water bodies, and saltwater, including the specified criterion of 130 cfu/100 mL Enterococci for primary contact recreation 1 in saltwater. Under 30 TAC \u00a7309.3(h), the commission applies the most stringent criterion, i.e., for primary contact recreation 1, for permitting purposes. No changes were made in response to these comments. \u00a7307.10, Appendices A - G Appendix A, Site-specific Uses and Criteria for Classified Seg- ments Comment EPA recommended that aquatic life uses be adopted for Seg- ments 1006 and 1007 of the Houston Ship Channel. EPA noted that data have been collected that demonstrate an aquatic life use is justified. In accordance with this recommendation, EPA stated that the dissolved oxygen standards should be reevalu- ated. Increasing the dissolved oxygen standards from 1.0 mg/L to 2.0 mg/L for Segment 1007 and from 2.0 mg/L to 3.0 mg/L for Segment 1006 are recommended by EPA to protect the actual aquatic life uses. EPA commented that the adoption of uses and revised standards would allow a transition to a dissolved oxygen standard of 4.0 mg/L and aquatic life use of high for Segment 1005. EPA noted there are very few exceedances in Segments 1006 and 1007 in the 2020 Integrated Report and previous re- ports. Response The commission responds that at this time, no recent evaluation of these segments in the form of a UAA has been performed. The comment requesting the reevaluation of both segments is noted and may be considered by the commission for future triennial revisions of the TSWQS. No changes were made in response to this comment. Comment Round Rock expressed support of the addition of a footnote to Brushy Creek (Segment 1244) restricting the public water supply use designation to the portions of Brushy Creek within the con- tributing, recharge, and transition zones of the Edwards Aquifer. Round Rock noted certain water body characteristics, inade- quate flows, no known public water supply uses, and lack of proximity to existing public water supply intakes and wells as support for the change. Response The commission acknowledges this comment. Comment Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, FBR commented that the re- moval of the public water supply use designation for a large por- tion of Brushy Creek (Segment 1244) is inappropriate because the removal of this use could make it easier for current or future permitted dischargers to degrade water quality. Response The commission responds that there are currently no public wa- ter supply intakes or wells under the influence of surface water in this section of Brushy Creek, as described in the footnote. The removal of the public water supply use designation for this sec- tion of Brushy Creek does not preclude the possible future use of this section as a public water supply. At such a time that a pub- lic water supply use was identified, the public water supply use designation would be placed on the applicable portion of Brushy Creek. No changes were made in response to this comment. Comment EPA recommended the adoption of an aquatic life use and cor- responding dissolved oxygen criteria for Mid Pecan Bayou (Seg- ment 1431) based on a completed UAA. Response The commission responds that it will review the UAA for possible inclusion in a future revision of the TSWQS. Comment CCMA expressed support for the removal of the footnote on Mid Cibolo Creek (Segment 1913) in Appendix A and requested that any future study of the watershed be performed with the effects of the Odo J. Riedel Regional Water Reclamation Plant discharge properly considered. Response The commission acknowledges this comment and notes it will evaluate site-specific information during any future studies of the watershed. Comment EPA commented that it has reviewed the Recreational UAA for San Miguel Creek (Segment 2108) and expressed support for the proposed revision to secondary contact recreation 1 for this water body pending review of any comments submitted during this public comment period and from earlier comment periods. Response The commission acknowledges this comment. Comment Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, and FBR expressed opposition to the recreational use change for San Miguel Creek (Segment 2108) from primary contact recreation 1 to secondary contact recre- ation 1. Response The commission relied on information collected during the recre- ational UAA for San Miguel Creek to develop the site-specific secondary contact recreation 1 use. This reclassification is ap- propriate due to the presence of natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low flow conditions or water levels that prevent attainment of the existing use in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a7131.10(g)(2). The average thalweg depth was 18 inches, and there were no substantial pools. Access to the creek was moderate to difficult and limited by private property fencing adjacent to public bridge crossings. No changes were made in response to this comment. Appendix B, Sole-source Surface Drinking Water Supplies Comment EPA commented that it generally defers to TCEQ regarding the specific segments that should be included in Appendix B. How- ever, EPA questioned the deletion of Granger Lake (Segment 1247) based on information from TCEQ's Drinking Water Watch 47 TexReg 6604 October 7, 2022 Texas Register database, which appears to indicate that Granger Lake may still be a sole-source drinking water supply. EPA also recommended the addition of Caldwell and Guadalupe counties to the new en- try for San Marcos River (Segment 1808). Response The commission agrees that Granger Lake should not have been removed from the sole-source list. The commission also agrees that Caldwell and Guadalupe counties should be included in the San Marcos River entry. The \u00a7307.10(2), Appendix B entries for Granger Lake and the San Marcos River have been modified as recommended. Appendix C, Segment Descriptions Comment CCMA expressed support of the reversion of the segment de- scriptions for Upper Cibolo Creek (Segment 1908), Mid Cibolo Creek (Segment 1913), and Lower Cibolo Creek (Segment 1902) back to the most recent EPA-approved descriptions included in the 2014 TSWQS. CCMA referred to its review of historic and current aerial photography and water quality data as the basis for its support of this change. Response The commission acknowledges this comment. Appendix D, Site-specific Uses and Criteria for Unclassified Wa- ter Bodies Comment Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, and FBR expressed opposition to the aquatic life use change on the portion of Buckners Creek (unclassified stream within the watershed of Segment 1402) that has an intermittent with pools flow regime. The commenters noted that TCEQ's downgrade from a high to intermediate aquatic life use is based on evidence that this portion of the stream is not flowing much of the year. Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, FBR commented that intermittence should not dictate the level of aquatic life use since intermittent parts of a stream do not perform a less important role in aquatic life development. Response The commission responds that a two-year UAA was used to reevaluate standards for Buckners Creek. Biological data col- lected during the UAA indicated that an intermediate aquatic life use is attainable in the intermittent with pools portion of Buckn- ers Creek and is the appropriate aquatic life use. Federal regu- lations at 40 CFR \u00a7131.10(g) list several reasons for a change of use in a water body, which includes natural, ephemeral, inter- mittent, or low flow conditions or water levels that prevent the at- tainment of the existing use. Subcategories of aquatic life use do not indicate the relative importance of the aquatic life or stream reach, but rather the natural variability of aquatic communities. No changes were made in response to this comment. Appendix E, Site-specific Toxic Criteria Comment EPA noted that during the 2018 TSWQS revision cycle, revisions were adopted in \u00a7307.6(c) to clarify that BLM results can be used in the development of site-specific numeric criteria, rather than a multiplier to be used with the statewide freshwater copper crite- ria. EPA commented that it may be useful to add similar clarifi-cation in the second and fifth sentences in the introductory para- graph of Appendix E. EPA recommended inserting the phrase \"or site-specific criteria\" near the references to \"site-specific ad- justment factor(s)\" in both sentences. Response The commission agrees with this comment, and the phrase \"site- specific criteria\" has been added to the second and fifth sen- tences of the introductory paragraph of Appendix E. Comment EPA recommended revising footnote \"3\" to footnote \"4\" for both existing entries for Segment 0901. EPA noted that these two water-effect ratio (WER) studies were conducted by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC (TPDES Permit No. WQ0002940000), and the WER results are applicable to the area near the outfall as opposed to the entire water body. Response The commission agrees with this comment, and the footnotes have been changed from \"3\" to \"4\" as recommended in Appendix E. Comment EPA commented that, in accordance with \u00a7307.6(c)(9)-(10), EPA has previously approved site-specific criteria based on WER studies or BLM results for the following water bodies: unnamed tributary to Smith Creek (within the watershed of Segment 0202), Entergy Canal and tidal marshes (within the watershed of Segment 0601), Taylor Bayou Tidal (within the watershed of Segment 0702), Seals Gully (within the watershed of Segment 1009), Scott Bay (Segment 2429), Mustang Bayou (two studies within the watershed of Segment 2432), and Little Boggy Creek (within the watershed of Segment 2441). Response The commission acknowledges this comment and notes that those site-specific criteria were included in the revisions to Ap- pendix E. Comment EPA commented that the technical review of the following two studies is complete, and EPA will take action under CWA, \u00a7303(c) on the site-specific criteria pending completion of the 2022 revision of the TSWQS: Hurricane Creek (within the water- shed of Segment 0604) and Floyd Branch (within the watershed of Segment 0827). Response The commission acknowledges this comment and notes that those site-specific criteria were included in the revisions to Ap- pendix E. Comment EPA commented that the technical review of several additional studies for site-specific copper criteria have been completed, and if TCEQ's public comment period and EPA's approval un- der CWA, \u00a7303(c) are completed through the TPDES permitting process prior to the adoption of the 2022 TSWQS, it may be ap- propriate to include one or more of the following site-specific cri- teria in Appendix E of the adopted 2022 Spring Gully (within the watershed of Segment 1006), tributary to Houston Ship Channel (within the watershed of Segment 1007), and trib- ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6605 utary to Chocolate Bayou above Tidal (within the watershed of Segment 1108). Response The commission acknowledges this comment, and the above referenced studies will be added to Appendix E during the next revision of the TSWQS after receiving final EPA approval through the TPDES permitting process. Appendix G, Site-specific Recreational Uses and Criteria for Un- classified Water Bodies Comment EPA commented that it has reviewed the recreational UAA for South Lilly Creek, which is an unclassified stream within the wa- tershed of Segment 0409. EPA expressed support for the pro- posed revision to secondary contact recreation 1 for this water body pending review of any comments submitted during this pub- lic comment period and from earlier informal comment periods. Sierra Club, TCE, ET, ITL, and FBR expressed opposition to the recreational use change for South Lilly Creek from primary con- tact recreation 1 to secondary contact recreation 1. Response The commission relied on information collected during the recre- ational UAA for South Lilly Creek to develop the site-specific contact recreation use for this revision. This reclassification is appropriate due to natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low flow conditions or water levels that prevent the attainment of the ex- isting recreational use in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a7131.10(g)(2). The average thalweg depth was 19 inches, and there were no substantial pools. Access to the creek was difficult and limited due to private property. Therefore, the designation of secondary contact recreation 1 is appropriate. No changes were made in response to these comments. Comment EPA expressed support for the proposed revision to split Bull- head Bayou into two separate reaches as tributaries of Segment 1202. However, EPA recommended clarification of the eastern boundary of Bullhead Bayou East by revising the description to read \"to the Sweetwater Golf Course near Commonwealth Blvd in Fort Bend County.\" Response The commission agrees with this comment, and the description has been revised to the suggested edit for clarification. Statutory Authority The amendments are adopted under the authority of the Texas Water Code (TWC), \u00a75.102, which establishes the commission's general authority necessary to carry out its jurisdiction; TWC, \u00a75.103, which establishes the commission's general authority to adopt rules; TWC, \u00a75.105, which establishes the commission's authority to set policy by rule; TWC, \u00a75.120, which requires the commission to administer the law so as to promote the conserva- tion and protection of the quality of the state's environment and natural resources; TWC, \u00a726.011, which authorizes the commis- sion to establish the level of quality to be maintained in and con- trol the quality of water in the state; TWC, \u00a726.0135, which au- thorizes the commission to monitor and assess the water quality of each watershed and river basin in the state; TWC, \u00a726.023, which authorizes the commission to set water quality standards for water in the state by rule; TWC, \u00a726.027, which authorizes the commission to issue permits; TWC, \u00a726.121, which provides the commission's authority to prohibit unauthorized discharges; and 33 USC, \u00a71313, which requires states to adopt water quality standards and review them at least once every three years.

(2) Any errors in water quality standards resulting from clerical errors or errors in data may be corrected by the commission through amendment of the affected standards. Water quality standards not affected by such clerical errors or errors in data remain valid until changed by the commission. (3) The narrative provisions, presumed uses, designated uses, and numerical criteria of the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards may be amended for a specific water body to account for local conditions. A site-specific standard is an explicit amendment to this chapter, and adoption of a site-specific standard requires the procedures for public notice and hearing established under the Texas Water Code, \u00a726.024 and \u00a726.025. An amendment that establishes a site-specific standard requires a use-attainability analysis that demonstrates that reasonably attainable water-quality related uses are protected. Upon adoption, site-specific amendments to the standards will be listed in \u00a7307.10 of this title. (4) Factors that may justify the development of site-spe- cific standards are described in \u00a7307.4 and \u00a7\u00a7307.6 -307.8 of this title. (5) Temporary variance. When scientific information indi- cates that a site-specific standards amendment is justified, the commis- sion may allow a corresponding temporary variance to the water quality standards in a permit for a discharge of wastewater or stormwater. (A) A temporary variance is only applicable to an ex- isting permitted discharge. (B) A permittee may apply for a temporary variance prior to or during the permit application process. The temporary vari- ance request must be included in a public notice during the permit ap- plication process. An opportunity for public comment is provided, and the request may be considered in any public hearing on the permit ap- plication. (C) A temporary variance for a Texas Pollutant Dis- charge Elimination System permit also requires review and approval by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the permitting process. (D) The permit must contain effluent limitations that protect existing uses and preclude degradation of existing water quality, and the term of the permit must not exceed three years. Effluent lim- itations that are needed to meet the existing standards are listed in the permit and are effective immediately as final permit effluent limitations in the succeeding permit, unless the permittee fulfills the requirements of the conditions for the variance in the permit. (E) When the permittee has complied with the terms of the conditions in the temporary variance, then the succeeding permit may include a permit schedule to meet standards in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. The succeeding permit may also extend the temporary variance in accordance with subsection (f) of this sec- tion in order to allow additional time for a site-specific standard to be adopted in this chapter. This extension can be approved by the com- mission only after a site-specific study that supports a standards change is completed and the commission agrees the completed study supports a change in the applicable standard(s). (F) Site-specific standards that are developed under a temporary variance must be expeditiously proposed and publicly con- sidered for adoption at the earliest opportunity. (e) Standards implementation procedures. Provisions for im- plementing the water quality standards are described in a document en- titled Procedures to Implement the Texas Surface Water Quality Stan- dards (RG-194) as amended and approved by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and EPA. (f) Permit schedules to meet standards. Upon permit amend- ment or permit renewal, the commission may establish interim effluent limitations to allow a permittee time to modify effluent quality in order to attain final effluent limitations. The duration of any interim effluent limitations may not be longer than three years from the effective date of the permit issuance, except in accordance with a temporary variance as described in subsection (d)(5) of this section. (g) Temporary standards. Where a criterion or designated use is not attained and cannot be attained for one or more of the reasons listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u00a7131.10(g), or to fa- cilitate restoration or reconfiguration activities that preclude the attain- ment of the designated use or criterion, then a temporary standard for specific water bodies or permittees may be adopted in \u00a7307.10 of this title as an alternative to changing uses. (1) A temporary standard identifies the interim numerical criteria or use that applies during the existence of the temporary stan- dard. When a temporary standard is adopted for permittees or water bodies, the temporary standard must be expressed as one of the follow- ing: (A) The interim effluent condition that reflects the greatest pollutant reduction achievable; (B) Or if no additional feasible pollutant control tech- nology can be identified, the interim effluent condition that reflects the greatest pollutant reduction achievable with the pollutant control tech- nologies installed at the time the temporary standard is adopted, and implementation of a remediation plan as specified in the Procedures to Implement the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards (RG-194); or (C) The highest attainable interim criterion. (2) A temporary standard must be adopted in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d)(3) of this section. Once adopted by the commission and approved by EPA, a temporary standard is the applicable standard for the purposes of developing wastewater dis- charge permit limits and issuing certifications specified in the federal ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6607 Clean Water Act, \u00a7401 and Chapter 279 of this title (relating to Water Quality Certification). (3) Specific reasons and additional procedures for justify- ing a temporary standard are provided in the Procedures to Implement the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards (RG-194). A temporary standard must identify the water body or permittee to which the tem- porary standard applies. A temporary standard does not exempt any discharge from compliance with applicable technology-based effluent limits. (4) A temporary standard must be reevaluated every five years at a minimum, which may be conducted through the permit process or a triennial review of the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards. If the reevaluation is not submitted to EPA within 30 days of completion, subsequent federal Clean Water Act activities will be evaluated using the applicable existing underlying water quality standards. (5) The term of a temporary standard is expressed as an interval of time from the date of EPA approval or a specific date cited in the temporary standard. If the continuance of a temporary standard is sufficiently justified, it can be renewed during revisions of the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards. When a temporary standard expires, subsequent discharge permits are issued to meet the applicable existing water quality standards. (6) A temporary standard must preclude the degradation of existing water quality unless degradation is necessary to facilitate restoration or reconfiguration activities as specified in this section. (h) Effective date of standards. Except as provided in 40 CFR \u00a7131.21 (EPA review and approval of water quality standards), this chapter becomes effective 20 days after the date the chapter is filed in the Office of the Secretary of State. As to actions covered by 40 CFR \u00a7131.21, the rules become effective upon approval by EPA. (i) Effect of conflict or invalidity of rule. (1) If any provision of this chapter or its application to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not af- fect other provisions or applications of the provisions contained in this chapter that can be given effect without the invalid provision or appli- cation, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are severable. (2) To the extent of any irreconcilable conflict between pro- visions of this chapter and other rules of the commission, the provisions of this chapter supersede. \u00a7307.3. Definitions and Abbreviations. (a) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this chapter, have the defined meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. (1) Acute toxicity--Toxicity that exerts a stimulus severe enough to rapidly induce an effect. The duration of exposure applicable to acute toxicity is typically 96 hours or less. Tests of total toxicity normally use lethality as the measure of acute impacts. (Direct thermal impacts are excluded from definitions of toxicity.) (2) Ambient--Refers to the existing water quality in a par- ticular water body. (3) Aquatic vegetation--Refers to aquatic organisms, i.e., plant life, found in the water and includes phytoplankton; algae, both attached and floating; and vascular and nonvascular plants, both rooted and floating. (4) Attainable use--A use that can be reasonably achieved by a water body in accordance with its physical, biological, and chemical characteristics whether it is currently meeting that use or not. Guidelines for the determination and review of attainable uses are provided in the standards implementation procedures. The designated use, existing use, or presumed use of a water body may not necessarily be the attainable use. (5) Background--Refers to the water quality in a particular water body that would occur if that water body were relatively unaf- fected by human activities. (6) Bedslope--Stream gradient, or the extent of the drop in elevation encountered as the stream flows downhill. One measure of bedslope is the elevation decline in meters over the stream distance in kilometers. (7) Best management practices--Schedules of activities, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of water in the state from point and nonpoint sources, to the maximum extent practicable. Best management prac- tices also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.

(9) Bioaccumulation factor--A unitless value describing the degree to which a chemical can be concentrated in the tissues of an organism in the aquatic environment and that is absorbed through all routes of exposure, including the food chain. The bioaccumulation factor is the ratio of the concentration of a chemical in the tissue of an aquatic organism to the concentration of the chemical dissolved in ambient water at the site of sampling. (10) Bioconcentration factor--A unitless value describing the degree to which a chemical can be concentrated in the tissues of an organism in the aquatic environment and that is absorbed directly from the water. The bioconcentration factor is the ratio of a chemical's concentration in the tissue of an organism compared to that chemical's average concentration in the surrounding water.

(39) Method detection limit--The minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the analyte concentration is distinguishable from the method blank results and is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix containing the analyte. The method detection limit is estimated in ac- cordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 136, Appendix B. (40) Minimum analytical level--The lowest concentration that a particular substance can be quantitatively measured with a de- fined accuracy and precision level using approved analytical methods. The minimum analytical level is not the published method detection limit for a United States Environmental Protection Agency-approved analytical method that is based on laboratory analysis of the substance in reagent (distilled) water. The minimum analytical level is based on analyses of the analyte in the matrix of concern (e.g., wastewater efflu- ents). The commission establishes general minimum analytical levels that are applicable when information on matrix-specific minimum an- alytical levels is unavailable. (41) Mixing zone--The area contiguous to a permitted dis- charge where mixing with receiving waters takes place and where spec- ified criteria, as listed in \u00a7307.8(b)(1) of this title (relating to Applica- tion of Standards), can be exceeded. Acute toxicity to aquatic organ- isms is not allowed in a mixing zone, and chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms is not allowed beyond a mixing zone. (42) Noncontact recreation--Activities that do not involve a significant risk of water ingestion, such as those with limited body contact incidental to shoreline activity, including birding, hiking, and biking. Noncontact recreation use may also be assigned where primary and secondary contact recreation activities should not occur because of unsafe conditions, such as ship and barge traffic. (43) Nonpersistent--Describes a toxic substance that read- ily degrades in the aquatic environment, exhibits a half-life of less than 60 days, and does not have a tendency to accumulate in organisms. (44) Nutrient criteria--Numeric and narrative criteria that are established to protect surface waters from excessive growth of aquatic vegetation. Nutrient numeric criteria for reservoirs are expressed in terms of chlorophyll a concentration per unit volume as a measure of phytoplankton density. ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6609 (45) Nutrient--A chemical constituent, most commonly a form of nitrogen or phosphorus, that in excess can contribute to the undesirable growth of aquatic vegetation and impact uses as defined in this title.

(48) Pollution--The alteration of the physical, thermal, chemical, or biological quality of, or the contamination of, any water in the state that renders the water harmful, detrimental, or injurious to humans, animal life, vegetation, or property or to the public health, safety, or welfare, or impairs the usefulness or the public enjoyment of the water for any lawful or reasonable purpose. (49) Point source--Any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tun- nel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concen- trated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants or wastes are or may be discharged into or adjacent to any water in the state. (50) Presumed use--A use that is assigned to generic cate- gories of water bodies (such as perennial streams). Presumed uses are superseded by designated uses for individual water bodies in Appendix A, D, or G of \u00a7307.10 of this title (relating to Appendices A -G). (51) Primary contact recreation 1--Activities that are pre- sumed to involve a significant risk of ingestion of water (e.g., wading by children, swimming, water skiing, diving, tubing, surfing, handfish- ing as defined by Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a766.115, and the fol- lowing whitewater activities: kayaking, (52) Primary contact recreation 2--Water recreation activi- ties, such as wading by children, swimming, water skiing, diving, tub- ing, surfing, handfishing as defined by Texas Parks and Wildlife Code, \u00a766.115, and whitewater kayaking, canoeing, and rafting, that involve a significant risk of ingestion of water but that occur less frequently than for primary contact recreation 1 due to: (A) physical characteristics of the water body; or (B) limited public access. (53) Protection zone--Any area within the watershed of a sole-source surface drinking water supply that is: (A) within two miles of the normal pool elevation of a body of surface water that is a sole-source surface drinking water supply; (B) within two miles of that part of a perennial stream that is: (i) a tributary of a sole-source surface drinking water supply; and (ii) within three linear miles upstream of the normal pool elevation of a sole-source surface drinking water supply; or (C) within two miles of that part of a stream that is a sole-source surface drinking water supply, extending three linear miles upstream from the water supply intake (Texas Water Code, \u00a726.0286). (54) Public drinking water supply--A water body desig- nated to provide water to a public water system as defined in Chapter 290 of this title (relating to Public Drinking Water). (55) Saltwater--A coastal water that has a measurable ele- vation change due to normal tides. In the absence of tidal information, saltwater is generally considered to be a coastal water that typically has a salinity of two parts per thousand or greater in a significant portion of the water column. (56) Salinity--The total dissolved solids in water after all carbonates have been converted to oxides, all bromide and iodide have been replaced by chloride, and all organic matter has been oxidized. For most purposes, salinity is considered equivalent to total dissolved salt content. Salinity is usually expressed in parts per thousand. (57) Seagrass propagation--A water-quality-related exist- ing use that applies to saltwater with significant stands of submerged seagrass. (58) Secondary contact recreation 1--Activities that com- monly occur but have limited body contact incidental to shoreline ac- tivity (e.g. fishing, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, and motor boating). These activities are presumed to pose a less significant risk of water in- gestion than primary contact recreation 1 or 2 but more than secondary contact recreation 2. (59) Secondary contact recreation 2--Activities with lim- ited body contact incidental to shoreline activity (e.g. fishing, canoe- ing, kayaking, rafting, and motor boating) that are presumed to pose a less significant risk of water ingestion than secondary contact recre- ation 1. These activities occur less frequently than secondary contact recreation 1 due to physical characteristics of the water body or limited public access. (60) Segment--A water body or portion of a water body that is individually defined and classified in Appendices A and C of \u00a7307.10 of this title (relating to Appendices A -G) in the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards.

(63) Shellfish--Clams, oysters, mussels, crabs, crayfish, lobsters, and shrimp. (64) Sole-source surface drinking water supply--A body of surface water that is identified as a public water supply in rules adopted by the commission under Texas Water Code, \u00a726.023 and is the sole source of supply of a public water supply system, exclusive of emer- gency water connections (Texas Water Code, \u00a726.0286). (65) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater--A document describing sampling and analytical proce- dures that is published by the American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association, and Water Environment Federa- tion.

(70) Stream order--A classification of stream size, where the smallest, unbranched tributaries of a drainage basin are designated first order streams. Where two first order streams join, a second order stream is formed; where two second order streams join, a third order stream is formed, etc. For purposes of water quality standards applica- tion, stream order is determined from United States Geological Survey topographic maps with a scale of 1:24,000. (71) Surface water in the state--Lakes, bays, ponds, im- pounding reservoirs, springs, rivers, streams, creeks, estuaries, wet- lands, marshes, inlets, canals, the Gulf of Mexico inside the territorial limits of the state as defined in the Texas Water Code, \u00a726.001, and all other bodies of surface water, natural or artificial, inland or coastal, fresh or salt, navigable or nonnavigable, and including the beds and banks of all water-courses and bodies of surface water, that are wholly or partially inside or bordering the state or subject to the jurisdiction of the state; except that waters in treatment systems that are authorized by state or federal law, regulation, or permit, and that are created for the purpose of waste treatment are not considered to be water in the state. (72) Sustainable Fisheries--Descriptive of water bodies that potentially have sufficient fish production or fishing activity to create significant long-term human consumption of fish. Sustainable fisheries include perennial streams and rivers with a stream order of three or greater; lakes and reservoirs greater than or equal to 150 acre-feet or 50 surface acres; all bays, estuaries, and tidal rivers. Water bodies that are presumed to have sustainable fisheries include all designated segments listed in Appendix A of \u00a7307.10 of this title (relating to Appendices A -G) unless specifically exempted. (73) Thalweg--The deepest portion of a stream or river channel cross-section. (74) Tidal--Descriptive of coastal waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of tides. For purposes of standards applicability, tidal waters are considered to be saltwater. Classified tidal waters include all bays and estuaries with a segment number that begins with 24xx, all streams with the word tidal in the segment name, and the Gulf of Mexico. (75) To discharge--Includes to deposit, conduct, drain, emit, throw, run, allow to seep, or otherwise release or dispose of, or to allow, permit, or suffer any of these acts or omissions. (76) Total dissolved solids--The amount of material (inor- ganic salts and small amounts of organic material) dissolved in water and commonly expressed as a concentration in terms of milligrams per liter. The term is equivalent to the term filterable residue, as used in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 136 and in previous editions of the publication entitled, Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. (77) Total maximum daily load (TMDL)--The total amount of a substance that a water body can assimilate and still meet the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards. (78) Total suspended solids--Total suspended matter in wa- ter, which is commonly expressed as a concentration in terms of mil- ligrams per liter. The term is equivalent to nonfilterable residue, as used in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 136 and in previous editions of the publication entitled, Standard Methods for the Examination of Wa- ter and Wastewater. (79) Total toxicity--Toxicity as determined by exposing aquatic organisms to samples or dilutions of instream water or treated effluent. Also referred to as whole effluent toxicity or biomonitoring. (80) Toxic equivalency factor--A factor to describe an or- der-of-magnitude consensus estimate of the toxicity of a compound relative to the toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetraclorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8- TCDD). The factor is applied to transform various concentrations of dioxins and furans or dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls into equiv- a toxic equiva- lency. (81) Toxic equivalency--The sum of the products from the concentration of each dioxin and furan, or dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl congener, multiplied by its respective toxic equivalency factor to give a single 2,3,7,8-tetraclorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalent. (82) Toxicity--The occurrence of adverse effects to living organisms due to exposure to toxic materials. Adverse effects caused by conditions of temperature and dissolved oxygen are excluded from the definition of toxicity. With respect to the provisions of \u00a7307.6(e) of this title (relating to Toxic Materials), which concerns total toxicity and biomonitoring requirements, adverse effects caused by concentra- tions of dissolved salts (such as sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, carbonate) in source waters are excluded from the definition of toxi- city. Source water is defined as surface water or groundwater that is used as a public water supply or industrial water supply (including a cooling-water supply). Source water does not include brine water that is produced during the extraction of oil and gas, or other sources of brine water that are substantially uncharacteristic of surface waters in the area of discharge. In addition, adverse effects caused by concen- trations of dissolved salts that are added to source water by industrial processes are not excluded from the requirements of \u00a7307.6(e) of this title, except as specifically noted in \u00a7307.6(e)(2)(B) of this title, which concerns requirements for toxicity testing of 100% effluent. This defi- nition of toxicity does not affect the standards for dissolved salts in this chapter other than \u00a7307.6(e) of this title. The standards implementation procedures contain provisions to protect surface waters from adverse effects of dissolved salts and methods to address the effects of dissolved salts on total toxicity tests. (83) Toxicity biomonitoring--The process or act of deter- mining total toxicity. Documents that describe procedures for toxicity biomonitoring are cited in \u00a7307.6 of this title (relating to Toxic Mate- rials). Also referred to simply as biomonitoring. (84) Water-effect ratio (WER)--The WER is calculated as the toxic concentration (LC50) of a substance in water at a particular site, divided by the toxic concentration of that substance as reported in laboratory dilution water. The WER can be used to establish site-spe- cific acute and chronic criteria to protect aquatic life. The site-specific criterion is equal to the WER times the statewide aquatic life criterion in \u00a7307.6(c) of this title. (85) Water quality management program--The agency's overall program for attaining and maintaining water quality consistent with state standards, as authorized under the Texas Water Code, the Texas Administrative Code, and the federal Clean Water Act, \u00a7\u00a7106, 205(j), 208, 303(e) and 314 (33 United States Code, \u00a7\u00a71251 et seq.). ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6611 (86) Wetland--An area (including a swamp, marsh, bog, prairie pothole, or similar area) having a predominance of hydric soils that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and that under normal circumstances supports the growth and regeneration of hydrophytic vegetation. The term \"hydric soil\" means soil that, in its undrained condition, is satu- rated, flooded, or ponded long enough during a growing season to de- velop an anaerobic condition that supports the growth and regeneration of hydrophytic vegetation. The term \"hydrophytic vegetation\" means a plant growing in: water or a substrate that is at least periodically defi- cient in oxygen during a growing season as a result of excessive water content. The term \"wetland\" does not include irrigated acreage used as farmland; a man-made wetland of less than one acre; or a man-made wetland where construction or creation commenced on or after August 28, 1989, and that was not constructed with wetland creation as a stated objective, including but not limited to an impoundment made for the purpose of soil and water conservation that has been approved or re- quested by soil and water conservation districts. If this definition of wetland conflicts with the federal definition in any manner, the federal definition prevails. (87) Wetland water quality functions--Attributes of wet- lands that protect and maintain the quality of water in the state, which include stormwater storage and retention and the moderation of extreme water level fluctuations; shoreline protection against erosion through the dissipation of wave energy and water velocity, and anchor- ing of sediments; habitat for aquatic life; and removal, transformation, and retention of nutrients and toxic substances. (88) Zone of initial dilution--The small area at the immedi- ate point of a permitted discharge where initial dilution with receiving waters occurs and that may not meet certain criteria applicable to the receiving water.

The toxic criteria set forth in this section ap- ply to surface water in the state and specifically apply to substances attributed to waste discharges or human activity. With the exception of numeric human health criteria, toxic criteria do not apply to those instances where surface water, solely as a result of natural phenom- ena, exhibit characteristics beyond the limits established by this sec- tion. Standards and procedures set forth in this section are applied in accordance with \u00a7307.8 of this title (relating to Application of Stan- dards) and \u00a7307.9 of this title (relating to Determination of Standards Attainment). (b) General provisions. (1) Water in the state must not be acutely toxic to aquatic life in accordance with \u00a7307.8 of this title. (2) Water in the state with designated or existing aquatic life uses of limited or greater must not be chronically toxic to aquatic life, in accordance with \u00a7307.8 of this title. (3) Water in the state must be maintained to preclude ad- verse toxic effects on human health resulting from contact recreation, consumption of aquatic organisms, consumption of drinking water or any combination of the three. Water in the state with sustainable fish- eries or public drinking water supply uses must not exceed applicable human health toxic criteria, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section and \u00a7307.8 of this title. (4) Water in the state must be maintained to preclude ad- verse toxic effects on aquatic life, terrestrial life, livestock, or domes- tic animals, resulting from contact, consumption of aquatic organisms, consumption of water, or any combination of the three. (c) Specific numerical aquatic life criteria. (1) Numerical criteria are established in Table 1 of this paragraph for those specific toxic substances where adequate toxicity information is available and that have the potential for exerting adverse impacts on water in the state. Figure: 30 TAC \u00a7307.6(c)(1) (2) Numerical criteria are based on ambient water qual- ity criteria documents published by the EPA. EPA guidance criteria have been appropriately recalculated to eliminate the effects of toxi- city data for aquatic organisms that are not native to Texas, in accor- dance with procedures in the EPA guidance documents entitled Guide- lines for Deriving Numerical Site-specific Water Quality Criteria (EPA 600/3-84-099) and Revised Deletion Process for the Site-Specific Re- calculation Procedure for Aquatic Life Criteria (EPA-823-R-13-001). Additional EPA guidelines that may be used to establish aquatic life criteria are detailed in the guidance documents. (3) Specific numerical acute aquatic life criteria are applied as 24-hour averages, and specific numerical chronic aquatic life criteria are applied as seven-day averages. (4) Ammonia and chlorine toxicity are addressed by total toxicity (biomonitoring) requirements in subsection (e) of this section. (5) Specific numerical aquatic life criteria for metals and metalloids in Table 1 of paragraph (1) of this subsection apply to dis-solved concentrations where noted. Dissolved concentrations can be estimated by filtration of samples prior to analysis, or by converting from total recoverable measurements in accordance with procedures approved by the commission in the standards implementation proce- dures (RG-194) as amended. Specific numerical aquatic life criteria for non-metallic substances in Table 1 of paragraph (1) of this subsec- tion apply to total recoverable concentrations unless otherwise noted. (6) Specific numerical acute criteria for toxic substances are applicable to all water in the state except for small zones of initial dilution (ZIDs) at discharge points. Acute criteria may be exceeded within a ZID and below extremely low streamflow conditions (one- fourth of critical low-flow conditions) in accordance with \u00a7307.8 of this title. There must be no lethality to aquatic organisms that move through a ZID, and the sizes of ZIDs are limited in accordance with \u00a7307.8 of this title. Specific numerical chronic criteria are applicable to all water in the state with designated or existing aquatic life uses of limited or greater, except inside mixing zones and below critical low-flow conditions, in accordance with \u00a7307.8 of this title. (7) For toxic materials where specific numerical criteria are not listed in Table 1 of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the appropriate criteria for aquatic life protection may be derived in accordance with current EPA guidelines for deriving site-specific water quality criteria. When insufficient data are available to use EPA guidelines, the follow- ing provisions are applied in accordance with this section and \u00a7307.8 of this title. The LC callyobtainedfromtraditional50 data used in the subsequent calculations are typi- laboratory studies; however, if LCdata areunavailable50 or incomplete, other methodologies (such as quantita- tive structure-activity relationships) may be used: (A) acute criteria are calculated as 0.3 of the LCof the most sensitive aquatic species; LC50 \u00d7 (0.3) = acutecriteria;50 (B) concentrations of nonpersistent toxic materials must not exceed concentrations that are chronically toxic as deter- mined from appropriate chronic toxicity data obtained in accordance with procedures in the EPA guidance document entitled Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Life and Their Uses (EPA 822-R-85-100) or calculated as 0.1 of acute LC 50 values to the most sensitive aquatic species; LC 50 \u00d7 (0.1) = chronic criteria; (C) concentrations of persistent toxic materials that do not bioaccumulate shall not exceed concentrations that are chronically toxic as determined from appropriate chronic toxicity data obtained in accordance with procedures in the EPA guidance document entitled Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Life and Their Uses (EPA 822-R-85-100) or calculated as 0.05 of LCvalues to the most sensitive aquatic species; LC\u00d750 50 (0.05) = chronic criteria; and (D) concentrations of toxic materials that bioaccumu- late must not exceed concentrations that are chronically toxic as deter- mined from appropriate chronic toxicity data obtained in accordance with procedures in the EPA guidance document entitled Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Life and Their Uses (EPA 822-R-85-100) or calculated as 0.01 of LC 50 values to the most sensitive aquatic species; LC 50 \u00d7 (0.01) = chronic criteria. (8) For toxic substances where the relationship of toxicity is defined as a function of pH or hardness, numerical criteria are pre- sented as an equation based on this relationship. Site-specific values for each segment are given in the standards implementation procedures (RG-194) as amended. ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6613 (9) Criteria for most metals are multiplied by a water-effect ratio (WER) in order to incorporate the effects of local water chem- istry on toxicity. The WER is assumed to be equal to one except where sufficient site-specific data are available to determine the WER for a particular water body or portion of a water body. A WER is only appli- cable to those portions of a water body that are adequately addressed by site-specific data. WERs that have been determined for particular water bodies are listed in Appendix E of \u00a7307.10 of this title (relating to Appendices A -G) when standards are revised. A site-specific WER that affects an effluent limitation in a wastewater discharge permit, and that has not been incorporated into Appendix E of \u00a7307.10 of this title, must be noted in a public notice during the permit application process. An opportunity for public comment must be provided, and the WER may be considered in any public hearing on the permit application. (10) Freshwater copper aquatic-life criteria include a mul- tiplier (m) to incorporate effects of local water chemistry on toxicity. Site-specific criteria may be based on either a WER or a biotic ligand model. The WER multiplier is assumed to be equal to one except where sufficient site-specific data are available to determine the multiplier for a particular water body or portion of a water body. The WER multi- plier or biotic ligand model result is only applicable to those portions of a water body that are adequately addressed by site-specific data. The biotic ligand model is based on the dissolved portion of copper, and the freshwater equation is not used in this case. As WER multipliers and criteria based on biotic ligand models are determined for particu- lar water bodies, they are listed in Appendix E of \u00a7307.10 of this title when standards are revised. A site-specific WER multiplier or biotic ligand model result that affects an effluent limitation in a wastewater discharge permit, and that has not been incorporated into Appendix E of \u00a7307.10 of this title, is noted in a public notice during the permit application process. An opportunity for public comment must be pro- vided, and the WER multiplier or biotic ligand model result may be considered in any public hearing on the permit application. (11) Additional site-specific factors may indicate that the numerical criteria listed in Table 1 of paragraph (1) of this subsection are inappropriate for a particular water body. These factors are applied as a site-specific standards modification in accordance with \u00a7307.2(d) of this title (relating to Description of Standards). The application of a site-specific standard must not impair an existing, attainable, or desig- nated use. Factors that may justify a temporary variance or site-specific standards amendment include the following: (A) background concentrations of specific toxics of concern in receiving waters, sediment, or indigenous biota; (B) persistence and degradation rate of specific toxic materials; (C) synergistic, additive, or antagonistic interactions of toxic substances with other toxic or nontoxic materials; (D) measurements of total effluent toxicity; (E) indigenous aquatic organisms, which may have dif- ferent responses to particular toxic materials; (F) technological or economic limits of treatability for specific toxic materials; (G) bioavailability of specific toxic substances of con- cern, as determined by WER tests or other analyses approved by the commission; and (H) new information concerning the toxicity of a par- ticular substance. (d) Specific numerical human health criteria. (1) Numerical human health criteria are established in Ta- ble 2 of this paragraph. Figure: 30 TAC \u00a7307.6(d)(1) (2) Categories of human health criteria. (A) Concentration criteria to prevent contamination of drinking water, fish, and other aquatic life to ensure that they are safe for human consumption. These criteria apply to surface waters that are designated or used for public drinking water supplies, including all water bodies identified as having a public drinking water supply use in Appendix A of \u00a7307.10 of this title or as a sole-source surface drinking water supply in Appendix B of \u00a7307.10 of this title. (Column A in Table 2 of paragraph (1) of this subsection.) (B) Concentration criteria to prevent contamination of fish and other aquatic life to ensure that they are safe for human con- sumption. These criteria apply to surface waters that have sustainable fisheries and that are not designated or used for public water supply or as a sole-source surface drinking water supply. (Column B in Table 2 of paragraph (1) of this subsection.) (3) Specific assumptions and procedures (except where noted in Table 2 of paragraph (1) of this subsection). (A) Sources for the toxicity factors to calculate criteria were derived from EPA's IRIS database; EPA's National Recommended Water Quality Criteria: 2002, Human Health Criteria Calculation Ma- trix (EPA-822-R-02-012); EPA inputs for calculating the 2015 updated national recommended human health criteria; EPA Health Effects As- sessment Summary Tables (HEAST); Assessment for the Eval- uation of Risk (ASTER); EPA's QSAR Toxicity Estimation Software Tool, version 4.1; and the computer program, CLOGP3. (B) For known or suspected carcinogens (as identified in EPA's IRIS database), an incremental cancer risk level of 10-5 (1 in 100,000) was used to derive criteria. An RfD (reference dose) was determined for carcinogens and noncarcinogens where the EPA has not derived cancer slope factors. (C) Consumption rates of fish and shellfish were esti- mated as 17.5 grams per person per day, unless otherwise specified in Table 2 of paragraph (1) of this subsection. (D) Drinking water consumption rates were estimated as 2.0 liters per person per day. (E) For carcinogens, a body-weight scaling factor of 3/4 power was used to convert data on laboratory test animals to human scale. Reported weights of laboratory test animals are used, and an average weight of 70 kilograms is assumed for humans. (F) Childhood exposure was considered for all noncar- cinogens. Consumption rates for fish and shellfish were estimated as 5.6 grams per child per day and drinking water consumption rates were estimated as 0.64 liters per child per day. A child body weight was es- timated at 15 kilograms. Both the water consumption rate and body weight are age-adjusted for a six-year-old child. The consumption rate for fish and shellfish for children is from Table 10-61 of EPA's 1997 Exposure Factors Handbook (EPA/600/P-95/002Fa-c). (G) Numerical human health criteria were derived in accordance with the general procedures and calculations in the EPA guidance documents entitled Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control (EPA/505/2-90-001); Guidance Manual for Assessing Human Health Risks from Chemically Contaminated Fish and Shellfish (EPA/503/8-89-002); and Methodology for Deriving Am- bient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health (2000) (EPA-822-B-00-004). 47 TexReg 6614 October 7, 2022 Texas Register (H) If a calculated criterion to prevent contamination of drinking water and fish to ensure they are safe for human consumption (Column A in Table 2 of paragraph (1) of this subsection) was greater than the applicable maximum contaminant level (MCL) in Chapter 290 of this title (relating to Public Drinking Water), then the MCL was used as the criterion. (I) If the concentration of a substance in fish tissue used for these calculations was greater than the applicable United States Food and Drug Administration Action Level for edible fish and shell- fish tissue, then the acceptable concentration in fish tissue was lowered to the Action Level for calculation of criteria. (4) Human health criteria for additional toxic materials are adopted by the commission as appropriate. (5) Specific human health concentration criteria for water are applicable to water in the state that has sustainable fisheries or des- ignation or use as a public drinking water supply or as a sole-source drinking water supply except within mixing zones and below stream flow conditions as specified in \u00a7307.8 of this title. The following wa- ters are considered to have sustainable fisheries: (A) all designated segments listed in Appendix A of \u00a7307.10 of this title, unless specifically exempted; (B) perennial streams and rivers with a stream order of three or greater, as defined in \u00a7307.3 of this title (relating to Definitions and Abbreviations); (C) lakes and reservoirs greater than or equal to 150 acre-feet or 50 surface acres; (D) all bays, estuaries, and tidal rivers; and (E) any other waters that potentially have sufficient fish production or fishing activity to create significant long-term human consumption of fish. (6) Waters that are not considered to have a sustainable fishery, but that have an aquatic life use of limited or greater, are con- sidered to have an incidental fishery. Consumption rates assumed for incidental fishery waters are 1.75 grams per person per day. Therefore, numerical criteria applicable to incidental fishery waters are ten times the criteria listed in Column B in Table 2 of paragraph (1) of this sub- section. (7) Specific human health criteria are applied as long term average exposure criteria designed to protect populations over a life time. Attainment measures for human health are addressed in \u00a7307.9 of this title. (8) For toxic materials of concern where specific human health criteria are not listed in Table 2 of paragraph (1) of this subsec- tion, the following provisions apply: (A) For known or suspected carcinogens (as identified in EPA's IRIS database), a cancer risk of 10-5 (1 in 100,000) is applied to the most recent numerical criteria adopted by the EPA and published in the Federal Register. If an MCL or equivalent agency guideline for protection of drinking water sources is less than the resulting criterion, then the MCL applies to public drinking water supplies in accordance with paragraph (3)(H) of this subsection. (B) For toxic materials not defined as carcinogens, the most recent numerical criteria adopted by the EPA and published in the Federal Register are applicable. If an MCL or equivalent agency guide- line for protection of drinking water sources is less than the resulting criterion, then the MCL applies to public drinking water supplies in ac- cordance with paragraph (3)(H) of this subsection. (C) In the absence of available criteria, numerical crite- ria may be derived from technically valid information and calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subsection. (9) Numerical criteria for bioconcentratable pollutants are derived in accordance with the general procedures in the EPA guid- ance document entitled Assessment and Control of Bioconcentratable Contaminants in Surface Water (March 1991). The commission may develop discharge permit limits in accordance with the provisions of this section. (10) Numerical human health criteria are expressed as to- tal recoverable concentrations for nonmetals and selenium and as dis- solved concentrations for other metals and metalloids. (11) Additional site-specific factors may indicate that the numerical human health criteria listed in Table 2 of paragraph (1) of this subsection are inappropriate for a particular water body. These factors are applied as a site-specific standards modification in accordance with \u00a7307.2(d) of this title. The application of site-specific criteria must not impair an existing, attainable, presumed, or designated use or affect human health. Factors that may justify a temporary variance or site- specific standards amendment include the following: (A) background concentrations of specific toxics of concern in receiving waters, sediment, or indigenous biota; (B) persistence and degradation rate of specific toxic materials; (C) synergistic or antagonistic interactions of toxic sub- stances with other toxic or nontoxic materials; (D) technological or economic limits of treatability for specific toxic materials; (E) bioavailability of specific toxic substances of con- cern; (F) local water chemistry and other site-specific condi- tions that may alter the bioconcentration, bioaccumulation, or toxicity of specific toxic substances; (G) site-specific differences in the bioaccumulation re- sponses of indigenous, edible aquatic organisms to specific toxic ma- terials; (H) local differences in consumption patterns of fish and shellfish or drinking water, but only if any changes in assumed consumption rates are protective of the local population that frequently consumes fish, shellfish, or drinking water from a particular water body; and (I) new information concerning the toxicity of a partic- ular substance. (e) Total toxicity. (1) Total (whole-effluent) toxicity of permitted discharges, as determined from biomonitoring of effluent samples at appropriate dilutions, must be sufficiently controlled to preclude acute total toxi- city in all water in the state with the exception of small ZIDs at dis- charge points and at extremely low streamflow conditions (one-fourth of critical low-flow conditions) in accordance with \u00a7307.8 of this title. Acute total toxicity levels may be exceeded in a ZID, but there must be no significant lethality to aquatic organisms that move through a ZID, and the sizes of ZIDs are limited in accordance with \u00a7307.8 of this title. Chronic total toxicity, as determined from biomonitoring of ef- fluent samples at appropriate dilutions, must be sufficiently controlled to preclude chronic toxicity in all water in the state with an existing or designated aquatic life use of limited or greater except in mixing zones ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6615 at discharge points and at flows less than critical low-flows, in accor- dance with \u00a7307.8 of this title. Chronic toxicity levels may be exceeded in a mixing zone, but there must be no significant sublethal toxicity to aquatic organisms that move through the mixing zone. (2) General provisions for controlling total toxicity. (A) Dischargers whose effluent has a significant po- tential for exerting toxicity in receiving waters as described in the Procedures to Implement the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards (RG-194) as amended are required to conduct whole effluent toxicity biomonitoring at appropriate dilutions. (B) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the effluent of discharges to water in the state must not be acutely toxic to sensitive species of aquatic life, as demonstrated by effluent toxicity tests. Toxicity testing for this purpose is conducted on samples of 100% effluent, and the criterion for acute toxicity is mortality of 50% or more of the test organisms after 24 hours of exposure. This provision does not apply to mortality that is a result of an excess, deficiency, or imbal- ance of dissolved inorganic salts (such as sodium, calcium, potassium, chloride, or carbonate) that are in the effluent and are not listed in Table 1 of subsection (c)(1) of this section or that are in source waters. (C) The latest revisions of the following EPA publi- cations provide methods for appropriate biomonitoring procedures: Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms, Short-term Methods for Estimating the Chronic Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater Organisms, Short-term Methods for Estimating the Chronic Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Marine and Estuarine Organisms, and the Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control. The use of other procedures approved by the agency and the EPA is also acceptable. Toxicity tests must be conducted using representative, sensitive aquatic organisms as ap- proved by the agency, and any such testing must adequately determine if toxicity standards are being attained. (D) If toxicity biomonitoring results indicate that a dis- charge is not sufficiently controlled to preclude acute or chronic toxicity as described in this subsection, then the permittee will be required to eliminate sources of toxicity and may be required to conduct a toxicity reduction evaluation (TRE) in accordance with the permitting proce- dures of the commission. In accordance with the standards implemen- tation procedures (RG-194), permits are amended to include appropri- ate provisions to eliminate toxicity. Such provisions may include total toxicity limits, chemical-specific limits, best management practices, or other actions (such as moving a discharge location) designed to reduce or eliminate toxicity. Where sufficient to attain and maintain applicable numeric and narrative state water quality standards, a chemical-specific limit, best management practices, or other actions designed to reduce or eliminate toxicity rather than a total toxicity limit may be established in the permit. Where conditions may be necessary to prevent or re- duce effluent toxicity, permits must include a reasonable schedule for achieving compliance with such additional conditions. (E) Discharge permit limits based on total toxicity may be established in consideration of site-specific factors, but the applica- tion of such factors must not result in impairment of an existing, at- tainable, presumed, or designated use. These factors are applied as a site-specific standards modification in accordance with \u00a7307.2(d) of this title. A demonstration that uses are protected may consist of ad- ditional effluent toxicity testing, instream monitoring requirements, or other necessary information as determined by the agency. Factors that may justify a temporary variance or site-specific standards amendment include the following: (i) background toxicity of receiving waters; (ii) persistence and degradation rate of principal toxic materials that are contributing to the total toxicity of the dis- charge; (iii) site-specific variables that may alter the impact of toxicity in the discharge; (iv) indigenous aquatic organisms that may have dif- ferent levels of sensitivity than the species used for total toxicity test- ing; and (v) technological, economic, or legal limits of treata- bility or control for specific toxic material. \u00a7307.10.

RIGHT OF WAY The Texas Department of Transportation (department) adopts amendments to \u00a7\u00a721.31, 21.37, 21.38, 21.40, and 21.41 con- cerning Utility Accommodation, and the repeal of \u00a7\u00a721.921 - 21.930, concerning utility relocation prepayment funding agree- amendments to \u00a7\u00a721.31, 21.37, 21.38, 21.40, and 21.41 are adopted with changes to the proposed text as pub- lished in the April 15, 2022, issue of the Texas Register (47 TexReg 1976) and will be republished. The repeals will not be republished. EXPLANATION OF ADOPTED AMENDMENTS AND REPEAL A review of the department's rules regarding utility accommo- dations within state right-of-way was undertaken by the depart- ment. The review indicated a need to amend the rules to ad- dress advances in technology and current construction practice that have evolved since the rules were last amended. During the review, Senate Bill 507, Acts of the 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021, was passed requiring the Texas Transportation Commission (commission) to adopt rules to provide for broad- band providers use of state highway rights-of-way. The review and passage of Senate Bill 507 resulted in this rulemaking re- vising Chapter 21, Subchapter C, Utility Accommodations. The proposed revisions are in the interests of safety, protection, use, and future development of the state highway system with due consideration given to the public service afforded by adequate and economical utility facilities. The review also revealed the need to repeal Chapter 21, Sub- chapter P, Utility Relocation Prepayment Funding Agreements, which addresses a utility relocation prepayment funding program under Transportation Code, \u00a7203.0922, which expired Septem- ber 1, 2013. Amendments make various changes throughout Chapter 21, Subchapter C, to correct minor wording errors and to provide consistency within the subchapter in the use of \"shall,\" \"may,\" and \"must\" by aligning the use of those words with the statutory construction rules set out in Government Code, \u00a7311.016. Amendments to \u00a721.31, Definitions, adds definitions for ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers), broadband service, com- munication line, and encasement for clarification in the accom- modation rules. The rules also amend the definitions of \"public utility\" and \"utility product\" to incorporate broadband service and repeal the definitions of \"idled facility\" and \"ramp terminus\" be- cause those terms are not used in the subchapter. Amendments to \u00a721.37, Design, address the requirements of a utility in the design phase of any installation of a utility facility within state right of way. The amendments list additional fed- eral and state regulations and policies that were previously re- quired but not specified in the rule. The amendments also incor- porate certain design criteria for utility installations in and around common highway facility features for clarification and safety en- hancement purposes. ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6617 Amendments to \u00a721.38, Construction and Maintenance, ad- dress department requirements for the installation, operation, and maintenance of utility facilities within state right of way. These amendments bring the rules into conformance with the department's current operational requirements for utilities to ensure the accommodation process is safe and efficient. The amendments change the section heading to include inspection in the heading. Amendments to \u00a721.40, Underground Utilities, address de- partment requirements for underground utilities. Specifically, the amendments call out the requirements for encasing under- ground utility lines to protect the utility and highway facility. The amendments also provide the minimum depths and installation methods that the department requires for various utility facility types. The installation methods additionally address the use of joint duct banks for underground communication lines. These changes are made to align the rules with current department operations. Amendments to \u00a721.41, Overhead Electric and Communication Lines, address department requirements for overhead electric and communication lines. Specifically, the amendments specify the requirements for utility pole sizes and vertical clearances and the requirement that only one set of pole lines for all utilities will be allowed to be installed on each side of a particular segment of state right of way unless the department deems the requirement impractical. Chapter 21, Subchapter P, Utility Relocation Prepayment Fund- ing Agreements (\u00a7\u00a721.921-21.930), is repealed. That subchap- ter implemented a utility relocation prepayment funding program under Transportation Code, \u00a7203.0922. Section 203.0922 ex- pired in 2013 and is no longer available for use. COMMENTS The department posted the rules for comment in the April 15, 2022, issue of the Texas Register. The department received comments through June 10, 2022. Upon the request of two as- sociations, the department conducted a public hearing on the proposed rules on June 10, 2022. In total the department re- ceived written comments from 23 different entities and individ- uals. Six entities provided oral comments at the public hearing that reflected the previously submitted written comments. The department received comments from the following associations: Texas Cable Association, Texas Electric Cooperatives, Texas Rural Water Association, and the Texas Telephone Association. Texas Electric Cooperatives provided oral comments at the pub- lic hearing against the adoption of the rules as proposed. The department received seven comments concerning defini- tions in \u00a721.31. One comment requested the addition of a defi- nition for \"One Call Notification & Utility Location Requirements.\" The department does not believe that there is a need to add this definition at this point. One comment requested revisions to the definitions of both \"high pressure pipeline\" and \"low pressure pipeline.\" The department has not proposed a revision to either of these definitions but re- viewed this request and has decided to retain the current defini- tions. One comment requested revisions to the definition of \"conduit.\" The department has not proposed a revision to the definition of conduit and does not believe a revision is warranted at this time. Two comments requested a revision to the department's pro- posed definition of \"encasement.\" The department's proposed definition of encasement focuses on the utility of the structure and does not limit the material to be used for such a structure. Paired with the definition for \"design vehicle load (HS-20),\" the definition provides sufficient guidance for the composition of the structure. The department has not made any revisions to the proposed definition of \"encasement.\" One comment requested the repeal of the definitions of \"distribu- tion line\" and \"transmission line\" from the rules. The department chose not to remove those definitions at this time because it be- lieved they add perspective to section 21.41, Overhead Electric and Communication Lines. One comment requested the revision to the definition of \"util- ity facility\" to specifically include pipe embedment and blocking. The department did not revise the definition of \"utility facility\" as it believes the current definition is sufficiently broad to include the requested appurtenances. One comment requested a revision to the proposed definition of \"broadband service.\" The department's proposed definition of broadband service mirrors the definition provided in Senate Bill 507, Acts of the 87th Legislature, Regular Session, 2021. The department received 32 comments concerning \u00a721.37. Three comments raised concerns that the department's pro- posed \u00a721.37(b)(1), which allows a department district to have special provisions for utility facility installations based on needs in its area, would create piecemeal standards for the location of utilities across the state. The department declined to make changes regarding those concerns. The department's right of way across the state is located within very diverse developments from the most rural of areas to the densest of urban areas. This diversity requires each district to have flexibility to address the particular needs of the district. However, the department's overall location of utilities within its right of way will remains uniform across the state as outlined in the utility accommodation rules. Ten comments raised concerns with the department's proposed \u00a721.37(b)(9), which clarifies that for a utility facility that extends across a railroad's right of way, the utility must provide the depart- ment with a copy of a permit executed by the railroad authorizing the installation within the railroad right of way prior to installation within the department's right of way. The primary concern was that this requirement could significantly delay the utility installa- tion project. The department's proposed revision is a codification of the department's current practice to ensure the proper prop- erty rights are obtained by the utility from any necessary third parties prior to installing a facility within the department's right of way to avoid any needs for realignment if those rights were not secured. This proposed revision only clarifies that installa- tion of the utility facility may not occur prior to the production of such a permit. The department's review and comment on a util- ity's installation package will continue during the time the utility is securing this permit and should not unduly delay a utility installa- tion. The department has revised the proposed rules to indicate that the department may also partition a utility installation into multiple permits to assist in avoiding any delays that may arise relating to the utility's procurement of an agreement with the rail- road. Finally, a revision was made to address comments that the railroad enters into agreements for utility crossings as opposed to permits. Eleven comments raised concerns with the department's pro- posed \u00a721.37(c)(4), which requires the utility's installation plans to be based on survey data provided by a Texas registered 47 TexReg 6618 October 7, 2022 Texas Register professional land surveyor. The department has an obligation to protect the public's investment in the state highway system and an essential element in this obligation is ensuring all trans- portation elements and utilities are installed in their designated locations. Improperly located utilities can and have led to costly delays in the department's delivery of transportation facilities and damage to utility facilities during department construction projects. Considering the comments, however, a revision was made to allow the utility to continue to utilize department survey data in the development of their installation plans. Nine comments were received regarding the department's pro- posed \u00a721.37(c)(5), which requires the utility to verify the de- partment's right of way line on the ground and procure any ad- ditional surveys required by the department before installing the utility facility. The department has received various complaints across the state about instances where a utility intending to in- stall within department right of way has encroached into adjacent property. This proposed requirement mitigates the risk that the utility mis-identifies the limits of the department's right of way. The department's right of way maps are available for review by the utility and the need for additional surveys is likely to be needed only on rare occasions. No revisions to the proposed requirement are made. The department received five comments regarding the depart- ment's proposed revision to \u00a721.37(c)(6), which will require the utility to provide as-built plans that comply with the American So- ciety of Civil Engineers guidelines and standards for utility fa- cilities installed within department right of way. Utility facilities that differ from the plans provided to the department have led to costly delays in the department's delivery of transportation facil- ities and damage to utility facilities during department construc- tion projects. This requirement ensures that the department has a uniform standard for as-built plans and accurate information regarding the utility facilities located within its right of way. No revisions to the proposed requirement are made. One comment was received on \u00a721.37(d)(1) requesting the clari- fication that the restriction on fuel tanks may not be located within 100 feet of a highway structure within the department's right of way. The department's utility accommodation rules only apply to installations within the department's right of way as set forth in \u00a721.32 and $21.33. No revisions are made to \u00a721.37(d)(1). Three comments were received regarding \u00a721.37(e)(2)(G), which addresses certain requirements around the attachment of utility facilities to department bridges. Two comments believed clarification was needed to ensure that the requirements of the section were not limited to water and wastewater facilities. While this subsection does have additional requirements for water and wastewater facilities, the subsection is not limited to these types of utility facilities. The third comment requested clarification that the as-built plans are signed by a professional engineer registered in the state of Texas. Engineer is defined within this subchapter to mean \"a person licensed to practice engineering in the state of Texas.\" No revisions are made to this subsection. One comment was received on \u00a721.38(a) requesting the addition of language expressly requiring that the installation of facilities within the department's right of way conform to the excavation safety requirements contained in Chapter 251 of the Texas Util- ities Code and Title 16, Chapter 18 of the Texas Administrative Code. Because these statutory provisions currently apply to util- ity facility installations within the department's right of way and are standard industry practice, the department did not make any revisions to \u00a721.38(a). One comment was received requesting language be included in \u00a721.38(a)(2) that specified that the provision only applies to utility facilities located within department right of way. No clarification is needed within \u00a721.38 (a)(2) because \u00a721.32 provides that the subchapter that contains \u00a721.38 applies to \"utility facilities within the right of way of the state highway system.\" One comment was received on \u00a721.38 (b)(3) and the proposed 12-month requirement to reseed, resod or repair areas of the department's right of way where settlement or erosion has oc- curred. The comment raised the concern that the 12-month pe- riod was not sufficient time. The department believes that 12 months is a reasonable amount of time to repair erosion or set- tlement caused by a utility and is maintaining the proposed clari- fication of the reasonable time period. However, the department has revised the proposed rule to allow the district to provide ad- ditional time if the installation conditions warrant an extension. Two comments were received on \u00a721.38 (b)(7), which states that a utility is responsible for any damages it causes to property ad- jacent to the department's right of way. The department regularly receives complaints from adjacent landowners about damages incurred on their property by the installation of utility facilities. The department declines to change this provision; it puts the utility on notice that the utility, not the department, is responsible for addressing a damage claim by an adjacent landowner. The provision does not waive any defenses that a utility may have regarding such a claim. Four comments were received regarding the signage require- ment proposed in \u00a721.38 (c)(2). Two comments questioned the department's need for this requirement. This requirement, which is also required of department construction contractors, is a di- rect result of the department's commitment to work-zone safety based on studies showing that signage reduces accidents. The signage also provides the public notice of who is conducting work within the department's right of way. One comment requested the details of the information required on the signage. A fig- ure of the signage was provided in the proposed rules in Figure \u00a721.38(c)(2) that included the required information. One com- ment requested additional information on the details of the phys- ical signage to create uniform signage requirements across the state. All signage within department right of way must conform to the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The department made one revision to this rule making the utility's contractor contact information optional so long as utility's con- tact information is provided. The department received six comments regarding the proposed updates to the requirements for encasement of underground util- ities in \u00a721.40(a)(1). The department has reviewed the com- ments and believes the encasement requirements adequately address the most common types of underground utility installa- tions in a manner that best protects the roadway and utility facil- ities. The department districts always have the ability to create an exception to address unique situations that may need to be addressed. A revision was made to accommodate the various connection methods used to connect high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes. Four comments were received regarding the depth require- ments for underground utilities in \u00a721.40(a)(2). One comment stated that the figure in the section contained incorrect data. The department reviewed the data and confirmed the require- ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6619 ments were consistent with the department's intention. The remaining comments were focused on the district's ability to require additional depth requirements when certain scenarios arise. This flexibility for the district to require additional depth allows the district to appropriately manage the right of way and protect the highway infrastructure through various locations and development conditions. No revisions are made to \u00a721.40(a)(2). Five comments were received on \u00a721.40(a)(4)(A) regarding the requirement that all utilities must obtain a department permit prior to installing or maintaining utility facilities within department right of way. The comments raised the concern that in emergency sit- uations, the utility would be delayed in addressing its facilities. This provision addresses new installation of facilities. Section 21.38(a)(4) provides to previously permitted utilities the ability to address emergency maintenance work, which is also reiterated in the installation permit issued by the department. The depart- ment is also creating an emergency notification system to help streamline and confirm emergency work done within the depart- ment's right of way. A revision was made to \u00a721.40(a)(4)(A) to clarify that the permit requirement only applies to new utility fa- cility installations. Three comments were received on \u00a721.40(a)(4)(B) regarding the district's ability to require a utility to relocate its facilities if the actual installation does not match the permitted location. The de- partment declines to make changes to this provision. The district is responsible for ensuring the safety of the roadway infrastruc- ture and maximizing the use of the department's right of way. This responsibility dictates that the district has sole discretion over the location of utilities within its right of way. Improperly lo- cated utility facilities lead to additional costs and delays to the department and the utility. The department received five comments regarding \u00a721.40(a)(4)(C), which requires that all longitudinal under- ground utility installations utilize boring to cross driveways and intersecting roadways. The comments argued that this requirement would increase installation costs. This requirement reduces the impact to the driveways and intersecting roadways and the department has found that boring costs are competitive with open trench installations when including the required repair work to the intersecting improvements. Additionally, the proposed section also allows for open trench installation upon written approval by the district engineer. No revisions are made to \u00a721.40(a)(4)(C). Two comments were received on \u00a721.40(a)(4)(D) regarding the requirements addressing the protection of vegetation and land- scaping within the right of way during underground utility facility installation. This section standardizes the department's proce- dures on protection of vegetation and landscaping within the right of way across the state. Revisions are made to \u00a721.40(a)(4)(D) to clarify that the district may make exceptions to the boring re- quirements. One comment was received regarding the bore size require- ments in \u00a721.40(a)(4)(F). This requirement is in accordance with industry standards. The reduction in bore sizes helps the long- term pavement preservation and reduces the maintenance costs to the department. No revisions are made to \u00a721.40(a)(4)(F). One comment was received regarding the requirement for extending the boring beyond the curb and sidewalk in \u00a721.40(a)(4)(G). The comment raised concern that there may not be sufficient area beyond the sidewalk to accommodate the utility facilities. A revision was made to \u00a721.40(a)(4)(G) to allow the district to allow for open-trench installations when there was inadequate space to allow for boring. The department received one comment on \u00a721.40(a)(4)(K) re- garding the requirement to install utility facilities in uniform align- ment with and as near as possible to the edge of the depart- ment's right of way with consideration given to allow safe clear- ances from adjacent installations. The commentor wanted a specific reference to \u00a721.40(a)(7). Because both subsections are within \u00a721.40(a), the department thinks that a specific refer- ence is not needed and declines to include the reference. The department received one comment on \u00a721.40(a)(4)(L) regarding the additional 12 inches of depth for underground utility facilities within 50 feet of waterways, ditches, channels, creeks, or culverts. These features introduce additional risks to utility facilities and this additional depth avoids conflicts with these features and protects the utility. No revisions are made to \u00a721.40(a)(4)(L). Two comments were received on \u00a721.40(a)(4)(M) regarding the district's ability to require utility facilities to be installed below cur- rent facilities and require encasements to allow for the repair or replacement of facilities without disturbing adjacent facilities. One comment raised concerns about the safety of allowing ver- tical stacking of utility facilities. The vertical stacking of utility facilities is at the discretion of the district and would only be con- sidered when appropriate. One comment raised concerns about the additional costs of required encasements. The ability for the district to require encasement for certain installations allows the district to adequately protect the roadway and utility infrastruc- ture within the department's right of way as development occurs. No revisions are made to \u00a721.40(a)(4)(M). Two comments were received on \u00a721.40(a)(7). One comment requested the department to define \"disturbing\" to determine when the minimum clearances are increased to 24 inches. The proposed revisions do not substantively change this re- quirement, which has been in place for over 10 years without issue. The department does not believe a revision or further definition of \"disturbing\" is warranted. One comment requested clarification that \u00a721.40(a)(7) applied to broadband service providers. This section applies to all underground utilities in- stalled within the department's right of way, which would include communication lines installed by broadband service providers. A revision was made to \u00a721.40(a)(7) to provide the district with the flexibility to require the 24-inch clearance only when it determines there is a disturbance of installed facilities and the additional clearance is necessary. Four comments were received on \u00a721.40(b)(1) relating to spe- cific requirements for low-pressure pipelines. Two comments re- late to the encasement requirement in \u00a721.40(b)(1)(C). The com- ments request the elimination of the encasement requirement for low-pressure pipelines crossing the pavement or in the al- ternative to allow for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) encase- ments. The department declines to change the provision. En- casements protect the utility facilities from damage and allow for repairs to the pipeline without cutting the pavement. The rules provide that the district may waive the encasement requirement if the pipeline meets certain material criteria and the utility agrees that the pavement will not be cut for pipeline repairs. Further, the revisions clarify that the encasement may be HDPE or the equiv- alent. Two comments relate to above-ground appurtenances discussed in \u00a721.40(b)(1)(E). A revision was made to 47 TexReg 6620 October 7, 2022 Texas Register \u00a721.40(b)(1)(E) in response to the comments to allow pipeline markers and gas rectifiers to be installed above ground. One comment was received regarding the above-ground appur- tenances for high-pressure pipelines in \u00a721.40(b)(2) requesting to specifically provide for sign markers as an exception to the above-ground appurtenance prohibition. A revision was made to \u00a721.40(b)(2)(F) to allow pipeline markers and gas rectifiers to be installed above ground. One comment was received concerning the deletion of current \u00a721.40(f)(1)(F). It raised concerns about the elimination of the ability to abandon facilities in place. The district may allow for the abandonment in place of the utility facility pursuant to \u00a721.39(d)(2), which is not amended by this rulemaking. Six comments were received regarding the requirement to install a joint duct bank for use by other utilities when installing under- ground communication lines in \u00a721.40(g)(1). Based on the com- ments received the rule has been revised to only require a utility to use a department owned joint duct bank when it is available, unless otherwise authorized by the district. The department received two comments regarding the depth of cover requirement for longitudinal placement of underground communication lines in \u00a721.40(g)(3). The requirement of 48 inches of depth on longitudinal installations of communication lines allows for a standardized depth for all types of communi- cation lines and reduces the risk of future conflicts with roadway infrastructure. To address the comments, however, the depart- ment revised \u00a721.40(g)(3) to provide the district with the flexibility to allow the installation of underground communication lines at 42 inches if site conditions warrant. Two comments were received on \u00a721.40(g)(4) questioning the need for encasement of communication lines at all crossings and how the department would confirm the required size dimension ratios. The primary driver of the encasement requirement was to protect roadway pavement structures. Encasements prevent voids and reduce the need to cut the pavement for repair of the utility facility. The size dimension ratios are declared on the prod- uct and can be easily confirmed by the department. No revisions are made to \u00a721.40(g)(4). One comment was received on \u00a721.40(g)(6) inquiring as to the need for the department to issue an additional permit for the in- stallation of a communication line within a currently installed joint duct. To properly manage the department's right of way, the de- partment must have a complete inventory of all utilities located within the right of way. This requirement ensures that the de- partment is fully informed of the utilities and activities occurring within the right of way. No revisions are made to \u00a721.40(g)(6) Two comments were received on \u00a721.40(g)(7)(B) and the re- quirements for hand holes. One comment raised concerns the prohibition of hand holes on sidewalks would reduce accessibil- ity to communication facilities and negatively impact deployment timeframes for communication utilities. Sidewalks are a vital component of the department's transportation infrastructure and reducing the impacts to this component is important to the de- partment. Another comment requested to further limit the width of the hand holes to three feet unless larger widths could be ac- commodated. The current language provides that hand holes may only be installed when there is sufficient width available be- tween the curbs, sidewalks, and the right of way line, which ad- dresses this concern. No revisions are made to \u00a721.40(g)(7)(B). Three comments were received on \u00a721.40(g)(8) raising con- cerns that eliminating the utility's ability to abandon communi- cation lines in place would be costly and time consuming. One commentor requested clarification if the requirement would ap- ply to all department right of way. Another commentor requested clarification that this requirement only applies to communication utilities. The number of facilities being abandoned in place presents a growing challenge to the department's ability to ef- fectively maximize the use of the department's right of way and causes delays in department construction projects. Due to its location within the rules, the proposed restriction in \u00a721.40(g)(8) is limited to underground communication lines but applies to all department right of way. A revision was made to \u00a721.40(g)(8) to provide the district with the flexibility to allow for communication lines to be abandoned in place. Two comments were received on the vertical clearance re- quirements for overhead electric lines and communication lines in \u00a721.41(b). The comments argued that the proposed requirements conflict with the requirements of the National Electric Safety Code (NESC). The department determined that the requirements either match or exceed the requirements of the NESC but are not in conflict with those requirements. This provision also expressly provides that vertical clearance may be greater if required by the NESC. The department's decision to exceed the NESC vertical clearance requirements in some manner was to reduce the risk of conflicts with commercial vehicles utilizing the state highway system. However, the department revised \u00a721.41(b) to go back to the 18-foot vertical clearance for communication and cable television lines that is in the existing rules. The department received five comments on the department's limitation of 42 inches on the base diameter of overhead elec- tric and communication lines crossings at intersections, bridges, or large drainage spans contained in \u00a721.41(d)(1). The com- mentors believe that the limitation of 42 inches is too restrictive for those structures. The department is tasked with maximizing the use of the right of way. The department increased the cur- rent base limitation from 36 inches to a 42-inch base limitation based on that size being a typical engineered pole size for utility crossings. No revisions are made to \u00a721.41(d)(1). Four comments were received on 90 degree crossing re- quirement for overhead electric and communication lines in \u00a721.41(d)(4). The commentors' primary concern was that this requirement applies to existing facilities, which would require the utilities to adjust various lines across the state. The department has reviewed the language and is striking \"and existing\" from the section to clarify the requirement applies only to newly installed facilities. Two comments were received on the vertical clearance from bridge or grade separation structures requirement for longitudi- nally installed overhead electric and communication lines found in \u00a721.41(d)(5). The commentors believed the section was un- clear as to what horizontal distance from the bridge or grade sep- aration structures would trigger the vertical clearance require- ment. A revision was made to \u00a721.41(d)(5) to clarify that the adequate horizontal distance requirement would be determined by the district. The department received two comments on \u00a721.41(d)(6), which addresses the requirement for overhead installations at intersec- tions. The comments raised concerns that the offset was too restrictive and would ultimately require more poles in the right of way. The department declines to make changes to this pro- ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6621 vision. There have been various instances in which a driver's visibility of traffic signals has been impaired because of utility fa- cilities located near the intersection. This provision reduces that risk and aligns with Occupational Safety and Health Administra- tion (OSHA) requirements. The offset requirements also pro- mote safety during construction or routine maintenance of the roadways. Eleven comments were received on the \u00a721.41(d)(7), which re- stricts to one set the number of pole lines allowed within a seg- ment of department right of way. The comments raised concerns that the requirement was too restrictive and may create safety concerns when addressing high-voltage transmission lines. The department is responsible for maximizing the use of the right of way. Avoiding clutter allows the department to effectively and safely use its right of way for both transportation and utility pur- poses. The department recognizes that it may be impractical or unsafe to co-locate certain utilities and has addressed this issue by providing the department the flexibility to allow additional in- stallations in such a situation. One comment also requested clarification that one pole line would be allowed within the right of way on each side of the highway. Revisions were made to \u00a721.41(a) and \u00a721.41(d)(7) to clarify that one pole line requirement would be applicable to each side of the right of way. An additional revision was made to \u00a721.41(d)(7) to clarify that the pole line requirements were at the discretion of the district. One comment was received on \u00a721.41(e) requesting clarification of whether the marker requirement would also apply to light poles owned by the utility and located within the department's right of way. The marker requirement in \u00a721.41(e) would apply only to poles that carry electric loads and are a part of the electric transmission facility. The requirement does not apply to light poles that are not part of the transmission facility. One comment requested clarification on the effective date of the rules. The rules will apply only to a utility facility that is installed after the date on which the changes made by this rulemaking take effect. A utility facility that was installed before that date will not need to obtain new permits. Two comments were received regarding the department's fiscal impact statements and in particular the department's statement that the proposed rules would not imposes a cost on regulated persons. The commentors raised the issue of whether Govern- ment Code, \u00a72001.0045 applies to this rulemaking. The depart- ment maintains its position that the proposed revisions to the utility accommodation rules will not impose a cost on regulated persons. The proposed revisions create a uniform set of require- ments across the state for the installation of utility facilities, which will streamline the permitting process and significantly reduce the number of utility line strikes within the department's right of way. This should result in a savings in time and resources of the utilities. Furthermore, necessary to implement Transporta- tion Code, \u00a7203.002, obligates the Texas Transportation Com- mission to lay out, construct, maintain, and operate a modern state highway system. To implement this section, the commis- sion must routinely review and revise the utility accommodation provisions to maintain a modern state highway system. SUBCHAPTER C.

In addition, soil erosion shall be held to a minimum and sediment from the construction site shall be kept away from the highway and drain inlets. (3) Utility facility installations shall be planned to mini- mize hazards to, and interference with, future highway projects or other utility installations. (4) Plans must include the design, proposed location, ver- tical elevations, and horizontal alignments of the utility facility based on survey data provided by a person registered by Texas as a registered professional land surveyor or the department's survey data, the rela- tionship to existing highway facilities and the right of way line, and location of existing utility facilities that may be affected by the pro- posed utility facility. (5) A utility shall verify the department's right of way line on the ground and procure any additional surveys required by the de- partment before installing the utility facility. (6) As-built plans or certified as-installed construction plans must include the installed location, vertical elevations, and hor- izontal alignments of the utility facility based upon the department's survey data, the relationship to existing highway facilities and the right of way line, and access procedures for maintenance of the utility facility. All as-built plans must comply with ASCE guidelines and standards. As-installed construction plans certified by a utility or its representative shall be submitted to the department for each relocation or new installation. In the alternative, if approved by the director of the Maintenance Division or Right of Way Division, a district may require a utility to deliver either as-installed construction plans that are certified by an independent party or final as-built plans that are signed and sealed by an engineer or registered professional land surveyor. In determining whether to authorize a requirement for independently certified or signed and sealed plans, the director shall consider: (A) the amount of available right of way or the proposed utility facility's proximity to department facilities and other utility fa- cilities that may be impacted; (B) the type of utility facility; and ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6625 (C) past performance of the utility in providing accurate location data and conformance with its certified as-installed construc- tion plans. (7) If approved by the director of the Maintenance Division or the Right of Way Division, a district may require a utility to deliver plans that are signed and sealed by an engineer. In determining whether to authorize a requirement for signed and sealed plans, the director shall consider: (A) the amount of available right of way or the proposed utility facility's proximity to department facilities or other utility facil- ities that may be impacted; (B) the complexity of required traffic control plans; (C) the type of utility facility; (D) whether the installation or adjustment activity re- quires a storm water pollution prevention plan; and (E) the utility's past performance in providing accurate location data and conformance with its construction plans. (d) Tunnels and bridges. (1) Fuel tanks, including storage tanks for petroleum or compressed gases, may not be within 100 feet of a highway structure.

(H) Any maintenance, servicing, or repair of the utility facilities is the responsibility of the utility. (I) The utility shall notify the district 48 hours in ad- vance of any maintenance, servicing, or repair; however, in an emer- gency situation, the utility shall notify the district as soon as practicable. (3) If a utility facility exists on the utility's own easement and it would be more economical to the department to adjust the util- ity facility across a highway by use of a utility tunnel or bridge rather than to provide separately trenched and cased crossing, consideration should be given to provision of such a structure. Where the utility fa- cility was placed through an approved use and occupancy agreement and the adjustment of the utility facility is the sole responsibility of the utility, the department may allow for the provision of a utility struc- ture without cost to the department, provided the conditions outlined in subsection (a) of this section and all other pertinent requirements are met. If a structure is to serve as a joint utility/pedestrian crossing or a joint utility/sign support structure, the department will participate to the extent necessary for accommodation of pedestrians or highway signs only. (e) Joint use of utility and highway structures. (1) The attachment of utility facilities to bridges and grade separation structures is prohibited if other locations are feasible and reasonable. (2) Where other arrangements for a utility facility to span an obstruction are not feasible, the utility may submit a request to the district for attachment of the utility facility to a bridge structure through a bridge attachment agreement. Each attachment will be considered on an individual basis, and permission to attach will not be considered as establishing a precedent for granting of subsequent requests for attach- ment. (A) When it is impractical to carry a self-supporting communication line across a stream or other obstruction, the depart- ment may permit the attachment of the utility facility to its bridge. If approved on existing bridges, the utility facility shall be enclosed in a conduit and so located on the bridge structure as not to interfere with stream flow, traffic, or routine maintenance operations. When a request is made before construction of a bridge, if approved, suitable conduits may be provided in the structure if the utility bears the cost of all addi- tional work and materials involved. (B) If it is the department's responsibility to provide for the adjustment of telephone lines or telephone conduits to accommo- date the construction of a highway and the adjustment provides for the placement of telephone conduits in a bridge, the department will allow a reasonable number of spare telephone conduits in the structure if the spares are placed at the time of construction and the telephone com- pany bears the cost of the spare conduits. (C) A utility may not attach a utility facility to a bridge without the written approval of the executive director. (D) Power lines carrying greater than 600 volts are pro- hibited on bridges. (E) When a utility is granted permission to attach a util- ity facility to a proposed bridge prior to construction, any additional costs associated with the design or construction to accommodate the utility facility are the responsibility of the utility. (F) A utility requesting permission to attach a utility fa- cility to an existing bridge shall submit sufficient information to allow the department to conduct a stress analysis to determine the effect of the added load on the bridge structure. The department may require other details of the proposed attachment as they affect safety and main- tenance. (G) A utility shall ensure that water and wastewater fa- cilities attached to a bridge are not susceptible to leaks and do not dam- age the highway facility. The utility shall ensure that all utility facil- ities attached to a bridge do not adversely affect the serviceability of 47 TexReg 6626 October 7, 2022 Texas Register the bridge. As-built plans of the attached utility facility must be signed and sealed by an engineer. (f) Aesthetics. A utility shall notify the department before re- moving, trimming, or replacing trees, bushes, shrubbery, or any other aesthetic features. The department must approve the extent and method of removal, trimming, or replacement of trees, bushes, shrubbery, or any other aesthetic feature. (g) Design and construction responsibility. (1) The utility is responsible for the design of the installa- tion, adjustment, or relocation of a utility facility.

(3) Under the agreement the department may use only an engineering consultant approved by the utility. An employee of the department may not be used to provide engineering services under the agreement. (4) The utility must approve the resulting plan for the ad- justment or relocation before it may be included in the construction contract. The utility is responsible for ensuring that the design and con- struction meet all regulatory and environmental compliance require- ments. (5) The agreement must provide for: (A) concurrent construction inspection by the utility during construction; and (B) final acceptance by the utility of the design and con- struction after the construction is completed. (6) During the relocation or adjustment construction work under the agreement, the utility remains liable under any certificate of service. The department is not responsible for any issue related to the design or construction of the adjustment or relocation of the utility fa- cility after final acceptance by the utility of the adjustment or reloca- tion. (7) After the completion of the construction work under the agreement, the utility is responsible for any ongoing maintenance, in- cluding compliance with \u00a721.38 of this subchapter (relating to Con- struction and Maintenance). (8) The department will reimburse the utility for eligible expenses incurred in approving and inspecting the design documents. (9) All provisions of this subchapter and Subchapter B of this chapter (relating to Utility Adjustment, Relocation, or Removal) that apply to the design, estimates, and scope of an adjustment or re- location apply to a project carried out under an agreement entered into under this subsection. \u00a721.38.

(1) If a state highway improvement project requires the ad- justment or relocation of a utility facility, the utility by agreement with the department may authorize the department to include the adjustment or relocation of the utility facility in the highway construction contract. The department may enter into an agreement under this subsection only if the district engineer determines that: (A) including the adjustment or relocation of the utility facility in the construction contract is necessary to meet the construc- tion sequencing of the state highway improvement project or will ex- pedite the project; (B) the adjustment or relocation of the utility facility by the department's contractor can be accomplished in conformity with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations for the installation of the particular utility facility; and (C) the adjustment or relocation of the utility facility by the department's contractor will not involve an unreasonably high risk of: (i) danger to the traveling public, highway, or con- struction workers due to the presence of hazardous materials, high pres- sure pipelines, or other potentially dangerous utility products; or (ii) prolonged interruption of the delivery of a utility product that is essential to public health and safety. (2) The utility must approve the plans, specifications, and cost estimate for the adjustment or relocation of the utility facility be- fore it may be included in the construction contract. The utility is re- sponsible for ensuring that the design and construction of the utility fa- cility meet all regulatory and environmental compliance requirements. (3) If the adjustment or relocation of the utility facility included in the construction contract is not 100 percent reimbursable by the department under the requirements of Transportation Code, \u00a7203.092, the utility is responsible for advancing or otherwise paying to the department the utility's prorata share under state law of the funds necessary for construction work related to the adjustment or relocation. (4) An agreement under this subsection must provide: (A) the estimated cost of the construction work related to the adjustment or relocation, including the cost of any betterment, to be performed by the department's contractor, and the utility's prorata share of the cost based on eligibility for department cost participation under Transportation Code, \u00a7203.092; (B) for payment to the department of the utility's pro- rata share, if any, of the estimated cost under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph at least 45 days before the date set for the receipt and open- ing of bids for the highway construction contract; (C) a description of the construction work related to the adjustment or relocation, including any betterment, that is to be per- formed by the utility at no cost to the department; (D) for concurrent construction inspection by the utility during construction; (E) that the utility is responsible for physically connect- ing the installed utility facility to its existing utility facilities to make the installed facility operational and for performing any tests required to assure compliance with all applicable safety standards and regula- tions; (F) for final acceptance by the utility of the adjustment or relocation after the construction work is completed; and (G) any other provisions that the district engineer con- siders to be necessary or desirable. (5) When used in this subsection, \"betterment\" means any upgrading of the utility facility being adjusted or relocated that is not attributable to the highway construction project nor required in order to comply with any other law, code, or ordinance, and is made solely for the benefit and at the election of the utility. (6) During the adjustment or relocation of a utility facility under an agreement under this subsection, the utility remains liable under any certificate of service. The department is not responsible for any issue related to the design or construction of the adjustment or relocation of the utility facility after final acceptance by the utility of the utility facility. (7) After completion of the construction work under an agreement under this subsection, the utility is responsible for any 47 TexReg 6628 October 7, 2022 Texas Register ongoing maintenance of the utility facility in compliance with this section. (8) If the adjustment or relocation of the utility facility is reimbursable by the department under the requirements of Transporta- tion Code, \u00a7203.092, the department will reimburse the utility for el- igible expenses incurred in approving and inspecting the construction work. (9) All provisions of this subchapter and Subchapter B of this chapter (relating to Utility Adjustment, Relocation, or Removal) that apply to the design, estimates, and scope of an adjustment or re- location apply to a project carried out under an agreement entered into under this subsection. \u00a721.40. Underground Utilities. (a) General. (1) Encasement. Figure: 43 TAC \u00a721.40(a)(1) (A) Underground utility facilities crossing the highway shall be encased as shown in Figure \u00a721.40(a)(1). The encasement must be a single structure with no open seams. If used, polyvinyl chlo- ride (PVC) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe shall be glued with an appropriate adhesive, bonded, or mechanically fastened. Steel pipe shall be welded or bolted. (B) The encasement may be of metallic or non-metallic material, depending on the type of utility facility. If the encasement is not schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, high-density polyeth- ylene (HDPE), or made of steel, the utility must demonstrate that the encasement is adequate for the expected loads and stresses. (C) The length of any encasement shall extend, as ap- plicable, to within five feet of the right of way, two feet of a connecting longitudinal line, or five feet beyond the face of the curb, whichever is greatest. These lengths of encasement include areas under center medians and outer separations. At a district's discretion, the district may waive the encasement requirement under center medians or un- der outer separations that are more than 76 feet wide. At a district's discretion and after considering traffic volume, condition of highway, maintenance responsibility, and district practice, the district may waive the encasement requirement under side road entrances. (D) Unless waived by the district, an encasement is re- quired for installation under other department structures, such as re- taining walls, headwalls, and sound walls. (2) Depth. (A) Underground utility facilities shall be installed at the applicable minimum depth of cover shown in Figure \u00a721.40(a)(2)(A) unless the district requires or authorizes a different depth under this paragraph. Figure: 43 TAC \u00a721.40(a)(2)(A) (B) The district may require a greater depth at specific areas due to site conditions including areas such as culvert crossings, drainage areas, and future project considerations. (C) The district may require a greater depth based on distance from edge of pavement. (D) Where placements at the depths in this section are impractical or where unusual conditions exist, the department may al- low installations at a lesser depth, but will require other means of pro- tection, including encasement or the placement of a reinforced concrete slab. Reinforced concrete slabs or caps shall meet the following stan- dards: (i) width -- five feet, or three times the diameter of the pipe, whichever is greater; (ii) thickness --a minimum of six inches; (iii) reinforcement --#4 bars at 12 inch centers each way or equivalent reinforcement; and (iv) cover --no less than six inches of sand or equiv- alent cushion between the bottom of the slab/cap and the top of the pipe. (3) Manholes. (A) Manholes may not be installed unless necessary for installation and maintenance of underground lines. In no case shall a manhole be placed or permitted to remain in the pavement or shoulder of a highway. However, on noncontrolled access highways in urban areas, the district may, in its discretion, allow existing lines to remain in place under existing or proposed highways. In these cases, manholes may remain in place or be installed under traffic lanes of low volume highways in municipalities only if measures are taken to minimize the installations and to avoid locating them at intersections or in wheel paths. (B) To conserve space, a manhole's dimensions must be the minimum acceptable by appropriate engineering and safety stan- dards. The only equipment that may be installed in manholes located on the right of way is equipment that is essential to the normal flow of the utility facility, such as circuit reclosers, cable splices, relays, valves, and regulators. Other equipment, such as substation equipment, large transformers, and pumps, shall be located outside the right of way. (C) Inline manholes are the only type permitted within the right of way. The width dimensions may not be larger than nec- essary to hold equipment involved and to meet safety standards for maintenance personnel. Outside width, the dimension of the manhole perpendicular to the highway, may not exceed ten feet, with the length to be held to a reasonable minimum. The outside diameter of the man- hole chimney at the ground level may not exceed 36 inches, except that if the utility demonstrates necessity, the district may, at its discretion, allow an outside diameter of up to 52 inches. The top of the roof of the manhole must be five feet or more below ground level. (D) All manhole covers shall be installed flush with the ground or pavement structure. In order to minimize vandalism, man- hole covers must weigh at least 175 pounds. Manhole rings and covers must be designed for HS-20 loading. (E) Manholes shall be straight, inline installations with a minimum overall width necessary to operate and maintain the en- closed equipment. The utility is responsible for any adjustment of the manhole rim that may be needed to meet grade changes. (4) Installation. (A) A department permit is required for all installation of utility facilities in the department's right of way. (B) If the installation of the utility facility deviates from the approved location, the district, at its sole discretion, may require the adjustment of the utility facility to the approved location. (C) Utility facilities placed beneath any existing high- way shall be installed by boring or tunneling. Jacking may not be used unless approved in writing by the district. The use of explosives is prohibited. Pipe bursting or fluid/mist jetting may not be used unless approved in writing by the department. Longitudinal installation of a utility facility across driveways and intersecting roadways shall be bored. Open trench construction through intersecting roadways and ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6629 driveways may not be used unless approved in writing by the district engineer. (D) To preserve and protect trees, shrubbery, and other aesthetic features within the department's right of way, the district may specify the extent and methods of tree removal, tree trimming, or the replacement of the aesthetic features. Landscape areas in the depart- ment's right of way that are associated with residences shall be bored, unless the district approves another method. The district may require boring on steep slopes where vegetation may be damaged. (E) For rural, uncurbed highway crossings, all borings shall extend beneath all travel lanes. Unless precluded by right of way limitations, the following clearances are required for rural highway crossings: (i) 30 feet from all freeway mainlanes and other high-speed (exceeding 40 mph) highways except as indicated in clauses (ii) -(iv) of this subparagraph; (ii) 16 feet for high-speed highways with current av- erage daily traffic volumes of 750 vehicles per day or fewer; (iii) 16 feet for ramps; or (iv) ten feet for low-speed (40 mph or less) high- ways. (F) The reamed bore size may not exceed 40 percent of the outside diameter of the encasement, and a reamer that allows the natural wet grout to remain shall be used. Alternately, annular voids greater than one inch between the bore hole and the carrier line or en- casement], if used, shall be filled with a slurry grout or other flowable fill acceptable to the department to prevent settlement of the highway facility. (G) Unless an open-trench installation is approved by the district in locations where adequate space is not available, all bor- ings for curbed highway crossings shall extend beneath travel and park- ing lanes and beyond the back of curb and sidewalk, plus: (i) 30 feet from facilities with speed limits of 40 mph or greater; or (ii) five feet from highway facilities with speed lim- its of less than 40 mph or less. (H) Where circumstances necessitate the excavation of a bore pit or the presence of directional boring equipment closer than 30 feet from the edge of pavement, approved protective devices shall be installed for protection of the traveling public in accordance with \u00a721.38 of this subchapter (relating to Construction and Maintenance). Bore pits shall be located and constructed in such a manner as not to interfere with the highway structure or traffic operations. Shoring shall be utilized for the protection of the highway facility, and its use and design must be approved by the district. (I) All traffic control devices, including signs, mark- ings, or barricades used to warn motorists and pedestrians of the con- struction activity must conform to the TMUTCD. (J) When trenching longitudinally, backfill or stabilized sand shall be compacted to densities equal to that of the surrounding soil. Compaction must meet all requirements listed in Item 400, re- lating to excavation and backfill structures, of the department's pub- lication, Standard Specification for Construction and Maintenance of Highways, Streets, and Bridges. (K) Longitudinal installations shall be in uniform align- ment with the department's right of way and as near as practical to the edge of the department's right of way line. Consideration shall be given to allow safe clearance from adjacent installations. (L) An additional 12 inches of depth are required for installations within 50 feet of waterways, ditches, channels, creeks, or culverts. (M) As assigned corridors within the department's right of way are finite at particular depths, the district may require the place- ment of a utility facility below other facilities at necessary clearances. The district may require encasements to allow the repair or replacement of the utility facility without disturbing adjacent utility facilities. (5) Nonmetallic pipe detection. Where nonmetallic pipe is installed, whether longitudinally or at a crossing, a durable metal wire or other district-approved means of detection shall be concurrently installed. (6) Unsuitable conditions. The following conditions are generally unsuitable or undesirable for pipeline crossings and shall be avoided: (A) deep cuts; (B) locations near footings or bridges and retaining walls; (C) crossing intersections at-grade or ramp terminals; (D) locations at cross-drains where the flow of water may be obstructed; (E) locations within basins or underpasses drained by pump if the pipeline carries a liquid or liquefied gas; or (F) terrain where minimum depth of cover would be dif- ficult to attain. (7) Clearances. Except as specified in this subchapter, there shall be a minimum of 12 inches vertical and horizontal clear- ance between a new utility facility and an existing utility facility, unless a greater clearance is required by the district. However, if an installation of another utility facility or highway feature cannot take place without disturbing an existing utility facility, the district may require a minimum clearance of 24 inches. (8) Drainage easements. Where it is necessary for pipelines to cross department drainage easements outside of the right of way, the depth of cover shall be as specified for each type of utility facility. In cases where soil conditions are such that erosion might occur, or where it is not feasible to obtain specified depth, it shall be the responsibility of the utility to install retards, energy dissipators, encasement, or concrete or equivalent slabs/caps over the pipe, as approved by the department. Where grades on the pipelines must be maintained, such as gravity flow sewer lines, each case will be reviewed on an individual basis. The main purpose of the department's drainage easement is to carry drainage water and the drainage may not be obstructed. The utility is responsible for obtaining any other approvals or rights required to occupy the drainage easement. (9) Existing installations in a highway or transportation project. At the district's discretion, existing longitudinal utility facil- ities in a highway or transportation project that otherwise meet the requirements of this subchapter may remain in place if the utility facilities: (A) can be maintained in accordance with \u00a721.37(b)(2) of this subchapter (relating to Design); and (B) are not located under the pavement structure or shoulder of any proposed or existing highway. 47 TexReg 6630 October 7, 2022 Texas Register (10) Markers. If a high pressure pipeline crosses a high- way, the utility shall place a readily identifiable, durable, and weath- erproof marker over the centerline of the pipe at each right of way line. Readily identifiable, durable, and weatherproof markers shall be placed at a minimum distance of 500 feet apart or line of sight at the right of way line for pipelines installed longitudinally within the right of way. All markers shall indicate the name, address, emergency tele- phone number of the utility, and offset from the right of way line for longitudinal placement. For gas, petroleum, or saltwater pipelines, the pipeline product, operating pressure, and depth of pipe below grade shall also be indicated on the markers. At locations where underground utility facilities have been allowed to cross at an angle other than 90 degrees to centerline, the district may require additional markers in the medians and outer separations of the highway.

The minimum vertical clearance above the highway at the largest vertical sag of the line is 22 feet for electric lines, and 18 feet for communication and cable television lines. The minimum vertical clearance for longitudinal lines on the right of way at the largest vertical sag of the line is 22 feet for electric lines, and 18 feet for communication lines. These clearances may be greater, as required by the National Electric Safety Code and governing laws. ADOPTED RULES October 7, 2022 47 TexReg 6633 (c) Horizontal clearances. Horizontal clearances or clear zones must conform to the department's publication, Roadway Design Manual. Clear zone requirements may vary based on speed limit, functional classification of the highway, location of the highway, and average daily traffic. (d) Location. (1) Poles supporting longitudinal lines shall be located within three feet of the right of way line, except that, at the option of the department, this distance may be varied at short breaks in the right of way line. Pole and guy wire installations may not encroach on current American Disabilities Act (ADA) clearances. Poles with widths measured at the widest part of the pole base that are greater than 36 inches in diameter may not be placed within the department's right of way. For overhead crossings at intersections, bridges, or large drainage structures that require greater vertical clearances or longer spans, the pole width measured at the widest part of the pole base may not be greater than 42 inches. Guy wires placed within the right of way shall be held to a minimum and be in line with the pole line. Other locations may be allowed, but in no case shall the guy wires or poles be located closer than the minimum allowed by the department's horizontal clearance policy, as shown in subsection (c) of this section. (2) Poles may not be placed in the center median of any highway. At the department's discretion, poles may be placed in the outer separations or more than three feet inside the right of way where the right of way is greater than 300 feet and where poles can be lo- cated in accordance with the department's horizontal clearance policy, as shown in subsection (c) of this section. (3) Overhead electric and communication line crossings at bridges or grade separation structures are prohibited. Overhead lines may not be located below any bridge structure. If rerouting the line completely around the structure and approaches is not feasible, a min- imum horizontal distance of 150 feet from the bridge abutment joint and a minimum vertical clearance of 30 feet above crossing the highest point of the bridge pavement and retaining walls is required to ensure adequate safety for construction and maintenance operations. (4) Overhead electric lines crossing a highway must con- form with \u00a721.37(b)(4) of this subchapter (related to Design). This requirement applies only to new utility facility crossings. (5) Overhead electric and communication lines running longitudinal to the bridge or grade separation structures must maintain a clearance of 30 feet above the highest point of the bridge pavement or any retaining wall unless there is adequate horizontal clearance, as determined by the district, between the bridge or grade separation structure and the overhead electric or communication lines. (6) When installing overhead electric and communications lines at intersections, a utility shall follow the right of way offset, if ap- plicable, as shown in Figure \u00a721.41(d)(6). Overhead electric or com- munication lines must have a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any department structure. Figure: 43 TAC \u00a721.41(d)(6) (7) Only one set of pole lines for all utilities will be permit- ted for longitudinal installation on each side of the right of way, unless the district, in its sole discretion, determines that one set of pole lines is impractical. Joint use of the pole lines is required, unless the district, in its sole discretion, determines that joint use of the pole lines is unsafe or impractical. (e) Markers. Electric poles and communication lines must bear, in a format acceptable to the department, readily identifiable plaques or other approved markers denoting ownership and use, at a frequency of every other pole, as equally spaced as practicable, and at every crossing. Each company connecting to a pole shall appropriately identify its use of the pole. There shall be a beginning and end marker for each user of the pole line.

No comments were received on the proposed rule review. The Department finds that the reasons for initially adopting Chapter 1, Subchapter A continue to exist, and readopts the rules with nonsub-stantive changes, with the exception of \u00a7\u00a71.8 and 1.22. The Depart- ment finds the reasons for initially adopting \u00a7\u00a71.8 and 1.22 no longer exist. As a result, the Department proposes amendments to \u00a7\u00a71.1-1.5, \u00a7\u00a71.10-1.13, \u00a71.15, \u00a7\u00a71.17-1.21, \u00a7\u00a71.23-1.27, \u00a71.30, and \u00a71.41, and the repeal of \u00a7\u00a71.8 and 1.22, which can be found in the Proposed Rules section of this issue. Lastly, the Department readopts, with no TRD-202203841 Counsel Texas Department of Agriculture Filed: September 22, 2022 Pursuant to the Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.039, the Texas Depart- ment of Agriculture (Department) has completed its review of Texas Administrative Code, Title 4, Part 1, Chapter 13, Grain Warehouse. The notice of intent to review was published in the July 2, 2021 issue of the Texas Register (46 TexReg 4027). No comments were received in response to this notice. Before publishing notice of this rule review, the Department issued an informal advance notice of the proposed rule review to stakeholders. In response, the Department received seven informal comments. Five comments recommended no changes to these rules. One comment ex- pressed general concern over using open storage grain prior to receiv- ing an invoice and receiving delayed payments on grain sales but did not reference a specific rule. In apparent reference to \u00a713.2 (relating to General Requirements), \u00a713.3 (relating to License and Permits), and \u00a713.6 (relating to Financial Statements), another comment expressed concern over the cost of obtaining an audited financial statement re- quired to obtain licensure and asserted a signed contract required to accompany any change in a warehouse's daily position report is unnec- essary. The Department reviewed and considered these informal comments as part of the rule review process and determined the comments did not ne- cessitate amendments to existing rules in this chapter at this time. The requirement to provide a financial statement to obtain licensure with this chapter mirrors a statutory requirement outlined in Texas Agricul- ture Code, \u00a714.023; hence any proposed rule amendment to modify this requirement would be conditioned on a corresponding statutory change in advance. The Department also notes that, in accordance with Rule \u00a713.2(7), changes in a warehouse's daily position report do not have to be accompanied by a signed contract, but could rather be accompanied by a proof of payment, a canceled receipt, or a scale weight ticket. The Department finds that the reasons for initially adopting the rules in this chapter continue to exist and readopts this chapter with amend- ments. The proposed amendments can be found in the Proposed Rules section of this issue.

Case Title and Court: State of Texas v. Magellan Terminals Hold- ings, L.P.; Cause No. D-1-GN-22-001713 in the 455th Judicial District Court, Travis County, Texas. Background: Defendant Magellan Terminals Holdings, L.P. (\"Magel- lan\") owns and operates a storage terminal located at 1802 Poth Lane, Corpus Christi, Texas (the \"Terminal\"). The Terminal receives petro- leum products and stores them in storage tanks. On December 5, 2020, a Magellan contractor was cleaning out tank bottom materials from one of the storage tanks and a fire occurred. The fire resulted in the release of air contaminants and injuring six contract workers, including one fatality. After this emissions event, Magellan cooperated with Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (\"TCEQ\") to timely submit and implement a corrective action plan to prevent this type of emissions event from occurring in the future. The State filed suit against Mag- ellan for the unauthorized release of air contaminants, in violation of its TCEQ's permit, the Texas Clean Air Act, the Texas Water Code and the rules promulgated by the TCEQ.

The property proposed for annexation is adjoined to the west- ern boundary of the district. Access to the annexation tract will be by George Owens Road to the west and Old Stoney Road to the north. In accordance with Local Government Code \u00a742.0425 and \u00a742.042, the Petitioner and the District submitted a petition to the City, requesting the City's consent to the annexation of land into the District. Informa- tion provided indicates that the City did not consent to the inclusion of the land into the District's area. After the 90-day period passed without receiving the City's consent to the annexation, the Petitioner submitted a petition to the City requesting the City provide water and sanitary sewer services to the proposed annexation area. The 120-day period for reaching a mutually agreeable contract expired and the information provided indicates that the Petitioner and the City have not executed a mutually agreeable contract for service.

TRD-202203875 Karen Ray Chief Counsel Texas Health and Human Services Commission Filed: September 26, 2022 Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board Notice of Intent to Engage in Negotiated Rulemaking-Tuition Equalization Grant (Texas Private/Independent Institutions of Higher Education) To provide institutions with greater predictability and flexibility for the Tuition Equalization Grant (TEG), the Texas Higher Education Coor- dinating Board proposes updating the definition of \"Excep- tional TEG Need.\" In accordance with Texas Education Code, Section 61.0331, the THECB intends to engage in negotiated rulemaking to amend Chapter 22, Subchapter B, \u00a722.22, which provides definitions for the Tuition Equalization Grant for private/independent institutions of higher education. In identifying persons likely affected by the proposed rules, the Con- vener of Negotiated Rulemaking sent a memo via GovDelivery to all chancellors and presidents at Texas private/independent institutions of higher education, soliciting their interest and willingness to participate in the negotiated rulemaking process or nominate a representative from their campus. From this effort, 10 individuals responded (out of approximately 40 affected entities) and expressed an interest to participate or nominated a representative from their institution to participate on the negotiated rulemaking committee for Tuition Equalization Grant. The positions held by the volunteers and nominees indicate a probable willingness and authority of the affected interests to negotiate in good faith and a reasonable probability that a negotiated rulemaking process can result in a unanimous or, if the committee so chooses, a suitable general con- sensus on the proposed rule. The following is a list of the stakeholders who are significantly affected by this rule and will be represented on the negotiated rulemaking com- mittee for the Tuition Equalization Grant: 1. Texas Private/Independent Institutions; and 2. Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

If there are persons who are sig- nificantly affected by these proposed rules and are not represented by the persons named above, those persons may apply to the agency for membership on the negotiated rulemaking committee or nominate an- other person to represent their interests. Application for membership must be made in writing and include the following information: 1. Name and contact information of the person submitting the applica- tion; 2. Description of how the person is significantly affected by the rule and how their interests are different than those represented by the per- sons named above; 3. Name and contact information of the person being nominated for membership; and 4. Description of the qualifications of the nominee to represent the person's interests. The THECB requests comments on the Notice of Intent to engage in negotiated rulemaking and on the membership of the negotiated rule- making committee for the Tuition Equalization Grant. Comments and applications for membership on the committee must be submitted by October 16, 2022, to Laurie A. Frederick, Convener, Texas Higher Ed- ucation Coordinating Board, P.O.

Texas Administrative Code The Texas Administrative Code (TAC ) is the compilation of all final state agency rules published in the Texas Register . Following its effective date, a rule is entered into the Texas Administrative Code. Emergency rules, which may be adopted by an agency on an interim basis, are not codified within the TAC. The TAC volumes are arranged into Titles and Parts (using Arabic numerals). The Titles are broad subject categories into which the agencies are grouped as a matter of convenience. Each Part represents an individual state agency. The complete TAC is available through the Secretary of State's website at http:// www.sos.state.tx.us/tac. The Titles of the TAC, and their respective Title numbers are: 1. Administration 4. Agriculture 7. Banking and Securities 10. Community Development 13. Cultural Resources 16. Economic Regulation 19. Education 22. Examining Boards 25. Health Services 26. Health and Human Services 28. Insurance 30. Environmental Quality 31. Natural Resources and Conservation 34. Public Finance 37. Public Safety and Corr ections 40. Social Services and Assistance 43. Transportation How to Cite: Under the TAC scheme, each section is designated by a TAC number. For example in the citation 1 TAC \u00a727.15: 1 indicates the title under which the agency appears in the Texas Administrative Code; TAC stands for the Texas Administrative Code ; \u00a727.15 is the section number of the rule (27 indicates that the section is under Chapter 27 of Title 1; 15 re presents the individual section within the chapter). How to Update: To find out if a rule has changed since the publication of the current supplement to the Texas Administrative Code , please look at the Index of Rules . The Index of Rules is published cumulatively in the blue-cover quarterly indexes to the Texas Register. If a rule has changed during the time period covered by the table, the rule's TAC number will be printed with the Texas Register page number and a notation indicating the type of filing (emergency, proposed, withdrawn, or adopted) as shown in the following example.
