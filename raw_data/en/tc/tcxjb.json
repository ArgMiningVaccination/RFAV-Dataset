Since that time clinicians have been practicing and documenting their clinical findings and outcomes and passing these down from generation to generation. Now in the 21st century modern biomedical research is finding lab-based evidence supporting its effectiveness and publishing these in literally thousands of papers. Meanwhile, Quantum Physics is 'discovering' many of the foundational principals of energy/activity that underpin its philosophical foundations.

The advantage of offering all 5 pillars of Chinese medicine is that you receive not only an individualised diagnosis, treatment strategy and intervention, but also a treatment plan created just for you using the most effective modality or combination of modalities to get you better quicker and keep you well longer.
