Even better: the Pure Mitti bags have two sets of handles and organization pouches for groceries. I'm delighted with them! I was looking for something handmade and organic and this turmeric soap was perfect. 5/5 Stars. Excited to order again! I purchased two of the market bags several years ago and I am still using them. I was surprised at the quality. They are made of nice heavy duty materials. I take them to the farmers market. They hold so many items and because of the compartments I can keep all my items separate. They are so well made I don't have to worry about the weight. They also wash up and dry like new. Great bags! The soap is great and it leaves my skin feeling very soft. Wondering if you would ever consider making a blend of vetiver and bergamot? Those 2 are my favorite blends of essential oils in general. The hair mask worked wonders as a conditioner. Left my hair feeling soft and shiny. The quality was also great. You could smell the herbs. I followed the instructions as specified and it was easy to put it on. Does require a thorough rinse to make sure the mask isn't stuck to the hair. "}
