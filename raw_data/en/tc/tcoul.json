Using the OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910. 1030 and NFPA 1581 as the template s, the purpose of this document is to \"reduce occupational exposure to Hepatitis B and C viruses, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other bloodborne pathogens\" that personnel may encounter in the workplace. ELTSFCD believes that there are a number of good general principles that should be followed when working with bloodborne pathogens. These include that: It is pru dent to minimize all exposures to bloodborne pathogens. Risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens should never be underestimated. This department shall institute as many engineering and work practice controls as possible to eliminate or minimize employe e exposure to bloodborne pathogens. ELTSFCD has implemented this Exposure Control Plan to meet the letter and intent of the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard and NFPA 1581. The objectives of the plan are to: Protect personnel from the health hazards as sociated with bloodborne pathogens. Provide appropriate treatment and counseling should an individual be exposed to bloodborne pathogens. These policies and procedures are in addition to the applicable policies and procedures of Pinellas County EMS and th e Office of the Medical Director. Section 2 Page 1 GENERAL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT A.

In order to be in compliance with the Exposure Control Plan, all operations personnel must be assigned an exposure category according to their risk of exposure to blood and body fluids. Each is further required to acknowledge receipt of this information which will be filed in his/her personnel file. The Infection Control Officer (ICO) will shall review all duties/tasks conducted and shall determine the appropriate risk category. Further, the ICO shal l review each category assignment with each individual who shall sign the acknowledgment form. New employees shall sign the form at initial employment. The original copy of the acknowledgment form will be maintained in the employees personnel file. Section 4 Page 2 11 | P a g e PROCEDURES WHERE OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE MAY OCCUR Procedures where occupational exposure may occur include but are not limited to: 1. Dressing and bandaging wounds 2. IV establishment and maintenance 3. Patient assessment and exams 4. Removing patient's clothing and exposing wounds 5. Cleaning and decontaminating equipment, vehicle and/or clothing articles 6. Parenteral administration of medications 7. Removal of body fluid sample for testing such as c apillary blood glucose level (finger stick) 8. Extrication or other acts involving contact with contaminated materials that have potential to inoculate, i.e.: needles, other sharps, slivers, splinters, broken glass, hard plastic, sharp edges of metal or wood, etc. 9.

Handling of biomedical waste 15. Childbirth procedures 16. Any other act that has potential to cause exposure to blood and other body fluids. 12 | P a g e Section 4 Page 3 OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE For the purpose of this plan, occupational exposure means reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee's duties. A significant exposure would be: Exposure to blood or body fluids through a needle stick, instruments, equipment or sharps; Exposure of mucous membranes to visible blood or body fluids visibly contaminated with blood to which universal precautions apply according to the Centers for Disease Control, including, without li mitations, the following body fluids: a. Blood b. Semen c. Vaginal secretions d. Cerebrospinal fluid e. Synovial fluid f. Pericardial fluid g. Pleural fluid h. Peritoneal fluid i. Amniotic fluid j. Laboratory specimens that contain HIV, HBV, and/or HCV. Exposure of the skin to visible blood or body fluids, especially when the exposed skin is chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis, or the contact is prolonged or involves an extensive area. METHOD OF COMPLIANCE It is the understanding of ELTSFCD that there are a number of areas that must be addressed in order to effectively eliminate or minimize exposure to bloodborne pathogens in the 13 | P a g e department. The first five areas in the plan are: The use of Body Surface Isolation (BS I). Establishing appropriate Engineering Controls. Implementing appropriate Work Practice Controls. Using necessary Personal Protective Equipment information). By rigorously following the requirements of OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogens Standard in these five areas, ELTSFCD feels that it will eli minate or minimize occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens as much as possible. Implementing appropriate Housekeeping Procedures Section 5 Page 1 Each of these areas is reviewed with fire department staff members during their bloodborne pathogens related training (See the \"Information and Training \" section of this plan for additional Section 5 Page 2 A. BODY SUBSTANCE ISOLATION POLICY: It is th e policy of ELTSFCD to consider all patient's blood and body fluids potentially infectious, and barriers will be used to prevent exposure. PURPOSE : To prevent exposure to blood and body fluids. PROCEDURE: All Personnel of ELTSFCD are required to adhere to universal precautions, including the appropriate use of hand washing and care in the use and disposal of needles and other sharps. 1. Barriers indicated in Universal Precautions are: a. NITRI LE GLOVES, AND VINYL GLOVES: These must be worn whenever exposure to the following is planned or anticipated, (or to an item 14 | P a g e contaminated with such): 1) Blood/body products/body fluids with v isible blood 2) Urine 3) Feces 4) Saliva 5) Mucous Membranes 6) Wound drainage 7) Drainage tubes 8) Non -intact skin 9) When assisting with invasive procedures 10) Amniotic, cerebral spinal, pericardial, pleural, peritoneal, synovial fluid 11) When handling instruments or equipment b. FIREFIGHTER GLOVES : These shall be worn in any situation where sharp or rough surfaces are likely to be encountered (i.e., extrication). Firefighting gloves can be worn over Nitrile gloves in cases other than firefighting. Section 5 Page 3 b. (1) EXTRICATION GLOVES : These shall be worn in any situation where sharp or rough surfaces are likely to be encountered during extrication as an option to wearing Firefighter Gloves. c. MASKS : These must be worn during procedures that are likely to gene rate droplets of blood or body fluids to prevent exposure to mucous membranes of the individual's mouth and/or nose; such as trauma, child birth, intubation and cleaning instruments. d. FLUID RESISTANT COV ERALLS (GOWNS/JUMPSUITS ): These must be worn when there is potential for soiling clothing with blood/body fluids and for close contact with blood/body fluids ; such as child birth, invasive procedures and cleaning instruments. e. BUNKER GEAR : These should be worn when there is a chance for puncture, i.e. glass breakage, extrication. f. EYE WEAR : Protection over the eyes must be worn during procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood/body fluids; such as childbirth, intubation, assisting in invasive procedures or cleaning instruments. g. HAND WASHING : Always wash hands before donning and as soon as possible after removing gloves, immediately if hands become contaminated with blood or other body fluids and frequently during the day. The use of alcohol base gels and foams before 15 | P a g e donning and after removal is required if soap and running water is not available until return to the station where proper hand washing can be done. h. MOUTH -TO-MOUTH BREATHING : Only use resuscitation bags, mouth pieces, or other devices for artificial ventilation. Avoid mouth -to- mouth breathing. This does not preclude emergency lifesaving performance of mouth -to-mouth if PPE is not immediately available. i. PUNCTURE RESISTANT GLOVES : Use when handling items with the potential to puncture the skin, i .e., broken glass, un -capped needles. j. RUBBER KEVLAR or LEATHER FIRE FIGHTER BOOTS : These should be worn during firefighting procedures or during any traumatic scene where there is heavy bleed ing. Section 5 Page 4 k. SHARPS : Handle all contaminated needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments with extreme care both during and after procedures. Never recap, bend, clip, remove from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulate contaminated sharps into a puncture - resistant container for disposal. The puncture -resistant container should be located as close as practical to the use area. l. SPILLS : Spills of blood and blood -containing body fluids should be cleaned promptly with an approved tuberculocidal, viricidal solution. m. SKIN LESIONS : Individuals with exudative skin lesions or weeping dermatitis shall be evaluated by the department physician to determine if the individual should refrain from all invasive procedures and from handling patient care equipment and instruments until the co ndition resolves. Additionally, any individual with small skin abrasions shall cover that abrasion completely with a bandage prior to performing any duties and wear gloves. 2. Monitoring Compliance All personnel of ELTSFCD are responsible for monitoring compliance to Universal Precautions. If non -compliance is observed, that individual shall be counseled by his/her immediate supervisor and that counseling documented on the employee tracking record. If necessary, the employee tracking record shall be reviewed with the Chief for corrective action. 16 | P a g e Section 5 Page 5 B. ENGINEERING CONTROLS One of the key aspects to the Exposure Con trol Plan is the use of Engineering Controls to eliminate or minimize exposure to bloodborne pathogens. As a result, the department employs equipment such as: 1. Hand washing facilities are accessible in each station and at the hospital to all individuals who have the potential for exposure. 2. Waterless hand cleaner 3. Eye wash station / solution 4. Containers for conta minated sharps having the following characteristics: Puncture -resistant Labeled with biohazard warning label Leak -proof on the sides and bottom 5. Biomedical Waste bags and containers that meet the requirements of the State of Florida 6. Sp ecimen bags which are labeled with the biohazardous symbol 7. Disposable bag/valve devices 8. Disposable suction canisters 9. Easily cleaned, stocked trauma boxes 10. Individual hip packs for the carriage of PPE 11. Se lf-sheathing IV catheters and needleless administration system The EMS District Chief or Chiefs designee will review tasks and procedures implemented by this Department. As part of this effort, three areas were identified: Areas where engineering controls are currently employed Areas where engineering controls can be updated Areas currently not employing engineering controls, but where engineering controls could be beneficial. Section 5 Page 6 17 | P a g e C. WORK PRACTICE CONTROLS The Chief of ELTSFCD is responsible for overseeing the implementation of these Work Practice Controls, however, he has delegated that responsibility to the Infection Control Officer and the District Chiefs. All personnel work in con junction with the Infection Control Officer and the District Chiefs to affect this implementation. It is important to note, that while emergency personnel work is limited to the pre -hospital setting, some pre -hospital procedures are defined as \"invasive p rocedures\". Among others, \"invasive procedures\" include, treatment of traumatic injuries, a childbirth delivery or other obstetric procedure in which bleeding may occur, and endotracheal intubation and, intravascular procedures and surgical cricothyroidotomy. ELTSFCD has adopted the following Work Practice Controls as part of the Bloodborne Pathogens Compliance Program: Section 5 Page 7 1. HAND WASHING POLICY: It is the policy of ELTSFCD that vigorous hand washing shall be observed by all members of the department frequently during the day and as soon as feasible after each patient contact. PURPOSE: To eliminate the possibility of cross -contamination of pathogenic org anisms. INDICATIONS: The indications for hand washing depends on the type, intensity and duration of contact. Superficial contact , such as handshaking, does not require hand washing. Prolonged and intense contact with any patient, do es require hand washing. Additionally, personnel should always wash their hands before invasive procedures, after contact with instruments/equipment, whenever possible. All members of the department will: Wash their hands immediately before patient contact (waterless hand cleaner will comply with this section if soap and water not available). Wash their hands immediately, or as soon as feasible, after removal of gloves or 18 | P a g e other personal protective equipment. Wash their hands following any contact of body areas with blood or any other infectious materials. Wash their hands after touching a source that is likely to be contaminated. TECHNIQUE: The recommended hand washing technique depends on the purpose of the washing. For most, a vigorous, 10 second scrub under stream of running water with soap is recommended. It is important that personnel note that bar soaps and liquid soap containers have been reported to become contaminated and can serve as a reservoir of microorganisms. When refilling liquid soap containers, do not allow the pump stem to come in contact with potentially contaminated surfaces. Section 5 Page 8 PROCEDURE: 1. Do not touch the sink with your clothing. 2. Use continuously running water a t a comfortable temperature. 3. Soap and friction are essential. 4. Rub the soap in between fingers, around nail beds and 3 inches above your wrist. 5. Rinse your hands thoroughly in a downward position so that the runoff will go into the sink and not down your arms. 6. Avoid splashing. 7. Dry well, being sure to dry in between your fingers, from your wrist to your fingertips. 8. Discard the towels into the trash can, being sure not to touch th e trash can with your hands. 9. Turn off the faucets with a dry paper towel and discard into the trash can being sure not to touch the trash can with your hands. FACILITIES: Hand washing facilities consist of a sink with running water, liquid or dry soap and paper towels. Waterless hand cleaner shall be readily available if running water is not available. However, as soon as running water and soap are available, the hands should be re -washed. 19 | P a g e Waterless alcohol base gel/foam hand cleaner must be carried in each vehicle for use in the field. MAINTENANCE : Sinks and fixtures are to be kept clean and uncluttered. HAND CARE: For most routine procedures a gentle liquid lotion soap i s acceptable. Prior to invasive procedures an antimicrobial soap shall be utilized. Waterless hand cleaners are not to be used if running water is available. Section 5 Page 9 2. PERSONAL ITEMS PO LICY: It is the policy of ELTSFCD that any personal items (ex: razors, toothbrushes, etc.) brought to the station shall be secured in the employee's locker between use. PURPOSE: To prevent transmission of disease. PROCEDURE : When not in use, all personal items shall be stored in the individual's sleep room or locker. These items shall not be left on the counters in the restroom or shower stalls. Towels, bedding, and soiled personal clothing shall be removed from the lockers and laundered at least every 5 shifts. Refer to the housekeeping and laundry guidelines later in this section. 20 | P a g e Section 5 Page 10 3. CONSUMPTION OF FOOD/BEVERAGES, SMOKING, AP PLYING OF COSMETIC/LIP BALM, HANDLING OF CONTACT LENSES.
