About Our Drug Formulary Our drug formulary is a list of drugs that our Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee has reviewed and approved for our Members and includes drugs covered under this EOC . Drugs on the form ulary have been approved by the FDA. Our Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee is made up of Participating Physicians, other Participating Providers, pharmacists, and administrative staff. The committee chooses drugs for the formulary based on several factors, including safety and effectiveness as determined from a review of the scientific literature. They may not approve a drug if there is not enough scientific evidence that it is clinically effective. They may also exclude a drug if it does not have a clinical or cost advantage over comp arable formulary drugs. The Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee meets to review new drugs and reconsider drugs currently on the market. After this review, they may add drugs to the formulary or remove drugs from it. If a drug is removed from the formulary, you will need to switch to another comparable drug that is on the drug EWIDDEDSTD0123 37 formulary, unless your old drug meets exception criteria. Refer to the \"Drug Formulary Exception Process\" in this \"Outpatient Prescription Drugs and Supplies\" section for more information. When a drug is removed from the formulary, we will notify Members who filled a prescription for the drug at a Participating Pharmacy within the prior three months. If a formulary change affects a prescription drug you are taking, we encourag e you to discuss any questions or concerns with your Participating Provider or another member of your health care team. Drugs on our formulary may move to a different drug tier during the Year. For example, a drug could move from the Non -Preferred Brand -Name Drug list to the Preferred Brand -Name Drug list. If a drug you are taking is moved to a different drug tier, this could change the Cost Share you pay for that drug. To see if a drug or supply is on our drug formulary, or to find out what drug tier the drug is in, go online to kp.org/formulary .

REDUCTIONS Coordination of Benefits This Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when you have health care coverage under more than one Plan . To avoid delays in claim processing, you and your provider should file all your claims with each Plan at the same time. If Medicare is your Primary Plan, Medicare may submit your claims to your Secondary Plan for you. Plan, and other important terms that apply only to this provision, are defined below. The order of benefit determination rules described under this \"Coordination of Benefits\" section determines the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits. The Pl an that pays first is called the Primary Plan . The Primary Plan must pay benefits in accordance with its contract terms without regard to the possibility that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan. EWIDDEDSTD0123 52 The Secondary Plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable Expense. If the Secondary Plan receives a claim without the Primary Plan's payment details, the Secondary Plan will no tify the submitting provider and/or you as soon as possible and within 30 days of receipt of the claim that the claim is incomplete. After receiving the missing information, the Secondary Plan will promptly process the claim. If the Primary Plan has not pr ocessed the claim within 60 days and is not waiting for additional information, the provider and/or you may submit the claim to the Secondary Plan with a notice that the Primary Plan has failed to pay the claim. The Secondary Plan must pay the claim as the Primary Plan within 30 calendar days. After payment information is received from the Primary Plan, the Secondary Plan may recover any excess amount paid under the \"Right of Recovery\" provision. Notice to Covered Persons If you are covered by more than one health benefit Plan, and you do not know which is your primary Plan, you or your provider should contact any one of the health Plans to verify which Plan is primary. The health Plan you contact is responsible for working with the other Plan to determine which is primary and will let you know within thirty calendar days. CAUTION: All health Plans have timely claim filing requirements. If you or your provider fail to submit your claim to a secondary health Plan within that Plan's claim filing time limit, the Plan can deny the claim. If you experience delays in the processing of your claim by the primary health Plan, you or your provider will need to submit your claim to the secondary health Plan within its claim filing time limit to prevent a denial of the claim. To avoid delays in claims processing, if you are covered by more than one Plan you should promptly report to your providers and P lans any changes in your coverage. Definitions for this \"Coordination of Benefits\" section Plan. A Plan is any of the following that provides benefits or Services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same Plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts. However, if COB rules do not apply to all contracts, or to all benefits in the same contract, the contract or benefit to which COB does not apply is treated as a separate Plan. Plan includes: Group, individual, or blanket disability insurance contracts, and group or individual insurance contracts issued by health care service contractors or health maintenance organizations (HMO), Closed Panel Plans or other forms of group coverage; medical care components of long- term care contr acts, such as skilled nursing care; and Medicare or any other federal governmental Plan, as permitted by law. Plan does not include: Hospital indemnity or fixed payment coverage or other fixed indemnity or fixed payment coverage; accident only coverage; specified disease or specified accident coverage; limited benefit health coverage, as defined by state law; school accident type coverage; benefits for non -medical components of long-term care policies; automobile insurance policies required by statute to provide medical benefits; Medicare supplement policies; Medicaid coverage; or coverage under other federal governmental Plans, unless permitted by law. Each contract for coverage is a separate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. This Plan. This Plan means the part of the contract providing the health care benefits to which the COB provision applies and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other Plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benefits is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benefits, such as dental benefits, coordinating only with similar benefits, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits. EWIDDEDSTD0123 53 Primary Plan/Secondary Plan. The order of benefit determination rules determines whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan when the person has health care coverage under more than one Plan. When This Plan is primary, we determine payment for the benefits first before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan's benefits. We will not reduce your benefits under This Plan. When This Plan is secondary, we determine the benefits after those of another Plan and must make payment in an amount so that when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim equal 100 percent of the total Allowable Expense for that claim. This means that when This Plan is secondar y, we must pay the amount which, when combined with what the Primary Plan paid, cannot be less than the same Allowable Expense the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan . In addition, if This Plan is secondary, we must calculate the savings (the amount paid subtracted from the amount we would have paid had we been the Primary Plan) and record these savings as a medical benefit reserve for the covered person. This reserve must be used to pay any medical expenses during that c alendar y ear, whether or not they are an Allowable Expense under This Plan. If This Plan is Secondary, it will not be required to pay an amount in excess of its maximum benefit plus any accrued savings. Allowable Expense. Allowable Expense is a health care expense, including deductible, coinsurance, and copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering the person. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of Services, the Charges of each Service will be considered an Allowable Expense and a benefit p aid. An expense that is not covered by any Plan covering the person is not an Allowable Expense. The following are examples of expenses that are not Allowable Expenses: The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an allowable expense unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. If a person is covered by two or more Plans that compute their benefit payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedu le reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement method, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specific benefit. If a person is covered by two or more Plans that provide benefits or Services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees. Closed Panel Plan. Closed Panel Plan is a Plan that provides health care benefits to covered persons in the form of Services through a panel of providers who are primarily contracted by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for Services provided by other providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel provider. Custodial Parent. Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the c alendar y ear excluding any temporary visitation. Order of Benefit Determination Rules When a Member is covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are as follows: The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits under any other Plan. A Plan that does not contain a COB provision that is consistent with state regulations is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary cov erage is excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples include major medical coverages that are superimposed over hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed Panel Plan to provide out-of-network benefits. EWIDDEDSTD0123 54 A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is secondary to that other Plan. Each Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: Subscriber or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person as a Subscriber is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is the Secondary Plan. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering the person as a Dependent, and primary to the Plan covering the person as a Subscriber (e.g., a retired employee), then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as Subscriber is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan is the Primary Plan. Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a Dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benefits is determined as follows: For a Dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: The Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the c alendar y ear is the Pr imary Plan; or If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan. For a Dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to claim determin ation periods commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree; If a court decree states one parent is to assume primary financial responsibility for the Dependent child but does not mention responsibility for health care expenses, the Plan of the parent assuming financial responsibility is primary; If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the c alendar year is the Primary Plan or if both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan ; If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the Dependent child, the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar y ear is the Primary Plan or if both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the long est is the Primary Plan; or If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the D ependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: 1) The Plan covering the Custodial Parent 2) The Plan co vering the spouse of the Custodial Parent 3) The Plan covering the non-Custodial Parent 4) The Plan covering the spouse of the non- Custodial Parent For a Dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the above provisions determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. EWIDDEDSTD0123 55 Active Employee or Retired or Laid -off Employee. The Plan that covers a person as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor ret ired, is the Primary Plan. The Plan covering that same person as a retired or laid -off employee is the Secondary Plan. The same would hold true if a person is a Dependent of an active employee and that same person is a Dependent of a retired or laid -off em ployee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section can determine the order of benefits. COBRA or State Continuation Coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber, or retiree or covering the person as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber, or retiree is the Primary Plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a res ult, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the \"Order of Benefit Determination Rules\" section can determine the order of benefits. Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage. The Plan that covered the person as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber, or retiree longer is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covered the person the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan. If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the Allowable Expenses must be shared equally between the Plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than we would have paid had we been the Primary Plan. Effect on the Benefits of This Plan. When This Plan is secondary, we may red uce the benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans during a claim determination period are not more than the total Allowable Expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Plan must make payment in an amo unt so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim equal 100 percent of the total Allowable Expense for that claim. Total Allowable Expense cannot be less than the same Allowable Expense the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. In addition, the Secondary Plan must credit to its Plan deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage. Right to R eceive and Release Needed Information. Certain facts about health care coverage and Services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans. We may get the facts we need from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claiming benefits. We are not required to tell, or obtain the consent of, any person to do this. Each person c laiming benefits under This Plan must give us any facts we need to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. Facility of Payment. If payments that should have been made under This Plan are made by another Plan, we have the right, at our discretion, to remit to the other Plan the amount we determine appropriate to satisfy the intent of this provision. The amounts paid to the other Plan are considered benefits paid under This Plan. To the extent of these payments, we are fully discharged fr om liability under This Plan. Right of Recovery. We have the right to recover excess payment whenever we pay Allowable Expenses in excess of the maximum amount of payment necessary to satisfy the intent of this provision. We may recover excess payment from any person to whom or for whom payment was made or any other issuers or Plans. Questions About Coordination of Benefits?

Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties or Covered by No-fault Insurance This \"Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties or Covered by No -fault Insurance\" section applies if you receive covered Services for an injury or illness alleged to be any of the following: Caused by another party's act or omission. Received on the premises of another party. Covered by a no-fault insurance provision. Subject to applicable law, i f you obtain a settlement , award, or judgment from or on behalf of another party or insurer, or a payment under a no-fault insurance provision, you must ensure we are reimbursed for covered Services that you receive for the injury or illness , except that we will not collect to the extent that the payment would leave you less than fully compensated for your injury or illness . This \"Injuries or Illnesses Alleged to be Caused by Other Parties or Covered by No -fault Insurance\" section does not affect your obligation to pay any applicable Cost Share for these covered Services. The amount of reimburseme nt due to the Plan is not limited by or subject to the Out-of- Pocket Maximum. If you do not recover anything from or on behalf of the other party or no- fault insurance, then you are responsible only for any applicable Cost Share . To the extent permitted by law, we have the option of becoming subrogated to all claims, causes of action, and other rights you may have against another party or an insurer, government program, or other source of coverage for monetary damages, compensation, or indemnification on account of the injury or illness allegedly caused by another party. We will be so subrogated as of the time we mail or deliver a written notice of our exercise of this option to you or your attorney, but we will be subrogated only to the extent of the total Charges for the relevant covered Services. To secure our rights, we will have a lien on the proceeds of any judgment , award, or settlement you or we (when we subrogate) obtain against another party or any other insurer, regardless of how those proceeds may be characterized or designated. The proceeds that are subject to our lien include any judgment, award, or settlement that you obtain.

Sufficient funds to satisfy our claims must be held in a specifically identifiable account until our claims are resolved . Pending final resolution of our claims, you must retain control over the recovered amounts to which we may assert a right. If reasonable collectio ns costs have been incurred by your attorney in connection with obtaining recovery, we will reduce the amount of our claim by the amount of an equitable apportionment of the collection costs between us and you. This reduction will be made only if: We receive a list of the fees and associated costs before settlement, and Your attorney's actions were directly related to securing a recovery for you. If your estate, parent, guardian, or conservator asserts a claim against another party or any insurer based on your injury or illness, any settlement or judgment recovered shall be subject to our liens and other rights to the same extent as if you had asserted the claim against the other party. We may assign our rights to enforce our liens and other rights. Surrogac y Arrangements If you enter into a Surrogacy Arrangement, whether traditional or gestational, you must ensure we are reimbursed for covered Services you receive related to conception, pregnancy, delivery, or postpartum care in connection with that arrangement (\"Surrogacy Health Services\"), except that the amount we collect will not exceed the payments or other compensation you and any other payee are entitled to receive under the Surrogacy Arrangement. A \"Surrogacy Arrangement\" is one in which a woman agrees to become pregnant and to surrender the baby (or babies) to another person or persons who intend to raise the child (or children), whether or not the woman receives payment for being a surrogate. This includes any person who is impregnated by artificial insemination, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization or through the surgical implantation of a fertilized egg of another person and includes both traditional surrogacy and gestational carriers. Note: This \"Surrogacy Arrangements\" section does not affect your obligation to pay any applicable Cost Share, or other amounts you are required to pay for these Services. After you surrender a baby to the legal parents, you are not obligated to pay Charges for any Services that the baby receives (the legal parents are financially responsible for any Services that the baby receives). By accepting Surrogacy Health Services, you automatically assign to us your right to receive payments that are payable to you or any other payee under the Surrogacy Arrangement, regardless of whether those payments are characterized as being for medical expenses. To secure our rights, we will also have a lien on those payments and on any escrow account, trust, or any other account that holds those payments. Those payments (and amounts in any escrow account, trust, or other account that holds those payments) shall first be applied to satisfy our lien. The assignment and our lien will not exceed the total amount of your obligation to us under the preceding paragraph.
