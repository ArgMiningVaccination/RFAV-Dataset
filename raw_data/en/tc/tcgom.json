Chair and Chief Executive's Foreword Welcome to our annual report and accounts for 2017/18. It has been another successful year at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital in whi ch we were delighted to announce the launch of the UK's first robotic heart and lung surgery programme. Thanks to the support of the LHCH Charity and investment from the Trust, o ur new robotics programme will enable more patients requiring specialist c ardiothoracic treatment to benefit from cutting edge surgery. It will mean we can significantly increase the number of patients who can undergo minimally invasive surgery, whilst also being able to reduce their post - operative pain, lower their risk of infe ction, and ensure that their stay in hospital is considerably reduced, getting them back to their family and loved ones quicker. Furthermore it will also enable us to develop a training and research programme that will ensure we can attract top trainees an d consultants in the future. We were also pleased that N HS England announced that congenital heart disease services in the North West would be provided in a new network approach . As part of this approach, NHS England will directly commission its congenita l heart disease services from three trusts, including Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, working under the governance arrangements of The North West Congenital Heart Disease Network. Despite the ongoing financial, operational and strategic challenges fac ed by all NHS trusts, we were pleased once again to have been rated by our patients as one of the top two trusts in the country for 'overall patient experience' in the Care Quality Commission's National Inpatient Survey, published in in May 2017. This ac hievement was also supported by the views of our workforce in the NHS Staff Survey, published in March 2018, which showed that LHCH was ranked top in the country, among similar organisations, for eight out of 32 key findings. This year, we also announced plans to share our reputation for high quality care and patient experience with a new global audience. For the first time, we showcased our services at Arab Health in Dubai, before joining a UK government trade mission to India to mark the 70th anniversar y of the NHS. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 7 As a result of receiving increasing numbers of requests for help with international healthcare projects, we believe we can make a unique contribution to specialist cardiothoracic training and education, and also provide bespoke suppor t in m any other areas. Therefore, in future, we hope that ou r knowledge, expertise and our outstanding reputation for patient and family centred care will enable us to deliver high quality healthcare and services to even greater numbers of patients. This year w e have continued working closely with our commissioners and other stakeholders in the wider health economy, whilst extensive work has taken place during 2017/18 to consider the future provision of cardiovascular disease services across Cheshire and Merseys ide. As part of this workstream, we have been successful in setting up a working group, including stakeholders from NHS providers, commissioning groups and the ambulance service, to develop the best pathway for the management of Acute Coronary Syndromes. As we look to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the NHS in July this year, and recognise the outstanding patient and family centred care provided by all of our 1,6 00 staff, we are also excited by our plans to make further investments in our patient servi ces and facilities, including a new CT scanner and medical equipment, upgrades to our theatres and catheter laboratories and improvements to our IT infrastructure. Since our last Annual Report, the Board of Directors was delighted to welcome Nicholas Brookes and Darren Sinclair as Non Executive Director s following the retirement of Professor Lawrence Cotter, and the departure of David Bricknell at the end of his term of office. We must also acknowledge, once again, the contribution of our members and t he invaluable support of our Governors who give their time voluntarily to raise awareness of the work of the hospital in their constituencies and assist the Board of Directors on a range of issues. Finally we would like to place on record our sincere t hanks to all our volunteers without whom the hospital would not be the same place. We have no doubt that many more challenges lie ahead in 2018/19. However we are equally confident that each one of these challenges will be fully met by our 'Outstanding' t eam at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, as we retain our focus on delivering exceptional patient and family centred care, and adding value to our services wherever possible. Neil Large Jane Tomkinson Chairman, MBE Chief Executive, OBE Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 8 1.1 Overview Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital (LHCH) achieved foundation trust status in 2009, and operates as a public benefit corporation with the Board of Directors accountable to its membership through the Council of Governors, which is elected from publi c and staff membership along with nominated representatives from key stakeholder organisations. Our Vision is To be the best - leading and delivering outstanding heart and chest care and research. Our Mission is Excellent, Compassionate and Safe Care for every patient, every day. In this report you can read more about how Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital is developing to ensure a clinically and financially sustainable future for its patient population. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital is one of the largest single site specialist heart and chest hospitals in the UK, providing specialist services in cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology, respiratory medicine including adult cystic fibrosis and diagnostic imaging . The Trust serves a population of 2.8milli on spanning Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales and the Isle of Man. The Trust also receives referrals from outside of its core population base for some of its highly specialised services such as aortics. The Trust has 195 beds. In 2017/18, it treated (inc . NHS 69,304 hospital outpatients As at 31st March 2018, the T rust employed 1,613 staff of whom 430 w ere male and 1,183 were female . There were also 19 senior managers - being those persons in in senior positions having authority or responsibility for directing or controlling the major activities of the NHS foundatio n trust - of whom 8 were male and 1 1 were female. In addition, the Board of Directors comprised 7 males and 4 females, as well as 3 Associate Directors of whom 1 was male and 2 were female. The Trust aims to provide 'e xcellent , compassionate and safe car e to every patient, every day' and has firmly embedded the values and behaviours that are expected of all its staff and volunteers. The vision, 'to be the best', is underpinned by five strategic objective themes: Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 9 Quality and Patient Experience Enhancin g Service Delivery, Research & Innovation Financial Sustainability and Value for Money Workforce - the Best NHS Employer with a highly motivated, skilled and effective workforce Partnerships - developing partnership and collaborative working through health system leadership Furthermore, the Trust's vision, strategic objectives and all key activities are underpinned by its safety culture, model of Patient and Family Centred Care and its People Strategy. The Trust operates in a challenging financial environ ment and continues to strive to develop a portfolio of services that are clinically and financially sustainable. Demand is increasing due to demographic and lifestyle factors. Heart and lung diseases continue to be amongst the biggest killers in the UK an d all business decisions and opportunities are considered in the context of benefits for our patients. The Trust has a strong culture of research and innovation underpinning its excellent clinical outcomes. The Trust is a digitally enabled organisation an d seeks to improve clinical and operational performance and the patient and family experience. Alongside significant investments in its IT infrastructure, further investments have been made to the estates infrastructure and medical equipment. The Trust re cognises the challenges it is facing but sees opportunities to strengthen its position through extending integrated models of care through collaborative working. The Trust has developed a long term plan that it continues to execute with success, which will help to ensure that the Trust continues to succeed and that commissioner focus on service quality (national standards, NICE implementation and delivery of the NHS Constitution) remains a key strength. Within this context, the plan continues to focus on where it is possible to form strong clinical and organisational relationships. There is clear evidence that partnerships enhance the role of the Trust, improve patient care and outcomes at partner Trusts and reduce streamline patient pathways. Key achieve ments in 2017/18 LHCH launched the UK's first robotic cardiothoracic surgery programme. NHS England announced a new network approach for the delivery of congenital heart disease services in the North West and will directly commission its congenital heart disease services from three trusts, including LHCH. LHCH ranked top in the country, among similar organisations, in eight out of 32 key findings in the NHS Staff Survey 2017. LHCH was rated second in the country for ' overall patient experience' in the Care Quality Commission's National Inpatient Survey, published in May 2017. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 10 Professor Gregory Lip was appointed as Chair of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Liverpool, in partnership with the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moor es University. LHCH hosted the seventh biennial Aortic Surgery Symposium. LHCH hosted the second annual Aortic Dissection Awareness Conference. LHCH's Keith Wilson won the Outstanding Contribution to Patient and Public Involvement Award at the North W est Coast Research and Innovation Awards 2018. LHCH was accredited by the Skills Development Network as a Level 1 Towards Excellence Finance organisation. LHCH's Pulmonary Function Team was a shortlisted finalist for an Innovation Award at the Advancing Healthcare Awards 2017. No improvements identified by the Care Quality Commission following 'Outstanding ' status given in April 2016. All minimum standards of care met or exceeded as defined by the Department of Health. LHCH delivered strong performanc e against financial and operational targets for 2017/18. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 11 Going concern After making enquiries, the Board of Directors has a reasonable expectation that the NHS foundation trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeab le future. For this reason, the Trust continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. The Board of Directors has a reasonable expectation that the Trust has adequate resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future. Fo r this reason the accounts continue to be prepared under the going concern basis. 1.2 Performance Analysis Activity carried out by the Trust comprises both elective and emergency referrals from surrounding district general hospitals, general practitio ners and clinicians from across the country. The Trust's core services are cardiology and chest medicine, cardiac and thoracic surgery and the provision of community -based care services for chronic long term conditions. The total annual operating revenue for the Trust in 2017/18 was \u00a3144.5m - an increase of 11% from 2016/17. The vast majority of this increase is related to the change in tariff currency from HRG4 to HRG4+. The total income was derived from a number of key contracts: \u00a387.5m from NHS Engla nd for Tertiary \u00a316.6m from the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee; \u00a317.9m from North West Clinical Commissioning Groups for secondary care activity; \u00a34.0m from community contracts; \u00a33.6m for the Isle of Ma n contract; \u00a33.3m from private patient work; \u00a32.7m for clinical education and training , and \u00a31.6m in support of research and development activities. The table below demonstrates the movement in patient activity numbers since 2013/14. 5 year Activity at March 31st 2018, the Trust wa s compliant with 18 weeks and cancer waiting tim es. Diagnostic waiting times were non-compliant for the y ear to date. Performance against the W elsh 26 week target was below plan for admitted and incomplete pathways as of March 31st 2018 but compliant for non-admitted pathways . Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 12 Analysis of 2017/18 financial performance The Trust's financial plans for 2017/18 required the delivery of a surplus of \u00a36.9 m in line with its externally set 'Control Total' agreed with NHS Improvement . The Trust delivered a norma lised deficit (excluding the impact of impairments) of \u00a38.4m, which was \u00a3 1.5m better than plan. This posi tion included delivery of \u00a33.6 m Cost Improvement and was after receiving \u00a34.1m of Strategic and Transformation Funding (STF). Overall financial perf ormance for the year is summarised in the table below. Financial Performance 2017/18 \u00a3m Plan Actual Variance Operating Revenue 140.5 144.5 Employee Expenses (73.8) (73.3) 0.5 Non-pay Expenses (45.1) (45.4) (0.2) Overheads (7.5) (10.1) (2.6) Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 14.0 15.7 1.6 Net financing expenses (7.2) (4.9) 2.3 Net Surplus/ (Deficit) as per Annual Accounts 6.9 10.8 4.0 Remove Exceptional Items* (0.0) (2.4) (2.4) Trust no rmalised Surplus/Deficit (Control Total) 6.9 8.4 1.5 *Exceptional items includ e an impairment reversal (\u00a32.4 m) and transactions related to donated assets The Trust's operating revenue at \u00a3144.5m is a \u00a3 4.0m increase against the planned income for 2017/18 . The main elements of this include the following: An additional \u00a3 1.5m of STF funding from NHS Improvement notified in April 2018. The tertiary contract with NHS England over-performed by \u00a32.0 m (2%) (or net in total. The tertiary contract with NHS England over performed by \u00a32.0 m (2%) This mainly related to an over performance of \u00a31.4m on non elective and \u00a31.2m on planned inpatients offset slightly by an under performance of \u00a30.3m on outpatients and \u00a30.2m for high cost drugs and devices. The remaining s econdary care contracts slightly underperformed by \u00a30.2m (0.5%), relating to underachievement of KPIs related to the COPD contract with Knowsley CCG. Private patient income was below plan by \u00a30.02 m (0.6%). Non patient related income was above plan by \u00a30 .7m (36%) materially driven by increased demand for radiology services from other provider organisations and an increase in research and development. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 13 Costs and productivity The Trust's total costs in 2017/18 were \u00a3 136.1m, above plan by \u00a32.4 m. Pay costs w ere \u00a30.5m (1%) below plan. Agency costs were slightly lower than the previous year \u00a31.5m in 2017/18 compared to \u00a31.6m in 2016/17. In addition medical costs were \u00a30.6m lower than plan due to unfilled vacancies, while nursing costs were \u00a30.2m higher than planned, arising from increased ward pressures during the winter months. Direct non p ay costs were above plan by \u00a32.9m (5 %). This is made up of a number of areas: the largest being the provision of additional radiology services to meet increased demand has r esulted in \u00a30.5m of additional costs, an increase in drug costs of 2% (\u00a30.2m) and an increase in costs associated with research and development. The bad debt provision has also increased following a review of aged debt associated with private patients, a s well as to accommodate a number of outstanding drug, device and activity challenges from NHS England that have yet to be resolved. The Trust had a Cost Improvement Programme target (CIP) of \u00a33.7m or 2.8% of its planned operating expenditure over the pe riod. The actual delivery against this target is set out in the table below: Performance by Category Plan Actual Variance \u00a3m Income 0 0.06 0.06 Pay 2.0 1.6 -0.4 Non Pay 1.7 1.5 -0.3 Total 3.7 3.1 -0.7 The underperformance on the CIP programme wa s partially offset in year through non - recurrent savings totalling \u00a3 0.5k. The Trust has been actively using benchmarking information to identify and drive CIPs, taking advantage of NHS Improvement's initiatives, such as Model Hospital, Back -office benchm arking and GIRFT (Getting it Right First Time), alongside long -standing reviews such as the National Cardiac Benchmarking Reports. CIP schemes are identified by Trust Divisions and are subject to review via the Trust Senior Management Team, overseen by t he Business Transformation Steering Group, reporting to the Operations Board and providing assurance through the Integrated Performance Committee. Quality Impact Assessments are undertaken on all CIP schemes above a de minimus value and are reviewed throug h the Quality Committee to ensure that schemes are not agreed which will have a detrimental effect upon patient safety or quality of care. The Medical Director and Director of Nursing are required to approve all CIP schemes to provide assurance that they w ill not adversely impact upon patient care. The Trust remains an active member of the Cheshire and Merseyside Strategic Transformation Plan and is leading the cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) transformation project Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 14 across the region. Many of the Trust's efficiency schemes in 2018/19 and beyond will be focussed on pathway redesign over this wider planning footprint. Capital investments and cash flow During the 2017/18 financial year, the total capital investment in improving the hospital facilities was \u00a36.0 m. The main investments are highlighted below. The purchase of a s urgical robot (\u00a31.4m) IT investm ent and network upgrades (\u00a31.5 m, including \u00a3 0.6m on cyber security) The purch ase of medical equipment (\u00a31.3 m) Estates infrastructure costs (\u00a31.3 m) include commencement of the same -day admissions unit , refurbishment of wards and theatres, replacement of chillers for theatres , and other improvements across the site. Completion of the b edside monitoring system (\u00a30.4 m). After funding the capital programme outline d above, the Trust had a closing cash balance of \u00a37.5m as at 31st March 2018. The Trust's cash position was \u00a31.9m below plan due to contractual payments falling into 2018/19. Financing Under its licence conditions, the Trust's ability to service borrowing s is measured through the capital service capacity risk rating. The total amount of lease obligations remaining as at 31st March 2017 is \u00a30.6 m. Financing activities are managed in accordance with the Trust's approved Treasury Management Policy which is re viewed by the Investment Committee and approved annually by the Board of Directors. During the year, cash investments accrued \u00a31 9k of interest. Better Payment Practice Code The Better Payment Practice Code requires trusts to aim to pay all undisputed invo ices by the due date or within 30 days of receipt of goods or a valid invoice, whichever is later. Performance against the Better Payment Practice Code has improved in 2017/18 for non - NHS suppliers. For NHS invoices, there has been a slight deterioration in the number of NHS invoices paid within target but an improvement in the overall amount paid within target .

The Trust's treasury management activity is subject to review by internal auditors. Currency risk The Trust is principally a domestic organisation with the great majority of transactions, assets and liabilities being in the UK and sterling based. The Trust has no overseas operations, but does rely on a US company to provide the consumables for the surgical robot. The Trust therefore has some exposure to currency r ate fluctuations, but these are not considered material. Interest rate risk The Trust has minimal borrowings. These are based on rates of interest fixed at the time of entering into the lease agreements. The Trust funds its capital programme from interna lly generated funds, therefore does not have any other loans and so is not exposed to any interest rate risk. Credit risk The majority of the Trust's income comes from contracts with other public sector bodies. The Trust has low exposure to credit risk. T he maximum exposures as at 31st March 2018 are in receivables from customers, as disclosed in the trade and other receivables note. Liquidity risk The Trust's operating costs are incurred under contracts with CCGs and NHS England, which are financed from resources voted annually by Parliament. The Trust finances its capital expenditure from internally generated funds. The Trust is not, therefore, exposed to significant liquidity risks.

The Trust has an executive lead for all environme ntal issues and continues to implement a number of low energy projects across the Estate. The Trust also undertakes feasibility studies into alternative energy projects that will provide more sustainable energy and more resilient services to the Trust. Social matters The Trust has an Equality and Inclusion Strategy which sets out our commitment to taking equality, diversity and human rights into account in everything we do. The Trust takes its legal, ethical and moral duties and obligations around equali ty, inclusion and human rights seriously and the strategy has been aligned with The NHS Public Sector Duty and the requirements set out within the Workforce Race Equality Standard. For further details, visit: www.lhch.nhs.uk/about -lhch/equality -and-inclusion/ The Trust has an Anti-Fraud, Bribery and Corruption Policy and is committed to reducing level s of fraud, bribery and corruption within both the Trust and the wider NHS to an a bsolute minimum. The Trust does not tolerate fraud, bribery and corruption and aims to eliminate all such activity as far as possible, and will seek the appropriate disciplinary, regulatory, civil, and criminal sanctions against fraudsters and where possib le will attempt to recover losses. Conclusion The Trust has met its externally set financial targets for the year with the achievement of a normalised surplus of \u00a38.4m against its planned surplus of \u00a3 6.9k (\u00a31.5m better than plan). Plans for 20 18/19 have been set which aim to build upon this year's strong financial performance. This, together with the progress being made on our efficiency programme, means the Trust is well placed to continue to rise to the financial challenges ahead.

In accordance with the Code of Governance, all Non Executive Director s are considered to be independent, including the Chairman. In line with NHS Improvement's guidance, the term of office of Directors appointed to the antecedent NHS Trust are not c onsidered material in calculation of the length of office served on the Board of the Foundation Trust. Non Executive Director s are normally appointed for 3 year terms subject to continued satisfactory performance. After serving two three year terms (6 ye ars in total), careful consideration is given to any further re -appointment in the context of independence and objectivity. Any re -appointment beyond 6 years is on an annual basis and governors must be satisfied that exceptional needs of the Trust (e.g. to maintain continuity of leadership) outweigh any risk around maintaining independence. It is for the Council of Governors to determine the termination of any Non Executive Director appointment. The Directors' biographical details summarised above demonst rate the wide range of skills and experience that they bring to the Board. The Board recognises the value of succession planning and the Board's Nominations and Remuneration Committee undertakes an annual process of succession planning review for Board mem bers. The Trust has a programme of full Board and individual appraisal to support the succession planning process and ensure the stability and effectiveness of the Board in the context of new challenges and the dynamic external environment within which the Trust operates. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 21 Board meetings and attendance The Board met seven times during the year. Attendance at meetings is recorded in the table below. Director 25th April 2017 30th May 2017 25th July 2017 31st Oct 2017 28th Nov 2017 30th Jan 2018 27th March 2018 Chairman Neil Large x Chief Executive Jane Tomkinson Non Executive Director s David Bricknell x Nicholas Brooks Lawrence Cotter Julian Farmer Mark Jones Marion Savill x Darren Sinclair x Executive Directors Sue Pemberton Raphael Perry x Tony Wilding x Claire Wilson Evaluation of Board and committees Each Board Committ ee has undertaken a review of its effectiveness in delivering its terms of reference and these reports are reviewed by the Audit Committee before being reported to the Board. Board members have evaluated the performance and conduct of the Board at the end of each Board meeting and an annual evaluation report completed. During 201 7/18, the Board has put in place developmental work following its independent 'Well Led Review', which reported in March 2017 and which concluded that the Trust is well led with n o significant findings (please refer to Annual Governance Statement in section 2.7) . The Trust has followed up this work with further reviews of the effectiveness of its Assurance Committees and identified opportunities to streamline the terms of reference and business cycles to eliminate duplication. The Board designated four full days during the year to work on strategic planning and development and a half day for joint planning work with the Council of Governors. All Directors received an individual appraisal in 201 7/18. In the case of the Chief Executive, this was led by the Chairman; for the executive directors, the process was led by the Chief Executive; and for the Non -Executives by the Chairman. The Chairman's appraisal was led by the Senior Ind ependent Director and followed a process approved by the Council of Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 22 Governors that involved all governors and directors having the opportunity to input relevant feedback. Understanding the views of Governors, members and the public The Board recognises th e value and importance of engaging with Governors in order that Governors may properly fulfil their role as conduit between the Board and the members, public and stakeholders. The Board and Council of Governors meet regularly and enjoy a strong working re lationship. The Chair ensures that each body is kept advised of the other's work and key decisions. All members of the Board regularly attend Council of Governor meetings (quarterly) and Non Executive Director s present reports on a cyclical basis of the w ork of the Board's Assurance Committees. A report from the Audit Committee is provided at every meeting of the Council of Governors. The Council of Governors is provided with a copy of the agenda and minutes of every Board meeting and Governors are alway s welcome to attend to observe meetings of the Board which are held in public. Through observation of the Board in action, Governors have opportunity to observe the challenge and scrutiny of reports brought to the Board, helping them to better understand t he work of the Board and how it operates. Prior to every meeting of the Council of Governors, there is an opportunity for Governors to participate in an organised walkabout led by the Chairman. This is followed by informal 'interest groups' at which Gove rnors divide into three groups, each led by an Executive Director and a Non - Executive Director sponsor to discuss topical issues relating to either 'quality and safety', 'patient and family experience' or 'finance and performance'. These informal sessions also provide opportunity for Governors to prepare further questions for debate at the formal Council meeting that follows. At the start of each Council meeting, the Governors receive a patient story and also a short presentation from either a clinical o r operational manager on a particular service, in order to enhance Governor understanding and awareness of the services provided by the Trust. In addition to the Council of Governors meetings, the Chair hosts a quarterly informal lunch meeting, at which G overnors are updated on news and have opportunity to network and feedback on any matters they wish to raise. These meetings are followed up with a Chair's Bulletin which is sent to all Governors, ensuring that every governor is updated on any communication s, news and forthcoming events. At every Council of Governors meeting the agenda includes a standing item for governors to feedback on any networks, events or issues raised by constituency members. The Trust also organises an annual development day for g overnors at which part of the time is allocated to joint working with Directors. It is through this variety of mechanisms that the Chairman ensures strong working relationships and effective flow of communication between the Board and Council such that Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 23 the Board is able to understand and take account of the views of governors, members and the public. Registers of interests The Trust maintains a register of interests of Directors and a register of interests of Governors and these are reviewed periodical ly by the respective bodies to identify any potential conflicts and where such conflicts are material, consider how these are to be managed. The Trust's Register of Interests is accessible to the public via the Trust's website - www.lhch.nhs.uk/about -lhch/performance -plans -and-publications/ Board committees The Board has three statutory committees. 1. Audit Committee 2. Charitable Funds Committee 3. Nominations and Remunerati on Committees (Executive Directors) There are three additional assurance committees. Quality Committee Integrated Performance Committee People Committee Each of the above committees is chaired by an independent Non Executive Director ; the Nominations and Remuneration Committee (Executive Directors) is chaired by the Chairman. A second Nominations and Remuneration Committee ( Non Executive Director s) deals with the nomination and remuneration of Non Executive Director s and reports to the Council of Governo rs. This Committee is also chaired by the Chairman (or the Deputy Chair when matters pertaining to the tenure or remuneration of the Chairman are to be discussed). A report on the work of the Audit Committee is set out below along with reports on the Nomi nations and Remuneration Committee (Executives) and Nominations a nd Remuneration Committee (Non -Executives). Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 24 Statutory committees : Audit Committee The Audit Committee is a committee of the Non Executive Director s (excluding the Chairman) and is chaire d by Julian Farmer. The Committee met on four occasions during 201 7/18. Member 30th May 2017 17th July 2017 7th November 2017 29th January 2018 Julian Farmer David Bricknell x Marion Savill x Lawrence Cotter x Mark Jones Darren Sinclair x x Nicholas Brooks x Role of the Audit Committee The Audit Committee critically reviews the governance and assurance processes upon which the Board of Directors places reliance. All Non Executive Director s are members of the Audit Committee, reflecting the importance that the Board places on the Audit Committee to enable effective Non Executive challenge, including triangulation of the work of the Board's Assurance Committees (Quality, Integrated Performance and People Com mittees) across all aspects of the Trust's business. The work of the Audit Committee in 2017/18 has been to review the effectiveness of the organisation and its systems of governance, risk management and internal control through a programme of work involv ing the scrutiny of assurances provided by internal audit, external audit, local anti -fraud officer, Trust managers, finance staff and the clinical audit team along with reports and reviews from other external bodies. An annual work programme is set at t he start of the year along with agreement of the internal audit and anti -fraud work plans, with provision to meet contingency requirements. Principal review areas in 2017/18 The narrative below sets out the principal areas of review and significant issue s considered by the Audit Committee during 2017/18 reflecting the key objectives of the committee as set out in its terms of reference. Internal control and risk management The Committee , having reviewed relevant disclosure statements for 2017/18 and oth er appropriate independent assurance , together with the Director of Internal Audit Opinion, external audit opinion (at its May 2018 meeting ), considers that the 2017/18 Annual Governance Statement is consistent with the Committee's view on the Trust's syst em of internal control. Accordingly the Committee support ed the 2017/18 Annual Governance Statement for approval by the Board of Directors. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 25 The Trust has continued to further embed the risk management systems in place during 2017/18. The Datix system i s now embedded and has led to improved incident reporting and integration of incidents, claims, complaints and risk management. The Committee re viewed the risk management KPI s throughout the year and undertook a comprehensive review of compliance with the risk management policy in November 2017 . The Committee has undertaken a review of the Well Led Report in relation to the effectiveness of assurance committees (July 2017) and has also received and reviewed annual reports for 2017/18 from each Assurance C ommittee of the Board of Directors; these enable the Audit Committee to test the effectiveness of the Assurance Committees and be satisfied that the assurance mechanisms are fit for purpose in terms of discharging the responsibilities delegated by the Boar d of Directors. M ersey Internal Audit Agency (MIAA) followed up the 'Well Led ' review with more detailed review s of the Assurance Committees and made recommendations enabling the Trust to further streamline reporting and eliminate duplication. Other risk priority areas identified by the Committee for review included community services administrative processes review, mobile computing, Consultant job planning, charitable fund processes, expenses , cyber security, combined financ ial systems, controlled drugs and payroll , together with a review of evidence to support provider licence self -certification and review of conflict of interest arrangements. Internal audit Throughout the year, the Committee worked effectively with internal audit to ensure that the design and operation of the Trust's internal control processes are sufficiently robust. The Committee has given considerable attention to the importance of follow up in respect of internal audit work in order to gain assurance that appropriate management action has been implemented. The latest follow up report received by the committee in January 2018, noted much improvement in the degree of progress since the previous year, demonstrating the impact of improved management controls. The Committee has consi dered the major findings of internal audit and where appropriate has sought management assurance that remedial action has been taken. The Committee reviewed and approved the internal audit plan and detailed programme of work for 2017/18 at its March 2017 meeting. This included a range of key risks identified through discussion with Management and Executives and review of the Trust's B oard Assurance Framework (BAF) . Reviews were identified across a range of areas, including financial systems, IM&T, Perfo rmance, Clinical Quality, Workforce, Governance and Risk. MIAA has supported the N on Executive Directors over the year through the provision of networking events, policy advice, and Insight updates. MIAA routinely reviews the papers received by the Boar d of Directors and minutes of Board meetings to pick up on areas of potential risk for inclusion in the audit programme. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 26 Anti-Fraud The Committee reviewed and approved the counter fraud work plan for 2017/18 at its March 2017 meeting noting coverage ac ross all mandated areas of strategic governance, inform and involve, prevent and deter and hold to account. The Committee also during the course of the year regularly reviewed updates on proactive counter fraud work and one fraud investigation was undertak en, completed and closed. External audit The external audit service was market tested during 2017/18 with a new contract awarded by the Council of Governors to Grant Thornton with effect from October 2017. An audit task group was appointed to oversee the appointment process. Whilst the previous audit contract was also with Grant Thornton, there has been a change to the audit team to ensure objectivity and independence. The Committee routinely receives a progress report from the external auditor, includi ng an update annual accounts audit timetable and programme of work, updates on key emerging national issues and developments which may be of interest to Committee members alongside a number of challenge questions in respect of these emerging issues which t he Committee may wish to consider . Management assurance The Committee has frequently assessed the adequacy of wider corporate assurance processes as appropriate and has requested and received assurance reports from executives, managers and wider Committe e representation throughout the year. These have included review of CIP delivery assurance, actions to address MIAA findings in relation to review of Community administrative processes, review of Freedom to Speak Up Policy and arrangements, NICE guidance r eview and monitoring of risk management KPIs. The Committee also noted findings of the Informatics Review and will carry forward to conclusion (2018/19 business cycle) assurance that effective arrangements are in place for data quality . Financial assuranc e The Committee has reviewed the accounting policies and annual financial statements prior to submission to the Board and considered these to be accurate. It has ensured that all external audit recommendations have been addressed. Other assurance The Co mmittee has routinely received reports on Losses and Special Payments and Single Source Tender Waivers. The Committee has reviewed and updated the Governance Manual including Standing Financial Instructions and Schemes of Delegation and has formally adop ted the revised manual. A new policy on Managing Conflicts of Interests was incorporated into the Corporate Governance Manual following publication of new national guidelines in July 2017. Members of the Committee have met privately with the internal an d external auditors, without the presence of any Trust officer. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 27 Review of Audit Committee effectiveness The Trust's first independent 'Well Led ' Review was completed in March 2017 and this included a review of the effectiveness of the Board's assurance c ommittees, including the Audit Committee. There were no significant findings and a developmental action plan was put in place with oversight by the Board of directors. The key outstanding assurance gap relates to data quality following an external review o f the informatics function. The Audit Committee has reflected on the previous positive assurances received in relation to data quality and during 2018/19 will ensure that the Trust has in place new and effective assurance mechanisms for data quality. In view of the recent governance review, the Audit Committee limited its annual self - assessment to a review of compliance with the Audit Committee checklist , as set out in the Audit Committee handbook. All Audit Committee members completed the checklist and a follow up workshop session was facilitated by MIAA to discuss the responses and identify any areas for development. Alongside this process, the two newly appointed NEDs completed the LHCH Audit Committee induction with the Chair of the Audit Committee. The review also included follow up review of actions identified from the February 2016 review which were confirmed to be complete.

Work is also ongoing to review and ensure the effectiveness of Divisional leadership and governance, through a fo llow up review on the effectiveness of the Operational Board. The Audit Committee has considered the Well Led review findings in compiling the Trust's Annual Governance Statement ( section 2.7 ). The Quality Report (section 3 ) provides further detail on the Trust's approach to improve quality, including use of a locally developed EECS assurance framework (Excellent, Efficient, Compassionate and Safe) which is used to assess each clinical area against CQC quality standards.

The benefits valued are the members' accrued benefits and any contingent spouse's (or other allowable beneficiary's) pension payable fro m the scheme. A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme or arrangement to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme or arrangement when the member leaves a scheme and chooses to transfer the benefits accrued in their former scheme. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership of the pension scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which disclosure applies. The CETV figures and the other pension details include the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to the NHS pension scheme. They also include any additional pension benefit accrued to the member as a result of their purchasing additional ye ars of pension service in the scheme at their own cost. CETVs are calculated in accordance with SI 2008 No.1050 Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) Regulations 200832F33. Real Increase in CETV This reflects the increase in CETV that is fund ed by the employer. It does not include the increase in accrued pension due to inflation or contributions paid by the employee (including the value of any benefits transferred from another pension scheme or arrangement). Pay Multiples (audited) Reporting bodies are required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration of the highest paid director in their organisation and the median remuneration of the organisation's workforce. The banded remuneration of the highest paid director in the Trust in the financial year 2017/18 was \u00a315 7.5k (2016/17 \u00a316 2.5k). This was 6 times (2016/17, 6 times) the median remuneration of the workforce, which was \u00a329k, (2016/17 \u00a328k). The median remuneration of the workforce for 2017/18 has remained consistent with 2016/ 17. In 2017/18, 7 (2016/17, 5) employees received remuneration in excess of the highest paid director. Remuneration ranged from \u00a317k to \u00a3208k (2016/17 \u00a315k to \u00a3213k). Total remuneration includes salary, non -consolidated performance related pay, benefits in kind as well as severance payments. It does not include pension related benefits, employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions. The Trust employs two executives, the Chief Executive, and the Medical Director who ar e paid more than the Prime Minister. The Chief Executive's remuneration was considered carefully on appointment and referenced to benchmarking data. She accepted the position on the same level of remuneration as her previous post and is paid at a level tha t is Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 39 commensurate with her skills and experience. Since her appointment, her level of remuneration has been uplifted only by inflationary pay awards consistent with those applicable to all NHS staff. The Medical Director is an Interventional Cardiologist of national standing and holds regional and national responsibilities as the Cheshire & Merseyside Cardiac Network Clinical Lead, the Deanery Training Programme Director and is part of the RCP National Specialist Advisory Committee. He is also deputy chai r of the Cheshire and Mersey cardiac cross cutting theme of the five year forward view, is a case assessor for the GMC and leads on mortality reduction and infection control and prevention. Expenses of the Directors In 2017/18 the total number of directo rs in office was 16 (2016/17, 16). The number of directors receiving expenses in the reporting period was 12 (2016/17, 9). The aggregate sum of expenses paid to these directors in the reporting period was \u00a310,597 (2016/17, \u00a310,762). Expenses of the Govern ors In 2017/18 the total number of governors in office was 25 (2016/17, 25). The number of governors receiving expenses in the reporting period was 18 (2016/17, 11). The aggregate sum of expenses paid to these governors in the reporting period was \u00a37,970 ( 2016/17, \u00a34,364). Pension Liabilities Early payment of a pension, with enhancement, is available to members of the NHS Pension Scheme who are permanently incapable of fulfilling their duties effectively through illness or infirmity. A death gratuity of t wice final year's pensionable pay for death in service, and five times their annual pension for death after retirement is payable. Number of early retirements due to ill health 1 Value of early retirements due to ill health \u00a381,458 Past and present em ployees are covered by the provisions of the NHS Pension Scheme. The scheme is an unfunded, defined benefit scheme that covers NHS employers, General Practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State, in England and Wales. I t is not possible for the Trust to identify its share of the underlying scheme liabilities. Therefore, the scheme is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme. Employer's pension costs are charged to operating expenses as and when they become due. Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements are not funded by the scheme except where the retirement is due to ill -health. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to operating expenses at the time the Trust comm its itself to the retirement, regardless of the method or timing of payment.

Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 53 Staff Friends & Family Test The Friends and Family Test (FFT) for Staff is a national feedback tool which allows staff to feedback on NHS s ervices based on recent experience. The Staff FFT is conducted on a quarterly basis (except for the quarter when the Staff Survey is running). There is no set criterion for how many staff should be asked in each quarter, simply a requirement that all staff should be asked at least once over the year. The Trust opens the survey for all sta ff to complete for each of the three quarters. For national feedback , staff are asked to respond to two questions. The ' Care' question asks how likely staff are to recommend the NHS services they work in to friends and family who need treatment or care. The 'Work' question asks how likely staff would be to recommend the NHS service they work in to friends and family as a place to work. Staff are given a 6 - point scale from which they can respond to each quest ion. LHCH scores are shown below, plotted alongside the National Staff Survey results: \"How likely are you to recommend the organisation to friends and family as a place to work?\" 2014/15 you to recommend the organisation to friends and family if they needed care or treatment?\" 2014/15 Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 54 Corporate social responsibility As well as providing specialist healthcare services, Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital is committed to its wider social responsibilities as a major local organisation and believes that investing in its loc al community enhances its reputation as an employer of choice, helping to achieve its vision to 'be the best'.

Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 59 2.4 Disclosures set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance Compliance with the Code of Governance Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has applied the principles of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance ('The Code') on a 'comply or explain basis'. The NHS Foundation T rust Code of Governance, most recently revised in July 2014 is based upon the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 2012. During 2017/18, the Board of Directors has established governance policies and processes that reflect the principl es of the Code, including: A clear vision, underpinned by strategic objectives and operational plan A Corporate Governance Manual which includes the constitution and procedures by which the Board of Directors and Council of Governors operate; the Scheme o f Reservation and Delegation, the Board Committee structure and associated Terms of Reference, Standing Financial Instructions and key corporate policies. At least half the Board of Directors, excluding the Chair, comprises independent Non Executive Direct ors; The appointment of a Senior Independent Director; Regular private meetings between the Chair and Non Executive Director s; Robust annual appraisal process for the Chair and Non Executive Director s that has been developed and approved by the Council of Governors; Robust recruitment process for the appointment of Non Executive Director s; Induction process for Non -executive and Executive Directors; Comprehensive induction programme and ongoing training programme for Governors; Annual review of Non Executi ve Director independence; Annual review of compliance with Fit and Proper Persons' criteria for all Directors; Publicly accessible R egister of Interests for Directors, Governors and senior staff; Senior Governor appointed; Provision of Board minutes and su mmaries of the Board's private business to governors; Effective infrastructure to support the Council of Governors including sub committees, interest groups and informal meetings with the Chair; Process for annual evaluation of the Council of Governors an d for setting key objectives / priority areas for the following year; Membership Strategy with KPIs and engagement plan reported to the Council of Governors; Two Nominations and Remuneration Committees for executive and non -executive appointments / remuner ation respectively - in the case of non -executive appointments / remuneration recommendations are made to the Council of Governors for approval; High quality reports to the Board of Directors and Council of Governors; Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 60 Independent Well Led Review (March 20 16) and developmental action plan in place for 2017/18; Board evaluation and development plan; Codes of Conduct for Governors and for Directors; Going concern report; Robust Audit Committee arrangements; Governor -led appointment process for external audito r Freedom to Speak Up (Raising Concerns) Policy; Anti-fraud policy and plan The Board of Directors conducts an annual review of the Code of Governance to monitor compliance and identify areas for further development. The Board has confirmed that, with the exception of the following provision, the Tr ust has complied with the provisions of the Code in 2017/18. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital departed from Provision B.7.1 which states: 'Any term beyond six years (e.g. two three year terms) for a Non E xecutive Director should be subject to particularly rigorous review, and should take into account the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. Non Executive Director s may, in exceptional circumstances, serve longer than six years (e.g. two three year terms following authorisation of the NHS Foundation trust) but this should be subject to annual re -appointment. Serving more than six years could be relevant to the determination of a non -executive's independence.' The Chair was re -appointed by the Counci l of Governors for a third successive year beyond the six year tenure and his current term of office will expire in October 2018, at which point he will have served on the Board of the foundation trust for almost nine years. The Board has determined that the Chair continues to be independent and there is clear evidence of continued challenge. The Chair has no material conflicts of interest and maintains a clear boundary between personal and professional relationships. There has been a consistent turnover o f Non Executive Director s, bringing collective challenge and fresh perspective to the Board and during 2017/18 there was a change to the Senior Independent Director. The Council of Governor's decision to continue the Chair's tenure was based on the Chairm an's outstanding contribution and performance; and as the Board has seen a refresh of Non Executive Director s, the re -appointment of the Chair would provide ongoing stability during a challenging operational period within a rapidly changing external enviro nment. The Council of Governors also recognised the Chair's specific experience and personal networks in the context of the Trust's wider systems leadership role within Cheshire and Merseyside. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 61 Membership The Trust is committed to ensuring that mem bers are representative of the population it serves. Anyone living in England and Wales over the age of 16 is eligible to become a public member. The public constituency is divid ed into four geographical areas. Merseyside (Districts of Knowsley, Liverpool , Sefton, St Helens and Wirral, including all electoral wards in those districts) Cheshire (Districts of Chester, Congleton, Crewe Warrington and Halton, including all electoral wards in th ose districts) North Wales (Districts of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Isle of Anglesey and Wrexham, including all electoral wards in those districts) Rest of England and Wales Staff membership is open to anyone who is employed by the Trust u nder a contract of employment which has no fixed term, or who has been continuously employed by the Trust under a contract of employment for at least 12 months. The Trust operates an 'opt out' basis. The staff constituency is divided into four classes to r eflect the workforce . Registered and Non -Registered Nurses (being health care assistants or their equivalent and student nurses) Non Clinical Staff Allied Healthcare Professionals, Technical and Scientific Staff Registered Medical Practitioners To date no members of staff have opted out of membership. Membership strategy The Trust believes that its membership makes a real contribution to improving the health of the local communities and our emphasis is on encouraging an active and engaged membership, as w ell as continuing to engage with members of the public. The Council of Governors is responsible for reviewing, contributing to and supporting the Membership Strategy and making recommendations to the Board of Directors, for approval of revisions to the st rategy. The implementation of the Membership Strategy is monitored by the Membership and Communications Sub Committee of the Council of Governors, which is chaired by an elected public governor. The membership plans are to: support greater engagement wit h the general public as well as membership continue to build a membership that is representative of the demographics of its patient population, whilst also being m indful of the public population continually increase the quality of engagement and participa tion through the involvement of members and members of the public in all sectors of the communities served - specifically seeking feedback from recent patients and families in order to ensure a balanced perspective in delivering our goals Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 62 communicate with members in accordance with their personal involvement preferences. This will ensure that the Trust achieves effective membership communications whilst achieving value for money. The target for public membership was to maintain an optimum number of circa 10,100 members by 31st March 201 8. Governors are encouraged to engage within their own constituencies, including any community groups with whom they are personally involved. This engagement is supported by the Trust's Membership Office which helps to faci litate opportunities for such activities. For example, the Trust has continued to provide a series of highly successful and popular 'Medicine for Members' events at which clinical specialists have hosted talks and discussion in local community settings. T hese events have also been advertised to members of the community in order to encourage engagement between Governors and members of the public. The Trust also held a health and open day for members in May 2017 and in preparation for the summer governor ele ction campaign , an open evening for prospective governors was also hosted, which was well attended. In addition, Governors attend regular patient and family listening events which provide further opportunity for effective engagement. It is through thes e activities that Governors canvass the views of members and the public in order to inform the Trust's forward plans, including its objectives, priorities and strategy. These views are communicated to the Board at quarterly Council of Governor meetings and at the annual Joint Board and Governor Development Day. In order to manage its turnover and to improve representation, Governors attended a number of recruitment events throughout the year, including a Disability Awareness Day held in Cheshire in July 2 017, and an event at Liverpool John Moores University. This is in addition to on -going recruitment of members as part of our hospital volunteer scheme. These aim to target those areas illustrated in the Membership Strategy as being under represented, bein g mindful of both the Trust's patient population and the general population of areas served. For public members, these include geographical areas of Merseyside and Cheshire along with an age range of 50 -74 years old.

NHS improvement's Single Oversight Fram ework provides the framework for overseeing providers and identifying potential support needs. The framework looks at five themes: Quality of care Finance and use of resources Operational performance Strategic Change Leadership and improvement capabilit y (well -led) Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A Foundation Trust will only be in segments 3 or 4 where i t has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital has been assessed as being segment 1 . This is defined as being those providers who are lowest risk and who are given maximum autonomy with no potential support needs identified. The Trust's Finance and Use of Resources score for the period ending 31st March 2018 is a 1 overall (on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 reflects the strongest performance) and is set out in the table below.

The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and of its incom e and expenditure, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the accounts, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual and in particula r to: observe the Accounts Direction issued by NHS Improvement, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis state whether applicable accounting standards as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual (and the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual ) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financial statements ensure that the use of public funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities and guidance and prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The accounting officer is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disc lose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS foundation trust and to enable him/her to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned Act. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for safe guarding the assets of the NHS foundation trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the p revention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . Chief Executive Date: 29th May 20 18 Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 71 2.7 Annual Governance Statement Scope of responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS foundation trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also re sponsible for ensuring that the NHS foundation trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Mem orandum . The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide r easonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in Liverpool Heart and Ch est Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2018 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. Capacity to handle risk I am accountable for risk management across all organisational, financial and clinical activitie s. I have delegated responsibility for risk management to the Director of Research and Innovation , who acts as the Chief Risk Officer. During 2017/18 the Chief Risk Officer has provided oversight to implementation of the Risk Management Policy which is no w fully embedded and complemented with DATIX, an electronic system to support incident and risk management and reporting and a bespoke software solution for the management of risk registers in accordance with the policy. Comprehensive risk management train ing has been provided at all levels of the organisation to provide our people with the skills to assess, describe, control, escalate and report risks from Ward to Board. This new approach was assured as part of our independent 'Well Led' review undertaken at the end of 2016/17. Risk management training is delivered via corporate and local induction programmes for new staff and thereafter by participation in mandatory training. The Trust's line management arrangements are designed to support staff and manag ers to manage risks and advice and guidance is available to all staff from the risk management team. The Trust has mechanisms in place to act upon alerts and recommendations made by central bodies such as the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), the Cen tral Alerting System (CAS) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The Chief Risk Officer also leads the Trust -wide effort on organisational learning, which seeks to ensure the cascade and implementation of learning from the Trust's own experiences and those of other organisations. This has resulted in the development of an Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 72 organisational learning policy. Key features associated with this include reporting improvements as a consequence of experiences to the Operational Board, thereby providing the opp ortunity for all to learn, together with robust follow up of improvements to ensure sustainability. In addition a quarterly organisational learning forum is in place for senior clinical staff to share and cascade lessons learned. The risk and control fra mework Risk Management is embedded in all activities of the organisation. Examples include: Application of the organisation -wide risk management assessment and control system for Quality Impact Assessments prior to implementation of any cost improvement scheme. Assurance on this process is received by the Quality Committee . Comprehensive annual proactive risk analysis undertaken by the Executive Team to ensure all possible risks likely to affect the Trust are considered (rather than those facing us at t he present time) . 46.5% improvement in incident reporting since launch of the ' Sign up to Safety' campaign three years ago. The work of this campaign is now embedded within the Trust's 'Safety Seven' initiative which has further developed the safety cultur e. Each department within the Trust has its own electronic risk register, which is integrated with all others such that the identification of a high scoring risk automatically appears in the relevant Divisional (scores above 8) or Corporate (scores above 10) risk register. Registers are available to staff in 'edit' (management staff) and 'read only' (all staff) modes to ensure complete visibility and transparency across the Trust. Risks are categorised according to a 5x5 scoring matrix; comprehensive tra ining on how to articulate risks together with identifying and applying relevant controls has been provided. Where risks are high scoring, the Chief Risk Officer meets with the relevant manager to ensure consistency in scoring and offer advice in risk man agement. The organisational appetite for risk has been set by the Board, and is embedded in the risk register structures. This results in the acceptance of risks when appetite thresholds are reached or exceeded. During 2017/18, the embedding of DATIX, o ne of the leading risk management software products in the UK has brought many benefits, including universal electronic incident reporting, integration of incidents, claims and complaints and vastly improved risk management reporting. Additionally, the Tr ust has maintained a bespoke solution for risk register management, as functionality is superior to what is offered through DATIX at present. A number of improvements have been made during 2017/18 which have further improved risk management processes. The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the risk management policy through regular review of KPIs set out in a Risk Management dashboard which has been refined Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 73 over the course of the year and during 2017/18 has undertaken an audit of compliance wit h the Risk Management policy. When things do go wrong, staff are encouraged to report incidents, whether or not there was any consequence, in order that opportunity for learning can be captured. Public stakeholders are involved in managing risks where th ere is an impact on them. For example, when a serious incident is investigated, members of the Trust speak to, and where possible, meet with those affected. The Trust follows a clear policy on being open and works to ensure that the duty of candour is adh ered to. Relevant feedback from discussions and dialogue with stakeholders is considered and a final copy of the investigation report is shared, providing further opportunity for comment. Quality governance is embedded within the Divisional structures, w ith monthly reporting to the Operational Board, where quality performance is reviewed. Cross -organisational quality initiatives are monitored and managed through a combined divisional quality governance meeting, the Quality and Patient & Family Experience Committee. A formal Board Assurance Committee for Quality meets quarterly and receives assurances from this Committee on progress with all of the Trust's quality initiatives. Compliance with CQC registration requirements are regularly tested through imp lementation of the Trust's own ' Excellent, Efficient, Compassionate, Safe ' (EECS) framework. This bespoke assessment tool relies upon the integration of quality performance data, together with direct observation of clinical practice and the experiences of patients from each clinical area of the Trust. Work is underway to rollout this process to non-clinical areas. The result is a stratified performance score, the value of which determines the requirement for the frequency of re -inspections. Assurance is e nhanced through regular walkarounds conducted by members of the Board and Governors. The Trust has undertaken a comprehensive audit of the controls in place to prevent cyber incidents and ensure a speedy and seamless recovery. A number of improvements h ave now been implemented and the Trust has an ongoing programme of cyber improvements which are managed by a dedicated Cyber Security and Information Governance Working Group. The Audit Committee received and reviewed a comprehensive risk assessment and assurance report following the cyber attack on the NHS in 2017, and has included oversight of cyber security controls within its terms of reference going forward. In addition an internal audit assessment of the effectiveness of the design and maturity of the technical elements of the organisation's cyber defence framework was undertaken in November 2017, and identified evidence of good practice along with some areas for developmental work. The Board's assurance committee structure comprises the Quality Commi ttee, Integrated Performance Committee and People Committee. All three assurance committees comprise Non Executive Director s and enable effective challenge of assurances to support delivery of the Trust's strategic objectives and regulatory compliance. The Trust's Operational Board is chaired by the Chief Executive and comprises all members of the executive team, the three Divisional Triumvirate Leadership Teams (Associate Medical Directors, Heads of Nursing and Divisional Heads of Operations); and the Cl inical Lead for Research and Innovation. The Operational Board is accountable for all aspects of delivery and operational performance and reports routinely to the Board of Directors. The governance structure Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 74 facilitates a clear distinction between assuranc e (non -executive led) and performance management (executive led). A comprehensive review of the Trust's governance arrangements was undertaken as part of an independent well led review undertaken in 2016/17. The review's conclusion was that the Trust is we ll led and there were no significant findings. The Trust implemented a development action plan in 2017/18 and undertook further work to streamline the assurance committees in order to minimise duplication. The Board has set aside dedicated time within its annual business cycle to focus on strategic planning and Board development. The Well Led review noted examples of outstanding practice in relation to strategic grip and system participation and leadership. There have been no changes to executive team memb ers during 2017/18 and the Trust continues to lead on the system -wide review of CVD pathways. A comprehensive review of compliance with the provider licence is undertaken annually and reported to the Audit Committee; this is supplemented by use of a quart erly checklist to test compliance with key provisions on a quarterly basis. The Audit Committee has recognised this process as a valuable source of assurance to inform the Annual Governance Statement. In relation to oversight of the Trust's performance, t he Board receives an integrated performance report at every meeting and exception reports with action plans are provided for any areas which are off target. This report is supplemented with issues raised by the Assurance Committees, reports from Operationa l Board and 'softer' intelligence gained from walkabouts and observation. The Board frequently receives presentations from clinical and non-clinical leaders to enable it to focus on key areas for development and learning and every Board meeting begins with a patient story. The Board Assurance Framework (BAF) is used as a tool to prioritise the Board's time through documentation of the principal risks to strategic objectives and regulatory compliance, identification of controls and assurances and actions ne eded to address any gaps. There is a clear process for regularly reviewing and updating the BAF and the BAF drives the Board's agenda and business cycle. All Board and Committee papers are referenced to the BAF to enable any changes in risks or gaps in ass urance to be highlighted. Each of the Assurance Committees reports on BAF key issues to the Board and this informs regular review of the BAF. The Trust has consistently achieved an internal audit opinion of 'significant assurance' in relation to its BAF pr ocesses and this has again been confirmed for 2017/18. The Board assures itself of the validity of its corporate governance statement through: alignment of Board business cycle to the assurances required to support the Board declarations annual review of the effectiveness of the Assurance Committees, led by the Audit Committee incorporating within the internal audit programme an annual review of the sufficiency and quality of evidence brought to the Board and its Committees throughout the year to support t he corporate governance statement. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 75 The Well Led Review during 2016/17 has provided further independent assurance in relation to the effectiveness of governance arrangements and Board leadership. A brief description of the Trust's major risks is set out b elow. Key in-year risks i) Compliance with provider licence condition 4 (FT governance) - the Trust has managed operational risks this year arising from the increasing acuity of patients, a growing proportion of non -elective work and a shortage of skilled st aff available to recruit. In addition the Trust supported system -wide winter pressures through provision of increased bed capacity and specialist outreach support to alleviate pressures on the acute hospital sector. These factors have presented challenges in relation to RTT compliance, cancelled operations and diagnostic waiting times . ii) The Trust has received two 'limited' assurance reports from internal audit in 2017/18. The first related to community administration systems which have become cumbersome and prone to error - introduction of an electronic patient record for community patients is in progress. The Audit Committee has received a comprehensive management response and action plan to improve internal controls in the interim. The second related to mo bile computing which was undertaken at the year-end - a management response and action plan will be considered by the Audit Committee in April 2018. iii) The Trust commissioned a review into the effectiveness of the informatics function in 2017/18 which has hi ghlighted gaps in assurance relating to data quality and the need for significant actions to establish effective business intelligence and integrated strategy for digital, IM&T and informatics functions; a change of leadership and new structures have been put in place to support this and the Audit Committee will ensure that there are effective arrangements for data quality assurance going forward. iv) There have been three serious clinical incidents in 2017/18: Missed radiological alert resulting in delayed di agnosis of cancer - duty of candour was exercised with the family and this has been closed. Unexpected death following minimally invasive surgery - duty of candour was exercised and this has been closed. Delay in non -urgent results reporting to GPs - the lead investigator for this incident was the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital. Immediate investigations were initiated into these incidents and organisational learning plans were immediately in place. v) During the year the Trust has conti nued its work to further improve safety through a focus on the management of sepsis, safe medications, falls reduction and timeliness of mortality reviews. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 76 Future risks i) Delivery of the 2018/19 Financial Plan Whist the Trust has agreed the Control Total set for 2018/19, there remain significant risks to delivering the financial plan, primarily in relation to: National agreement of funding for Wales at HRG4+ Maintaining elective activity levels CIP delivery Magnitude of essential capital replacement requi rements In 2018/19 the Trust will put in place new arrangements to strengthen focus on quality improvement and efficiency. ii) Impact of external environment The Trust continues to work with partners across the Liverpool health economy to support delivery of the Cheshire and Merseyside Five Year Forward View and is leading on the redesign of the CVD pathway across the Cheshire and Merseyside footprint. The external environment continues to change a rapid pace and the Board continues to ring - fence time for s trategic planning and work with external commentators. The Board remains mindful of its wider catchment population and will continue to consider all service changes in the context of benefits to patients. iii) Workforce The pace of strategic organisational ch ange and national agenda around consolidation of corporate and clinical support services and delivery of further efficiencies , as set out in the Carter Review, cannot be underestimated and the Trust must work hard to engage with staff around the change pro cess and mitigate against reduced staff experience. Of particular risk is the gap in junior doctors' rota and the need to improve the training experience in response to the Deanery review. The Trust has in place a People Strategy and the successful delive ry of this is critical to ensuring the mitigation of its workforce risks, particularly in relation to the impact of national shortages of key staffing groups. There will be a renewed focus in 2018/19 of staff engagement through adoption of the Listening in to Action model. iv) Delivery of targets Delivery of targets will continue to be a challenge. The Trust's operational plan provides for the planned capacity requirement but the continuation of patient complexity and acuity, and increase in non -elective referr als remain a challenge. The foundation trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission and is rated 'outstanding'. As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures ar e in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 77 rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The foundation trust has undertaken risk assessments and Carbon Reduction Delivery Plans are in place in accordance with emergency preparedness and civil contingency requirements, as based on UKCIP 2009 weather projects, to ensure tha t this organisation's obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with. Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources The financial plan is approved by the Board and submitted to NHS Improvement (NHSI). The plan, including forward projections, is monitored in detail by the Integrated Performance Committee, a formal Assurance Committee of the Board. The Integrated Performance Committee also monitors productivity and has reviewed and extended the range of KPIs during the course of 2017/18. The Board itself reviews a report on financial performance provided by the Chief Finance Officer including key performance indicators and NHSI metrics at each Board meeting. The Trust's resource s are managed within the framework set by the Governance Manual, which includes Standing Financial Instructions. Financial governance arrangements are supported by internal and external audit to ensure economic, efficient and effective use of resources. The financial plan is developed through a robust process of 'confirm and challenge' meetings with divisions and departments to ensure best use of resources. All cost improvement plans are risk assessed for deliverability and potential impact on patient safe ty through an Executive led review process. The Business Transformation Steering Group reports to the Operational Board on CIP delivery and productivity and identifies where there is further scope to improve. The outcome of the quality impact assessments i s reported to the Integrated Performance Committee, Quality Committee and Board of Directors as part of the sign off of annual plans. Information governance Information governance risks are managed as part of the processes described above and assessed us ing the Information Governance Toolkit. The Trust has submitted a compliant Information Governance Toolkit assessment as at 31st March 2018; this has been reviewed by Mersey Internal Audit who provided an opinion of 'significant assurance'. Annual Quali ty Report The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of the powers conferred on Mo nitor) has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual Quality Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 78 Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual . The directors are required under the Health Ac t 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. Monitor has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual Quality Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual . The formulation of the Annual Quality Report has been led by the Director of Nursing and Quality with the support of Medical Director, Divisional Heads of Opera tions, Informatics team and other teams as required, for example, Care Support Team and Safeguarding team. The Annual Quality Report 2017/18 has been developed in line with national guidance. All data within the Quality Report is reviewed by the Quality Co mmittee as part of a quality dashboard and is derived from a comprehensive 3 Year Quality Strategy, approved by the Board of Directors. The Quality Committee reports regularly to the Board via a 'BAF Key Issues Report'. The Quality Report has been reviewe d through both internal and external audit processes and comments have been provided by governors and local stakeholders including, patients, commissioners, Healthwatch and the local authority. These stakeholders have fed back on what is important to them and how the Trust can further improve the quality and safety of services for our patients and their families. Implementation of the Quality Strategy and Organisational Learning Policy supports delivery of the Trust's key objective to provide high qual ity and safe care. At the centre of these strategies is an ambition to continually improve the quality of service, including staff consistently demonstrating their compassion, confidence and skills to champion the delivery of safe and effective care. The O rganisational Learning Policy focuses on how the Trust learns from all available information and feedback about services; this sharing learning and good practice is monitored through the Quality Committee and communicated widely across the Trust through Di visional Governance structures. There are systems in place within the Trust to review and monitor performance and quality of care through performance dashboards at ward, service, divisional and Board level with a wide range of information available ac ross the whole Trust. The Quality Committee makes use of a bespoke clinical quality dashboard to monitor the performance of the key indicators set out in the Quality Improvement Strategy. The use of electronic monitors at the entrance to all wards display s quality data and staffing levels to inform patients and families and to provide confidence around quality and safety. The Trust has in place a dedicated 18 week validation team working alongside operational managers and consultants to routinely cleanse and validate waiting time data. The process is reviewed periodically as part of the Trust's internal audit programme. The Trust commissions an annual external audit of the Quality Account confirming the reporting of a balanced view of the Trust's perfor mance on quality. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 79 Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of th e internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS foundation trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the content of the Quality Repo rt within this Annual Report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their Audit Findings Report and Annual Audit Letter. I have been advised on the implications of the resu lt of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, the audit committee and quality committee, and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The Board has reviewed its assur ance processes and the Board Assurance Framework provides me with an overview of the internal control environment and evidence of the effectiveness of the controls that manage the risks to the organisation achieving its principal objectives. The Audit Co mmittee reviews the effectiveness of internal control through delivery of the internal audit plan and by undertaking a rolling programme of reviews of the Board's Assurance Committees. The Chair of the Audit Committee has provided me with an annual report of the work of the Audit Committee that supports my opinion that there are effective processes in place for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of internal control. The Head of Internal Audit has also provided me with a 'substantial assurance' op inion on the effectiveness of the systems of internal control. The opinion is based on a review of the Board Assurance Framework, outcomes of risk based reviews and follow -up of previous recommendations. I have been advised on the implications of the resu lts of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board and its Standing Committees. A plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. Processes are well established and ensure regular r eview of systems and action plans on the effectiveness of the systems of internal control through: Board review of Board Assurance Framework through key issues reports from Standing Committees and formal quarterly BAF review Audit Committee scrutiny of con trols in place Audit Committee consideration (standing item on agenda) of issues which could impact upon the Annual Governance Statement Review of serious incidents and learning by the standing committees, Review of clinical audit, patient survey and staff survey information Assurance Committee review of compliance with CQC standards Internal audits of effectiveness of systems of internal control. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 80 Conclusion There were no significant control issues identified in 2017/18, however during the year the Trust has actively addressed the actions and organisational learning arising from the reported serious incidents and has maintained an active oversight of the effectiveness of controls in place to mitigate the risk of harm and ensure delivery of operational tar gets. Chief Executive Date: 29th May 20 18 Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 81 SECTION 3: QUALITY REPORT Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is a single site specialist hospital serving a population of 2.8 million people living in Cheshire, Merseyside, North Wale s and the Isle of Man. It provides the full range of heart and chest services with the exception of organ transplantation. Throughout 2017/18, this included: 1. procedures used to visualise the coronary arteries and treat narrowing's using balloons and ste nts (coronar y angiography and intervention) 2. the implantation of pacemakers and other devices such as LinQ, and treatments used to control and restore the normal rhythm of th e heart (arrhythmia management) 3. surgical procedures used to bypass coronary artery narrowings, replac ing the valves of the heart or deal ing with other problems with major vessels in the chest (cardiac surgery) 4. surgical procedures used to treat all major diseases that can affect the normal function of the lungs (thoracic surgery) 5. drug management of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis (respiratory medicine) 6. community cardiovascular, respiratory and chronic obstructive pulmonary care for the residents of Knowsley. All clinical ward and operating theatres areas were assessed against the Trust's Efficient Excellent Compassionate and Safe Care standards (EECS) framework in 2017 . All areas were awarded a green status with achievement plaques displayed outside each entrance. Six areas were able to apply for Gold S tatus and were successful with awards being presented at the Trust 's Grand Award Ceremony in December 2017. The successful ward/department areas recognised for their outstanding results on the delivery to patient and family centred care were: Mulberry Ward Maple Ward Cherry Ward Theatres Knowsley C ardiovascular Disease Services Knowsley Respiratory Services During 2017 /18 the Trust saw projects being led by multi -disciplinary teams Trust wide. The Trust has seen improvements made to the pathway of its pa tients that focus on quality and experience. Enabling patients to be discharged earlier in the day, reducing the number of moves a patient has during their care pathway and ensuring all medications and equipment are available befo re discharge. This work i ncluded displaying the patient 's discharge pass, which focuse d healthcare teams to have everything ready for their timely discharge, and informing the patient, their families and carers of the expected day of discharge. This enables families and carers to support the patient transition from hospital to home. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 82 The Trust has an international reputation as a leader in interventional research, and is renowned across the UK for leading the way in the introduction of pioneering new theatre facilities, technologica l advances and procedures in medicine and surgery. Robotic surgery Following Board approval for the implementation of robotic surgery , a detailed implementation plan was prepared to ensure that this new and innovat ive service was introduced safely at LH CH. The plan provided instructions on how the Trust would manage the Da Vinci surgery programme, the governance supporting the programme and operational plan to safely and effectively implement robotic surgery. A detailed training plan was organised by LHCH with the assistance of the Intuitive team. Both cardiac and thoracic surgery program mes included off site training alongside European and American proctors who are experienced robotic surgeons. All initial cases were completed with two consultants p resent and with a proctor on site at LHCH; all proctor registration was signed off by the Associate Medical Director. The initial assembly of the operating teams took careful consideration; the core robotic team were signed off by the Da Vinci training pa ssport and took part in theatre dry runs to ensure staff felt confident prior to the initial case. These measures allowed LHCH to safely implement and operationalise robotic surgery in line with the Trust 's quality strategy. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 83 Quality Account summary This Quality Account takes a look at the year past and reflects upon the commitment the Trust has made to improve quality. The Trust is pleased to announce that significant progress has been made on the quality priorities agreed by its Governors and sta keholders in 2017 /18. Identification of post -operative surgical delirium by the development of a risk assessment tool . If a patient developed post -surgical delirium a mechanism of informing the patients GP in case further treatment was required followin g discharge . Identification of patients who require more comprehensive care if they suffer from complex health issues . Frailty screen that includes assessment when identified . It has been another good year for improving the quality of care at LHCH, with the focus on improving the quality of care and experience for all its patients, their families and carers. This Quality Account also reassures readers regarding work that is a key enabler of quality, including clinical audit, research, data quality, work force management and leadership. It draws upon the results from the Trust's survey work with patients and other quality improvement work supporting the different services and functions of the Trust. The Quality Account has also been the subject of discu ssion with Clinical Commissioning Groups, Healthwatch, relevant Local Authority Overview & Scrutiny Committees and other interested parties such as the staff working within LHCH or other hospitals with whom the Trust works. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 84 Part 1 Statement on quality from the Chief Executive of Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust It is my pleasure to introduce the Quality Account for 2017 /18 by Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which demonstrates our commitment to deliver th e very best in healthcare. The Trust Board has a very strong commitment to quality which is reflected in our mission: \"Excellent, compassionate and safe care for every patient every day\" And our vision: 'to be the best - delivering and leading outstandin g heart and chest care and research '. We have made significant improvements to quality since our Quality Account 201 6/17. Our front line staff have been involved in identifying and focusing on quality improvements that have been generated by them. Alongs ide this we have focused on developing a culture of open ness , honest y and transparen cy with our patients and their families. Quality of care is at the heart of everything we do. This is supported by a welcoming, honest and compassionate approach to our d elivery of healthcare. We will continue to engage with our patients and families in order to improve our services whilst learning from incidents and errors. We will strive to deliver excellent healthcare, whilst supporting our staff to speak out safely, to reduce avoidable harm. We will continue to hold engagement events with our patients and their families to consistently strive to improve our services for them. This vision encapsulates our commitment to cardiothoracic (heart and chest) care as our core business , but advances our ambition to develop services which bridge the divide between general practitioners, local district hospitals and ourselves. Integration with our healthcare partners will allow us to reach further into the community and develop the high quality care and experience enjoyed by our patients. We are committed to work ing with other healthcare colleagues in development of Sustainable Transformation Plans (STP) that focus on delivering excellent healthcare locally in an evolving healt hcare environment. This year has been positive for the quality of care provided to our patients. LHCH launched the UK's first robotic cardiothoracic surgery programme. NHS England announced a new network approach for the delivery of congenital heart disease services in the North West and will directly commission its congenital heart disease services from three trusts, including LHCH. LHCH ranked top in the country, among similar organisations, in eight out of 32 key findings in the NHS Staff Survey 2017. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 85 LHCH was rated second in the country for ' overall patient experience' in the Care Quality Commission's National Inpatient Survey, published in May 2017. Professor Gregory Lip was appointed as Chair of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Liverpool, in partnership with the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University. LHCH hosted the seventh biennial Aortic Surgery Symposium. LHCH hosted the second annual Aortic Dissection Awareness Conference. LHCH's Keith Wilson won the Outstanding Contribution to Patient and Public Involvement Award at the North West Coast Research and Innovation Awards 2018. LHCH was accredited by the Skills Development Network as a Level 1 Towards Excellence Finance organisation. LHCH's Pulmonary Function Team was a shortlisted finalist for an Innovation Award at the Advancing Healthcare Awards 2017. No improvements identified by the Care Quality Commission following 'Outstanding ' status given in April 2016. All minimum standards of care met or exceeded as defined by the Department of Health. LHCH delivered strong performance against financial and operational targets for 2017/18. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 86 Clinical standards for seven day services Seven day services relating to cover from other specialities remain challenging. LHCH have updated the SLA with the Local Trusts to include the services in standard 6 and we are currently finalising this as part of the annual planning process. Despite this excellent performance, we remain committed to improving the qualit y and safety of care given to our patients and their families and this Quality Account is the public statement to this. We have led an extensive consultation exercise with our staff together with our Foundation Trust membership and the Hospital's commis sioning bodies, patients, carers and other services we work with, to ensure we focus on those aspects of quality improvement which will bring the biggest benefit to the people we serve. This Quality Account provides details of those aspects of clinical ca re we have selected over the coming twelve months, together with a review of our performance over the past year. I confirm that the information in this document is an accurate reflection of the quality of our services. Jane Tomkinson Chief Executiv e Officer OBE Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 87 Part 2 Priorities for improvement and statements of assurance from the Board Priorities for improvement Priority One: Further develop the pre -screening tool for identification of pre -surgical delirium throughout all surgical wards. Following pre -screening medical assessment for those patients who require medical intervention. Category: Patient Experience Why: Post-operative delirium can be extremely upsetting for patients; if LHCH can identify those patients most at risk it may be possible to reduce the incidence of this distressing post -operative complication. How much: The Trust's aim is to identify those patients most at risk of delirium on admission and to ensure that those who are at risk are given a tailored multi -compone nt intervention package. By When: March 2019 Who collects the data: Information will be collected by the nurses in the risk assessment document, to be completed on admission, and on the assessment and care flow sheets in EPR. Monitoring of Data: The Trust's Business Intelligence Team Current Position: April 2018 Implementation of the risk assessment document throughout all surgical ward areas - Cedar Ward , Elm Ward , Oak Ward , Mulberry Ward , and POCCU. By March 2019 , target 80% Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 88 Priority Two: To complete inpatient 365 shadows within the Trust, exploring and learning from a year of inpatient journeys across all specialities. Category: Safe Why: Shadowing the pathway of patients and families to learn and change practice from observation of our patient journey will enable the Trust to monitor standards and change practices w here applicable to keep patients safe and harm free. How much: The Trust's aim is to ensure a total number of 365 shadows are completed. By When: March 2019 Who colle cts the data: The administration team within the service improvement department Monitoring of Data: On a weekly basis to ensure the numbers of shadows required have been completed and documented learning is captured. Current Position : April 2018 devel op the structures for capturing and recording shadows with 365 completed by March 2019 . Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 89 Priority Three: Assessment of patients who have been identified on admission as having a complex/enhanced health condition. Category: Safe Why: Patients who r equire specialist care pathway planning post -operatively need to be identified on admission. Nationally there is an increase in the number of patients who reach the threshold of needing specialist mental health support. How much: The Trust's aim is to id entify those patients with complex health conditions. This includes mental health on admission and to ensure that those who do are referred to the Trust's Safeguarding Lead/Team. By When: March 2019 Who collects the data: Information will be collected via the risk assessment document in EPR, to be completed on admission. Monitoring of Data: The Trust's Business Intelligence Team Current Position: March 2018 , 26% By March 2019 , target 60% Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 90 Priority Four: The Trust prides itself on encouraging pa tients' families and carers to support the hospital health care tea m by contributing to the health care of the patient where appropriate . Patients and families will be offered the opportunity to have a care partner. Category: Safe Why: To increase the a mount of time that people can be independent with family support . This is pivotal to ensuring patients continue to receive physical and emotional support whilst in hospital. Many families want to continue to provide care and as a Trust we want to engage wi th families for them to do so. How much: The Trust's aim is to complete a care partner request to assist on admission . By When: March 2019 Who collects the data: Information will be collected by the admission documentation in EPR. Monitoring of Dat a: The Trust's Business Intelligence Team Current Position: March 2018 , 66% By March 2019 , target 90% Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 91 How our priorities were selected In the pursuit of its goal to deliver the best outcomes and be the safest integrated healthcare organisation i n the country, throughout 2017/18 the Trust led a continuous and comprehensive consultation exercise. The focus was on the identification of those priorities for improvement which would bring the biggest benefits to the people the Trust serves. By people, this naturally includes patients, but importantly also carers, Foundation Trust members and other health and social care professionals with whom the Trust interacts with on a daily basis. The Trust held a number of internal and external consultation even ts which have successively refined its decision making over which priorities to select. The final selection emerged from a synthesis of priorities contributed from: 1. Staff delivering front line services who know where improvements need to be made . 2. The Exec utive Team who have considered the wider agenda in terms of national targets, new policy directives and quality incentive schemes (eg commissioning). 3. The Trust's quality, safety and patient experience Council of Governors ' sub-group, who are continuously i dentifying priorities from the Trust's 10, 000 members. 4. Patient and family listening events. 5. Members and the general public, who have provided suggestions for improvement throughout the year via focus groups and a structured questionnaire which is handed ou t at every 'Medicine for Members' engagement event run in the local communities served by the Trust. 6. Healthwatch, who were invited to the Trust's stakeholder event for Quality Accounts prioritisation. 7. Issues raised by LHCH patients through both national an d local surveys. 8. Key stakeholders (doctors, nurses and managers from referring hospitals, commissioners, patient self -help groups, higher education institutions) who from a dedicated workshop identified a range of improvements they would like to see implem ented which they felt would improve relationships with the Trust. Priorities were shortlisted by the Council of Governors and the Executive Team based upon the gap in performance between Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital and the best performance, togethe r with number of people likely to benefit. We call this 'the scope for improvement '. The shortlist was presented to the Trust's Governors who discussed the priorities and approved the final shortlisted priorities on behalf of the Board of Directors on 1st February 201 8. This process has resulted in four of the five suggestions from stakeholders external to the Trust being accepted as a priority. This year, all of the suggested priorities have been influenced by our stakeholders and our Council of Gover nors, with engagement from staff. Monitoring of the quality priorities will be via the Patient and Family Experience Committee at each meeting. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 92 Duty of Candour LHCH acknowledges the need for open and effective communication with all patients, carers and families. This effective communication begins at the start of a patient 's care pathway and continues throughout their time spent at the hospital. Openness and transparency with patients and their families , when an incident has been identified as causin g patient harm , is both encouraged and supported by the Board of Directors. The Trust has initiated a number of ways for imp lementing the duty of candour. These include: awareness raising for all staff groups inclusion of duty of candour training within the Trust's mandatory training policy human factor s training for clinicians training for Board of Directors leaflets and posters informing staff of the Trust's commitment for open and honest communications strengthening Trust policies and procedures su pporting Duty of Candour . Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 93 Review of priorities from 2016/17 Priority One: Development and implementation of a pre -screening tool that would identify those patients at risk of having post -surgical procedure delirium . Category: Patient Experie extremely upsetting for patients; if LHCH can identify those patients most at risk it may be possible to reduce the incidence of this distressing post -operative complication. How much: The Trust's aim is to iden tify those patients most at risk of delirium on admission and to ensure that those who are at risk are given a tailored multi -component intervention package. By When: March 2018 Who collects the data: Information will be collected by the nurses in the risk assessment document, to be completed on admission, and on the assessment and care flow sheets in EPR. Monitoring of Data: The Trust's Business Intelligence Team Current Position: April - May 2017: Development of the risk assessment tool and enhan cement of assessment and care flow sheets in EPR, commination to all nursing / medical teams. June - July 2017: Implementation of the risk assessment document. August - December 2017: Start to monitor compliance against the following quality standards: ris k factor assessment, interventions, avoidance of pharmacological intervention, patient/family . It was from October 2017 that a 50% target of compliance was reached , derived from the implementation of the risk assessment . March 2018: Overall performance 71 .49% Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 94 Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 95 Priority Two: Those patients who have been identified as experiencing delirium post -operatively to develop a post discharge follow -up mechanism referral to GP if assessment outcome indicates on going physiological conc erns. Category: Safe Why: Some patients do experience post -operative delirium; as part of the Trust's Patient Experience Vision, LHCH wants to provide the ongoing support patients may need when discharged home. How much: The Trust's aim is to develop the mechanism for following up all patients who have been identified as experiencing significant delirium post -operatively and, where appropriate, refer to GP. By When: March 2018 Who collects the data: Information will be collected by the nurses and medical staff in the treatment plans for significant delirium assessment in EPR. Monitoring of Data: The Trust's Business Intelligence Team Current Position April - July 2017: Development of the post discharge assessment tool . October 2017: Commence t he communications to patients General Practitioners for those patients who require GP . March 2018: Overall performance 31.96% further work required to ensure the electronic patient record captures the request and processes to the GP discharge summaries. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 96 Priority Three: Assessment of patients who have been identified on admission as having a complex mental health condition Category: Safe Why: Patients who require specialist care pathway planning post -operatively need to be identified on admissio n. Nationally there is an increase in the number of patients who reach the threshold of needing specialist mental health support. How much: The Trust's aim is to identify those patients with complex mental health conditions on admission and to ensure tha t those who do are referred to the Trust's Safeguarding Lead/Team. By When: March 2018 Who collects the data: Information will be collected via the risk assessment document in EPR, to be completed on admission. Monitoring of Data: The Trust's Busines s Intelligence Team Current Position: April - June 2017: Development of the risk assessment tool July - September 2017: Implementation of the risk assessment document October - December 2017: Start to monitor performance and collect baseline data of those patients who have a complex mental health condition March 2018: Numbers are relatively small performance 100% Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 97 Priority Four: GP referral for patients who have been identified as frail and needing further GP support following OT assessment as an inpat ient. Category: Safe Why: To increase the amount of time that people can be independent, healthy and active in later life. Frailty can be either physical or psychological, or a combination of the two, and can occur as a result of a range of diseases and medical conditions. Frailty affects individuals, families and society as a whole, and can cause reduced quality of life, illhealth and premature mortality and has a direct effect on community resources, because people are less able to do their usual daily activities and often need support and long term care. How much: The Trust's aim is to complete a GP referral for patients identified as frail and needing further GP support following OT assessment as an inpatient, improving on last year's performance against this indicator (60%). By When: March 2018 Who collects the data: Information will be collected by the OTs in the Di scharge Summary in EPR. Monitoring of Data: The Trust's Business Intelligence Team Current Position: A frailty assessment document was developed and implemented in 2016/17; screening takes place on admission. The facility to refer to OT has also alread y been implemented in the Trust's EPR. April - June 2017: Continue to monitor the number and % of frailty assessments taking place collect baseline data of those patients determined as frail. Further development of the OT referral functionality and OT ass essment documentation / Discharge Summary . March 2018: Performance via electronic health record 100% Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 98 Part 2.2 Statements of assurance from the Board Participation in clinical audits During 2017/18, 12 national clinical audits and one national confidential enquiry covered relevant health services that Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital provides. During that period, Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital participated in 100% national clinical audits and 100% national confidential enquiries of the national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries which it was eligible to participate in. The national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries that Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital were eligible to participate in during 2017/18 are as follows in Table 1. The national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries that Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital participated in during 2017/18 are as follows in Table 1.

National Audit of Cardiac Rhythm Management National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) Peri -op Diabetes Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 102 Cancer Lung Cancer (National Lung Cancer Audit) Lung cancer clinical outcomes publication 2017 (for the 2015 audit period) Published November 2017 In 2015 LHCH carried out the largest number of lung cancer operations in England when compared to the other thoracic surgical hospitals. The outcomes of 30 -day and 90 -day mortality and length of stay in hospital for the patients w ere almost exactly the same as the mean for the whole country. Resection rates for the MDTs we serve are amongst the highest. This may be one of the reasons that the patients who had surgery at LHCH in 2015 have one of the lowest 1 -year survivals at 82.3% (mean for England = 87.9%), which has led to LHCH receiving an alert from HQIP and the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery (SCTS) on this particular outcome 1-year survival after surgery is a new outcome and has not been studied previously by the National Lung Cancer Audit. Nevertheless it is important for patients and lung cancer teams. It may be that LHCH surgeons are operating on older, frailer patients with more advanced cancers then the rest of the country, despite the risk stratification model aiming to correct for these factors. In the absence of an inferior survival at 30 and 90 days, the 1 -year figure is unlikely to relate to the quality of care the patients receive specifically at LHCH. It may be that the secondary care service patients receive aft er their surgery needs to improve. It is certainly an outcome that is the responsibility of all lung cancer team and not just the tertiary service provided by LHCH. Actions 1. Review the data for accuracy of the deaths at 1 -year (already initiated by S Wooll ey, thoracic data lead for LHCH) 2. Liaise with the Merseyside and Cheshire Lung Cancer Network over the care of patients during their first year after surgery, in particular the causes of their deaths (already initiated) 3. R D Page to work with the SCTS and HQ IP over improving the usefulness of the Lung Cancer Clinical Outcomes Project (on -going) National Lung Cancer Audit annual report 2017 (for the audit period 2016) Published January 2018 Good areas of performance identified. Two areas for exploration / case note review in relation to treatment rates identified. Will need collaboration with surgical & oncology colleagues. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 103 Heart National Audit of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (BCIS) (data period Jan 2015 - December 2015) published September 2017 LHCH continues to provide a very high quality PPCI and ACS service to the region. Our outcomes for both are below the national norm despite high volumes. Good practice includes a streamlined 24/7 door to balloon protocol for STEMI patients, an established programme for prompt transfer of OOHCA with ROSC STEMI patients from local AEDs as well as a current pilot study of direct paramedic transfer for these patients. We have maintained flexible Cath Lab working to accommodate the high volume of ACS and PPCI p atients. We have maintained a day -case programme for ACS cases with 85% radial access. Our clinical audit department is of very high quality with complete data returns for STEMI and improving data completion for nSTEMI patients Gaps in service include so me delays in Call to Balloon times for PPCI - the data show that this delay largely relates to those patients referred from other hospitals. Our own investigation of this delay has revealed that this is largely due to ambulance transfer delays due to press ures on the ambulance service. Weekend ACS lists are fully established with resultant reduction in transfer time. We continue to promote and develop a protocol to enable prompt transfer of v high risk nSTEMI patients along the lines of STEMI patients. We a lso intend to lead a programme to improve the patient pathway from partner hospital to LHCH through collaboration with local cardiologist and AEDs Acute Coronary Syndrome (MINAP) (data period 2015 /16) published July 2017 LHCH continues to provide provide s an excellent PPCI service as demonstrated by our low door to balloon times and high volume activity. Instances where door to balloon times are prolonged generally relate to multiple primaries arriving at once especially during out of hours or when medica l stabilisation of the patient is req uired prior to transfer to the C ath Lab. We have developed a clearer pathway for direct transfer of survivors out of hospital cardiac arrest with STEMI and volumes of such patients are increasing. We are currently pilo ting a programme of direct transfer of NSTEMI patients with OOHCA. Our performance as a centre continues to exceed national outcomes for PPCI. We fall short when it comes to call to balloon delays for transferred and directly admitted patients. For direc t admissions the primary and continuing issue is that of the delay between the call for help and attendance by the ambulance service. Underperformance in transferred patients is exclusively around delayed transfer from local hospitals - delays in summoning an ambulance are a significant issue. We are working with the ambulance service to improve all these areas recognising the tremendous strain on NWAS resources at the present time. Delays in diagnosis remains an important issue in some referral centres - pathways of care for STEMI are variable. We continue to work with Healthy Liverpool partners and STP to improve the single pathway through education and greater 'front door' cardiology team involvement in the process. For NSTEMI, we are working towards a 72 hour target. Weekend ACS lists are established and smooth out patient flow over the whole week and reduce the delays to Cath Lab for patients referred on Thursday/Friday. Day case ACS work is the norm at LHCH which improves patient flow and preserves wa rd bed status. Delays in diagnosis and from Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 104 diagnosis to referral at referring centres are the main reasons for failure to achieve the 72 hour target. Via STP there is an ambition to improve this with greater involvement of senior cardiologists at referrin g hospitals and an agreed single pathway of care to improve access to LHCH. We also are developing a direct NSTEMI pathway for high risk cases. We have identified some data entry discrepancies locally which go some way to explaining previous relatively lo w DTB times - with correct data entry our DTB time is approaching 98%. National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit Consultant outcomes published for data period 01/04/2013 - 31/03/2016 Consultant outcomes publication shows the number and type of heart operatio ns each consultant and hospital is performing, average patient risk profiles and risk adjusted in - hospital survival rates. All LHCH cardiac surgeons are performing within the 'expected' range - this means that there are no outliers and cause for concern a bout their practice. Results are searchable by using an interactive map to search for a centre or by consultant name and are available on the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgery (SCTS) website. A link is also available through My NHS - NHS choices website. National Heart Failure Audit (2015 -16 data period) Published August 2017 This report is only partially representative of the service we provide to the Heart Failure (HF) patients as a Tertiary Care Hospital. It does not reflect on the large number of patie nts admitted as day case following cardiac device implant every day that also benefit from the service offered by the HF team. Trust figures reveal continued high performance with adherence to prescribing medications, with percentages significantly above national average . This is achieved as a Tertiary Care Hospital representative of the access patients have to cardiologist and heart failure review during admission. The Trust's 30 day mortality figures (post discharge) are within accepted figures. The Tr ust's in-hospital mortality figures have risen above national figures consistent with similar findings reported 2014 /15. These figures are above national average , and as a Tru st we continue to learn from robust and consistent mortality review s of all pati ents. As a Tertiary Care Hospital, the Trust's inpatient group does include direct admission following Myocardial Infarct (MI) and patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery End of life care is more standardised particularly for patients with implan table devices. Patients are offered clinical review to discuss potential deactivation of an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), and ICD deactivation document is now part of electronic records for better documentation of the process. Pathways are in place for use of new HF medication Sacubitril / Valsartan as per European Society of Cardiology ESC and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 105 recommendations. This has been ratified at D rugs & Therapeutics Committee and is being incorpo rated into the local trust wide HF guidelines. The number of patients being referred to Heart Failure Teams on discharge has seen a reduction from previous figures 2014 /15, but remains in line with national average. The Trust has addressed this by recruit ing an additional WTE 1.0 Band 7 Heart Failure Nurse appointed 3.4.2018. There is also planning for integrated with the Knowsley Cardiovascular Service. National Congenital Heart Disease (2013 -16 data period) Published March 2018 The report summarises all paediatric and congenital heart surgery, electrophysiology and transcatheter procedures undertaken in the UK. Adult patients undergoing CHD procedures are discussed at Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) meetings. With the implementation of the new ACHD services at LHCH the Trust will be required to review resources to fully support national clinical audit activity, including local Information Technology support and software that fully accommodates the NCHDA dataset for timely submission of data and verification of data quality. The Trust only undertake s percutaneous ASD closure at LHCH. Data completion and submission is undertaken in a timely fashion by involved clinicians and the dedicated clinical audit team. Clinical support for the audit i s available the Clinical Audit lead physician. There is an internal MDT to discuss all cases and many referrals come to LHCH via the regional ACHD MDT meetings. Going forward all cases to be discussed at ACHD MDT as the Trust takes over the service with d edicated ACHD intervention lists. Procedural outcomes are well within the national norm. National Cardiac Arrest Audit (NCAA) Published September 2017 The NCAA Report covering April 2016 to March 2017 specifically by risk adjusted comparative analyses com pared the LHCH with four other cardiothoracic hospitals in this audit period as opposed to three cardiothoracic hospitals the previous period. The whole report in its entirety was presented to the Resuscitation and Quality Patient / Family Experience Commi ttees for its findings to be reviewed. For the third year running compared with all other hospitals (at least 75% of all acute hospitals in this country now participate in this audit), the LHCH is performing better than the national average in both patie nt survival to hospital discharge by shockable and non - shockable presenting / first documented rhythm. The Resuscitation Training Officer analysed every cardiac arrest where the report had predicted a probability of survival to discharge greater than 50% . Analysis of the majority of these cases showed the present limitations predicting the probable survival to discharge ratio, since it is unable to factor in extremely high -risk co -morbidities into their risk adjusted comparative analysis. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 106 Going forwards for the next NCAA annual report: Each NCAA quarterly report is closely analysed by the Resuscitation Committee and the annual NCAA report will be presented to the Resuscitation and Quality Patient / Family Experience Committees with an accompanying presen tation of the salient points. This will include a detailed investigation of all suggested unexpected non - survivors, so that any areas of concern can be highlighted and measures for improvement initiated. Adult critical care (ICNARC) quarterly quality repo rt for specialist cardiothoracic critical care units The latest report from ICNARC shows the unit has performed well in comparison with other trusts in most of the categories analysed. In the categories where the Trust has performed less-well, performance is being monitored and measures will be put in place if deemed necessary. National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Audit: Pulmonary Rehabilitation : Beyond Breathing Better (Published December 2017) Knowsley Service In comparison to other se rvices in England and Wales, the Knowsley CRS team continues to perform well. Colleagues within the service and the area utilise the service effectively and this is reflected in the number of referrals received (635 - 2015 -16) which is double the national a verage and continues to increase year on year. The service constantly strives to improve and change in order to continue to provide a high quality service. At present the team are involved in a project using the Patient Activation Measure and early data s uggests a positive improvement in PAM scores following the Pulmonary Rehabilitation course which provides data to reinforce the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing the activation of patients. This year the Team ha s also been involved in workin g more closely with Cardiac Rehab colleagues in order to improve quality and work more collaboratively. Going forward the Trust intend s to continue to improve quality and increase involvement in research, particularly around post exacerbation PR. Nation al Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Audit: Pulmonary Rehabilitation : Beyond breathing better (Published December 2017) Liverpool Service The National audit demonstrates that the Liverpool Pulmonary Rehabilitation service is providing a service in line with national standards. Areas to consider for development are as follows: Liverpool patients have not met the national average with MRC scores at discharge assessment. This has been addressed through the provision of a home education Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 107 pack, augmen ted reality cards and encouragement to access the breathe programme website so that patients are equipped with a range of information to help them self - manage their condition. Exploration of local leisure centres/gyms for the pulmonary rehabilitation comm unity classes rather than community centres, church halls and health centres To consider using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) & Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) 40% rather than the LINQ6 for measuring outcomes To address the issue of non -compliance with discharge assessment, a tailored breathe prescription has been introduced. Additional assessment slots and increased telephone calls have also commenced to improve post assessment outcomes The discrepancy with MCID can be explained by audited patient s with higher levels of deprivation and MRC scores of 5 The Trust has exceeded the national standards in relation to waiting times for assessment and for starting the programme. National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion programme: Audit of Patient Blood Management in Scheduled Surgery Re -audit Sept 2016 (Published Oct 2017) The 2015 audit of Patient Blood Management (PBM) in Elective surgery demonstrated that there was considerable variation in practice across the country and highlighted areas for improvement. In addition, since the 2015 audit, further guidance on PBM has been published in the form of the NICE Clinical Guidelines and Quality Standards. This paper reports on the findings of the National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion 2016 R epeat Audit of Patient Blood Management in Adults undergoing elective, scheduled surgery at LHCH. A gap analysis was completed on the report recommendations to identify areas for improvement and to ensure LHCH are delivering care based upon best practic e recommendations from this National comparative audit of blood transfusion 2016. Overall, there has been an improvement in PBM practice since 2015. The recommendations from this report were discussed, reviewed and will be monitored by the Hospital Trans fusion Team. Sentinel stroke (SSNAP) Post -acute annual audit report (published November 2017) In addition to the above report, a Sentinel stroke (SSNAP) Annual CCG Stroke Dashboard - Knowsley CCG is published each year. Actions Number of Early Supporte d Discharge (ESD) patients in Knowsley has increased each year - currently 61.5% for 16 -17. Previously was 54.2% for 15 -16 and 51.6% for 14-15. National level is currently 35%. Plan to continue to offer ESD input to all Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 108 patients who are appropriate and to continue to input audit data for Sentinel stroke audit (SSNAP). Team to transfer over to electronic patient records - EMIS system. New physiotherapist to start in team April 2018 to fill current vacancy UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry annual report (Publishe d August 2017) In the main measures of CF clinic performance (lung function and nutrition) the Trust is above the national average and frequently in the top centile, suggesting that the care offer ed is very good. The Trust has less than average use of mu colytic therapies (rhDnase and hypertonic saline), but these parameters are not evidence -based and are historical - given that LHCH patients are doing well, the Trust has no plans to increase the use of these therapies. The Trust's chronic Pseudomonas aer uginosa infection level is higher than the national average, but such cases are nearly all inherited from the paediatric sector (who seem to have very high levels compared to other paediatric units) and what really matters are new infections (this would be a better measure) - the Trust has very few of these. In summary this audit did not highlight any gaps in the LHCH service that need to be correct ed. The Trust perform s well and ha s a good national reputation. The rep orts of 13 local clinical audits were reviewed by the pro vider in 2017/18 and Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital intends to take the fo llowing actions to improve the quality of healthcare provided: Below are some e xamples of improvement work having audited local practice. WHO audit Month ly audit monitoring Monitored monthly and shows excellent comp liance against the standards. Consent Audit March 2017 Listed below are the areas that needed to be improved as part of the consent audit action plan: Policy should be updated to reflect the M ontgomery law and changes to the procedure specific consent forms. Documenting every time that the green slip has been accepted or not by the patient. Then for those that accept, ensuring the green slip is detached. Consent should take place prior to the d ay of the procedure. All patients have consent reconfirmed on the day of the procedure (Cardiology). All patients should receive an appropriate patient information booklet prior to procedure. VTE audit March 2018 Teaching about NICE guidelines on risk assessment and Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 109 VTE Prophylaxis for the Medicine Division. Change VTE assessment tool on EPR as not adequate for surgical patients. Reassess patients 24 hours after admission. Re-audit in six months' time. Valve verification audit Quarterly Positive perf ormance against the policy. Checking valve in line with the policy prior to the opening of the valve. Learning from the never event action plan. Fasting audit Quarterly Improved patient experience with a tighter policy on fasting. Revised policy to re flect the above. Compliance in surgery positive against the new policy. One area for improvement is changing the fasting instructions for patients when they are moved in position on the operating list. Infection prevention audit programme Audit Improv ement work planned for 2018 (insert statement) Surgical Site Infection Prevention A number of audits have been performed by a multi -disciplinary group for the prevention of surgical site infection. These included; prophylaxis administration, dressing cha nges, pre -op screening and pre -op preparation. Action plans were developed by the Surgical Site Group to address the issues raised. Infection Prevention Standard Precautions Infection prevention audits have been undertaken across the Trust in conjunction with ward/departmental staff. These audits cover environmental cleanliness, sharps disposal, waste disposal and equipment cleanliness. Each area achieved above the overall target score but action plans were produced to rectify and issues identified Phar macy audit programme Audit Improvement work planned for 2018 Antibiotic prescribing audit Promote adherence to the Antimicrobial Policy (Ensure prescribers can access the policy via a quick link and provide a quick reference card to attach to lanyards) Review of cultures (Separate audit to review if positive cultures are acted on and antibiotic therapy tailored to sensitivities) Training (Review of antimicrobial training at induction and for policy updates or changes) Audit on the prescribing, preparatio n, measurement and administration of medicines via enteral To revise the Enteral Administration of Medicines and Nutritional Feed Policy and include step by step flow sheet on correct ad ministration of medicines via feeding tube.

It provides the opportunity to generate new knowledge about new treatments or models of care, which truly deliver the quality improvements anticipated. The Trust's engagement with clinical research demonstrates its commitment to testing and offering the latest medical treatments and techniques. It is well documented that r esearch active NHS t rusts tend to have better patient outcomes and benefit from the competitive advantage gained through improved knowledge management and in particular, the ability to use and generate research knowledge (NHS Confederation, 2010). The improvement in patient health outcomes at LHCH demonstrates that a commitment to clinical research leads to better treatments for patients. As a specialist provider, LHCH undertakes the more complex clinical research trials, drawing from a much smaller group of patients compared to secondary care providers when offering participation in trials to our p atients. The total number of patients receiving relevant health services provided or sub -contracted by Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital between 1st April 2017 - 28th February 2018 that were recruited during this period to participate in clinical resear ch approved by a research ethics committee was 1004. During 2017/18 Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital was involved in actively recruiting to 40 clinical research studies across the cardiovascular and respiratory specialties, of which 7 clinical research studies are in the cancer speciality, 19 clinical research studies are in the cardiology specialty 3 clinical research studies are in the surgery / critical care specialty, 9 clinical research studies are in the respiratory specialty (7 being conducted wi th patients who have a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis), 1 clinical research studies is looking at quality of life, and 1 study has targeted health individuals. This list also includes the ongoing support from the Trust for NHS Transformation across the Nort h West Coast in delivering the 100,000 Genomes Project, by recruiting patients with a new diagnosis of lung cancer and also patients with one of several rare cardiac diseases. The Trust has also entered into exciting new research collaboration with McMast er University in Canada. The Trust has already opened the Vision Cardiac clinical research trial and aim s to open an innovative study later in 2018 which is looking at remote monitoring of vital signs for post -operative cardiac surgery patients both in the ward setting as well as following the patient home for 30days. This will be the first study of its kind and has the ability to radically transform care. The following are some examples of the high quality research taking place at the Trust: VISION CARDI AC One of the aims of this study is to determine the incidence of cardiovascular events in the 30 days post -operative period. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 112 RIPCORD 2 The purpose of the study is to compare routine pressure wire assessment with conventional angiography in the management of patients with coronary artery disease. VIOLET The purpose of this study is to determine whether open lung cancer surgery or a form of keyhole surgery called VATS (Video -Assisted Thorascopic Surgery) offers the best treatment and post -operative recove ry for known or suspected lung cancer. Vertex Studies The Trust's collaboration with Vertex in the delivery of high quality clinical research for patients with Cystic Fibrosis continues. All CF patients are invited to participate in clinical research. The SURE Group SURE stands for Service Users Research Endeavour, and is a very well established patient group who support the research governance process within the Trust. The group is tasked with reviewing Consent Forms and Patient Information Sheets fo r every individual clinical research study conducted at the Trust. Feedback is then given to the Sponsor of the trial and a Local Briefing Paper is created by the Principal Investigator to enhance the patient's understanding of the trial. This group prov ides a layer of assurance that the relevant trial documentation is fit for purpose. Innovation at LHCH Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital has been developing innovative ways to imp rove the quality of patient s' treatment and experience in 2017/18. The Trust has 12 specific innovations that it has been invol ved in scoping during 2017/18. One example is the development of an Arterial Connector. This is currently in the evaluation phase . The Trust's collaboration with Trustech is very positive. The Trust launched the Innovation Factor this year and is encouraging staff to think up new ideas to submit to Trustech, who provide support throughout the application submission process and beyond. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 113 Goals agreed with commissioners In 2017/18, the Trust implem ented the following CQUIN schemes as directed by the local and specialised commissioning contracts with commissioners: National schemes : Staff Health & Wellbeing Sepsis and Anti -microbial resistance Advice & Guidance E-referrals Specialised Commissioning : Clinical Utilisation Review Patient activation for patients with Long Term Conditions Medicine optimisation Device optimisation Adult critical care timely discharge Further details are available upon request from Dr Mark Jackson, Director of Research & Innovation (e -mail mark.jackson@lhch.nhs.uk or telephone 0151 600 1332). What others say about the provider Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital is required to register with the Care Quality Commission and its current registration status is 'registered wi thout condition'. The Care Quality Commission has not taken enforcement action against Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital during 201 7/18 Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital has not participated in any special reviews or investigations by the Care Quality Commission during the reporting period 201 7/18. The Trust is rated as 'Outstanding' by the Care Quality Commission . Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 114 Data quality NHS Numb er and General Medical Practice Code Validity Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital submitted records during 2016/17 to the Secondary Uses s ervice for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics, which are included in the latest published data. The percentage of records in the published data which included the patients can be seen in the ta ble below: For admitted p atient care For outpatient care Valid NHS number was: 99.9% 99.9% Note: Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital does not have an accident and eme rgency department, so A&E indicators do not apply. Information Governance Assessment Report Attainment Levels Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital's Information Governance Toolkit assessme nt for 2016/17 was with an o verall score of 75% 'green-satisfactory' achieving level 2 or above for all requirements. The Trust also received independent assurance from the Mersey Internal Audit Agency in March 2017 o btaining a 's ignificant' ass urance opinion. *NB - the above is subject to approval of Digital Healthcare Committee with the final submission based on com pletion of outstanding actions (perceived all to be completed by submission). Clinical Coding Error Rate Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital has not been subject to a Payment by Results clinical coding audit during 201 7/18. The last Payment by Results clinical coding audit undertaken for the Trust in 201 4/15 n oted that the Trust continues to maintain its high level of coding accuracy with the fo llowing error rates identified: The error rates reported in the latest published audit for diagnoses and treatment coding (clinical coding) were: Primary diagnoses incorrect - 2.0% Secondary diagnoses incorrect - 0.5% Primary proced ures incorrect - 0.5% Secondary procedures incorrect - 0.9% Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 115 As part of Information Governance r equirements, the Trust has undertaken a c linical coding audit in 2016/ 17, which was carried out by external auditors th at found the following error rates: Primary diagnoses incorrect - 0% Secondary diagnoses incorrect - 1.45% Primary proced ures incorrect - 0% Secondary procedures incorrect - 1.42% Results should not be extrapolated further than the actual sample audited. Data Quality Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital will be t aking the following actions to impro ve data quality: Continuation of delivering the Trust's data quality strategy that is aimed at impro ving the collection, storage, analysis, reporting and validation of information. Pivotal to this strategy is the a doption of the six dimensions of data quality which is already in place. Producing data that is fit for purpose should be an integral part of an organisation's operational performance management and governance ar rangements. As such, this new process se eks to pro vide m ore rigor to deriving the assurances on data quality the Trust requires, focused on non- financial data. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 116 Figures You Can Trust; A Briefing on Data Quality in the NHS (Audit Commission, 2009) presents the s ix dimensions of data qua lity. The Trust's Business Intelligence Committee will oversee the continued application of the six dimensions of data quality, and ensure it is applied to the Trust's Strategic Obj ectives and und erlying Dashboards compris ing of Clinical Quality, Performance and Workforce indicators. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 117 Continuation of the Trust's Business Intelligence Committee, which meets on a mo nthly basis, to identify and discuss p otential data quality issues which need to be addressed and actioned acc ordingly. The Committee tackles issues identified through external (e.g. SUS Data Quality Dashboard and the Care Qu ality Commissions Intelligent Monitoring Report) and internal sources (e.g. Indicator reviews using the six dimensions of data quality approach ). The Committee is to be su pported by a S ystems Data Quality Group which oversees key working groups des igned to tackle key data quality issues. For 2017/18 new emphasis is being placed on the Systems Data Quality Group and key areas of focus have been identified to improve the quality of data captured across the Trust. These include the following: Ensuring SOPs are embedded regarding syst em data collection and that these are adhered to. Improving Patient Demographics data held in PAS, specifically patient address, GP address, next of kin, ethnicity, and mobile numbers. Improving detail on PAS regarding Consultant Responsible . Improving de tail on PAS regarding patient ward movements . Addressing inefficient processes such as recording TCIs on PAS for non -electives which was introduced as a work around for functionality in EPR . Addressing the use of EPRs Problem List . Discuss and action 18 -weeks and commissioner related queries; would involve co - opting 18 -week validators and members of Finance when needed. Other performance issues such as cancer waiting times may also be discussed at this forum with relevant co -opting of staff members . General forum for raising other data quality issues related to PAS, EPR, and RIS. Other systems will be adopted into the group in the future . Discuss and action relevant Information Standard Notices (ISNs) as delegated by the Business Intelligence Committee . A new Data Quality Team has also been established and will work alongside the Systems Data Quality Group, Systems Staff and Operational Staff to deliver improvements. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 118 Learning from Deaths Note 1: During 2017/18, 192 LHCH patients died. This compri sed the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: 58 in the first quarter 41 in the second quarter 51 in the third quarter 42 in the fourth quarter. Note 2: By 28/02/2018 , 132 case record reviews and 44 investi gations have been carried out in relation to the 192 deaths included in Note 1 . In 44 cases a death was subjected to both a case record review and an investigation. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record review or an investigation wa s carried out was: 58 in the first quarter 41 in the second quarter 48 in the third quarter 29 in the fourth quarter. Note 3: 6 representing 3.1% of the patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. In relation to each quarter, this consisted of: 3 represent ing 5.2% for the first quarter 0 represen ting 0% for the second quarter 3 represent ing 5.9% for the third quarter 0 representing 0% for the fourth qu arter These numbers have been estimated using the Trust's Mortality Review Policy, based upon national guidance on learning from deaths issued by the National Quality Board (March 2017) and implementation of the structured judgement review methodology iss ued by the Royal College of Physicians (2016). Note 4: A summary of learning from cas e reviews in relation to Note 3. LHCH has a well -established review process for all deaths which dates back to 2011. The mortality review process has been improved and brought up to date with national guidance issued in January 2016. A multidisciplinary Mortality Review Group (MRG) meets at least monthly and selects those reviews which suggest areas for improvement that should be shared with the rest of the organisation . These are then sent for presentation at audit days in surgery and cardiology, with the principle and reviewing consultant discussing the case. Nursing review of cases is carried out in parallel to ensure a multidisciplinary approach is considered. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 119 The Chair of the MRG summarises the key learning points every 3 months for the Directorates and presents an annual review to the Trust's Quality and patient experience committee. Note 5: Summary of actions taken from those reviews as per Note 4. Development and implementation of a new policy governing the assistance of Proctors for new technology/ procedures agreed within the Trust. Divisional accountability and responsibility for the monitoring of the policy Re-enforcing individual responsibility to initia te HALT to prevent potential harm Changes to the emergency communication for medical assistance -direct dialog to Consultant Stronger communication links between external Trusts regarding timing of transfers of patients to LHCH Development of rapid surgic al pathway for high risk patients to transfer into LHCH from external Trusts Note 6: Impact assessment of actions described in item Note 4 during the reporting period. The proctor policy has been used twice (thoracic and cardiac robotic surgery) with much stronger governance around the process. Bleep filtering and escalation are under further review by the division of medicine. Impact not yet fully assessed. Most of the other actions have not yet been formally evaluated as the changes/actions are recen t. Note 7: Number of investigations completed after 01/04/2017 . 16 case record reviews and 16 investigations completed after 01/04/2017 which related to deaths which took place before the start of the reporting period. Note 8: Percentage of patient deat hs before the reporting period . 1 representing (1/16) 6.25% of the patient deaths before the reporting period, are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient Note 9: Percentage of patient deaths d uring the previous reporting period . 7 representing 7/(192+16) 3.4% of the patient deaths during 2016/17 are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Annual Report and Accounts 2017 /18 Page | 120 Part 2.3 Reporting against Core Indicat ors Hospital-Level Mort ality Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: Specialist acute trusts do not calculate their mortality rates using the summary hospital -level mortality indicator (SHMI ); instead, Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital uses information provided by Dr Foster Intelligence in the form of Hospital Standardised Mortality ratios that is updated each month as part of its performance management arrangements and reported to the Trust 's Quality Committee. To achieve statistical significance using confidence intervals: To be high, a hospital must have HSMR and the lower confidence interval above 100. A hospital above 100 but with lower confidence interval below 100 is classed as 'withi n the expected range'. Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital intends to take the following actions to continue to improve this rate and so the quality of its services by: Continuing to support the broadened remit of the mortality review group and ensuring a ll deaths in the hospital are subject to a mortality review screening process and any lessons learnt shared accordingly.

This commentary relates to the contents of a draft Quality Account document that was made available to Healthwatch prior to its publication, and has also been informed by our engagement with the Trust. Healthwatch Liverpool receives feedback about the Trust through our information and signposting service, and via independent web -based resources such as www.careopinion.org.uk . Hea lthwatch takes both patient feedback and the Trust's responses to this into account when considering the quality of the hospital's services. Healthwatch Liverpool held a Listening Event at the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital in June 2017. We spoke to 6 3 patients and visitors to find out what was good about the services, and what improvements they thought could be made. Feedback was mostly very positive, particularly about the care and treatment received and about staff attitudes. Healthwatch Liverpool is assured that this Quality Account provides an informative overview of the quality of services pr ovided by the Trust during 2017/ 18. The Trust should be congratulated on being rated one of the top hospitals for overall patient experience in the National Inpatient Survey once again in the past year. We were also pleased to note that the Trust continues to introduce pioneering treatments such as robotic surgery, which ensures that more patients can be treated. Details about the Trust's performance show th at overall p rogress against the 2017 /18 priorities has been good; for example, we were pleased to see that the focus on delirium has led to the introduction of patient screening before operations. Additionally, the priorities focusing on patients who are f rail or have a complex mental health condition should support those patients to have a better experience of care both while in hospital and after discharge. The report identifies where the hospital can try to make further improvements to patient outcomes by working with other providers of care, for example the ambulance service. Also, although readmission rates are not high, the Trust did not meet its target and is taking appropriate steps to address this. We welcome the use of a 'teach back' approach, a sking patients to repeat what they have been told about taking their medication to ensure that they have understood the information; a simple way to prevent potential harm to patients.We also welcome that the priorities chosen for 2018 /19 have a strong foc us on patient and carer experience. The 365 'shadows' of inpatients at the Trust is an innovative way to highlight where good practice exists and where potential improvements could be made, and we will be very interested to learn more about any outcomes fr om this work. Finally, the Trust serves and employs people from diverse communities, and we would like to see some information about the work the Trust carries out to ensure Equality and Diversity considerations are taken into account to be included in t he report. Healthwatch Liverpool is looking forward to ongoing regular engagement with the Trust in order to be able to monitor the progress of both quality and equality considerations.
