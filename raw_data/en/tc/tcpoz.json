Automatic Transport The esophagus is a short,muscular tube in whichinvoluntary, wavelike con-tractions and relaxationspropel food from the mouthto the stomach.Storage and Processing The stomach acts as a temporary storage and processingfacility before emptying its contents into the small intestine.Early stages of digestion take place in the stomach wherepepsin and lipase aid in digesting protein and fat. Treatment Facilities In the small intestine, enzymes break down large, complex food moleculesinto simpler units that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The pan-creas is an organ that does double duty, secreting digestive enzymes intothe gut and hormones, including insulin and glucogon, into the blood.Important for fat metabolism, the liver produces bile and partially stores itin the gall bladder between meals.End of the Line The primary function of the largeintestine is to absorb electrolytesand water. Also, this is wheremicrobes ferment nutrients thathave so far escaped digestionand absorption. COMMITTEE ON NUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS OF DOGS AND CATS DONALD C.

Does the food I'm providing meet my dog's nutritional needs? As our knowledge of the relationship between diet andhealth continues to advance and as the range of foods available for dogs con-tinues to expand, it's more important than ever to base feeding choices ongood information. The information in this pamphlet is based on Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats , a technical report issued by the National Research Council as part of its Animal Nutrition Series. The Food and Drug Administration relies on information in the report to regulate and ensure the safety of pet foods. Otherreports in the series address the nutritional needs of horses, dairy cattle, beefcattle, nonhuman primates, swine, and small ruminants. Scientists who studythe nutritional needs of animals use the Animal Nutrition Series to guidefuture research. The series is also used by animal owners, caretakers, andveterinarians to develop specialized diets for individual animals. Links toreports in the series can be found at http://dels.nas.edu/banr .37491_Dog_P01_16 07/24/06 4:47 PM Page 12Dogs need several different kinds of nutrients to survive: amino acids from proteins, fatty acids and carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals,and water . The tables in this pamphlet provide recommended daily allowances for dietary nutrients based on the minimum amountrequired to maintain good health in normal dogs. Your dog's unique nutritional requirements will depend on its size, its breed, and its stage in life,among other factors. A better understanding of how dogs use the various nutri-ents in food and how much of them they need can help you choose a healthierdiet for your pet. PROTEINS AND AMINO ACIDS Dogs cannot survive without protein in their diets. Dietary protein contains 10 specific amino acids that dogs cannot make on their own. Known as essen- tial amino acids, they provide the building blocks for many important bio- logically active compounds and proteins. In addition, they donate the carbon chains needed to make glucose for energy. High-quality pro- teins have a good balance of all of the essential amino acids. Studies show that dogs can tell when their food lacks a single amino acid and will avoid such a meal. Dogs are known to selectively choose foods that are high in protein. Whether this is simply a matter of taste or a com- plex response to their biological needs for all 10 essential amino acids is not known. However, dogs can survive on a vegetarian diet as long as it contains sufficient protein and is supplemented with vitamin D. F A TS AND F A TTYACIDS Dietary fats, mainly derived from animal fats and the seed oils of various plants, provide the most concentrated source of energy in the diet. They supply essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized in the body and serve as carriers for important fat-soluble vitamins. Fatty acids play a role in cell structure and function. Food fats tend to enhance the taste and texture of the dog's food as well. Essential fatty acids are necessary to keep your dog's skin and coat healthy. Puppies fed ultralow-fat diets develop dry, coarse hair and skin lesions that become increasingly vulnerable to infections. Deficiencies in the so-called \"omega-3\" family of essential fatty acids may be associated with vision problems and impaired learning ability. Another family of essentialfatty acids called \"omega-6\" has been shown to have important physiologiceffects in the body. 37491_Dog_P01_16 07/24/06 4:47 PM Page 23ENERGY NEEDS Dogs need a certain amount of energy to sustain the normal activities of their dailylives. Growth, pregnancy, lactation, and exercise all increase these normal energyrequirements. Generally measured in terms of calories, energy comes from threemajor dietary components: carbohydrates, protein, and fats. Omnivorous animals get some of their energy from carbohydrates, which includesugars, starches, and dietary fibers. The major sources of carbohydrates in com-mercial dog foods are cereals, legumes, and other plant foodstuffs. So-calledabsorbable carbohydrates, including glucose and fructose, can be directly absorbedand do not need to be digested by enzymes. Digestible carbohydrates are read-ily broken down by intestinal tract enzymes. Fermentable carbohydrates includecertain starches and dietary fibers that pass undigested through the small intes-tine to the colon, where they are fermented by microbes into short-chain fattyacids and gases. Some studies suggest that fermentable fibers may aid in theregulation of blood glucose concentrations and enhance immune function.Nonfermentable fibers, such as cellulose and wheat bran, contribute little interms of energy or nutrition and are primarily used to decrease caloric intake ofthe overweight animal.DAILY RECOMMENDED ALLOW ANCES FOR PROTEIN AND F A TS PUPPIES ADUL T DOGS PREG NANT /NURSING DOGS (Weighing 12 lb, 33 lb at maturity) (Weighing 33 lb) (Weighing 33 lb with 6 puppies) Crude Protein 56 g 25 g 69 g /158 gTotal Fat 21 g 14 g 29 g/67 g TIDBITScientific research has shown that an adult dog's daily diet can contain up to50% carbohydrates by weight, including 2.5-4.5% from fiber. A minimum ofapproximately 5.5% of the diet should come from fats and 10% from protein.Determining Grams of Essential Nutrients from Petfood LabelsPetfood labels do not generally list amounts of essential nutrients in grams. However, all petfood labels must state guarantees for the minimum percentages of crude* protein and crudefat, and the maximum percentages of crude fiber and moisture. To convert these percentagesto grams, simply multiply the crude percentages times the weight of your dog's daily portion.For example, if you feed your dog a 1-lb (454-gram) can of food per day, and the food contains8% crude protein, the grams of protein would be 0.08 454 = 36 grams. *\"Crude\" refers to the specific method of testing the product, not to the quality of the nutrient itself. 37491_Dog_P01_16x1 07/26/06 5:31 PM Page 34TYPE OF DOG PUPPIES (10 lb puppy growing to 33 lb at maturity) INACTIVE DOGS \u2014dogs with little stimu- lus or opportunity to exercise.

The term Calorie that is used on food nutrition labels is really a \"food calorie\" sometimes called a \"large calorie.\" It is equivalent to 1,000 calories (or 1 kilocalorie) as calories are defined scientifically (the amount of energy needed to warm 1 gram of water 1\u00b0C). In Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats , energy needs are expressed in terms of kilocalories, which are equivalent to Calories in this document. Number of Puppies 37491_Dog_P01_16 07/24/06 4:47 PM Page 45ENERGY NEEDS OF GROWING PUPPIES The growing puppy starts out needing about twice asmany calories per pound of body weight as an adultdog of the same breed. Owners should startfeeding puppies food at approximately 4 weeksafter birth, because mother's milk is no longersufficient. Food is best offered to puppies inmultiple, well-spaced meals. ENERGY NEEDS OF OLDER DOGS Because of decreased physical activityand slowed metabolism, older dogsneed 20% fewer total calories than domiddle-aged adult dogs. As dogs age,they tend to become overweight. Itmay take obese dogs longer for theirblood glucose concentrations to returnto normal. This disrupted carbohydratemetabolism can lead to diabetes. ENERGY NEEDS OF LACT A TING DOGS New mothers generally suckle their puppiesfor at least 6 weeks. The mother's need forcalories increase with the number of puppies andthe week of lactation, up to 4 weeks. Giant breeds(like Great Danes) have proportionately smaller diges-tive tracts and may not be able to eat enough to sustainthemselves during lactation. Owners of such dogs may needto start feeding puppies supplemental food at an early age. TIDBITSevere illness or trauma may increase a dog's energy needs. Whenever yourdog becomes ill, please consult with your veterinarian or dog nutritionist foryour dog's changed nutritional needs.37491_Dog_P01_16 07/24/06 4:47 PM Page 5VIT AMINS Vitamins are organic compounds that take part in awide range of metabolic activities. Dogs requirevitamins in their food, albeit at low concentrations.First noticed in dogs some 75 years ago, vitamindeficiencies can cause a variety of health prob-lems. Clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency, one ofthe first deficiencies studied in dogs, include motorand vision impairment, skin lesions, respiratory ail-ments, and increased susceptibility to infections.Dogs fed diets lacking vitamin E show signs of skele-tal muscle breakdown, reproductive failure, and retinaldegeneration. Thiamin deficiency can lead to brainlesions and other neurological abnormalities if the depri-vation is sudden and to heart damage and death if it ischronic. Some vitamins, such as vitamin D, are not onlyessential in small doses, but also toxic in excess amounts. 6DAILY RECOMMENDED ALLOW ANCES FOR VIT AMINS FUNCTIONS RECOMMENDED SIGNS OF ALLOW ANCE * DEFICIENCY /EXCESS Vitamin A Vitamin D Vitamin EVision; growth; immunefunction; fetal cellular differentia-tion; transmembrane phosphorous Defense against oxidative damage dehydration;central nervous system depression; joint clotting fac- tors, bone proteins, andother proteins Energy and carbohydrate metabolism; activation of ionchannels in neural tissue Enzyme functions Glucose geneactivation nucleotide metabolism; mitochondrialprotein synthesis Phospholipid cell membrane component0.41 mg 0.56 mg 1.3 mg 0.4 mg 4 mg 4 mg 9 \u00b5g 68\u00b5g 425 mgNo reports of naturally occurring deficiencies in normal dogs Failure to grow, weight loss and neurological abnormalities in pup-pies; damage to the nervous sys-tem and to the heart in adult dogs Anorexia; weight loss; muscular weakness; flaking dermatitis; eye lesions Anorexia and weight loss in pup- pies; convulsions, muscle twitch-ing, and anemia in adult dogs Impairment of motor control andbalance; muscle weakness Anorexia; weight loss; inflamma-tion of the lips, cheeks, and throat;profuse salivation; bloody diarrhea Bloody feces; convulsions Erratic food blood cells; anemia; bone marrowchanges Weight loss; decline in hemoglobin concentration Loss of body weight; fatty liver *Daily needs for an adult dog weighing 33 pounds, consuming 1,000 Calories per day. g = grams; mg = milligrams; \u00b5g = micrograms37491_Dog_P01_16 07/24/06 4:47 PM Page 78DAILY RECOMMEN DED ALLOWANCES FOR MINERALS DAILY SIGNS OF FUNCTION S RECOMME NDED D EFICIENCY/EXCESS A LLOWANCE * Calcium Phosphorus and teeth; blood coagulation; nerve impulse transmis-sion; muscle contraction; cell signaling structure; and function; mineral struc-ture of bones and teeth1 g 0.75 g 150 mgNutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism; significant decreases in bone mineral content, which can result in major skeletal abnormalities Different types of skeletal aberrations, espe - cially in growing puppies of large breeds Reduced weight gain; poor appetite; bowing and swelling of forelimbs in puppies Reduction in weight gain, irritability, and convulsions in puppies; hyperextension of carpal joints and hind-leg paralysis later in lifeMINERALS Twelve minerals in the table are known to be essential nutrients for dogs. Calcium and phosphorus are crucial to strong bones and teeth. Dogs need magnesium, potas - sium, and sodium for nerve impulse transmission, mus - cle contraction, and cell signaling. Many minerals that are present only in minute amounts in the body, including selenium, copper, and molybdenum, act as helpers in a wide variety of enzymatic reactions. Dogs can get too much or too little of a specific mineral in their diets. A deficiency of dietary calcium, for instance, causes a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. Recognized clinically for many years in dogs fed meals consist - ing mainly of meat, this disease results in major bone loss, skeletal abnormalities, and pathological fractures. An excess of calcium, on the other hand, may also cause skeletal abnormalities, especially in growing large-breed puppies. 9200 mg 1 g 300 mg 7.5 mg 1.5 mg 15 mg 1.2 mg 90 \u00b5g 220 \u00b5g *Daily needs for an adult dog weighing 33 pounds, consuming 1,000 Calories per day. g = grams; mg = milligrams; \u00b5g = microgramsSodium Potassium Chlorine Iron Zinc Manganese Selenium IodineAcid-base balance; regulation of osmotic pressure; extracellular across cell membranesSynthesis of blood components; energy metabolism Connective tissue formation; blood healing bone develop- ment; neurological function Defense against oxidative damage; immune response Thyroid hormone synthesis; cell differentiation; growth and development of puppies; regulation of metabolic rateRestlessness; increased heart rate, water intake, and hemoglobin concentration; dry and tacky mucous membranes Poor growth in puppies; paralysis of neck muscles and rear legs and general weakness later in life Reduced weight gain and weakness in puppies Poor growth; pale mucous mem - branes; lethargy; weakness; diarrhea At acute levels, dangerous oxida - tive reactions that lead to gastroin - testinal and other tissue damage Loss of hair pigmentation in puppies; anemia Poor weight gain; vomiting; skin lesions No studies of deficiency in dogs Anorexia; depression; breathing discomfort; coma; muscular degeneration Enlargement of thyroid glands; dry, sparse hair coat; weight gain Excessive tearing, salivation, and nasal discharge; dandruff10UNDER WEIGHT IDEAL OVER WEIGHTUNDER WEIGHT OR OVER WEIGHT? Your dog is not getting enough to eat if you caneasily see its ribs, vertebrae, and pelvic bones, feelno fat on the bones, and possibly notice some lossof muscle mass. If chronically underfed, adult dogsmay experience impaired ability to nurse young andperform work, and increased susceptibility to bac-terial infections and parasites; puppies may bestunted in their growth; adult dogs may developosteoporosis. Your dog is at an ideal weight if you can easily feelits ribs. The waist should be easily observed behindthe ribs when viewed from above. An abdominaltuck is evident when viewed from the side. Your dog is overweight if you cannot feel its ribs,see fat deposits over its back and the base of its tail,discern no waist behind the ribs when viewed fromabove, and see no abdominal tuck in profile.Obesity occurs in one out of four dogs in westernsocieties. Its incidence increases with age and is morecommon in neutered animals. Health risks include dia-betes and osteoarthritis.37491_Dog_P01_16 07/24/06 4:47 PM Page 1011FEEDING PRACTICES Q: Does my dog need to eat meat? A: Because dogs are descended from omnivores, theyare not strict meat eaters. They are remarkably adapt-able to a wide range of ingredients, texture, and form interms of what they will eat. Though many dogs mayprefer animal-based protein, they can thrive on a vege-tarian diet. Regardless of whether the protein comesfrom plant or animal sources, normal adult dogs shouldget at least 10% of their total calories from protein. Olderdogs appear to require somewhat more protein to maintaintheir protein reserves, perhaps as much as 50% more. Q: How much fiber is good for my dog? A: Fiber in the diet is probably good for overall gastrointestinalhealth and may help some dogs keep their weight down. The typicaldiet of normal adult dogs contains between 2.5 and 4.5% fiber. However,the fiber content of some \"diet\" dog foods may be higher. This may allow thedog to feel full without consuming too many calories for effective weight control.Diets high in fiber also may help in the management of hyperglycemia (high bloodsugar), and may improve large intestine function.On the other hand, too much fiber in the diet can decrease the digestibility of otherimportant nutrients and result in loose stools, frequent defecation, and reducedpalatability of the dog food. Wheat bran and barley products are high in fiber.Conversely, dog food ingredients high in starch, including rice and dried potatoes,have less fiber. Q: How often should I feed my dog? A: Dogs eat larger, less frequent meals than do cats. It is fine to feed an adult dogone or two times per day. Puppies, however, need two to three daily meals. Q: How can I help my overweight dog trim down? A: The most obvious answer is to feed your dog smaller amounts on the samefeeding schedule. Some dog owners offer less tasty food or allow less time to eat.Another option is to feed your dog one of the low-calorie dog foods on the market.It's also important to remember to keep your dog from sampling the dog-next-door'sfood and to refrain from giving your dog table scraps. Q: How do heat and exercise affect the amount of water my dog needs? A: Fresh water should be available to your dog at all times to reduce the risk ofbecoming overheated. A dog's need for water increases in keeping with the amountof energy he expends during exercise, and this need may more than double in warmconditions. Ideally, you should actively offer your dog water during exercise. 37491_Dog_P01_16 07/24/06 4:47 PM Page 1112FOOD CHOICES Commercial dog foods come in a variety of forms.The most common types are dry, semimoist, and canned. The moisture content of these foods ranges from 6 to 10 % for dry, 15 to 30% for semimoist, and75% for canned. Most canned food has relativelymore fat and protein and fewer carbohydrates than does dry and semi-moist food, and generally contains much higher lev-els of animal products.Pet food labels must list the percentage of protein, fat, fiber, and water in the food. When reading labels, it is important to remember that what may appear to be a big difference in the amount of a nutri- ent\u2014for example, 8% protein in a canned dog food vs. 27% protein in a dry dog food\u2014reflects the fact that there is more water in the canned food. PET FOOD ADDITIVES Some other substances that might be found in pet foods, which are not required nutrients, are described below: Chondroprotective agents are used by the body to make cartilage and joint tissues. Although, use of chondropro- tective agents may be indicated for selected clinical conditions, widespread inclusion in the diets of healthy popula- tions may not be warranted at this time. Antioxidants work to prevent oxidative damage to nutrients and other compounds in the body and inhibit or quench the formation of free radicals. At this time, data are lacking to make specific recommendations beyond those for the essential vitamins and minerals that are compo- nents of antioxidants.TIDBITExposure to certain flavors andtextures of food early in life canshape strong preferences later on. 37491_Dog_P01_16 07/24/06 4:47 PM Page 1213Herbs and botanicals are used in pet foods either to provide flavor or, more often, to have a medicinal effect on thebody. This is especially true in the case of extracts, wherethe classical nutritive components of the plant may beseparated from the extract in the process. Becausethe intended functions are more pharmacologic ver-sus nutritional in nature, discussion of potentialbenefit is beyond the scope of this publication.Flavors and extracts derived from animal tis- sues such as poultry or fish are considered\"natural\" flavors. A wide variety of flavors canbe derived from other animal and plant mate-rials, including dairy products, eggs, herbs,and spices. Acceptable processing methodsinclude roasting, extraction, and fermentation.Except for artificial smoke and bacon flavors,synthetic substances are rarely used in mostdog and cat foods.Colors are synthetic compounds used to replace or accentuate the inherent color of thefood. Only certified colors approved for use inhuman foods are allowed in pet foods. Iron oxideis a synthetic but noncertified color that can be usedat levels not to exceed 0.25% of the pet food productto give dog and cat food a red, meaty appearance.Titanium dioxide is another common color additive inhuman and pet foods because it can induce a \"brightness\"in foods by complementing other color additives. Its use is limited to 1% of the food by weight. TIDBITPet foods marketed as \"snacks\" are not requiredto have nutritional adequacy labels. 37491_Dog_P01_16 07/24/06 4:48 PM Page 13For more than 80 years, the National Academies has fostered improvedunderstanding of the nutritional needs of pets, wildlife, laboratory-research species, and food-producing animals through its Nutrient Requirements of Domestic Animals series\u2014a series that is considered the\"gold standard\" for animal nutrition in the United States and worldwide.This pamphlet is based on recommendations from the2006 release of Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats .
