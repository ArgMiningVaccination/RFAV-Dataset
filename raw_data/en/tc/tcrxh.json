The concept of detox so common in the social media nowadays and it is a usual topic in health discussions today. Detox is typically the first thought most people have when they decide to make positive, healthy changes in their lives. Additionally, the process of 'detoxing' has come to involve or mean many things from fasting, juice cleanses, various supplements, to strange drink concoctions. What is detox-ing? A simple definition of detoxification is the process by which the human body makes something less toxic. The liver is the main organ that handles detoxification. The human body produces metabolites from cellular metabolism that needs to be processed as well as metabolites from the environmental exposure. The liver is tasked to handle all the metabolites and metabolic by-products that your body has. In addition, your body has several organs of elimination. These include: liver, lungs, kidneys, colon, skin, and vagina (for females). The organs of elimination are avenues where the waste can be eradicated. The liver packages the metabolic by-products to be eliminated by the kidneys and colon. The lungs release CO2, by products of cellular metabolism. Do I need to detox? According to the National Toxicology Program, it is estimated that about 80,000 chemicals are registered for use including personal care products, prescription drugs, household cleaners, and many more. Exposure to environmental toxins is inevitable; with new chemicals being introduced on monthly basis, a comprehensive detox program is needed more than ever before. Also, to make matters worse, these environmental chemicals and toxins interfere and block key liver enzymes, and interfere with the functioning of the vital organs of elimination. This prevents proper detox and elimination leading to storage of the chemicals/toxins in various areas of our bodies. Commonly, toxins that your body is ill-equipped with eliminating will be stored in fat cells, joints, bones, skin, and organs. This type of storage of toxins leads to a variety of symptoms including joint pain, fatigue, memory problems, mental/emotional issues, skin problems to more severe health issues such as Parkinson's, seizures and other neurodegenerative problems. The problem with this type of toxicity is that it is usually leads to non-specific symptoms such as the ones listed above, and typically becomes a subclinical problem that most conventional doctors do not diagnose. This leads to many unsolved cases and years of suffering for many people. Detox is definitely necessary for most people because environmental toxins are so widespread in our environment from our water supply, food supply, air supply to even the coating of receipts from stores. Detox encourages built-up toxins from your own cells' metabolism and from environmental exposure to become eliminated properly. Encouraging detoxification clears the extracellular matrix of unnecessary debris allowing cells to perform in their optimal state leading to proper organ function. Some therapeutic treatments designed for detoxification range from gentle and slow, to direct and aggressive. Unless a patient has an overt toxicity of mercury or lead, I don't typically recommend the strong treatments such as chelation. Chelation is often too aggressive for most people, and often leads to many side effects. Biotherapeutic drainage offers slow but effective elimination of accumulated toxins with functional correction of the organs of elimination. Fasting allows for digestive organ rest, release of toxins stored in fat cells and leads to beneficial physiological changes to improve metabolism. Botanical medicine and specific detox supplements are also beneficial to detoxification.
