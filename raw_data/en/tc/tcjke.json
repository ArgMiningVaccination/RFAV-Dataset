For the uninitiated, crystals (fossilized minerals) are believed to contain several healing properties. From bringing peace to fighting depression, the list seems to be endless.What are crystals? For centuries, crystals, which are beautiful rock formations, have amazed humans. While one might like to use them as a part of the decoration, not many know that all the crystals carry certain vibrations, and can help change the energy index or the Vastu of the house.Crystals for peace of mind: While consulting a Vastu expert might not be an option for everyone, here are the two crystals which can be kept in the house without a second thought.1.Selenite Selenite -- a crystallized form of Gypsum -- is used for good luck and protection of the house and is considered to be one of the must-have crystals in the house. A high vibration stone, interestingly, selenite also energetically purifies and cleanses the air where it is placed. It also calms and soothes the people who come under its energy field by bringing a deep peace and sense of tranquillity. Unlike other crystals, which require regular cleansing with either specially prepared aura sprays, sunlight, or charging through water, selenite is said to cleanse itself on its own. It is an ideal stone to place it in the living room and the bedroom for [good vibrations](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/good-vibrations) . Selenite, however, can be charged under the moonlight and it doesn't have to be a full moon. Also, since selenite is a very soft crystal, so one should avoid using water around it as it can damage the crystal. Another interesting fact about selenite is that it can be used to cleanse the jewellery items and gemstones that we wear of the negative energy that they tend to absorb, by simply placing selenite on them or wrapping the jewellery and stones around it for four to six hours. All the negative and blocked energy will be removed from the jewellery items and stones.2.Black [tourmaline](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tourmaline) Another most sought after stone today by people is black tourmaline. The stone is known to protect people from negative energies of unwanted people entering your house. It is known to create a psychic shield deflecting and dispelling all the unwanted negative energies, entities, or destructive forces entering your premises. But what makes the crystal most loved one today is that it is known to guards against radiation and environmental pollutants. Plus, black tourmaline also neutralizes negative thoughts and turn them into positive ones. One can keep a black tourmaline in the bedroom and even under a pillow as it is known to help with dreams. A few people also put a piece in their cars to provide them with protection while driving. Since it also absorbs electromagnetic frequencies, tourmaline should be placed near electronics and computers. One of the best ways to clean black tourmaline is to soak it in salt water overnight and then wash it with water and let it soak in sunlight once in a month. "}
