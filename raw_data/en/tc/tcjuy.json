Kennedy Jr. have influenced the famous on \"bodily sovereignty.\"", "sitename": "Vanity Fair", "date": "2022-03-03", "cleaned_text": "It was October 2020, in a tented venue in Waynesville, North Carolina. Andrew Wakefield was set to present his documentary 1986: The Act, the latest in his anti-vaccination cinematic oeuvre, to a group of acolytes. This kind of personal appearance has long been the platform of choice for the handsome, charismatic Englishman, who connected the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism in an [infamous, retracted paper](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24Autism-t.html) for the medical journal The Lancet. For years now, parents\u2014mainly mothers\u2014of children with autism and other perceived vaccine injuries have lined up to feel the touch of his hand, share their stories, take a selfie, even though he's been exiled from the medical establishment. On that October night, supermodel Elle Macpherson, whom Wakefield introduced as \"my girlfriend,\" was called on to attest to his wonderfulness. \"We walk down the street together and more people recognize him than me,\" Macpherson told the crowd, her tall, slim frame draped over a director's chair facing Wakefield's. She was going casual, in dark pants and white sneakers, hair tousled over her shoulders. He was in a daring ensemble\u2014an acid-wash jean suit paired with a black turtleneck. She continued, \"I first heard about Andy in 1998. I had just had my first son.... And who would have thought that after reading about this doctor who said there's a problem with the MMR [vaccine], that I'd be sitting here talking to you about movies you've made.\" As with Vaxxed, which drew Robert De Niro into its press orbit, Wakefield tried to establish celebrity cred. The previous May, he'd attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles. \"At that fundraiser was Justin Timberlake and [Jessica Biel](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/jessica-biel-denies-she-s-anti-vaccination-after-lobbying-against-n1017171),\" said Wakefield, in grave, professorial tones. \"Justin Timberlake got up and he said, 'We've got to get behind this film. We've got to do whatever we can to get this film out there.'\" (A source close to Timberlake says he has no affiliation with the film or filmmaker.) And of course, \"Elle was intimately involved in the making of this film. And...I'm enormously grateful.\" Wakefield and Macpherson had met in 2017 at an event called \"Doctors Who Rock,\" a gala in Orlando honoring \"thought leaders and paradigm shifters\" in the trillion-dollar-plus global wellness world. Macpherson, who moved to Miami from London in 2014, had become successful with her company WelleCo, which offers powdered shakes that \"nourish on a cellular level.\" The 45 ingredients in \"The Super Elixir,\" she says, keep her skin glowing and her body in \"an alkaline state.\" (She sells a urine-testing kit that checks one's pH balance.) After splits from two business titans, Arpad Busson and Jeffrey Soffer, she found in Wakefield a man who possessed riches of a different kind. Sure, the Lancet paper, of which he was the lead author, had been debunked, retracted, dismissed by the British Medical Journal as an \"elaborate fraud\" that caused him to lose his medical license. And yes, he was reviled by some within the medical establishment as well as the mainstream media. But to his fans, his downfall was a sinister plot to destroy a man who knew the dangerous truth. To them\u2014and there are many of them\u2014he was a rock star martyr. \"Jesus Christ and Nelson Mandela rolled into one,\" as one supporter put it to The New York Times. Their time together was very moving to Macpherson. That the making of the film coincided with COVID was \"such beautiful, sacred timing,\" she told the audience. \"It's so pertinent and so relevant...in this sort of divine time where vaccination and mandatory vaccination is on everybody's lips.\" At the conclusion of the evening, Wakefield paced the stage and continued his call to arms. \"The most important thing of all [is] the extraordinary power of maternal intuition. This ancient wisdom...It is why we are here on this earth today...There has been a concerted effort by the man in the white coat to say, 'I know your child better than you do.' No, you do not. And that ancient wisdom is far more important than what medicine has done, what vaccines have done...It is time to take that back...to defer back to that inner authority...not Tony Fauci...telling you about how you should run your life.\" [Macpherson and Wakefield](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10290417/Elle-Macpherson-confirms-split-disgraced-former-doctor-Andrew-Wakefield.html) are now broken up. But lucky for him, the movement is bursting with ever more celebrities, demi-celebs, and influencers. The prominent names fighting the Man in the White Coat Apocalypse have, or claim to have, distinct ideologies, and some categorization is in order. Category One is a rather select few who admit outright to being [anti-vaccination](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/02/tech/facebook-vaccine-holocaust-misinformation/index.html). Category Two includes those you might call vaccine skeptics, squishy in which beliefs they'll publicly own. Category Two is the most formidable, subtly crafting its image. Its members take pains to claim that they are \"not anti-vaccination\"\u2014but rather \"pro-science\" or \"pro-vaccine safety.\" And their science shows that the vaccine du jour could be dangerous, or perhaps deadly. And then there's Category Three, a bucket that runneth over. Here, vaccine opinionators concede that [vaccines](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharysmith/2022/01/27/holocaust-survivors-condemn-anti-vaccine-protesters-use-of-nazi-imagery/?sh=653d1356796e) can be helpful\u2014maybe they've even gotten their COVID shots. But mandating vaccines, or mandating masks, isn't merely a complex question, as most Americans would agree; rather, it's akin to modern slavery, the [Holocaust](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-rep-davidson-compares-vaccine-mandates-holocaust-n1287382). As a group, you might call members of the three categories Vaxsurgents\u2014angry, loud, exhausting. The celebrity Vaxsurgents come in a variety of cultural flavors. There are the hardcore MAGA champs\u2014Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and an array of Republican demagogues, many of whom are surely vaccinated themselves but must daily bow to the red-hot base, and thus they won't divulge their status, many emphasizing that they are purely anti-mandate. Two of the loudest Vaxsurgents hail from the coastal-elitist fields of environmentalism ( [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/05/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-became-anti-vaxxer-icon-nightmare)) and feminism ( [Naomi Wolf](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/naomi-wolf-banned-twitter-spreading-vaccine-myths)). Hollywood boasts a high profile in the Vaxsurgency. Jenny McCarthy laid some crucial early groundwork. Ice Cube, Russell Brand, Lost actor Evangeline Lilly, and others have taken up the torch in different ways. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will require two negative PCR tests [to attend the Oscars](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/oscars-will-require-vaccines-for-guests-but-not-performers-and-presenters), and audience members (including nominees) must be vaccinated, but performers and presenters will not be required to be vaccinated. Industry reporters have speculated that the partial mandate means that certain influential actors and industry players are unvaccinated and would otherwise not participate in the show. Novak Djokovic and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers have launched their own subgroup of star-athlete Vaxsurgent, which is characterized by shiftiness and the belief that their brilliance on the court/field makes them modern-day Louis Pasteurs. Rodgers knowingly misled the public when he said he'd been \"immunized\"; he took an unspecified homeopathic treatment. Djokovic believes he can detoxify water with positive thinking. His obfuscations piled up by the hour before he was finally deported from Australia the day before the Australian Open. Supermodel Doutzen Kroes has whined from the fashion world. Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, and Meat Loaf have groused from the rock-and-roll arena; the latter reportedly died of complications from COVID in late January. Rounding out the Vaxsurgency are wellness influencers, Mother Earth bro adventurers, and juicing fanatics. They are lesser known, but still command sizable audiences who turn to them for answers about everything from ethically sourced crystals to how to cure cancer at home. With a collective reach into tens of millions, probably more, they've done considerable damage to both public health and the legitimacy of science. Since the vaccines became widely available last summer, an estimated hundred thousand unvaccinated people have died, twice as many deaths per capita as the much more vaccinated European Union and the U.K. With the omicron variant still working its way through the nation, hospitals have been filled to capacity with the unvaccinated, forced to turn away patients with other needs. Health care workers are being pushed to the brink. Civil servants like Fauci, and their family members, are getting targeted with death threats. Across the Canadian-American border, cities have been virtually held hostage by the \"Freedom Convoy\"\u2014trucker Vaxsurgents\u2014blocking roadways and crippling the delivery of goods. The general vibe from Vaxsurgent world is skepticism, sometimes contempt, of government expertise, and an exaltation of the self: self-love, self-care, self-importance. These guiding principles have driven the far-right and left flanks into each other's arms, one of the most bizarre phenomena of our era. Take RFK Jr., founder of the Children's Health Defense, recently heard hollering about COVID restrictions at the \"anti-mandate\" rally in Washington, D.C. \"Even in Hitler Germany...you could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did.\" Who would have imagined that the son of the liberal icon would one day protest alongside Proud Boys? Or that Wolf, third-wave feminist and author of a book called Vagina: A New Biography, would today join Steve Bannon as a fellow warrior fighting the tyranny of vaccine mandates? Or that Christiane Northrup, a pioneer in women's health and frequent guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show, would share an event with novelty kook Lin Wood as he shouts about Democrat baby-killers. Brian Deer, the investigative journalist who uncovered the Lancet fraud, says, \"You have to look at Jim Jones with people like this,\" referring to the cult leader who led 909 people to commit suicide. There's no ashram, no drumming, dancing, or picking flowers at dawn for Dear Leader. But the hallmarks are there. Matthew Remski, who studies cults and cohosts the podcast Conspirituality, says it's \"premised on first telling them the world is incredibly terrifying. And then in the next breath telling them that salvation is near at hand, and it's on my platform where you can buy my course.\" The monster is so big, the fight so urgent, that if distasteful political alliances must be formed, so be it. Wakefield and Kennedy, both born into privilege, have emerged as this nebulous force's guiding lights. Wakefield, a third-generation doctor and rugby man, assumes the role of sainted martyr, while Kennedy is the one who has given it all a veneer of legitimacy. \"A Kennedy creates social proof at such a phenomenal level just by having the name,\" says Imran Ahmed, founder of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). A CCDH study called the \"Disinformation Dozen,\" performed over a six-week period in 2021, identified the 12 players responsible for almost two thirds of the COVID disinformation out there; on it Kennedy was ranked number two. In a response to Vanity Fair's request for comment, the president and general counsel of Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, Mary Holland, disputes the CCDH's report\u2014by citing Facebook. \"Facebook has demonstrated that the CCDH's accusations are utterly false. The CCDH has been unable to point to a single factual inaccuracy on any of Mr. Kennedy's digital platforms.\" Yet a typical claim from Kennedy is that the COVID vaccine leads to miscarriage in pregnant women, when in fact a major study shows that pregnant unvaccinated women and their babies suffer the worst consequences from the virus, including stillbirths. \"What he's pushing is death,\" concludes Ahmed. Over the last two decades, Kennedy and Wakefield, working independently of each other, have effectively formed a kind of tag team. Wakefield's movement started off with a focus on autism. The 1998 Lancet paper (coauthored with several other researchers) was based on 12 children who'd allegedly exhibited signs of autism immediately after receiving their MMR vaccines. Even as scientists expressed skepticism, English newspapers and the BBC trumpeted his claims. Distraught parents of autistic children\u2014who'd never been given a clear why\u2014felt they had their answer. It wasn't until six years later that Wakefield's paper was exposed as fraudulent, thanks to Deer's series in London's Sunday Times. Among Deer's many revelations, it turned out that Wakefield had concealed that he was getting paid by a personal injury lawyer representing families in a suit against vaccine manufacturers. But by then, the misinformation had already spread\u2014a virus itself. In the wake of the expos\u00e9, Wakefield left England for Texas, finding in the U.S. a fresh breeding ground to peddle his theory. The misinformation phenomenon replicated. One listener was actor Jenny McCarthy, whose son, Evan, had been diagnosed with autism as a toddler. After writing Louder Than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism (2007), McCarthy went on The Oprah Winfrey Show to share what she had learned from \"the University of Google.\" No matter that scientific study after scientific study showed no connection between the vaccine and autism, McCarthy had something. \"Mommy instinct,\" she told Winfrey. \"Right before his MMR, I said to the doctor, I have a very bad feeling about this shot. This is the autism shot, isn't it?...And not soon thereafter, I noticed that change in his pictures: Boom! Soul, gone from his eyes.\" While insisting that she wasn't anti-vaccination, she repeated the terrifying MMR story on Larry King Live and Good Morning America; People magazine told her story too\u2014platforms reaching millions and millions of people. The Santa Monica pediatrician who treated her son, Jay Gordon, became the go-to doctor among West Side yoga moms; he started issuing \"personal belief\" MMR exemptions for their school children. Real estate mogul Donald Trump took notice. In a 2007 interview in the Sun Sentinel, he said about the rise in autism diagnoses, \"And now all of a sudden, it's an epidemic. Everybody has their theory. My theory, and I study it because I have young children, my theory is the shots.\" (His son Barron was nearly two at the time.) Around the same time, Kennedy, best known for his environmental advocacy, was entering the crusade. As chief prosecuting attorney for Riverkeeper and president of Waterkeeper Alliance, he had been doing important work, rooting out corporate polluters and holding them accountable. But those sins would be nothing compared to the government and Big Pharma knowingly poisoning children with the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine. The mainstream media was ready. In a 4,700-word article that ran concurrently in Rolling Stone and Salon in 2005, Kennedy wrote that if, as he believed was the case, \"our public health authorities knowingly allowed the pharmaceutical industry to poison an entire generation of American children, their actions arguably constitute one of the biggest scandals in the annals of American medicine.\" The article was so rife with errors, distortions, and\u2014as writer Seth Mnookin detailed in his book The Panic Virus\u2014spliced-and-diced testimony that Salon eventually retracted it and Rolling Stone removed it from its website. (Today the Children's Health Defense claims that \"Salon has never identified the inaccuracies that prompted its decision to retract the piece\"\u2014even though it did, in 500 words, detailing each and every one.) That didn't stop Kennedy from appearing on Scarborough Country with Joe Scarborough\u2014a father of a son with Asperger's\u2014to repeat the claims. Scarborough signed off the interview with, \"Let's get you running for a public office.\" Kennedy had thrown down a new gauntlet: a government cover-up. Wakefield, who'd been busy spreading the false MMR-autism connection to receptive communities, joined in. In 2014, four years after losing his medical license in the U.K., Wakefield announced in an online video: \"CDC whistleblower confesses to vaccine-autism fraud.\" The video went viral, and over the transom of Trump, by then the star of The Celebrity Apprentice, who tweeted, \"The doctors lied.\" Wakefield turned the video into a full-length 2016 documentary, Vaxxed. The centerpiece \"whistleblower,\" Dr. William Thompson, was in fact a CDC employee whose phone calls were being surreptitiously taped. Thompson had a single misgiving\u2014he felt that some pieces of data about African American boys and autism should have been included in a study he had coauthored about the MMR vaccine. His words were so wildly taken out of context as to render the film a journalistic travesty. Still, just as Wakefield had managed a decade earlier with Jenny McCarthy, he again landed a celebrity backer\u2014Robert De Niro, who, like McCarthy, worried that his son's autism was related to a vaccine. De Niro, the cofounder of the Tribeca Film Festival, secured a spot for the film at the 2016 festival, until public pressure and discussions with \"the scientific community\" (as he stated) became too much to bear, and the festival pulled it. But the publicity was the best thing to happen to Wakefield. Vaxxed immediately found a distributor. Two weeks later, De Niro went on the Today show, shared his personal story, and told viewers that \"the movie is something people should see...There's something to that movie.\" By this time, both Kennedy and Wakefield had snagged the biggest celebrity in the world to promulgate their ideas, or at least publicly validate them\u2014candidate Trump. In 2016, Trump met with anti-vaccine activists at a fundraiser in Florida. Wakefield, who attended, told his acolytes that Trump was \"on our side,\" and he later attended one of the inaugural balls at the president's invitation. In 2017, Kennedy announced that Trump had asked him to chair a commission on vaccine safety. Much to Kennedy's frustration, that commission never materialized. Trump never became quite the anti-vaxxer Kennedy hoped he'd be, but he was the first celebrity COVID denier, and arguably did more to politicize mask wearing and trample on the idea of shared sacrifice than any human being on the planet. Today Kennedy insists he is \"not anti-vaccine\" while claiming the COVID vaccine \"is the deadliest ever made\" in the same swoop. A statement to Vanity Fair from the Children's Health Defense reads, \"More than 1,000,000 injuries, including 20,000 deaths, have been reported in just over the year that [the vaccines] have been on the market.\" The source is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), an unverified dumping ground for any conjecture or piece of misinformation that any member of the public wishes to share. His organization had less to say about his foray into Holocaust distortion. Facing a massive public outcry after his Anne Frank remark, he tweeted out a classic half-apology: \"To the extent that I caused hurt, I am deeply sorry.\" That wasn't the first time he had to issue an apology for using a Holocaust analogy to describe vaccines. In 2015, he apologized \"to all whom I've offended by my use of the word\"\u2014but then continued to use the analogy; one section in his book about Fauci is titled \"Final Solution: Vaccines or Bust.\" When V.F. asked whether he would cease or reconsider using such charged rhetoric, the Children's Health Defense did not respond. With a growing fan base among the far right, perhaps it's hard to say goodbye to that whiff of anti-Semitism. Similarly, fellow former liberal darling Naomi Wolf has found a warm embrace in the arms of the far right, courtesy of [Steve Bannon](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/31/vaccine-skeptics-gop-politics-trump-00003759). Since early in the pandemic, she has been trumpeting the End of Days to listeners of his podcast, Bannon's War Room: \"These people will stop at nothing short of dissolving the bonds that make us strong as the United States of America,\" she said in July, referring to Bill Gates, Fauci, and their whole cabal. She has called the media's coverage of the vaccines \"like Goebbels,\" and the implementation of the vaccines \"Stalinist level of evil.\" In May, she said, \"This unholy marriage of data and this health focus, this vaccine focus, is an incredibly demonically brilliant way to control everyone.\" Yet Wolf, like Kennedy, insists to me over the phone that she's \"not an anti-vaxxer,\" going so far as to warn that \"there's going to be a lawyer's letter if you guys include me in a roundup of anti-vaxxers.\" Her kids have been vaccinated, she says, \"and I've had all my tested, proven vaccinations.\" When asked if the FDA approval made her feel any more confident in the testing of the COVID vaccine, she replies, \"I think that that's a regrettable question for a serious journalist to ask.\" She has not gotten the COVID vaccine, she says, because \"I have a serious neurological condition and there are no long-term studies.\" But what's really riling her up are the mandates, which she sees as violations of informed consent, and tools to create a second-class citizenry in the unvaccinated. \"What shocks me, shocks me, is that the left, my community, my people, are going along with the creation of a two-tiered society, which recreates discrimination.\" As for appearing on War Room with Bannon\u2014the man who told his listeners on January 5, 2021, \"It's all converging, and now we're on the point of attack tomorrow. It's going to kick off, it's going to be very dramatic\"\u2014Wolf says she had no choice. \"I tried to write for all the people I've written for in the past, and I absolutely am not being given the opportunity,\" she says. The perceived exile may precede the pandemic, stemming in part from a BBC Radio interview in which the host dismantled in real time a key tenet of her book Outrages: Sex, Censorship, and the Criminalization of Love, prompting the publisher to pulp it. A revised paperback was released a year later by a different publisher. (The first line of the New York Times review of the book dismissed her \"long, ludicrous career.\") \"The conservatives who are talking to me and the libertarians who are talking to me are not trying to silence me or smear me.\" Indeed, she is appreciative of Bannon's listeners, and thanked them on air for their \"support, help, and resources\" in supporting her Five Freedoms campaign to fight COVID restrictions. Bold-faced names in the fields of medicine, natural health, and wellness are making the same pilgrimage rightward. Ob-gyn Christiane Northrup came to prominence as the author of the seminal 1994 book Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom, about women's intuitive connection to their bodies. Popularized by Oprah Winfrey and alt-doc turned GOP hopeful Mehmet Oz, she was a gentle, medical matriarch, giving women advice about caring for their bodies and sometimes sharing videos of herself playing the harp. She even donated to Emily's List. But when QAnon came along, a new world of opportunity opened up. In May 2020, Northrup-a Category One Vaxsurgent-who has half a million followers on Facebook, shared the conspiracy video \"Plandemic,\" which argued that a secret cabal of elites had concocted COVID as a way to enrich themselves. Her \"share\" became one of the most seminal disinformation plays of the anti-vax army. As the podcast Conspirituality pointed out, this kind of controversial material got her more views than her pieces of advice about women's health, and she picked up steam. In late 2020, she made a series of videos dubbed \"The Great Awakening\"\u2014a QAnon notion about the imminent moment when those who stole the election from Trump would be brought to justice, and he would be reinstated. In a more recent video, she explains how the COVID vaccine targets specific chromosomes that act as the seat of our empathy, and how artificial intelligence is embedded in their material. There have been dystopian, real-world consequences to her set of beliefs. In April, Centner Academy, her grandchildren's reported private school in Miami, told staff that it would make efforts not to employ anyone who had received the COVID vaccine. Northrup has served as a model for younger natural-health and wellness influencers, like her friend Kelly Brogan, a dewy \"holistic psychiatrist\" and a former contributor to Goop. A few years ago Brogan earned respectability and a fan base by helping women wean themselves off psychotropic drugs. But in March 2020, she took a dramatic turn by announcing in a video, shared 75,000 times, that she had decided that COVID might not really exist. Since then, she and husband Sayer Ji\u2014a former health food store manager who founded the popular website greenmedinfo.com \u2014have been selling the message of \"bodily sovereignty,\" an idea manifested in their slender limbs and beautiful union, which one can witness in their many [joint videos](https://www.kellybroganmd.com/livecast-love-in-the-time-of-covid). \"You have a sovereign body,\" Ji says. \"No one should penetrate you or your children without [your] consent. We're seeing that happen.\" He is referring to \"being vaccinated, having a quantum dot\u2014a trackable system in you.\" Brogan chimes in, saying, \"Health is itself a religious construct, right? It's a belief system. There's already a lane for that in our collective consciousness, as if you need to be given permission to step into that.\" Then after a little ramble, she goes on: \"That choice seems so much a human entitlement that it lays bare the control-based elements of a perspective that says, 'No, you can't have that freedom of choice. You need to do what I think you should do. You need to conform to my belief system.'\" She mimics what she calls a \"control-based system\" of mask wearing, injections, social distancing, and temperature checks. For those turned on by such language, the message is simple: You are actually all that matters. As long as you buy Ji's book, and sign up for Brogan's Vital Mind Reset program, you too can be as perfect as we. Such unquestioning narcissism seems to be the mood of the era. In every corner of media and entertainment, there's a celebrity publicly fretting about selfhood. Eric Clapton and Van Morrison got in early, in December 2020, to flex some libertarian rage for a joint anti-lockdown anthem, \"Stand and Deliver\" (\"Do you want to be a free man? Or do you want to be a slave?\"). In September, Doutzen Kroes posted on her Instagram (7.1 million followers) a sun-dappled close-up with an accompanying announcement that she would \"not be forced to take the shot.\" She added, \"Pass on the torch of hope and love and speak your truth.\" Her fellow Victoria's Secret Angel Gisele B\u00fcndchen voiced her support with a lofty comment aimed at Kroes's critics. \"I invite you to silence your mind and go deep within to find love in your heart so we can all unite in peace and create harmony in our lives and in our world.\" Aaron Rodgers complains about the \"woke mob\" and blasts \"the Fake White House.\" Throughout the pandemic, comedian Russell Brand, under the auspices of \"just asking questions,\" has been posting videos about the loss of liberties, the \"vaccine gold rush,\" etc. His shouty sprays of verbiage are so relentless that one can't help but feel that being deprived of the in-person limelight for so long has been very rough on him. Meanwhile, approximately 97 million eligible Americans aren't fully vaccinated. The reasons for resisting are sometimes complicated. A large swath of the population bears a general mistrust of government and Big Pharma. Some of this mistrust, it must be said, is understandable\u2014particularly for Black Americans, who have seen Black bodies historically used as instruments of experimentation. The Merck Vioxx scandal and the opioid epidemic were the result of corporate greed and corruption. The weapons of mass destruction fraud led us into an unnecessary war. These are stains on our country that should not be forgotten. The celebrity purveyors of anti-vax and \"pro-vaccine-safety\" messaging have exploited that mistrust brilliantly, finding open vessels in which to dump their misinformation. According to doctors' accounts, anxious parents are refusing all kinds of vaccines for their children because they've heard somewhere that the toxins in them cause not just autism, but all kinds of other stuff: neurological problems, paralysis, eventual infertility, etc. They spout the \"wellness\" line\u2014that all their kids need for immune system support are vitamin supplements and fresh air. Some doctors themselves have fallen prey to the misinformation. Consider the popular Beverly Hills gynecologist Dr. Christine Collins. According to a patient who went to see Collins last spring, the doctor shared that neither she nor her staff were vaccinated\u2014citing the wisdom of RFK Jr.\u2014just as the patient was settling onto the examination table. (The patient left immediately.) \"Some of my staff are vaccinated and some are not, and I leave their medical decisions up to them and their doctors,\" Dr. Collins states in a response to Vanity Fair. \"I feel it is a HIPPA [sic] violation to ask for their medical information and vaccine status since I am not their personal doctor. I am not interested in discussing my own vaccine status with anyone. If my patients ask my opinion, I will refer them to those who have done research into this new mRNA technology that is labeled as a 'vaccine,' as I am not an expert in such matters.\" Those researchers, she says, are Northrup, Robert Malone, and Lee Merritt, three favorite doctors of the Vaxsurgency, whose views have been rejected by the medical establishment. \"Doing my own research\" has become the brag du jour. \"A lot of people who we're seeing now out on the streets,\" says Brian Deer, \"it's important to them to believe that they are party to some special knowledge and insights that separates them from the common person.\" The Man in the White Coat is the enemy, until contracting COVID threatens the unvaccinated soul. Perplexingly, unvaccinated patients who've railed against Big Pharma for \"lining its pockets\" are now seeking the monoclonal antibody treatment, which costs $2,100 a pop. And the propagandists are pumping out new looniness in the face of skeptics who've given in to the vaccine. In social media videos, people are taking \"radiation detox baths,\" made of borax and clay, to reverse the vaccine (not possible, say the experts). Social media companies have taken some action in deplatforming disinformers, but it's been a lax and scattershot effort to combat a suffuse phenomenon. Still, like Trump, the celebrity Vaxsurgents love to play victim, threaten lawsuits, and whine about censorship. These agents of \"freedom\" don't seem to grasp that social media platforms exist within a capitalist market\u2014that they, too, are independent entities, free to host what they see fit; and that there's a plethora of platforms eager to host them: Gab, Telegram, Gettr, Parler, etc. They are also free to write books, maintain websites, and shout from an infinite number of street corners\u2014as, indeed, they do. But this is the age of attention-seekers. Why miss a chance to turn an inconvenience into outrage? \u2014 The [Prince Fondle Me.
