The vaccines, provided for free by the Singaporean government are the two-dose Pfizer vaccines developed by American pharmaceutical corp Pfizer and German biotech company BioNTech. Earlier this month on January 13, SIA staff members began to receive Covid-19 vaccines at Changi Airport as part of a vaccination drive for those who work in the aviation sector, reports Channel News Asia. While participation was voluntary, the airline reported that 5,200 SIA employees have already signed up to get their vaccination shots, which will begin to take place in a few days. Once vaccinated, flight crews are no longer required to do a Covid-19 test when returning back to the country. The nation's quick response to the pandemic has been largely successful, containing the virus by using wearable contact-tracing devices and drone technology to maintain social distancing. Currently, in Singapore, there are over 59,000 cases and 29 deaths (January 20). Although the [\"air travel bubble\" with Hong Kong](https://hk.asiatatler.com/life/hong-kong-singapore-travel-bubble) has been delayed indefinitely after the city had a spike in virus cases in December, in the meantime, you can start planning your [Singapore itinerary](https://hk.asiatatler.com/life/instagram-spots-singapore) for when it's safe to travel again.
