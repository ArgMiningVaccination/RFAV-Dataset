We [announced ](https://www.commonspirit.org/commonspirit-health-announces-that-employees-must-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19/)this summer that all eligible employees must be fully vaccinated or receive an approved exemption by Nov 1. Thousands of additional employees have become vaccinated since we announced our policy, and nearly 97% of our employees are now vaccinated or have received an approved medical or religious exemption. We are deeply grateful to all of our employees who have chosen to get vaccinated. Since vaccines first became available, we have worked hard to share information with our employees about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, address any questions and concerns, and offer convenient options to get vaccinated. We will continue to work in good faith with employees who are not yet vaccinated to encourage them to do so. Our requirement is consistent with new federal rules requiring vaccination for health care workers. CommonSpirit Health supports policies that encourage vaccination, and CommonSpirit CEO Lloyd Dean has [praised the Biden administration's commitment](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vaccination-our-best-chance-end-pandemic-lloyd-dean/?trackingId=o1vxMqAnj8DT3t%2BVtLRNJg%3D%3D) to keeping health care workers safe from COVID-19 through vaccination. Most employees who did not have their exemption request approved will be able to continue to work while we seek to fill their role, to ensure we can keep providing essential health care services for our communities, except where local and state regulations differ. These employees will be subject to additional masking and testing requirements, and will have every opportunity to remain with our organization if they choose to get vaccinated. CommonSpirit will continue to follow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations related to vaccinations. Vaccination is the best way to bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage everyone in our communities who is eligible to get vaccinated as soon as they can. "}
