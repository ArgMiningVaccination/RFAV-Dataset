Bacteria, yeast, viruses, and chemicals can cause vaginitis. The most common types are: - Yeast infection. This is caused by one of the many species of fungus known as candida. These normally live in the vagina in small numbers. Candida may also be in the mouth and digestive tract in both boys and girls. Infection happens when something upsets the normal balance. For example, antibiotics can kill bacteria that normally balance the amount of yeast in the vagina. Too much yeast grows, causing an infection. Another cause can be pregnancy, which changes hormone levels. Diabetes can also be a cause because of too much sugar in the urine. - Bacterial vaginosis. This infection is caused when certain types of normal vaginal bacteria grow out of control and cause inflammation. - Trichomoniasis (trich). This is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a parasite. This parasite passes between partners during sexual contact. Most boys don't have symptoms with trichomoniasis. So the infection is often not diagnosed until a girl has vaginitis symptoms. - Viral vaginitis. Viruses are a common cause of vaginitis. Most are spread through sexual contact. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause viral vaginitis. The human papillomavirus (HPV) can also cause viral vaginitis. Both of these are spread through sexual contact. - Noninfectious vaginitis. This is vaginal irritation without an infection. It's most often caused by an allergic reaction or irritation. Chemicals in vaginal sprays, douches, or spermicides can cause it. It may also be caused by perfumed soaps, detergents, or fabric softeners. Even chemicals in clothing can cause symptoms. Which teens are at risk for vaginitis?
