I joyously realize Your absolute presence. I see You everywhere-in all places, all people, all that is. You breathe life and light into my very soul, YOU who are Infinite Love. Yes, I feel Your Presence-You live in me! Thank you for the Divine Spark within. God, You have said \"Ask and it shall be given.\" I come to You now in gratitude and love for Your assistance that is ever present. Receive my prayer as an offering of faith that what I ask for has already been given and received. (Take a moment to bring your prayer intention to mind. Speak it out loud or silently to yourself. Imagine handing all dis-ease and lack over to God, and God lovingly receiving it. Create a vivid inner experience of already having, doing and being your prayer request. And then hand this, too, over to God asking that Divine Will be done.) [Thank you, Divine Spirit!] I have faith in reality of Miracles! I believe in the power of LOVE! I release this intention into Your hands. I surrender to Your will. May the Divine Design now manifest! I know I am whole and perfect as You made me. There is nothing to be healed; only DIVINE LOVE to be revealed. [Now I join with my brothers and sisters] as we speak to You in unity. Our hearts join and overflow with Divine Love, And we become a powerful channel for Your Healing Work: [By the Grace of God, Divine Love now heals and guides] all those who have prayed for Your help! [By the Grace of God, Divine Love now heals and guides] every member of our personal communities! [By the Grace of God, Divine Love now heals and guides] all life on our earth! [Divine Spirit, spark our faith, hope and love into new action this day.] Our lives fill with gratitude, wonder and awe. Miracles happen. We receive the blessing of Your perfect love and wisdom. And with this prayer we now embrace the call You gave us-to be spiritual beings, in service to each other and to You. Amen "}
