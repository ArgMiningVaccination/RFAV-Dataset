There can be toxins at the physical, emotional and mental levels. Physical Toxins include heavy metals, insecticides, pesticides, medications, drugs, preservatives, addictive poisons, vaccines, metabolic toxins and free radicals. The effect of these toxins on the physical body relates to the disturbance of the body's natural processes, such as digestion, alertness, regeneration and elimination. This toxic effect can go up to the point of totally blocking the natural functioning of a system as exemplified in chronic inflammation, cancer, allergies, etc. Symptoms of Physical detoxification: - Headaches - Nausea/ vomiting - Dizziness - Digestive disorders/ diarrhoea - Loss of concentration - Skin rashes - Fever - Flu' like illness - Aches and pains - Increased sweating - Body and mouth odour - Flaring up of old symptoms - Tiredness Emotional toxins include all the negative emotions that we have absorbed and been imprinted with from our surroundings. Symptoms of Emotional detoxification: - Excessive feelings of grief, anger, hatred, fear, sadness, etc. - Insecurity - Irritability - Increased projection - Feelings of reluctance - Depression Mental toxins include all the patterns, beliefs and programs that keep us in a place of feeling limited and disconnected. - Symptoms of Mental detoxification: - Poor orientation - Confusion - Illogical arguments - No longer knowing what is \"right\" or \"wrong\" - Flashbacks from childhood - Thoughts going round and round - Loss of sense of identity All of us who have collected toxins must go through the detoxification process as part of our return to perfect health. However, the speed and intensity with which that takes place can be regulated. Being gentle with the self is always advisable. Do remember that the detoxification process is part of your healing to a higher order of health and happiness. If you feel you are detoxing make sure to drink lots of mineral water, take some rest and have epsom salt baths.
