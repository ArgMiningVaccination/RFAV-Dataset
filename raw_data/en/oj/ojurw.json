If you do not have access to Good Friday Oil, the next best remedy for healing those who are vaccinated is drinking exorcism water with the miraculous medal (preferably blessed). I have collected the three most recent messages from Our Lord, Jesus Christ, given to Prophet John Leary about using exorcism water with the miraculous medal for those vaccinated. Also, included is an image of a personal letter that Father Michel Rodrigue has sent to the faithful recommending the remedy as it was given to him by God the Father. In addition to applying the Good Friday Oil (anointing yourself or others with a cross on the forehead); or drinking the exorcism water with the miraculous medal, I recommend that people pray the 1,900 year old prayer to St Joseph as a novena for thanks to God as this particular prayer is especially efficacious in protecting from poisons and sudden deaths. Remember that you must have faith that God can heal you as both these remedies rely on faith to be able to work. That is why I recommend that people do a novena and not simply a one-time prayer, as it deepens your faith that you will be healed by God. Also, included within this blog post, is the official exorcism prayer for blessing salt and water that priests should use. When my dad was alive with his Parkinsons disease, every few months, my mother and I would either ask our parish priest or go to the local benedictine abbey to have water blessed with the exorcim prayer. We were not shy about doing this; we would actually bring several gallons of water for the priests to bless and they would come out to the car to bless them all at the same time (so the car would be blessed, too!). However, if you do not have access to a willing priest - as I know some people belong to liberal dioceses or all the local churches are closed), in the personal letter, Father Michel does recommend asking the Blessed Mother Mary for her intercession with the miraculous medal to bless the water, too, if there is no other way. I also want to recommend that once you are healed of the effects of the Covid-19 vaccines, that you follow up with using daily either the Oil of the Good Samaritan, St Raphael Oil, or wearing a Blue Scapular, for further protection in this End Times from plagues. You can also use the Healing Oil of St Philomena, St Joseph Oil (I will be writing more about this remedy soon), or any of the holy oils that you can get from various Catholic shrines. Because these are all faith-based remedies, God will work through all of them to cause healing and protection from further illness. I also recommend them because all of these holy oils also have deliverance blessings associated with them. This is important, because oftentimes, people will become sick and they will try all kinds of healing remedies when in reality, they need deliverance prayers because they have been cursed and have illnesses that are demonic in origin. That is why all Christians today should avail themselves of using various sacramentals, especially, frequently using holy oils, because the oils block demons from attacking - so they are a form of protection - as well as can heal and deliver you from demonic illnesses if needed. Also, believe me, if you are suffering in any way with illness, I recommend that you include deliverance prayers as part of your daily prayer regimen. I have been delivered from crippling illnesses just by doing an hour of deliverance prayers over myself because I often get cursed. You can even be cursed with cancer by others. I heard a story about a parish where nine people died of the same brain cancer within a year and a half. They brought a mystic in and it was discovered that a witch was part of the congregation cursing people. Here are the deliverance prayers that I often use which are very powerful: https://www.catholicwarriors.com/pages/warfare_prayers.htm Hopefully, this post will help a lot of people. God bless, a soul Letter Dated March 1, 2021: A friend forwarded the copy of a personal letter from Father Michel Rodrigue. Even though the letter was written to someone else, it contains a wonderful message for all of us! (included in downloadable PDF document) For Priests Use: Exorcism Blessing for Salt and Water (one page PDF): https://maryrefugeofholylove.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/exorcism_blessing_for_s alt_and_water-pdf.pdf (USA): For Donation: Exorcism Water Class Relic: Miraculous Medal https://www.cukierski.net/products/medal-of-miraclesPROPHET JOHN May 27, 2021 Jesus said: (Luke 10:46-52) \"My people, the blind beggar, Bartimeus, called out to Me as the Son of David to heal him of his blindness. He had faith in My healing power, so I healed him of his blindness. This faith in My healing power is necessary for all healing to take place. You remember well how I had difficulty in healing people in My hometown of Nazareth, because they lacked faith in My healing. I gave you a message that you could heal the Covid vaccinated people with the Good Friday oil, the exorcism water with the Miraculous medal, or by coming to My refuges at the proper time. The Covid vaccinated people need to have faith in My healing, and they will not die from the vaccine. When you hear about blindness, there are also spiritually blind people as well. You need to be baptized into the faith, and you will be healed of your spiritual blindness when you will receive the eyes of faith. Then you will see My purpose clearly in how I died on the cross to bring salvation to all of those people who believe in Me. Once you look beyond the world, you can accomplish the mission I have for you. Give up your agenda and follow Me, and you will be saved. By dying to self, and doing My Will, you will truly see My Light to lead you to heaven.\" Jesus said: \"My people, I told you that the vaccinated people could die from the vaccine, and even sooner when a deadly virus is released. I showed you a vision of dead bodies lying around, who represented the dead vaccinated people. Now, I am showing you how they will be disposing of the many bodies by either cremation or by using mass graves. There will be Covid spike proteins coming from these bodies, and that is why they need to be burned or buried. Pray that the vaccinated people can be healed with the Good Friday oil, the exorcism water with the miraculous medal, or at My refuges.\" Saturday, May 29, 2021 Later, at the Eternal Father Chapel we were praying before our Adoration DVD. I saw an overwhelming ongoing vision that was a sign of the coming deadly virus that would kill a lot of vaccinated people. I first saw a long table in a hall, and many people were eating a dessert. This was a sign of when the virus would be released. Then all at once many people started dying and there were bodies on the ground as I saw before. I then saw flames from a large crematorium as the dead bodies were being thrown into the fire. This burning of bodies was unbearable as I stopped the vision. This vision was crystal clear.Jesus said: \"My son, you have seen visions before of dead bodies on the ground when the vaccinated people would come in contact with the next deadly virus. This vision is even more dramatic as you again are seeing dead bodies, but now you are seeing many bodies being thrown into a huge crematorium, and they were burned up. I told you before that I would bring My Warning before this deadly virus would be released. This will be the last chance for the vaccinated people to chose to believe in Me, and be healed, or they could die. With the Good Friday oil, the exorcism water with the miraculous medal, or coming to My refuges, this would be a chance for the vaccinated people to be healed, but they must believe I can heal them in order to be healed. Pray for all of your family and friends to become believers in Me during the six weeks of conversion after the Warning, or they could die and go to hell. Trust in Me to answer your prayers, but people need to accept Me of their own free will. I will not force Myself on anyone.\" ALSO SEE: March 17, 2021 - Important Information - For those people who received the Covid-19 vaccines - MaryRefugeOfSouls https://maryrefugeofsouls.com/2021/03/17/march-17-2021-important-information- for-those-people-who-received-the-covid-19-vaccines-maryrefugeofsouls/1,900 YEAR OLD PRAYER TO SAINT JOSEPH (For the Greater Glory of God) Oh, St. Joseph, whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the Throne of God, I place in you all my interests and desires. Oh, St. Joseph, do assist me by your powerful intercession and obtain for me from your Divine Son all spiritual blessings through Jesus Christ, Our Lord; so that, having engaged here below your Heavenly power, I may offer my thanksgiving and homage to the most loving of fathers. Oh, St. Joseph, I never weary contemplating you and Jesus asleep in your arms. I dare not approach while He reposes near your heart. Press Him in my name and kiss His fine Head for me, and ask Him to return the Kiss when I draw my dying breath. St. Joseph, patron of departing souls, pray for us. Amen. Say for nine consecutive mornings for anything you may desire that is of God's will. It has seldom been known to fail. This prayer was found in the fiftieth year of Our Lord Jesus Christ. In 1505, it was sent by the Pope to Emperor Charles when he was going into battle. Who ever reads this prayer or hears it or carries it, will never die a sudden death, nor be drowned, nor will poison take effect on them. They will not fall into the hands of the enemy nor be burned in any fire, nor will they be defeated in battle. Make this prayer known everywhere. Imprimatur: Most Rev. George W.
