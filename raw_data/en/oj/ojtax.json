Coursework in philosophy provides students with an understanding of the methods and traditions of philosophical thought, as well as with opportunities to critically and collaboratively reflect on the nature of the world and the human situation in it. Through readings, discussion, and writing, students examine questions concerning the validity of moral judgments, political ideas, and scientific theories, as well as questions about values and policy in such areas as law, medicine, environment, and technology. Coursework in philosophy significantly strengthens study in other areas. The major emphasizes development of analytic, reasoning, and communication abilities, and it is designed to enable students to tailor it to their particular interests. Religious studies offers students the opportunity to acquire an understanding of religious experience within its social, historical, literary, and political context. Courses in religious studies examine specific religious traditions such as Judaism, Islam, and Hinduism, and using a comparative approach they explore themes across faith traditions. The religious studies major at Northeastern University emphasizes the lived religious experience, or how religion permeates and impacts people's lives through everything from politics and economics to fashion, relationships, and music. Through the major, students have the opportunity to study a range of religions and a variety of methods of understanding the key dimensions of religious life. Information on experiential learning opportunities, student life, and department faculty can be found at the [department website](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/philosophy/). Academic Progression Standards A minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.000 is required to remain in good standing in the major. Philosophy Major The department offers five ways to take the stand-alone major in philosophy: the standard major; the concentration in law and ethics; the concentration in ethics; the concentration in formal methods (e.g., game theory, social choice theory, and logic); and the concentration in religious studies. More information on these can be found on the program page. Religious Studies Major The religious studies major is designed to introduce students to a wide variety of religious experience and expression in the world. Through this major, students are exposed to the basic features of the world's religions and the ethical systems that accompany them. Students also have an opportunity to explore diverse methodological approaches to the study of religion. Combined Majors The analytical and critical skills gained from the study of philosophy are a valuable complement to any other area of study. So, too, is having an understanding of the history of ideas and of alternative world views and value systems. For this reason, the department offers combined majors with political science, economics, physics, environmental studies, history, English, computer science, behavioral neuroscience, criminal justice, sociology, anthropology, and media and screen studies. Details regarding these majors can be found on the program pages. The combined majors in religious studies bring together knowledge of religious traditions, awareness of religious experience, and methods of understanding the key dimensions of religious life with other areas in which religion plays a large role. The department currently offers combined majors in religious studies with history, international affairs, Africana studies, sociology, anthropology, and Jewish studies. More information on these majors can be found on the program pages. Minors The Department of Philosophy and Religion offers minors in philosophy and religious studies, as well as popular minors in ethics and information ethics. Each of these minors is structured to be highly flexible and to complement study in other majors, while also providing depth of knowledge in philosophy, religion, and ethics. The department also collaborates with the Department of Applied Psychology on a minor in mindfulness studies. Information on these minors can be found on the program pages.
