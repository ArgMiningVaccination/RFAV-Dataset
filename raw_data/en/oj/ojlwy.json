The extent to which facilities have i dentified resident -specific risk factors for adverse drug events, 2. The extent to which facilities d eveloped and i mplemented systems and processes to minimize risks associated with medications that are known to be high-risk and problem-prone, and 3. When a preventable adverse event has occurred , and evaluate if the nursing home identified the issue and responded appropriately to mitigate harm to the individual and prevent recurrence. Definitions: A dverse Event: An untoward, undesirable, and usually unanticipated event that causes death, serious injury, harm, or the risk thereof . Adverse Drug Event: An injury resulting from drug- related medical interventions. Adverse Drug Reaction: Harm directly caused by a drug at normal doses. Anticholinergic Effects: Physical symptoms resulting from drugs that counter the action of acetylcholine including increased blood pressure, respiratory distress, clumsiness/unsteadiness, bloating/constipation/i leus, nausea/vomiting, dry mouth, delirium, drowsiness/lethargy/fatigue, urinary memory problems, and blurred vis ion. Prescribing Cascade: Adverse reaction to one drug that goes unrecognized or is misinterpreted resulting in the prescriber inappropriately prescrib ing a subsequent drug to treat the signs/symptoms of the adverse reaction . Polypharmacy: Multiple definitions exist , but most include reference to drugs without indication and the number of medications used (e.g., more than 10). Risk Factor: Issue or condition that increases the potential for an adverse event to occur. Risk factors include resident level issues such as medications prescribed, age, and concurrent conditions as well as system level issues such as lack of staff knowledge related to high risk medications and unclear protocols to address lab results.
