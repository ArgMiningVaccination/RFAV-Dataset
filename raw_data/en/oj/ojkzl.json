At the very core of our existence is the desire to heal and to promote healthy living. We believe that leading a balanced lifestyle can help you stay well. However, if you are ill, a holistic approach to healthcare can help to stimulate your body's own natural healing capacity. You will find that our holistic approach to healthcare is deeply rooted in our heritage. 90 years ago in Switzerland, Dr. Rudolf Steiner, a renowned philosopher, founded Weleda in partnership with Dr. Ita Wegman, a medical doctor. They developed a personal approach to healthcare which takes into consideration the individual as well as the illness, and uses natural ingredients that work holistically to support the body's own healing capacity. Today, we still believe natural ingredients truly provide what a body needs to be vibrant and well. And, we put your health and wellbeing above all else. As a pharmaceutical company we control our whole supply chain, sometimes even down to the field or tree the ingredient comes from, so you can be assured a Weleda product is of the highest quality available. Our teams of scientists carefully process the ingredients, using their expertise and insights into 'nature's wisdom', ensuring the purest plant essence is extracted as a whole and activated to realise its potential. Our healthcare experts create holistic formulations to work with you on a physical and an emotional level. Every ingredient provides a health benefit, not as cheap filler or to make a fashionable marketing claim.
