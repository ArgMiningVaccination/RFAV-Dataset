Such reactions are divided into four types; type I or IgE -mediated hypersensitivity most of- ten called allergy. In this type of hypersensitivity, IgE antibodies are produced against antigens (al-lergens). IgE antibodies bound to mast cells, and with subsequent exposure to the allergen, the mast cell-bound IgE triggers cell degranulation, and release of immunologic mediators such as histamine, leading to clinical si gns of allergy. The most serious form of IgE -mediated hypersensi-Abstract Background: Most influenza vaccines are grown in embryonated eggs and residual egg proteins can cause al- lergic reactions in patients with egg allergy. The aim of the present study was to determine the safety of inacti- vated influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy in Kurdistan Province, Iran. Methods: This case -control study was done on 876 patients referred to Kurdistan Asthma and Allergy Clinic, Sanandaj, Iran; 635 pat ients with egg allergy (cases) and 241 patients without egg allergy (controls) from 2012 to 2016. All of the patients were injected seasonal influenza vaccine. Side effects including anaphylactic shock, local reaction, vomiting, coughing, sneezing, wheezin g, low blood pressure, redness and itching in the eyes, ab- dominal pain, dyspnea, oral/facial angioedema, swollen and itching of throat were checked by an allergist with- in 30 min after vaccination, and followed up to 24 h. Demographic and vaccination data w ere entered into the SPSS software and analyzed. Results: Out of 876 patients, 460 (52.5%) were male. Patients' ages ranged from 6 months to 80 yr (mean 13.38 \u00b1 15.22 SD). Overall, 63 patients with egg allergy had local reactions to vaccine . Difference of local reac- tions between case and control groups was statistically significant ( P=0.001). No anaphylactic reactions were seen after vaccination. Conclusion: Although the risk of anaphylactic reactions to influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy wa s rare, the vaccine should be administered by an allergist with precaution. The results of present study can be a confirmation of the existing evidences to prevent acute complications to influenza vaccine.

Egg allergy is one of the most common food al- lergies in children, at least 2% of preschool chil- dren (3). Mild symp toms of egg allergy are seen as hives only. Severe symptoms (e.g., anaphylaxis) involve cardiovascular (e.g., hypotension), respir- atory (e.g., wheezing, dyspnea), and gastrointesti- nal (e.g., nausea, vomiting), generally require epi- nephrine or emergency tre atment. Egg allergy may correlate with respiratory symptoms (asthma and/or rhinitis) (2). Egg allergy can be confirmed by a consistent history of adverse reactions to ingestion of egg and egg -containing foods, skin and/or blood testing for IgE produced aga inst egg proteins (4,5). Influenza viruses are the most abundant and the most important etiology of human respiratory infections (6). In infants, the elderly, and people with chronic diseases such as lung, heart, kidney, cancer, and organ transplantation, influenza is associated with more death. In addition, unvaccination may cause morbidity and mortality in children and high-risk groups such as elderly patients (1, 7) . Most influenza vaccines are grown in embryonated eggs and inactivated (8). For exam- ple, monovalent influenza type A , trivalent inacti- vated influenza vaccine (IIV3), usually contains two strains of influenza virus type A, and one strain of influenza virus type B (11). Quadrivalent inactivated influe nza vaccine (IIV4) contains four strains of influenza viruses, two strains A and two strains B. All administrated by injection. Fi- nally, a live vaccine termed quadrivalent live at- tenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4), administered intranasally (1). Until jus t recent years, the administration of in- fluenza vaccine to patients with egg allergy was contraindicated, because injection of influenza vaccines that contained remnant of egg proteins to a person with egg allergy, that produces IgE antibodies against egg proteins, could cause ana- phylaxis (12). Some of the developed methods, that made possible to receive safely inactivated influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy, in- cluding gradual vaccination, skin testing of the vaccine, and use of a vaccine with lo w-level oval- bumin (8). Recently, in order to get rid of residual egg pro- teins from influenza vaccines, two new non -egg- based influenza vaccines have been developed. One involves influenza viruses grown in mamma- lian cell culture, available as trivalent cell culture inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV3) . The other vaccine involves influenza virus recombinant hemagglutinin protein expressed in an insect cell line and is available as trivalent recombinant in- fluenza vaccine (RIV3) (1, 12) . However, in count ries where egg -free influenza vaccines do not prevail , patients with egg allergy could be giv- en the IIV3 vaccine with precaution. IIV3 was safe for patients with egg allergy, and no need any specific precautions to receive influ- enza vaccine (2, 7, 8) . However, numbers of such studies are limited. In addition, there was no pub- lished information on the safety of IIV3 in pa- tients with egg allergy in Iran. Therefore, the aim of present study was to de- termine the possible side effects of seasonal in- jectab le trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) in patients with egg allergy in Kurdistan Province, west of Iran. Methods Study population Kurdistan Province located in the west of Iran. According to the last census conducted in 2011, Kurdistan Provin ce had a total population of 1493645. The male/female ratio of the popula- tion was 1.1 and most of populations are Kurd. We were able to get information from 876 patients referred to the Kurdistan asthma and allergy clinic for routine medical services from 2012 to 2016. Out of 876 study population, 635 patients had allergy to egg, confirmed with a consistent medical history of adverse reactions to ingestion of egg and egg -containing foods and/or positive skin test Iran J Public Health, Vol. 4 8, No.4, Apr 2019, pp. 758-763 760 Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir and 241 patients without egg allergy. 56 patients suffered from asthma, 369 from rhinitis, and 76 had a food allergy, except egg. In this case -control study, 635 patients with egg allergy (cases) and 241 patients without egg aller- gy (controls) were lands). The vaccine was injected (0.5 ml for adults and children above 36 months; and 0.25 ml for 6 - 35 months children) under medical supervision. Probable side effects to the vacc ine including an- aphylactic shock, local reaction (redness of skin), systemic reaction (general skin reaction or tachy- cardia), vomiting, coughing, sneezing, stridor, wheezing, low blood pressure, redness and itch- ing in the eyes, dyspnea, oral/facial angioed ema, swollen/itching of throat, and abdominal pain were checked by an allergist within 30 min after vaccination, and followed up to 24 h by tele- phone. Patients with a history of wheeze or asthma underwent further follow up. Demographic information includin g age, gender, and other patients' clinical conditions were collected. Statistical analysis Demographic and vaccination information were entered into the SPSS software (ver.19 (Chicago, IL, USA) and were analyzed by the chi-square statistical test. In all steps P-values, less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Ethical considerations Patients voluntarily referred to the Kurdistan Asthma and Allergy Clinic for routine medical services. We get patients' information from the clinic archive. The patients' names and their in- formation were held confidential. This study was approved at Kurdistan University of Medical Sci- ences, Sanandaj, Iran (proposal and ethics code: IR.MUK.REC.1395/362). Results Out of 876 patients, 460 (52.5%) were male and 416 (47.5%) were female. The age range of the patients was 6 months to 80 yr (mean 13.38 \u00b1 15.22 Std. deviation). No anaphylactic reactions or seen after administration of sea- sonal injectible inactivated influenza vaccine in both groups. However , there were some minor reactions to the vaccine. For example, 63 out of 635 patients with egg allergy (cases) had local re- actions (redness of skin) to the vaccine. However, there were no local reactions to t he vaccine in patients without egg allergy (controls). Difference of the local reactions between case and control groups was statistically significant ( P=0.001). Other minor reactions to influenza vaccine are presented in Table 1. In patients with egg all ergy 4 had systemic re- sponse to vaccination, 2 oral/facial angioedema, 9 itching of throat, 2 swelling of the throat, 4 stridor, 4 cough and sneeze, 1 dyspnea, 1 wheez- ing, 1 hypotension, 2 abdominal pain, and 13 redness and itching in the eyes, respectivel y. Difference of these minor reactions to inactivat- ed influenza vaccine between case and control groups was not statistically significant (Table 1). Discussion At present study, 635 patients with egg allergy (cases), and 241 patients without egg allergy (con- trols) were administered seasonal trivalent inacti- vated influenza vaccine (IIV3) in Kurdistan Asthma and Allergy Clinic in influenza seasons. No anaphylactic reactions were seen after vac- cination. However, there were some minor reac- tions to vaccine . For examples, 63 patients with egg allergy had local reactions to vaccine . Difference of local reactions between case and control groups was statistically significa nt. There are clear data regarding the safety of egg - protein containing influenza vaccines to patients with egg allergy. Review of 28 previous studies collectively showed that administration of egg- containing influenza vaccines to the patients with history of anaphylactic reactions to the ingestion of egg had no significant reactions (1, 12) .

The tests did not predict al- lergic reactions, and such testing was unneces- sary. In addition, in many of the studies the vac- cines were administered in divided doses (often 10% of dose followed up 30 min then the re- maining 90%) (1, 12) . Because the full dose of the vaccine was tolerat- ed, many of the authors concluded that dividing the dose was also unnecessary. In studies that included control subjects without egg allergy, the rate of minor reactions to vaccine was almost the same as in the reci pients with egg allergy. There- fore, recipients scarcely developed anaphylactic reactions after administration of influenza vac- cines in both egg allergic and non -allergic groups (1, 12) . Allergic/ anaphylaxis reactions can occur to all types of vaccines in r esponse to various compo- nents of vaccines, although, such reactions are rare. In over 25.1 million doses of various vac- cines administered to children and adults, 33 cas- es of severe allergic reactions including anaphy- laxis occurred (1.31 per 1 million vacci ne doses). Among more than 7.4 million doses of IIV3 vac- cine given, there were 10 cases of anaphylaxis (1.35 per 1 million doses) (5, 13) . The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has reported that egg -free recombinant influenza vaccine also caus ed rare allergic /anaphylaxis reac- tions among patients with egg allergy and patients allergic to IIV; thus reaction to vaccine is not in- evitably related to remnant of egg proteins (14). Therefore, it is necessary to determine exactly other constituents of vaccine that cause anaphy-Iran J Public Health, Vol. 4 8, No.4, Apr 2019, pp. 758-763 762 Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir laxis reactions and detect IgE response to vaccine constituents in recipients. Ovalbumin as a marker for the egg protein in influenza vaccines may vary according to seasons, manufacturers, and vaccine lots (2). Nowadays all manufact urers of influenza vaccine indicate that their vaccine contains less than 1 \u00b5g of ovalbu- min per dose. Although the allergic reaction to egg protein in vaccine varies from egg protein in the food, so far, the minimal dose of egg protein that can cause an al lergic reaction has been 130 \u00b5g, and the amount of egg protein that cause no reactions in 99% of patients with egg allergy has been 30 \u00b5g. In this way, even in children with egg-allergy, the amount of egg protein in the in- fluenza vaccines is not sufficient to stimulate al- lergic reactions (1). The median ovalbumin con- tent of a seasonal and H1N1 influenza vaccines were 350 and 21 ng/ml, respectively (15). We did not detect egg protein (ovalbumin) content of administered influenza vaccine. A cohort study using live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), which contains less egg protein than IIV3, had no systemic reaction in the two hours after vaccin ation. Urticarial/angioedema was seen 30 to 120 min after LAIV administra- tion in two recipients, but after weeks they re- ceived a second dose of LAIV without any reac- tion. Possible allergic reactions (local urticaria, nasal and oropharyngeal symptoms) were report- ed in nine patients. Lower respiratory tract symp- toms within 72 h were reported in 62 patients (16). Therefore , the rate of reactions to vaccine is not related to amount of egg protein in the vac- cine. We also had some similar minor reactions in our v accine recipients. Maybe other constituents of vaccines cause reactions. People with egg allergy are not at more risk to al- lergic reactions than general people, and it is not necessary for prohibition of inactivated influenza vaccine (8). Patients with egg allergy could be safe- ly vaccinated with monovalent influenza A (H1N1) vaccine, although, those patients had ana- phylactic reactions to egg (9). However, results of our study are compatible with previous studies. We could not determine the concentration of egg proteins in the vaccines; in addition, we could not determine probable IgE antibodies to egg proteins or to an other constituent of vaccines in our popu- lation . Among the strengths of this case -control study are the large sample size, clinical profile of patients with egg allergy and patients with asthma or rhinitis in our study population. Finally, admin- istration of IIV3 in patients with egg allergy, and asthma or rhinitis seems to be safe. Conclusion Although the risk of anaphylactic reactions to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy was rare, the vaccine should be administered by an allergist with precaution. The results of present study can be a confirmation of the existing evidence s in order to prevent acute compli cations to influenza vaccine.
