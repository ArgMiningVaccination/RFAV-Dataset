Like all academic libraries of the 21st century, we are hybrid facilities to an ever increasing extent, preserving past knowledge while offering the latest resources, services and information technology. To do this well necessitates acquiring extensive and appropriate resources, enabling ready and straightforward access to them, and using both traditional and cutting-edge methods of acquisition, access and delivery of service to users. Technology and access to information are being transformed at a pace that requires dynamic, research libraries to be more nimble and flexible than ever before. New emphases in research and teaching, and the heightened expectations of the UMDNJ user community require that the libraries be proactive in anticipating needs, customizing information services that respond to user requirements and designing facilities that enable new kinds of interaction. The UMDNJ Libraries embrace the 21st century concept of knowledge management. These include the systems and processes used to acquire, organize, store, access, retrieve, teach and disseminate knowledge and information in all formats - traditional and digital. The University Libraries provide a critical portal, where scholarship in all formats is discovered and used, where collaborative education takes place, and where students, faculty and staff can find the expert assistance of highly trained librarians. The scholarly resources made available by the UMDNJ Libraries, combined with effective knowledge management, are crucial competitive assets in an era of massive change in health care and information technology. Access to scholarly resources and information services to the students, housestaff, faculty, and staff is our primary goal. The Li braries are continually expanding information access, in particular, to electronic scholarly resources available onsite and remotely. Currently, the Libraries provide access to 84 electronic databases, 607 major electronic textbooks and 4,350 of the most highly rated scholarly electronic journals in the health sciences. Utilization of licensed electronic resources, online books and journals exceeded 2.3 million uses in FY2009. The University Libraries are more aggressively supporting electronic journal subscriptions while continuing to cancel large numbers of print journals at each of our campus libraries. As a result of the reduction, we attempt to address the ongoing needs for new electronic content and archival collections. The reduction in print subscriptions is essential to our ability to continue access to the electronic versions of the journals. Currently, all UMDNJ libraries are fully wirele ss environments, providing flexible learning and study spaces for all users. New technologies are currently being implemented that will enhance library services to the Univ ersity community. These include expanding access to electronic resources using open-link/URL technology through a comprehensive knowledge base called SFX and deploying federated search capability enabling searches of multiple resources simultaneously. Improved data security and authentication practices have been a priority ov er the past year as the libraries move closer to a single sign-on process. The UMDNJ Libraries contribute to UMDNJ's community services goals and the reality of Internet medicine through HealthyNJ, an extensive consumer health Web site 31 UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES (http://www.healthynj.org ). The recent link to HealthyNJ on the University's main Web page will dramatically increase its utilization. HealthyNJ assists consumers in their quest to rapidly find patient/consumer information tailored to a wide range of cultural, education, and language needs. Currently, there are over 400 total topics in the Diseases and Conditions and Health and Wellness portals. Of these, over 200 topics are fully available in Spanish. The site has recently been enhanced with \"Read Me First\" entries resulting in more widespread use. The Libraries received funding to join other states in the National Library of Medicine's Go Local project, which provides information about health services in local geographic areas, including hospitals, physicians, nursing homes, support groups, and health screening providers throughout New Jersey. The University Libraries continue to work collaboratively to enhance knowledge management in the clinical practice, educat ion, research, and community service to meet the increasing challenges facing UMDNJ as a major academic health center. The Libraries play a critical support role in supporting learning and the creation and dissemination of new scholarly resources. The libraries strive to be an active catalyst for scholarly communication and knowledge management. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES http://www.umdnj.edu/librweb NEWARK CAMPUS UMDNJ-George F.

Using the vast resources of UMDNJ's eight medical, science, and health-related schools, UMDNJ- CCOE serves as the University's focal point for providing continuing medical education to physicians and other healthcare providers. In doing so, UMDNJ-CCOE supports UMDNJ's commitment to facilitate the \"transla tion\" of discoveries at the basic science level to the actual treatment, management, and prevention of disease. Content The content of the UMDNJ-CCOE CME program addresses gaps between \"best practices\" and \"current practices\" with the intention of improving practitioner competence or performance and/or patient outcomes and encompasses a broad range of primary and specialty topics. In the context of nationally-established competencies for physicians as defined by the Institutes of Medicine and the American Board of Medical Specialties, the content of UMDNJ educational interventions is derived from experts, national specialty guidelines and consensus statements, observed quality management indicators, and the needs of learners. The content of CME is matched to those assessed gaps and addresses strategies to close those gaps. Target Audience UMDNJ-CCOE serves several pr incipal audiences, as follows: Local and Regional Internal learners through their participating affiliated institutions who participate in a comprehensive regularly scheduled series (RSS) program that encompasses grand rounds, M&M conferences, tumor boards, and other series scheduled on a regular basis. Regionally-based physicians throughout the State of New Jersey who rely upon UMDNJ-CCOE to provide education on new developments in medicine and for those competencies they must master for relicensure and recertification. National and International Physician-learners throughout the United States and throughout the world who look to UMDNJ as a source of expertise based on distinctions earned by its distinguished faculty. Collaborative audiences in partnership with specialty societies and jointly sponsored activities. 34 CENTER FOR CONTINUING & OUTREACH EDUCATION UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 Types of Activities UMDNJ-CCOE chooses its educational design as a means to assure that the education offered matches the learning styles of its learners, is appropriate to the learning objectives, and provides mechanisms and processes to sustain change in physician behavior. When possible, educational interventions include interactive learning methods such as case studies and question-and-answer sessions to address adult learning styles and reinforce desired outcomes. Non-educational interventions, including tools to enhance the potential for successful outcomes, are also employed. When an activity is delivered in UMDNJ's academic centers, options such as simulation and multimodal sequential layering of information are incorporated. UMDNJ's options for activity delivery include: Live conferences, workshops and teleconferences Regularly scheduled series (RSS) Journal-based CME Enduring materials Internet-based education Jointly-sponsored collaborations with non-accredited organizations that are not commercial interests Expected Results Educational outcomes measurement (EOM) mechanisms are determined based on the intended result of the activity. For Improvement in Competence - When an activity is designated for \"improved competence,\" it will measur e competence based on the administration of either (1) a case study with questions that determine ability of the learner to apply the knowledge learned in a patient care setting, (2) a questionnaire that assesses the learner's ability to apply knowledge learned to patient care, or (3) a paired-question model in which competence is assessed prior to and immediately after the learning episode. For Improvements in Performance - When an activity is designated for \"improved performance-in-practice,\" a follow-up questionnaire will be administered to some or all learners to determine if key new behaviors and practices were actually implemented in the practice setting. ... For Improvements in Patient Outcomes - When an activity is designated for \"improved patient outcomes,\" it will be measured based on either (1) actual chart entries through quality management resources, or (2) through anecdotal reports from learners based on their observation of patients subsequent to the learning episode. From Evaluation to Improvement - The analysis of EOM data will form the basis of improvements to UMDNJ's overall CME Program. A process of continuous quality improvement is fundamental to UMDNJ-CCO E. The determination of improvements and active management of the implementation of planned improvements is a part of all staff meetings, management meetings, and meetings of the CME committees at both the New Jersey Medical School and Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Our program of 35UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 CENTER FOR CONTINUING & OUTREACH EDUCATION quality assessment and improvements is directly tied to the commitments made in the CME Mission and are in concert with the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) updated Criteria for Accreditation. OVERVIEW The Center for Continuing & Outreach Education serves as a the \"hub\" for the University's continuing and outreach educati on thrust and is the official \"approved provider\" for all continuing education ac tivities sponsored by the University. The CCOE draws upon the multiplicity of resources within the medical, osteopathic, health related professions, nursing, dental, public health, and biomedical science schools of the University and the network of UMDNJ affiliates throughout the state. Because CCOE works within the strictest interpretation of all relevant governmental and industry regulations, the importance of centrali zed administration of all the University's continuing education and educational outreach activities assures coordinated efforts for the comprehensive development and implementation of state-wide programming of the various schools and institutes, and all significant or distinguished continuing and outreach education initiatives. An experienced and well-credentialed staff is available to assist in the development and implementation of continuing education and educational outreach activities. The day-to-day operation of the department is headed by the Director of Operations, Continuing Education. Many staff possess master's degrees as well as certificates in adult and continuing education, public health, business, accounting, communications, marketing and advertising, and fund-raising management. Co llectively, their expertise, education and background provide UMDNJ with an unparalleled resource The continuing medical education thrust emanates from three UMDNJ Schools: New Jersey Medical School, Newark; Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick; and the School of Osteopathic Medicine, Stratford. Enrollment & Student Services and Financial & Accounting Services : To optimize physical and human resources, CCOE employs a centralized staff dedicated to providing a variety of customer support services and accounting and financial services in support of the University's continuing education and educational outreach mission and activities.

This paradox is by no means unique to UMDNJ, but quite common in academic health centers, in which excellence in education often is subordinated to research and clinical achievements in promotion and tenure decisions. To emphasize the value placed upon faculty excellence in teaching, consistent with the University's strategic goals, Dr. Stuart Cook formally launched the Master Educators' Program at UMDNJ at his inauguration on April 9, 1999. Shortly thereafter, a University-wide committee chaired by the Dean of the UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions (SHRP) was convened to determine the scope of the program and the general criteria to be employed in selecting Master Educators throughout the Schools of the University. The committee recommended the creation of a UMDNJ Master Educators' Guild, charged to help the University forge excellence in education throughout its Schools and to provide leadership in the continuous improvement of the teaching/learning continuum of the University's educational mission through educational scholarship, research and innovation. In June 2004, the Guild was officially named the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educators' Guild, in honor of its founder. The Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educator Award recognizes faculty members for a commitment to excellence in education as demonstrated over a long period of time. It moves beyond the concept of excellence in teaching to the more global concept of education, which includes the considerations of learning and teaching styles, and the multiple settings in which education occurs at UMDNJ. Toward this purpose, the recipients of the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educator Award are expected to work together in the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educators' Guild to continuously improve education at UMDNJ. Through a formal structure and bylaws that were first approved in September 2001 and revised in 2005, the Guild provides a stable foundation and home for the Master Educators to bring their influence to bear on the improvement of education throughout the Schools of UMDNJ and to share this expertise with educators in health sciences venues across the nation. Criteria: Nominees for Master Educator designation must demonstrate: Exceptional teaching skills in either a traditional modality of education (lecture, laboratory or clinical teaching) or an alternative form of teaching such as web-based education or another form of distance learning. Creativity in curricular design or innovation in the delivery of education to students; currency in knowledge. The requisite level of scholarship. Efficiency and effectiveness in teaching. The ability to engender enthusiasm among students, such that they are motivated to master the relevant subject matter or clinical competency. High regard as an excellent educator by his/her peers. 88 FACULTY UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 Within these general University-wide guide lines, each School of UMDNJ has developed specific criteria for selection and has established a Master Educator Review Committee comprising faculty, students and faculty administrators. ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO DATE Induction of Guild Members : In September 2000, the first 12 Master Educators were selected and inducted into the newly formed Master Educators' Guild. Additional classes have been inducted annually, with a curr ent total of over 66 members from the eight Schools of the University. It is a diverse group with regard to professional background and focus, and in 2006 the first librarian was inducted. The Guild is actively engaged in several projects, described below. Online Resource Center for Professionalism and Academic Integrity (2008 - ongoing) The Guild is creating an Online Resource Center for Professionalism and Academic Integrity . The audiences for the Resource Center will be both the internal UMDNJ community (administrators, faculty and students), and those external to the University with shared interests in promoting professionalism and academic integrity in the health professions. The overall goal of the Resource Center is to promote academic integrity and professionalism both within and outside the UMDNJ community via the online provision of appropriate information resources and training. Specific objectives of the proposed Resource Center are: 1. Establish and maintain a network of faculty groups (e.g., School committees) and administrators to identify and promote University-wide best-practices, academic integrity strategies and professionalism initiatives; 2. Consolidate and make more readily accessible all applicable University and School codes, statements and policies and procedures related to professional behavior and academic integrity; 3. Provide appropriate training programs for UMDNJ students on academic integrity; 4. Serve as a gateway to resources on professionalism and academic integrity practices (including those developed within UMDNJ) specifically targeted to the needs of faculty, students and administrators in health professions education. Master Educators' Strategic Plan (2008) The Guild developed its first 5-year strategic plan on April 1, 2008. The plan will form the framework around which the Guild will operate in the next five years. The plan identified five strategic goals and strategies to accomplish these goals. The strategic goals are: 1. Facilitate teaching and education excellence for faculty and students (infrastructure) 2. Increase emphasis on teaching as a valued role in mission triad 3. Increase impact and visibility of Guild with administration, faculty and students 4. Improve internal organizational structure and effectiveness of Guild 5. Expand active participation of Guild members 89UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 FACULTY Master Educator's Website (http://meg.umdnj.edu ) (2008) The purpose of the website is to provide its members online access to documents pertaining to the operation and structure of the Guild. It also serves as a forum for its members to share ideas related to promoting excellence in teaching. Online Center for Excellence in Health Sciences Education and Teaching (http://cte.umdnj.edu ): This Center, which helps the Guild achieve its role in promoting educational excellence through the innovative use of information technologies, was established and funded through the University 's Educational Technology Mini-Grant Program. The Center has three primary goals: to support, promote and enhance School and University-wide faculty development, furthering collaboration across the University by overcoming the barriers of time and place; to serve as a comprehensive resource center for the health sciences teaching community at large, projecting the University's educational expertise outward to the worldwide Internet community; and to provide a \"virtual home\" for the Master Educators' Guild. Officially launched during the 2004 University Day ceremonies, the Center's website provides a venue for the following activities: Coordinate and disseminate information on faculty development opportunities provided by the UMDNJ Schools (via an interactive online calendar). Provide University-wide mentoring and consultation services (via a new faculty mentoring program, a searchable database of faculty consultants, and a consultation discussion forum). Offer selected online programming of broad interest and appeal (via WebCT courses/tutorials). Publish and provide desk-top delivery of regular features on selected teaching and learning topics (e.g., educational technology, student evaluation, problem-based learning, clinical education, etc.). Serve as a dynamic repository of scholarly information on teaching and learning in the health professions (via provision of prestructured PubMed bibliographic queries and a large searchable database of relevant educational literature). Serve as a gateway to related sites (including other online University teaching centers and education and technology e-journals). Provide opportunities for external enrollment in selected online courses and tutorials offered by the University and/or Guild. Serve as the Guild's electronic archiv es, providing background information on the Guild, its origin, purpose, history and achievements. Provide a Guild Gallery, to include members' biographies and links to their research/scholarship. Furnish a gateway to the Guild's collaborative intranet. Use of the Center for Teaching Excellence continues to be robust. In the one-year period of May 2008-2009, the Center for Teaching Excellence had 149,272 visitors (+31% from the same 07-08 period) and 301,166 pageviews (+18% from the same 07-08 period). Visitors came from 206 countries/territories, with 87% of them being new to the site. Faculty Mentoring Initiative: Academic Mentoring is a major initiative of the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educators' Guild, reflecting the conviction of the members of the Guild that an organized system of mentoring will promote educational improvement 90FACULTY UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 across the University. The Guild already prov ides informational resources on mentoring through its Online Center, and has developed draft recommendations and guidelines on faculty mentoring. The guidelines first provide an overview of successful mentoring models, including the roles and responsibilities of both mentors and mentees. They then focus on mentoring at UMDNJ, including structure, responsibilities, incentives, evaluation and the role of the Stuart D. Cook, M.D. Master Educators' Guild in the process. Academic Integrity Initiative: In association with the theme of Academic Integrity selected by the Master Educators' Guild for its AY 2005-2006 Grand Rounds and Symposium (see below), the Guild formed a Committee on Academic Integrity. The Committee has gathered data from all Schools to determine the current status of academic integrity and activities designed to foster academic integrity at UMDNJ; analyzed the existing honor codes and codes of ethics of each School; and prepared a \"white paper\" that presents recommendations for unification or standardization of guidelines among all Schools. The Committee disseminated the document to the UMDNJ President and Academic Deans for review/adoption. Annual Master Educators' Guild Symposia: Since 2002, the Guild has sponsored a series of annual symposia open to all faculty of the University on topics it believes to be integral to its purposes. Each has featured a distinguished keynote speaker as well as workshops, demonstrations, discussion groups or poster sessions led by Master Educators and other faculty members. Themes have included educational technology, academic mentoring, the scholarship of teaching and learning, collaboration and interdisciplinary education, and academic integrity. In 2009 Lindsey Henson, MD PhD, Vice Dean for Education and Professor of Anesthesiology, University of Minnesota Medical School gave the keynote address during the 2009 Symposium \"Portfolios in Competency-Based Education: Keys to Success.\" Annual University Day Educational Grand Rounds: Beginning in 2003, the Master Educators' Guild instituted another innovative approach to the attainment of its mission: Educational Grand Rounds during the annual University Day program in September. Topics generally complement the theme for the spring symposium, and have included professionalism among health care providers, integrating professional education and facilitating collaboration through mentoring, and academic integrity. 91UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 200 9 FACULTY ENDOWED CHAIRS UMDNJ-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL Wesley J.

The University offers a myriad of programs and activities that serve our State and advance the health and quality of life of its residents. By providing more than 240 community service programs throughout the State, UMDNJ extends prevention, health care and related services to a ll of New Jersey's communities. Many of these programs target medically needy populations or those at high risk of particular health problems. A Community Resource Directory outlining all major community programs, activities and initiatives offered to the public, including health promotion, disease prevention, educational enrichment, neighborhood development and economic empowerment, is on UMDNJ's Urban and Community Development Website: www.umdnj.edu/comreweb . All of the Schools of UMDNJ provide students with opportunities for clinical education in community-based programs and settings, and foster cultural sensitivity and competence. Many sponsored research programs at UMDNJ focus on New Jersey's most urgent health problems. University faculty and scientists are helping to advance prevention and treatment in such areas as cancer; the effects of environmental agents on oral health; health disparities; and aging. UMDNJ faculty and staff also participate in numerous boards and organizations, volunteering many hours to address health, education and other issues affecting New Jersey. UMDNJ's commitment to public service is further exemplified by our substantial employment of urban and minority residents, the purchase of goods and services from minority-owned and special vendors, and partnerships with community-based organizations. These activities contribute to the redevelopment and economic growth of the cities and regions that host the University's campuses. Provided here are highlights of a few of the many University programs and services that continue to make a positive impact in New Jersey. For more offerings and updated information, visit UMDNJ's Urban and Community Development Website at www.umdnj.edu/comreweb and select \"Community Resource Directory.\" 103UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES EXAMPLES OF PUBLIC / COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES ALLIED DENTAL EDUCATION (SHRP) The Department of Allied Dental Education provi des clinical dental preventive services to approximately 400 New Jersey veterans through affiliation with the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Orange, N.J. Dental hygienists in clinical rotations at New Jersey Dental School (NJDS) in Newark and at SHRP's dental clinical facility on the Scotch Plains campus also provide preventive dental treatment to members of the public. While at NJDS, Dental Assisting students assist dental students in providing dental patient services. The faculty and students from the Department's Dental Assisting and Hygiene programs also provide community service presentations to thousands of participants at over 30 events annually at various locations throughout New Jersey. These events include health fairs, classroom presentations, career fairs, shadowing programs and special events during Children's Dental Health Month in February, such as the national Give Kids A Smile program and related activities. ANCORA AND GREYSTONE PARK CLINICAL AFFILIATION (SHRP) The overall purpose of the Greystone Park affiliation is to enhance the quality of patient care services at this state psychiatric hospital by im proving the competencies of direct care staff. To that end, five faculty members from the Department of Psychiatric Rehabilitation provide a variety of programming and technical assistance initiatives that impact some 250 patients at Greystone Park annually. These initiatives include on-site undergraduate psychiatric rehabilitation course work, in-service training to improve staff group work skills, and specialized programs like the Program Readiness Mall for patients unable to use traditional hospital programs. ANTI-STIGMA INITIATIVE \"MEETING AND LEARNING FROM PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS\" (SHRP) In collaboration with persons with serious m ental illness and Collaborative Support Programs of New Jersey, SHRP faculty provide 30 presentations annually to over 800 children and adults in middle schools, high schools, colleges, and community groups. Those attending meet people with mental illness and learn from them about their recovery and the importance of seeking help. ASIAN RISK ASSESSMENT COURSE (SPH) In collaboration with New Jersey Institute of Technology, the UMDNJ-School of Public Health (SPH) taught environmental risk assessment in a month-long course funded by the Asian Development Bank. This was the fifth year that the course was taught in Bangkok, Thailand at Chulalongkorn University. The School also continues to assist the faculty at Prince of Songkla University in Hat Yai, Thailand in furthering development of the Center for Toxicology and Risk Management, which was established in 2001. Through collaborative funding from the Environment al Health Sciences Center at UMDNJ and working with the Prince of Songkla University faculty, two studies have been initiated in Southern Thailand looking at lead and arsenic contamination in children in two villages.

It includes brain health activities to improve memory as well as education concerning the benefits of good nutrition, regular exercise and management of chronic disease. In addition to keeping mind and body healthy, the focus is to increase awareness of the importance of early evaluation of memory problems. This outreach effort, originally launched in September 2004, targets the 55+ age group and has also served a large church-affiliated minority population in Camden County. It continues to be one of the most requested community programs offered by the NJISA, having served over 2,500+ New Jersey senior residents since its inception. BRIDGING THE GAPS (SOM) UMDNJ joined the Bridging the Gaps (BTG) program as a network affiliate in 2007 as a means of linking the inter-professional training of health and social service professionals with the provision of health-related services for underserved and economically disadvantaged populations. BTG strives to facilitate the collaboration of these diverse voices for mutual benefit, creating a model of partnership, respect and understanding between communities and future health and social service professionals. Working under the auspices of the UMDNJ-School of Public Health on the Stratford campus, UMDNJ-SOM participates in BTG by matching medical students with nonprofit community partners in New Jersey. Students' projects are designed in collaboration with the community organizations based on community-defined needs and the professional discipline and interests of the students. During the 2008-2009 academic year, three medical school students worked, via the BTG program, on behalf of the Camden Area Health Education Center, the Hope Community Outreach Center and Planned Parenthood of Southern NJ. BRIDGING THE GAPS (SPH) In the summer of 2008, UMDNJ-School of Public Health again participated in Bridging the Gaps. This consortium of universities from around Pennsylvania and Delaware was established in 1988 to encourage service learning. SPH in Stratford created three interdisciplinary teams of students from public health (SPH), medicine (SOM) and GSBS. The students, who were paid a summer stipend, were placed at the Camden AHEC (Area Health Education Council), Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey and Hope Community Outreach Center in Camden. The students worked for seven weeks on service projects of benefit to the Camden community. In addition to working four days a week at their site, once a week students participated in workshops in Philadelphia on various community i ssues ranging from violence to oral health to approaches to working with youth. The students worked with inner-city youth in several summer programs. They taught workshops on nutrition and phy sical exercise, visited local South Jersey farms and took the children shopping at the Camden Farmers Market where they bought fresh produce and cooked healthy meals. The students worked with adults at Planned Parenthood where they conducted health workshops for pregnant mothers and provided information on reproductive health at the Camden Farmer's Market. They also assisted with the needle exchange project in the city. For more information on Bridging the Gaps, contact Dr. Bernadette West at westbm@umdnj.edu . 106PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 CAMDEN CITY HEALTHY FUTURES COMMITTEE and CITY OF CAMDEN COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT PROJECT (SPH) The Camden City Healthy Futures Committee, whose membership includes representation from the UMDNJ-School of Public Health, the UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine and the UMDNJ Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities, is dedicated to improving the health of the citizens of Camden. The objectives of the Committee are to promote a continuing dialogue among Camden health care and other organizations and to initiate a process that promotes a sustainable network for future joint planning and health delivery in the city. SPH faculty and students on the Stratford/Camden Campus continued to assist the Camden City Healthy Futures Committee in conducting their community health assessment. Faculty and students serve on the committee and are assisting with health planning around targeted public health issues, including development of a cable te levision series with segments focusing on teen pregnancy, diabetes, street violence, mental health, and asthma. For more information on this project, contact Dr. Bernadette West at westbm@umdnj.edu or Dr. Sherry Pomerantz at pomerash@umdnj.edu . CAMDEN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER (SN) The Community Health Center (CHC) is a joint venture of the UMDNJ-School of Nursing and the Camden County Council on Economic Opport unity (CCCOEO). CCC OEO invited the participation of the School of Nursing to include health care in its array of services offered to Camden residents. The services provided include primary care with referrals to local acute care facilities, health screening programs, and education and advocacy efforts. The majority served are either uninsured employed residents, uninsured students from local colleges and post- secondary trade schools or unemployed resident s receiving Medicaid. The CHC receives financial support from an endowment awarded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation and from the School of Nursing directly. CHC provides both primary care and health screenings at the following sites on a regular basis: 1) CCCOEO headquarters; 2) Acelera Early Childhood Center; 3) the Hispanic Family Center; and 4) the Urban Women's Center. These health screenings focus on detection of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, anemia, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and tuberculosis. In addition, adults with acute episodic health problems and those requiring physical examinations are also cared for at the CHC. Since its establishment, the CHC continues to be an invaluable resource to Camden City residents. Hundreds of patient contacts are made annually by CHC staff, and its reach is expanding through partnerships with community service organizations. For both prelicensure and graduate level nursing students and students of osteopathic medicine, the CHC provides essential learning regarding the delivery of a broad array of community services at a local, very accessible level for the residents of Camden City and its environs. CAMDEN COUNTY HEALTH SERVICES CENTER AT LAKELAND (SOM) The UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine, under a professional services contract, provides all mental health and primary care services fo r the Camden County Health Services (CCHS) Center at Lakeland. 107UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES The Department of Psychiatry provides staffing for all units in behavioral services. This includes eight psychiatrists, five advanced practice nurses and three psychologists. Department faculty are responsible for evaluation, medication monitoring and treatment team leadership for all psychiatric patients. The Department of Family Medicine is responsible for all primary care of patients at the CCHS Center. If patients need to be admitted to Kennedy Health System-Washington Township Division (KHS-WTD), Family Medicine facilitat es the admission and care with the UMDNJ-SOM Hospitalist team at KHS-WTD. Ira Cuttler, M.D., a UMDNJ-SOM New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging geriatrician, continues to provide primary care medical services to more than 230 older residents at Camden County's long-term care facility at Lakeland, with over 3,000 visits logged in the past year. This facility is 99 percent Medicaid supported. THE CAMDEN SATURDAY HEALTH CLINIC (SOM) The primary goal of the clinic, which is held every Sa turday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., is to provide urgent, primary and preventative health care, as well as health education, to the medically underserved population of Camden. To foster an interdisciplinary environment, the Camden Saturday Health Clinic (CSHC) is managed and operated by UMDNJ-SOM students in collaboration with practitioners from an array of health care disciplines. Since the clinic is a collaborative project with the School of Nursing, Dr. Carman Ciervo, Chairman of UMDNJ-SOM Family Medicine, and Dr. Susan Salmond, Dean of the School of Nursing, have enhanced the inter-professional cooperation between the two schools to further improve the delivery of healthcare services at the clinic. The School of Nursing provides services at the Clinic on Wednesdays that ar e followed up on Saturdays by Family Medicine. Patients are seen by appointment or on a walk-in basis by a team of two medical students who perform the initial patient exam/assessment. An attending physician from the SOM Family Medicine Department then sees the patient and guides the team to develop a treatment plan. Services offered include acute care for walk-i ns; immunizations; school physicals; gynecological testing HIV testing and counseling; STD education; screening tests for chronic diseases (i.e., high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, asthma, anemia, and depression); chronic disease management; and health education. Not only does the CSHC provide service to the community, but it also promotes cultural awareness and interdisciplinary experiences for medical students as part of their educational experience. The CSHC is supported by school-sponsored fundraising events as well as by grants and donations. This initiative was launched in June 2004 with funding by a \"Caring for Community\" (CFC) grant award from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAM C), in collaboration with the Pfizer Medical Humanities Initiative. SOM was one of only eight medical schools in the country to win this award. Most recently, in May 2009 , two first-year students, along with Dr. Ciervo, received one of only seven nationwide 2009 CFC grants from the AAMC. This special national award provides funding in support of SOM's Fam ily Medicine Clinic and its REACH (Revitalizing Education and Advancing Camden's Health) project. 108PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY (RWJMS) The Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ) is committed to expanding its capacity to provide exceptional and innovative outreach to New Jersey's medically underserved populations. The CINJ Office of Community Outreach works in conjunction with the Gallo Prostate Cancer Center, the Middlesex Country Cancer Coalition, the Healthier New Brunswick 2010 Community Health Advisory Group, the New Jersey Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan members and the New Jersey Cancer Education and Early Detection program to meet the cancer education and outreach needs of its community constituents. The Novartis Outreach and Education Project (NOEP) Established in 1998 with a grant from Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation, the goal of the Novartis Outreach and Education Project at CINJ is to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of the statewide cancer research clinical trial population. The project combines target outreach and education efforts to both the medically underserved and health care provider segments of New Jersey. The project provides seed funds and program support for local community organizations to provide cancer education and outreach programs throughout the State. This innovative program provides technical and grant support to help community organizations become self-sustaining partners in providing their own cancer education and awareness. The program facilitates increased knowledge and trust, both of which have been shown to be major barriers to cancer clinical trial participation for members of medically underserved groups. Medical literature and the American Cancer Society have published data showing disparities in cancer outcomes, with the African American and Latino population suffering poorer survival rates and later disease stage at diagnosis. In response, many of the current NOEP grantees are focusing specifically on the African American and Latino populations. The Dean and Betty Gallo Prostate Cancer Center The Center has developed many strong community ties that have been instrumental in increasing prostate cancer screening and education programs throughout the State, including screenings held at churches, clinics, and village gatherings and advertised through local papers, radio stations, bulletins, food stores, and community centers. The Gallo Center's advocacy has a national reputation, and this year also began new outreach and advocacy programs for women who suffer as those they love deal with prostate cancer and its treatment. Continuing Umbrella for Research Education The Continuing Umbrella for Research Education (CURE), originally established in 2003 with a grant from the National Cancer Institute, is now funded by Johnson & Johnson. The program enrolls eight students each year - four from Rutgers and four from the New Brunswick Health Science Technology High School - to conduct research at CINJ. Running for two summers and the academic year in between, the program provi des students with an excellent opportunity to experience the research environment and develop and pursue opportunities for careers in science. Community Activities CINJ Community Outreach staff work with Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and other area institutions to offer annual free screenings for prostate, breast and skin cancer. The Office of Outreach also designs curricula for cancer prevention and screening educational programs as well as informative treatment-related lectures to community organizations. Information on cancer screening and clinical trials is offered in both English and Spanish, and the Office of Community Outreach is enhancing its translation service to provide additional patient educational materials on other topics. 109UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES The Office of Community Outreach (OCO) maintains an Outreach Calendar and Reporting Forms to help plan, coordinate and track all CINJ outreach and screening activities. As of February 2007, staff and faculty of CINJ have: conducted 52 outreach activities (inclu ding cancer-related community education presentations, health fairs and community festivals) attended by 26,165 individuals; educated 1,071 community members about CINJ, cancer, its early detection, prevention (including prevention trials) and clinical trials; distributed 16,121 pieces of cancer-related educational literature; and conducted 453 free (prostate) screenings for the community. Other CINJ Activities A patient-relief fund was established with patient donations to assist with transportation, parking, etc., for indigent individuals. CINJ is active in New Jersey Cancer Education and Early Detection (NJCEED), a program sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control that provides cancer screenings for uninsured individuals in all 21 New Jersey counties. Our physician faculty members serve actively on NJCEED's Medical Advisory Board, chaired by CINJ's Deputy Director for Extramural Affairs. The CINJ Outreach Director co-chairs the NJCEED educational committee. CINJ collaborates with the NJ Commission on Cancer Research and the American Cancer Society on a project funded by Aventis entitled IMPACT, Improving Minority and Medically Underse rved Participation and Access in Clinical Trials. It is targeted to the Newark, Camden, Trenton, Jersey City, and Paterson communities. CINJ collaborates with the UMDNJ-School of Public Health on a grant to identify barriers to participation in cancer clinical trials among African Americans and Hispanics in New Jersey. In a goal to increase colorectal cancer screening awareness in populations with low literacy, OCO is developing a 7-10 minute video outlining current screening options in lay terms. To measure participant understanding of video content, a ten-question survey has been developed that will measure changes in pre- and post-test knowledge. CINJ Office of Community Outreach has developed clinician-friendly screening guideline pocket guides for breast, prostate, cervical, and colorectal cancer. One thousand copies were printed for distribution to statewide partners, including clinicians within the CINJ Hospital Network and family practice providers throughout New Jersey. A targeted mailing to more than 100 solo and group practices within the NJ Family Medicine Research Network was also completed in December 2008. CINJ has partnered with the National Cancer Institute's Information Service to develop a series of symposia on evidence-based outr each programming. These symposia will be offered free of charge to CINJ Network institutions, community organizations and the general public. CINJ has also hosted simila r symposia on health literacy and cultural competency. Through funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, OCO hired a full-time bilingual Program Development Specialist to oversee the development and translation of relevant materials for diverse audiences. In addition, OCO recruited a Program Development Analyst 110PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 who has been charged with the development, impl ementation, and evaluation of programs and services to meet the needs of the growing cancer survivorship population. More specifically, the grant uses the following strategies to increase cancer awareness: Translation services: OCO provides no cost translation services for community partners, CINJ departments, and CINJ network institutions. To date, OCO has served CentraState Medical Center, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Cooper Cancer Institute, Gloucester CEED Program, New Jersey Fam ily Medicine Research Network (NJFMRN), Monmouth Cancer Coalition, South Asian Total Healthcare Initiative, and various internal CINJ departments. Materials development: Through the use of Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. and OCO's Community Education Review Committee (CERC), and in partnership with the CINJ Network Colorectal Cancer Task Force, OCO developed patient education fact sheets regarding colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing (FOBT). To meet the needs of New Jersey's culturally and linguistically divers e audiences, fact sheets were developed at the lowest reading level possible and translated into five initial languages: Spanish, Portuguese, French/Creole, Vietnamese, and Hindi. Initial feedback was very positive, and in response, documents will also be translated into: Gujarati, Urdu, Chinese, Korean, and Arabic. In addition, two educational PowerPoint presentations - one community-based, one clinical - have been developed for health professionals to pr ovide setting-appropriate instruction on colorectal cancer. The community PowerPoint presentation has also been translated into Spanish for use in the Spanish-speaking community with bilingual health educators and/or clinicians. Health Education Materials Archive: The OCO is developing a health education materials archive for clinically accurate and culturally appropriate materials from sources across the United States. As a joint initiative betw een OCO and CINJ's Bioinformatics team, this interactive portal will allow for searching via keyword, population, and cancer site, as well submission of materials for inclusion and ordering of materials. OCO is committed to supporting the objectives contained within the New Jersey Comprehensive Cancer Plan. Moreover, the work of New Jersey's Cancer Education and Early Detection Program (NJCEED) is aligned with OCO's charge to ensure education and screening is provided to all New Jerseyans. Members of CINJ's OCO and OEA serve on several statewide committees sponsored by the NJDHSS, such as the New Jersey Cancer Education and Early Detection (NJCEED) - Public and Professional Education Subcommittee and County Cancer Awareness Coalitions (Middlesex, Mercer, Essex, Monmouth, Ocean, and Somerset Counties). Samples of statewide projects include: Choose Your Cover (August 2008, August 2009): Sponsored by the Ocean County Cancer Coalition, a multi-site melanoma screening held over two days on the Jersey Shore. CINJ provided promotional and educational materials for more than 1,000 participants screened. This program has been expanded for 2009 to include the entire shoreline from Monmouth to Cape May County. Monmouth County Oral Cancer Screening (March 2008, 2009): Sponsored by the Monmouth County Cancer Coalition, CINJ provided NCI-designed educational materials for a month-long screening with dentists throughout the county. In 2008, more than 100 sites agreed to provide no-cost screenings for the general public. 111UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES NJDHSS Breast Cancer Library Project (October 2008): In partnership with the NJDHSS and NJCEED, CINJ provided breast health educational and promotional materials for a mailing to more than 200 libraries throughout the state of New Jersey. CARES INSTITUTE (SOM) The Child Abuse Research Education and Service (CARES) Institute at SOM provides state-of- the-art medical and mental health services to children and families who have experienced child abuse and neglect. CARES also provides a wide variety of training and educational services to the community, directed towards children, parents, teachers, social workers, law enforcement, mental health clinicians, and/or medical professionals.

CENTER FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS (SN) The Apostle House of Newark Food Pantry - The School of Nursing Community Ambassadors and the Student Government Association jointly sponsored a food drive for The Apostles' House Food Pantry during the 2008 holiday season. Both faculty and students participated in this very successful campaign to raise awareness and to bring holiday cheer to many families in need. The SN Community Ambassadors also participated in the Apostle House Adopt a Family Program, providing age-appropriate holiday gifts for families that submitted a wish list to staff at Apostle House UMDNJ Day in Trenton - Five School of Nursing student volunteers participated in UMDNJ Day at the State House in Trenton, NJ on Thursday, October 23, 2008. UMDNJ-SN volunteers 113UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES provided weight and blood pressure screenings in collaboration with the UMDNJ-SN New Jersey Children's Health Project, distributed healthcare literature, attended a legislative session, and met with elected officials. CENTER FOR BIODEFENSE (NJMS) UMDNJ established the Center for BioDefense in 1999 in anticipation of bioterrorism attacks taking place in the United States. Since its founding, the Center has grown into a leading entity in the area of counter-terrorism, biodefense and emergency management. In light of the terrorist attacks in 2001 and of the President's commitment to protect America against future attacks, we are proud that New Jersey is able to join national efforts through the Center for BioDefense at UMDNJ. The breadth of the projects that the Center is supporting demonstrates its close relationship with State efforts to increase New Jersey's state of preparedness. The Center has gained a state and national reputation for its leadership and rapid response to the new age of bioterrorism. Since October 2001, members of the Center have embarked on an ambitious schedule of seminars, conferences, and other training sessions to educate scientists, clinicians, first responders, public health professionals, and the general public on terrorism and biodefense. Its members testify in Congress, deliver briefings, and serve on committees of the National Academies of Science and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. CENTER FOR SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION (SPH) The Center for School and Community Health Education (CSCHE), headquartered in New Brunswick, follows a mission to empower diverse populations to make informed decisions about their health through innovative outreach, creative partnerships and applied research. CSCHE translates leading scientific research into comprehensive educational materials through several outreach initiatives including professional development; curriculum development; website development for classroom enhancement and parental involvement; the Safe Schools Program; and community outreach. Professional Development Training workshops support the use of CSCHE materials and the integration of health-based topics into school curricula. Through hands-on workshops, participants experience the curricular materials as both students and teachers, promoting teachers as learners. Participants familiarize themselves with the activities, discovering how the lessons and activities are interrelated and build upon one another, ultimately preparing them for the classroom. CSCHE workshops are designed to meet the specific needs of each target audience. To achieve this goal, CSCHE employs several teacher training m odels, including national train-the-trainer programs; regional teacher workshops held pr imarily during the summer; and both short- and long-term district collaborations to train all teachers at a specific grade level(s). To date, CSCHE's programs and services have impac ted more than 7,200 teachers and 140,000 students in 29 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and overseas. Train-the-Trainer Programs: Using a train-the-trainer approach to increase the number of people who have the capacity to train teachers on select curricula is the most efficient method for ensuring nationwide curriculum dissemination through professional development. This mechanism greatly increases the number of teachers/students impacted when compared to one organization acting alone. These programs may involve the collaboration of several school districts, educational/environmental organizations and universities' education and outreach programs. Trainers are trained to facilitate workshops for teachers in their area focusing on health-related curricula. 114PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 Regional Teachers' Workshops: The annual Health Sciences Summer Institute for Educators, Grades K-12, continues to meet the needs of teachers throughout New Jersey. The Summer Institute offers workshops facilitated by CSCHE staff and health educators, scientists and classroom teachers. Workshop topics included toxicology, risk assessment, epidemiology, infectious diseases, real-life science and safe wo rk practices for teenagers. Since inception, 2,083 teachers have been trained through the annual Summer Institute to use health science as a theme for learning. District-Specific Teacher Workshops : With support from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), CSCHE conducted the SUC 2ES 2 (Students Understanding Critical Connections between the Environment, Society and Self) program from 2000-2008. SUC 2ES 2 was a partnership between CSCHE and the Woodbridge Township School District, in collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Education, the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University and Rider University . The goal was to develop three integrative, environmental health units, one for each of the di strict's second, fifth and seventh grades, based on the award-winning ToxRAP (Toxicology, Risk Assessment and Pollution) curriculum series. A critical project component was the implementation of a comprehensive evaluation of the ToxRAP materials and additional activities. This evaluation determined the effectiveness of the curriculum in increasing environmental health lite racy and in improving science attitudes among students. To date, all three curriculum guides have been developed and implemented in all of the district's elementary and middle schools. Student pre- and post-tests were conducted in treatment and comparison schools at each of the district's three grade levels. Preliminary results for all grades showed significant improvement in student learning. Curriculum Development Lesson plans containing current and impartial information increase public health literacy, with an emphasis on environmental health, while enhancing educational resources in elementary, secondary and vocational school classrooms (grades K-12). Teaching techniques include problem-based learning, games, graphing, hands-on experiments and case studies. Age- appropriate investigative science, math, health and language arts activities present students with real-life scenarios through which they lear n problem-solving, decision-making and critical- thinking skills. These tools for lear ning are readily transferable to other areas of students' lives. Select modules are also available in Spanish-bilingual and all-Spanish versions. Materials, where applicable, are indexed to state and national education standards. Working with the LIFE Center at The Cancer Institute of New Jersey (LPGA Pros in the Fight to Eradicate Breast Cancer), CSCHE developed BioCONECT, a new high school science curriculum that uses breast cancer as the context. The module enables both female and male high school students, through the process of scientific inquiry, to identify risk factors for breast cancer; learn how cancer develops; and make life-style changes to reduce the risk of cancer. The module targets science classrooms. The lessons follow fictional 14-year old twins, Steve and Nikki, as they discover their mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Via the twins' website, the students help the twins work through the associated scientific and psychological issues over time, as the twins' family moves through diagnosis and treatment. At critical decision points, students use their knowledge to share information using the twins' online forum. Safe Schools Safe Schools is a project supported by the New Jersey Department of Education, Office of Career and Technical Education, to assist schools in reducing risk due to occupational safety and health hazards. Safe Schools involves a number of outreach components designed to 115UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES support teachers, administrators, safety and health designees, structured learning experience/career orientation coordinators, county apprenticeship coordinators, cooperative education coordinators and those involved in school-to-careers. As one of its components, project staff developed recommendations regarding prohibited and restricted hazardous automotive and diesel work activities for minors (youth under the age of 18) involved in school-sponsored structured learning experiences. These recommendations, which were developed through a Safe Schools Program Task Force for the New Jersey Department of Education and the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, will guide revisions to New Jersey child labor laws. In addition, 1,193 teachers and administrators in New Jersey were trained during 66 courses focusing on occupational safety and health issues through the Safe Schools Program. Much of the training focused on preparing participants to meet the new teacher licensing requirements related to ensuring students associated with school-sponsored structured learning experiences are placed at safe work sites. Community Outreach The five-year HOPE Partnership (Health Observances and Public Education), made possible with funding from the National Center for Research Resources, is a collaboration of seven universities. The HOPE Partnership concentrates on three established national health observances that focus on diseases, illnesses or ailments to which a majority of the population can relate: Cancer Control Month, Allergy and Asthma Awareness Month and Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. Partners develop, implement and evaluate outreach programs that contain educational materials designed to raise public awareness of how research is leading towards the prevention, detection and/or treatment of diseases/illnesses. The materials are being implemented through community learning, formal and informal education, the media, non-profit organization events and science centers/museums. Team members have completed more than 50 focus groups among project target audiences (middle and high school students and teachers and the general public) to help guide the development of the educational materials. The Health Observance Package for Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month (held every May) wa s reviewed by target audiences and implemented in spring 2007 and 2008. The educational materials for Lead Poisoning Prevention Week (nationally observed the third week of Oc tober) were reviewed by target audiences and implemented in fall 2007 and 2008. Materials for Cancer Control Month (held every April) were reviewed by target audiences and implemented in spring 2008 and 2009. CSCHE is partnering with Oregon State University; University of Ariz ona; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; University of Southern California/University of Ca lifornia Los Angeles; University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center; and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. For more information on CSCHE programs and services, contact Ms. Laura Hemminger at hemminlb@umdnj.edu . CENTER FOR TOBACCO SURVEILLANCE AND EVALUATION RESEARCH (SPH) The Center for Tobacco Surveillance and Evaluation Research (CTSER), formerly known as the Tobacco Surveillance and Evaluation Research Program (TSERP), was first established in 2000 to evaluate New Jersey's Comprehensive Tobacco Control Program (CTCP) and is responsible for monitoring tobacco use trends in response to the State's tobacco control activities. The Center now includes multiple research projects, and its overall mission is to enhance the evaluation and surveillance of tobacco control as well as industry initiatives and strategies. 116PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 A key priority of CTSER is the dissemination of its findings. Since 2000, CTSER has produced over 25 reports and briefs for NJ CTCP, delivered over 100 conference presentations, and published over 35 journal articles. In addition, CTSER faculty have previously provided testimony before state lawmakers on potential legislative action related to tobacco products and advertising. For more information on this project, contact Dr. Cristine Delnevo at delnevo@umdnj.edu . COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY (RWJMS) The UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) has collaborated with Rutgers University and Seton Hall University in developing a number of programs aimed at increasing the enrollment of underrepresented minority students in medical school and the sciences. ACCESS-MED is a consortium program for undergraduates offered by Rutgers, Seton Hall, and RWJMS to provide academic enrichment, support and counseling for educationally and financially disadvantaged students pursuing health science careers. The Office of Special Academic Programs adminis ters two summer programs that it is hoped will increase the diversity of biomedical researchers, physicians and other health care professionals: The Biomedical Careers Program is an six-week joint RWJMS-Rutgers University program for educationally and financially disadvantaged undergraduate students interested in careers in medicine or other health professions The Pre-matriculation Summer Program allows educationally or financially disadvantaged incoming medical students to preview selected topics in anatomy, biochemistry, and cell biology/histology All of these programs, as well as RWJMS' affirmative action efforts, have contributed to the School's successful diversity efforts. RWJMS has maintained a commitment to increasing diversity within the medical school class by recruiting underrepresented students in medicine. The School is also collecting data about faculty diversity and is actively seeking to increase the recruitment, retention and promotion of underrepresented minority and women faculty. In recognition of the School's commitment to improving the health of the communities served and to increasing diversity, RWJMS has developed specific strategic goals and objectives related to these areas. These goals and objectives are part of the School's five-year strategic planning process. To facilitate planning and implementation of initiatives aimed at meeting these goals, the School has created subcommittees for community health and promoting diversity. Each committee has representation from faculty and administration for promoting diversity and health in the community. DR. CHARLES E. BRIMM MEDICAL ARTS HIGH SCHOOL (SOM) SOM Family Medicine third-year students and residents participate in a program for the Dr. Charles E. Brimm Medical Arts High School (locat ed at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden) in which they discuss health-related issues with high school students, including potential careers in clinical medicine. The well-received program--part of the federal Kids in Health Care program\u2014is being expanded to include more health prevention education programs for Camden's 7th and 8th graders by SOM Family Medicine physicians. Over the past six years, the SOM Family Medicine Department has also participated in Camden's Summer 117UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES Medical Youth Program, which promotes careers in the health sciences. Over the past year, third year students from UMDNJ-SOM have performed a Community Oriented Primary Care (COPC) project at the Brimm School that focused on meeting with students about opportunities in affiliated medical careers. On May 21, 2009, UMDNJ-SOM students provided health screenings and information at the Brimm Medical Arts High School Health Fair in Camden. COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD (SOM) \"Given the strong commitment to community health and service by the UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine, it is essential that residents from local communities and the region play an important role in advising our school to help support our continued growth, diversity and development,\" said Dean Thomas A. Cavalieri, D.O in announcing the creation of the UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine Community Advisory Board in early 2008. The Board brings together civic, business, academic and religious leaders to advise the School on fulfilling its commitment to excellence. Dr. Cavalieri said he was honored by the prominent local residents who agreed to share their talents and time to promote medical education, research and community-based health programs se rving Southern New Jersey. Recognizing that the school has made significant contributions to the health of the state's residents since its creation over 30 years ago, the UMDNJ-SO M Community Advisory Board focuses on supporting and expanding the school's programs, sustaining its leadership in diversity, and developing new alliances to further its mission. The Community Advisory Board participates in regular roundtable discussions of the school's progress and serves as liaison for the academic, research and health care leaders at SOM with individuals and groups that share an interest in addressing future needs. COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH (SOM) The majority of UMDNJ-SOM Department of Ps ychiatry services are provided through contractual arrangements with community based mental health organizations. SOM faculty, contracted by these agencies, treats indigent, Medicaid, Medicare and managed care patients throughout South Jersey. Patients come to these agencies from the surrounding counties in the South Jersey area. In fiscal year 2008, the Department contracted with 14 various community agencies and schools, along with four hospital based systems. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER INSTITUTE (CHWI) (SOM) One of only two statewide initiatives in the country aimed at developing the emerging profession of Community Health Worker (CHW), the Community Health Worker Institute (CHWI) is administered through the Camden Area Health Education Center (AHEC). Its goal is to enable medical and other health professions students in UMDNJ to gain knowledge about the potential of community health workers to improve healt h literacy, increase knowledge about cultural sensitivity and cultural competence in health care delivery, enhance quality of care and provide diverse learning experiences in underserved communities. The CHWI, based at UMDNJ-SOM, was initially established by the Camden AHEC in 2001. In 2004, through SOM, CHWI obtained federal funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services-Health Resources and Services Administration (DHHS-HRSA) for a Model State-Supported AHEC. A new three-year grant to support the NJ AHEC program and the 118PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 CHWI was approved for 2008-2011. Plans include expansion of community service learning sites to northern and central New Jersey under the aegis of the NJ AHEC CHWI. The CHWI has facilitated identification of competencies/standards and training resources for community health workers that can be applied statewide and that will ultimately lead to clear identification of this important new occupation. It is also finalizing a 200-hour curriculum for community health workers which will provide a consistent level of training based on the identified core competencies. The UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions is assisting in the development of this model curriculum. As the nation moves toward health care reform, community health workers will play a large part in working with minority and underserved communities in improving access to care and empowering individuals to take responsibility for their own health care. COMMUNITY NUTRITION INITIATIVES (SHRP) Annually, the SHRP-Dietetic Internship Program participates in several community nutrition initiatives. For the past two years, these initiatives have been targeted to children and adolescents through efforts with Girl Scouts in NJ. Supermarket tours emphasizing shopping for a healthy heart were conducted with students from Trenton Central High School in conjunction with the Teen Esteem Program sponsored by the Women's Heart Foundation. To celebrate National Nutrition Month, culinary presentations and nutrition exhibits were presented to high school students from the Union County Academy of Health Sciences, and \"You R What U Eat\" workshops were conducted for Girl Scouts from the Delaware-Raritan Valley Girl Scout Council. THE COMMUNITY- ORIENTED DENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAM (NJDS) The Community-Oriented Dental Education Program (CODE) is in its fourteenth year of having fourth-year pre-doctoral dental students deliver care under faculty supervision in NJDS' extramural dental centers in southern New Jersey. Students, who move into the area near one of the community-based facilities, participate in organized community projects throughout the year and come to Newark for didactic instruction one day each week. COMMUNITY ORIENTED DENTAL EDUCATION-II (NJDS) A new CODE II Program established this year by grants allows all pre-doctoral senior students an opportunity to rotate through New Jersey D ental School's extramural dental centers in Atlantic and Camden counties for a two-week experience. These students, like the CODE students selected for the original program, participate in organized community projects. COMMUNITY SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS (NJDS) All undergraduate students are required to perform four community service activities per year for their four years at New Jersey Dental School. Many NJDS students elect more than the sixteen required activities prior to graduation. Each student performs clinical oral health education and acquires cultural competency as well as the ability to work with variable age groups in our population. 119UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES CRISIS SERVICES FOR CHILDREN (SOM) Over recent years, public schools have focused close attention on students who exhibit at-risk behaviors. Most districts enacted policies requiring that any child who exhibits behaviors which cause suspicion of potential harm to others or self be suspended, pending an evaluation supporting their safe to return to school. As there is a dearth of child psychiatry in South Jersey, these students often are directed to a regional crisis center. The 14-bed Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit (CAPU) at the Cherry Hill Division of Kennedy Health System is in its seventeenth year as a state-designated Children's Crisis Intervention Services facility. Since its inc eption, the UMDNJ-SOM Department of Psychiatry has supplied medical services for this unit. The unit is designated as the regional unit for child and adolescent psychiatric admissions for Camden, Burlington, Gloucester, and Salem counties. The CAPU is also the secondary unit for Atlantic, Cape May, and Cumberland counties. The average length of stay is approximately one w eek. Over 40% of admissions to the CAPU are compensated by Medicaid, and approximately 10% are services provided to children and adolescents who are either indigent or have no health insurance. CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE (SOM) The SOM Department of Family Medicine has formed an interdisciplinary partnership with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Graduate School of Social Work, to teach a course entitled \"Cultural Competency and Interdisciplinary Healthcare Delivery.\" Through this course, medical students, graduate students in social work and other healthcare professionals from the community are trained to be culturally competent and skilled in interdisciplinary healthcare delivery. This past year, the SOM Department of Family Medicine ran four programs on cultural competency for over 550 community physicians from around the State of New Jersey, which received positive feedback for meeting the needs of local communities. The Area Health Education Centers (AHECs) suppor t this course by providing a two-week service-learning experience for these medical st udents at host sites in a medically underserved community. These sites include a homeless shelter, an HIV/AIDS mobile van, a senior center, a primary care clinic, and a hospice. Students implement the cultural and interdisciplinary skills learned in the course in their community service rotation. DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH (NJDS) The NJDS Department of Community Health provided oral health education programs, screening and/or treatment at many sites throughout New Jersey and the nation. Here are examples of events and places visited: Essex County College Child Development Center Liberty Science Center Native American Reservation Pallaca Arizona Native American Reservation Red Mesa Arizona Tri-City People's After School Program 120PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 Hispanic Coalition Statehouse - Oral Cancer Screening and Presentation for employees and legislators UMDNJ Day, Trenton - Oral Cancer table presentation New Community Center, Newark, NJ - Oral Cancer Presentation HIV Buddies Hackensack, NJ Senior Community Center of Piscataway New Jersey Milton School - Livingston Trinity Academy Early Childhood Center Jersey Shore Relay-Special Olympics Oral Cancer Walk, NY Hackensack Christian School Lakeview School (Children with cerebral palsy) Yeshiva Central Queens Elementary School Robert Treat Academy Asian & Pacific Islander Coalition on HIV/AIDS Kindercare, Newark Moriah School, Engelwood Nutley Extended Day Care Heywood Avenue School Healthfair, Orange Special Olympics-Special Smiles Lutheran Hospital Jewish Family Services, Meals on Wheels DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SYSTEMS & POLICY DOMINICAN REPUBLIC HEALTH OUTREACH PROJECT (SPH) The Dominican Republic Health Project began in 2003 when nine students and two faculty members undertook public health projects in the Haitian bateyes of the Dominican Republic (DR) to meet the field requirement of the three-credit course, \"Public Health Applications in Developing Countries.\" Bateyes are former sugar cane cutter camps that lack sanitary facilities, schools, and access to health and social services. The majority of Haitian women and children, although born in the Dominican Republic, are refused birth certificates so that they live like a stateless people. Since the Project's inception, over 100 students and faculty members have worked in the bateyes providing health education and promotion programs as well as primary care. In 2008, 22 students participated in the Project in April and July trips. Three trips are planned for 2009. In preparation for the trip, students and faculty plan specific public health interventions and obtain the resources necessary to implement them prior to their visit to the Dominican Republic. Typical projects include parasite control prog rams, primary care clinics, health education programs and assistance in nutrition and sanitation projects. During the Project's existence, students have raised funds that have been used to help purchase livestock, build a medical clinic, construct a water system and provide spec ialized medical care. Since 2007 the Project has supported the educational costs of 27 single parent Haitian children. In 2009, the project will begin construction of a bathroom and sleeping quarters on donated land to provide safe housing for the children and women who care for them. 121UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES For more information on this project contact Dr. Lois Grau at graulo@umdnj.edu and Dr. Bernadette West at westbbm@umdnj.edu .

CHANDLER HEALTH CENTER (RWJMS) The Eric B. Chandler Health Center (EBCHC) is the cornerstone of UMDNJ-RWJMS community-based programs. Founded in 1987 in memory of Eric B. Chandler, Ed.D, it is a comprehensive, family oriented community health center that opened in 1988. The Health Center is operated jointly by UMDNJ-RWJMS and the EBCHC Community Board, which together form the Health Center (co-applicant relationship). EBCHC was designated as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in January 1991 and received CHC Section 330 funding in October 1993. The Center is dedicated to providing high quality ambulatory health care services to low-income, uninsured and under-insured residents of the Greater New Brunswick community. The Center is also a training facility for residents and medical students at RWJMS. The primary care services provided at EBCHC include: Pediatrics & Adolescent services-inclusive of EPSDT and immunizations; Obstetrics & Gynecology-inclusive of family planning & colposcopy; Internal M edicine-inclusive of preventative health services; diagnostic laboratory; urgent medical care; follow up of hospitalized patients; geriatrics; preventative, restorative, and emergency dentistry. Dental services for children in grades K through 5 are also provided at the Lord Stirling School in New Brunswick. Other services include podiatry, HIV counseling and testing, early intervention and treatment, addiction services, clinical social services, translation services, community outreach, case coordination, health education and emergency transportation. Services provided by contract include diagnostic radiology and pharmacy services needed for quality continuity of clinic al care. Referral services provided include emergency care, mental health counseling and treatment, physical and occupational therapy, substance abuse and other medical specialties not provided on-site. Services provided on-site are offered 50 hours per week. Twenty-four hour coverage seven days per week is provided through a physician call schedule. The mission of the center is: To provide high quality ambulatory health care services that are culturally effective. To promote a healthy lifestyle and educate patients to assume responsibility for and participate in their health care decisions. To provide high quality educational opportunities for medical students, residents, physicians, nursing and other health professional students who train at the Center. All trainees will learn to provide culturally effective, respectful, quality health care in the context of the community. To serve as a community resource for health and social services. With the support of a federal grant, in March 2006 the Chandler Health Center opened an Annex in New Brunswick to expand its services . The new facility, five blocks from the main building, responds to the need for more medical and dental services and health education for the under-insured and uninsured population of central New Jersey. With two medical and two dental examination rooms, a patient education room, and offices for support staff, the services at the Chandler Annex have eased the long backlogs for appointments at the main Chandler Center. As part of an academic health center, Chandler actively participates in training medical students, residents, nursing students, and social work students. Emphasis is placed on 129UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES the use of a bio-psychosocial approach to patient care, with special attention given to helping learners understand the influences of poverty, poor education, cultural diversity and family structure on the delivery of effective patient care services. One of the primary goals of the Center is to teach learners about the unique issues that confront patients in an underserved urban setting. Each year over seventy residents and medical students rotate at Chandler. Internal medicine residents and pediatric residents are assigned to Chandler for their three years of continuity care experience. OB/GYN residents provide obstetrical care as well as continuity in gynecologic care. As part of its commitment to eliminating health disparities and improving clinical outcomes, the Center participates in the National Health Disparities Collaborative. Activities are designed to improve the overall care that each patient receives and to establish a process of improvement based on the Care Model. The Care Model fosters productive interactions between patients and a prepared practice team within a health care setting. The model is designed to maximize resources, use them effectively, and look towards the community for resources to help deliver evidence-based care. The Center is also committed to the PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) method for accelerating the change process and improving work flow, patient care, and other activities at Chandler. As a community-based health center, Chandler also collaborates with local agencies to address both health and social needs. For example, Chandler regularly participates in community health fairs and projects sponsored by the Healthier New Brunswick 2010 Initiative. In addition to its core clinical services, Chandler has developed the following community-based programs: Family Education Program This outreach project features a series of health education seminars on topics such as domestic violence, immigration, managed care, home safety and health maintenance. Prenatal Classes A series of classes for pregnant women is offered in English and Spanish three times a year to provide information about normal pregnancy, what to expect during labor, and normal child development. A separate series of prenatal classes is offered for expectant adolescent mothers with additional topics such as continuing education after the baby's birth and preventing unplanned pregnancies. Reach Out and Read Program To encourage reading to children from an early age, the Chandler Center participates with the National Reach Out and Read Program cooperatively with Rutgers University. At every well child visit, children are given books that are appropriate for their developmental level.

The Institute plays a leading role in the international arena, providing experti se in program development, education and training, and research to ministers of health, national TB programs and healthcare providers around the globe. A History of Excellence TB infections in the U.S. soared to unprecedented levels in the early 1990s. The UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School National Tuberculosis Center was established in 1993 in response to this resurgence. Under the direction of Lee B. Reichman, MD, MPH, it achieved federal designation as a national Model Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Center in 1994, indicating its success in delivering state-of-the-art treatment, conducting cutting-edge research, and providing education and training to all levels of health care providers as well as those afflicted with this deadly, yet curable, disease. To reflect this ever-expanding commitment to stamp out the disease even in the most remote locales, the Center changed its name to the Global Tuberculosis Institute in early 2006. Mission and Goals The mission of the Global Tuberculosis Institute is to advance state-of-the-art tuberculosis care through excellence in research, practice and teaching. The goals of the Institute are to decrease tuberculosis morbidity through state-of-the-art diagnostic, treatment and prevention programs; to create a cadre of interacting clinical and research scientists with a prime interest in the intersection of basic science, clinical and epidemiological aspects of tuberculosis; to develop and apply innovative diagnostic, therapeutic, behavioral, preventive and educational modalities for tuberculosis; and to provide an internationally recognized training center for courses and affiliations at all levels to increase the skills related to tuberculosis for physicians, nurses, epidemiologists and all other health-related professions. The Global Tuberculosis Institute's success has been achieved thr ough the realization of these goals. The Institute has developed proven effective practices, which are shared with others involved in the fight against tuberculosis. State-of-the-Art Care The Institute provides outpatient services at its state-of-the-art clinical facility designed from the ground up specifically for safe and effective treatment of tuberculosis. Renowned pulmonary and infectious disease specialists treat patients in the Waymon C. Lattimore Practice. Patient-centered care is provided through a multi-disciplinary team approach to address the complex clinical, social and cultural issues that impact the prevention control and elimination of tuberculosi s. Specialized care is given to children with tuberculosis, patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and those co-infected with HIV/AIDS. Demonstrated Effectiveness Since the Institute's creation, there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of tuberculosis cases within the population it serves. The Institute has an unprecedented record in patients' adherence in taking medica tion. Nearly all the patients--98 percent-- adhere to their medication regimen. Many people in the population that the Institute serves are coping with a variety of life's cha llenges, and taking medicine is not a priority. 136PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 To ensure that patients take their medications on time each day, the Institute implemented a widely used strategy called di rectly observed therapy, or DOT. As its name indicates, as part of the support system, this therapy involves public health workers visiting tuberculosis patients to watch them take their medication. It is these dedicated professionals who have been instrumental in the Institute's unprecedented success. Providing Worldwide Education and Training The Institute's Education and Training staff uses its wealth of knowledge and experience to develop educational resources, training programs, and distance learning opportunities. Training courses and individualized programs on specific tuberculosis- related topics are presented to physicians, nurses, healthcare workers, and government leaders across the country and around the world. New, web-based educational programs are available for those who may not be able to travel, yet desire the latest tuberculosis information. The Institute's website houses an extensive collection of downloadable and adaptable resources at http://www.umdnj.edu/gtbiweb , and the staff provides technical assistance to a variety of providers to develop and integrate training into their own unique circumstances. Regional Training and Medical Consultation Services As a federally designated Regional Training and Medical Consultation Center, the Institute is required to provide training, tec hnical assistance and medical consultation to healthcare professionals throughout the Northeastern U.S. The Institute's region includes Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia and the cities of Baltimore, Detroit, District of Columbia, New York City and Philadelphia. The Institute is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, with additional funds from U.S. Agency for International Development, NJ Department of Health and Senior Services and a number of non-governmental and private organizations and foundations. Medical Consultation Individualized information is provided by seni or medical staff to healthcare professionals and the public via a toll-free number, 1-800-4 TB DOCS (1-800-482-3627). This approach is well needed in the U.S. where rates of tuberculosis are declining along with the expertise and experience to deal with the disease and in high burden countries where resources may be less than adequate. When needed, the Institute provides supplementary advice to existing consultants for difficult cases of multi-drug resistant and pediatric tuberculosis, as well as for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS co-infection and others with complex medical management issues. Opening the Door to New Treatments and Practices The Institute is at the forefront of finding more effective ways to prevent and treat tuberculosis through groundbreaking research. As early as 1970, its staff was conducting clinical trials and doing studies in tuberculosis surveillance, patient behavior, and epidemiology. The Institute also collaborates closely with several of UMDNJ's centers and departments, including the Center for Emerging Pathogens and the Public Health Research Institute. Currently, the Institute is participating in the study of new drug regimens that could shorten tuberculosis treatment. The Institute is a member of Centers 137UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES for Disease Control and Prevention Tuberculosis Trials Consortium and Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium. An International Connection The Institute participates in program revi ews and provides policy guidance and technical assistance on a variety of topics including tuberculosis at the primary healthcare level, co-infections of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and patient care in the private sector. Physicians and educators from the Institute have participated in training, presentations and symposia around the world, including the regions of Eastern Europe, Central and Eastern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America. The staff is also involved in international research. The Institute also offers individualized training programs in specific aspects of tuberculosis control for physicians, nurses, educators, government officials and others working in the field of tuberculosis. Specialized trainings can be tailored to meet the interests and needs of international participants. Training is geared towards participants from countries with a high burden of tuberculosis and aims to build the knowledge and skills of participants in these settings. The Institute has hosted trainees from more than 25 countries all over the world. Priority is given to healthcare providers from countries with a high burden of tuberculosis that are mobilized to respond to the problem. HEALTH SCIENCE CAREERS PIPELINE (SHRP) The Health Science Careers Program, formerly Tech Prep, began in the 1993-94 academic year with three high schools and 12 students.

Directed by the Office of Community Health, a select group of students plan, carry out and write up collaborative population health based scholarly projects under the guidance of faculty and community mentors. The program involves students over the full four years of medical school. It includes service and didactic components, journaling, the preparation of a thesis for publication, and a presentation of the completed project to the sponsoring community organization and the RWJMS community. The DISC program adds a rigorous, scholarly component to existing community service projects, generates experience in population health scholarship, responds to health needs as defined by the community, generates partnerships with community groups, and recognizes students who distinguish themselves by independent, strong, long-term commitments to community health programs. MEDICAL SCIENCE ACADEMY (SOM) The Medical Science Academy (formerly the High School Scholars Program) is a 28- week medical orientation program for twelfth grade honor students from Camden, 144PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 Burlington and Gloucester Counties in South Jersey. Students meet every Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. on the Stratford Campus. Concluding its 25th year, the Medical Science Academy offers integrated and thematically organized presentations by UMDNJ -SOM faculty who volunteer their time to represent the medical and health care professions. Faculty address issues such as responsibilities to themselves, their patients, their institutions and their communities, as well as provide current information relevant to their work. Approximately 500 students have participated in the Medical Science Academy and many have either completed training in a health related profession or are attending undergraduate programs or medical schools. Students are able to participate in an optional research project sponsored by UMDNJ- SOM in collaboration with UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions. A total of 46 high school students participated in the Medical Science Academy during the 2008 - 2009 academic year. MEDICAL STUDENT VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS (RWJMS) The Homeless and Indigent Population Health Outreach Project (HIPHOP) was established by a group of RWJMS students in 1992 to help meet the health needs of the greater New Brunswick community. HIPHOP links medical students with the community in an attempt to reduce barriers that prevent community members from accessing primary and preventive health care and education. Program objectives of HIPHOP are: To provide a variety of health outreach services to an underserved population To provide medical, physician assistant, and public health students with meaningful service-learning experiences To create a heightened awareness of the role that RWJMS should play within its community To foster an atmosphere of responsible citizenship and encourage a lifelong commitment to community serv ice and humanism in medicine To expand the program locally in such a way that it might be duplicated on a national level The project has expanded from a small ad hoc group of dedicated medical students to a well-structured organization involving over 300+ medical and physician assistant students, faculty/staff members, and community representatives. In 2004, HIPHOP evolved into an umbrella program containing two major initiatives: the Community Health Initiative (C.H.I.) and the Promise Clinic. These initiatives are designed to link specific learning objectives for health professional students with the health-related needs of the community. The Community Health Initiative (CHI) has many projects and electives that promote healthy living practices, teach preventive health education, support and advocate for underserved and indigent populations and expose students to indigent primary health care services. The CHI Clinic Project offers community members increased access to primary care by assigning medical students to shadow and assist at St. John's Clinic, 145UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES EBCHC, Robert Wood Johnson AIDS Program and Edison Job Corp Wellness Center. These clinics and/or community centers serve indigent and underserved Greater New Brunswick area community members. HIPHOP student participants are exposed to indigent health care issues and their varied medical dynamics. The CHI-Health Workshop Project is an educational program that develops a community mentoring relationship while providing health promotion educational workshops. This is accomplished through a series of interactive workshops presented to various community based organizations and public schools in the Greater New Brunswick area. In these workshops students address issues such as HIV prevention, sexual health and responsibility, self-esteem, environmental influences on health and behavior, conflict resolution, nutrition, substance abuse and much more. The CHI\u2014Electives program comprises Students Teaching AIDS to Students (STATS), Patients At/In Risk (PAIR), Issues in Cultural Competency and the Underserved Community Elective (ICCUCE), and Literacy Initiative for Students Teaching Older Spanish Speakers (LISTOS). These programs are in place to provide students additional opportunities to support, advocate and understand the issues of at risk communities. The students who participate in these electives may volunteer to serve meals, attend lectures pertaining to issues of underserved populations, accompany at-risk young pregnant mothers to health literacy education sessions or clinics visits, or sit through a chemotherapy session with a patient. These are some examples of elective participation among the many different forms of elective participatory options. The final component of CHI is Project Outreach which offers a multitude of one-time volunteer experience for anyone who would lik e to get involved. Such experiences include serving at Elijah's Soup Kitchen, making knot blankets for the homeless, counting the homeless, reading to children, health fair participation, and organizing the program's annual drives and 5k Run. The Promise Clinic was started in January 2005 by a group of HIPHOP students to provide increased access to health care fo r the homeless who receive their meals and social services at Elijah's Promise Soup Kitchen, a shelter in New Brunswick. In the Promise Clinic, a student doctor team of first- through fourth-year students develops and implements a plan of care for their patients. This plan is overseen by volunteer faculty members from RWJMS who are the preceptors for this experience. The students collaborate with other groups to provide a broad range of social services to their patients and promote a culture of service among future health care professionals. The clinic is housed at an existing community health center\u2014St. John's Family Health and Services Center. The students manage an on-site medication room that provides medications free of charge under faculty supervision. Students assist clients with applying for patient prescription assistance programs and hospital Charity Care to offset the cost of: laboratory testing, imaging studies, and emergency care. Related health workshops are conducted to address topics such as nutrition and exercise to complement the care of the patient. Students are responsible for managing the operation of this experience (scheduling patients and faculty, purchasing and tracking medication). The Urban Health Initiative (UHI) at the RWJMS regional campus in Camden provides a broad range of services to the Camden community and is critically important to RWJMS-Camden students. UHI is an organized opportunity for third- and fourth-year medical students to become involved in t he Camden community in order to improve the overall quality of life of its citizens through service, charity, and education. Programs 146PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 include an Adult Health Outreach Project (HOP) Clinic, a Pediatric HOP Clinic, a Women's HOP Clinic, and many school and community outreach programs. In August 2000, the AAMC-Pfizer Caring for Communities Project awarded funding to third- and fourth-year medical students from RWJMS-Camden to support the development of the first Adult HOP Clinic. This clinic provides free medical care to 110 uninsured adult residents of Camden in a medical student-run facility at the LEAP Academy Health Center. Twenty-nine clinical fa culty volunteer as preceptors in the HOP clinics. Students staff all aspects of the clinic, from the front desk to the pharmacy. All third-year RWJMS-Camden students participate in this elective experience, and each student follows from one to three patients for the year. A Pediatric HOP Clinic, begun in 2003, now serves about 80 patients whose families are uninsured residents of Camden. A Women's Health HOP clinic, begun in 2005, serves up to 60 patients. In addition to the free clinics, the UHI arranges for medical student volunteers to teach CPR and First Aid in schools, day care centers and churches throughout the city, as well as a comprehensive family health curriculum for students in grades K to 9 at the LEAP Academy. UHI also sponsors a Mentoring Program in which medical students provide small group and one-on-one teaching on a variety of health topics to middle school students at the Promise Charter School. A joint program between UHI and Cooper Hospital, the Health Science Academy was begun in 2006 as an opportunity for Camden high school students interested in health- related careers to gain first-hand exposure to the hospital environment and to receive advanced teaching in the health sciences. After an application process, high school students are selected to participate in this year-long program, which occurs every other Wednesday afternoon. These students head straight to the hospital after school for additional lessons on a range of health topics, such as diabetes, cardiology, bone/joint fractures, and substance abuse. RWJMS-Camden students are actively involved in presenting these lessons and mentoring the participants. On alternating sessions, the students are taken onto the hospital floors for tours of various clinical departments and talks about a variety of careers within the hospital setting. Rarely today are patients given an extended am ount of time to spend with their primary care provider to ask whatever health related concerns they have. Adopted as a UHI project in 2006, the Ask-the-Provider program gives local Camden residents just that opportunity. Once each month, the program provides an open forum for them to ask health providers any questions they have in an informal, intimate, and relaxed setting. In cooperation with Respond, Inc., a local day care organization, several medical students have connected Camden residents with the medi cal expertise of volunteer physicians. This year, the program has taken on new shape, integrating a teaching segment for medical students to present a health-related topic to the evening's audience. Teaching topics this past academic year have included nutrition, infant feeding, asthma, children's health, and gynecological care. MINI-MEDICAL SCHOOL (NJMS) This program is designed to acquaint the community with the theory and practice of modern medicine, as well as to give them an understanding of the educational process involved in becoming a physician. NJMS public medical education programs are guided by a simple philosophical position: an educated patient is your doctor's best ally. By 147UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES empowering the individual, the physician and other health care providers are better able to serve the person. The Mini-Medical Sc hool program provides an education that is meaningful and enjoyable for each of its participants. MINI-MEDICAL SCHOOL (RWJMS) The Mini-Medical School program has become an integral part of RWJMS' commitment to community service and education. For the past six years the Mini-Medical School for High School Students--Achieving Excellence in the Sciences-- has served a class of over 180 students from high schools around the state. In addition to these students who share a profound interest in medicine and science, we teach their science teachers and their parents. The program provides opportunities for students to explore scientific interests and to speak at length with professionals who address patient care, research, and community service issues in their daily work. Over the sessions students attend lectures and discussion groups with faculty members who are national and international leaders in their fields - in areas as diverse as cardiac and renal transplantation, cancer biology and advanced therapeutics, stem cell re search, advances in neuroscience and \"the adolescent brain,\" pediatric AIDS and drug development, and culturally competent patient-centered care. Students have the opportunity to practice \"bedside manner\" in sessions with medical students acting as pat ients. As a final assignment students demonstrate self-directed learning by researching a topic and presenting it to classmates at their home schools. A diploma is awarded to mark this early achievement in health sciences education. MINI-MEDICAL SCHOOL (SOM) The Third Annual UMDNJ-SOM Mini-Medical School began on the Stratford campus in mid-March of 2009 and ran through early May. For those eight weeks, nationally and internationally-known faculty from the medical school led the students on in-depth discussions of specific health topics. The NJISA faculty participated in one of the eight week sessions presenting the latest information on Cognitive Dysfunction in Older Adults as well as the Implications for Caregiving. Class sessions took place in the same settings where SOM's medical students learn. Sessions covered the basic science and/or the clinical application of the week's topic, followed by interactive demonstrations or case illustrations. Topics included osteopathic manipulation, infectious diseases, biological nanotechnology, anti-depressant medications and menopause, among others. THE NATIONAL BORICUA LATINO HEALTH ORGANIZATION (SOM) Throughout the year, the UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine chapter of the National Boricua Latino Health Organization (NBHLO) sponsors a series of medical, cultural and social events for Hispanic Heritage Month, co-sponsors the Juvenile Diabetes Walk-a-thon, co-sponsors a Christmas party at a local nursing home and supports a mentoring program for high school students at LEAP Academy in Camden. UMDNJ-SOM students are active in the leadership of the NBLHO, which is a member of the National Network of Latin American Medical Students (NNLAMS). This is a national partnership between other regional Latino medical student groups to create one strong voice for Latino medical students throughout the United States. 148PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 The NBLHO has honored the student chapter at SOM as its \"Dr. Helen Rodriguez-Trias Chapter of the Year.\" The Dr. Helen Rodriguez-Trias Chapter of the Year award is given annually to the chapter that best represents the ideals of NBLHO, which include recruiting Latinos into higher education, advocating for increased Latino representation in health-related areas and promoting awareness about social, political and economic issues involving Hispanic populations. NATIONAL YOUTH LEADERSHIP FORUM ON MEDICINE (SOM) The National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine is designed to provide high school students from across the U.S. with exposure to the medical and health-related professions. Students from the NYLF visit the campus of UMDNJ-SOM each summer during the months of June and July. During their visit, students are exposed to osteopathic medicine and osteopathic manipulative medicine. The Mini-Medical School enables students to interact with medical educators as well as to learn the admissions process and understand the rigorous academic expectations for aspiring physicians. UMDNJ-SOM has sponsored the NYLF since 1998. A total of 90 high school students visited UMDNJ-SOM during the summer of 2008. NEW BRUNSWICK COMMUNITY INTERPRETER PROJECT (RWJMS) The New Brunswick Community Interpreter Project (NBCIP), formerly a grant-funded program now supported by the Office of Comm unity Health, currently provides Spanish medical interpretation and translation services in three area health centers: The Eric B. Chandler Health Center (EBCHC), The High Risk Obstetrics Ambulatory Care Clinic at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, and the Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ). The Interpreter Project represents the unique point in which three distinct communities come together: Rutgers students, Spanish speaking residents of New Brunswick, and doctors, nurses and medical students studying and working in the city. Through internships, federal work study jobs and volunteer opportunities, students have the exciting opportunity to explore the emerging field of medical interpreting while they develop solid job-related skills such as professionalism and enhance their Spanish language skills and knowledge of medicine. Mor eover, healthcare providers who partner with NBCIP interns have the opportunity to learn about issues such as cross cultural communication, the Hispanic culture and how to work with a trained interpreter. Founded in 1999, the program's interns have interpreted more than 75,000 patient-provider encounters, and over 100 vital medical documents and the EBCHC website have been translated into Spanish under the coordinator's supervision. The NBCIP has conducted basic interpreter training for bilingual staff at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey and for bilingual medical students in the RWJMS Department of Family Medicine. Additionally, for the past three years the NBCIP has participated in the bilingual workshop given by the Departm ent of Family Medicine for third-year medical students before they begin their clerkships. The program is staffed by two program coordinators and 35 student interpreters. 149UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES NEW JERSEY AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CENTERS (AHECs) (SOM) In collaboration with the New Jersey Area Health Education Centers (AHECs) and with the assistance of the Community Health Worker Institute (CHWI), the UMDNJ-SOM Department of Family Medicine has expanded it s clinical experiences in underserved communities for students during their first and second year. This year completed the transition from what was formerly known as the Community Oriented Primary Care (COPC) experience to the Community Involved Primary Care (CIPC) experience, where students develop and implement interventional projects on health promotion in underserved communities. First-year medical students were introduced to CIPC through an 18-hour course on conducting community-based needs assessments, accessing national and local resources, and identifying a community-specific health promotion/disease prevention project. As part of the experience, students participated in a \"community immersion\" experience through one of the three AHEC centers, where they met with a community health worker, representatives from community-based organizations, and members of the lay community to plan their projects. Projec ts developed in Year 1 will be delivered by the students in the fall semester of Year 2. The goal is to build on student experiences in underserved communities and forge a bond between the students and those communities, thus enriching the value of the experience and building an ongoing relationship with the AHEC centers and the communities in which they have become involved. All third-year students also participate in expanded Community Service rotations at NJ AHEC sites in Camden, Gloucester, Salem, Cumberland, and Atlantic counties. Host sites for these rotations include hospices, Head Start centers, federal prisons, migrant service organizations, adult daycare, local health departments, teen pregnancy prevention centers, and in-patient and out-patient substance abuse rehabilitation agencies. NJ AHEC also facilitates many Kids into Health Careers programs, such as the Medical Explorer program in Cumberland and Salem Counties; hospital job shadowing experiences in Gloucester County; Careers in Healthcare school fairs; and health careers curriculum to underserved middl e school students in Cumberland County schools. Students and faculty from SOM have participated in these activities with a goal of increasing the number of area minority and disadvantaged youth who pursue a career in the health professions. NEW JERSEY CENTER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS AT UMDNJ (SPH) The New Jersey Center for Public Health Preparedness at UMDNJ (NJCPHP), located at the UMDNJ-School of Public Health, is one of twenty-seven Centers for Public Health Preparedness funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control & Prevention at schools of public health across the country. The New Jersey Center develops and provides education and training designed to ensure that public health, health care, emergency response, and other workers are prepared to more effectively respond to any biological, chemical, or nuclear threats or emergencies, as well as infectious disease outbreaks and natural disasters. At the state level, NJCPHP works closely with both the 150PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 NJ Department of Health and Senior Services and the NJ Department of Environmental Protection. Service accomplishments for NJCPHP in the 2008-2009 academic year include the distribution of an online newsletter, PHLASH, to inform and to help coordinate preparedness education and training activities for the public health and healthcare workforce of New Jersey. Several education and training activities were conducted specifically targeting nurses, practicing physicians, medical students, hospital emergency room staff, and senior managers and their staffs in local and county health departments and the state health department, among others. These included two major conferences on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, and many smaller training sessions as well. Training was also provided to county and local emergency management and hazmat teams regarding radiological incidents, including transportation accidents and \"dirty bombs\". Two of the Center's faculty members served as Chair and Vice Chair of the State Health Department's Health Emergency Preparedness Advisory Council, and two members of the Center, representing the NJ Chapter of the American College of Physicians and the NJ Society for Public Health Education, are also members of this Council. NJCPHP expanded its formal educational work by opening the two preparedness courses developed for the SPH Graduate Certificate in Public Health Preparedness to Rutgers juniors and seniors; the courses are an integral component of a new undergraduate certificate in public health preparedness at Rutgers. For more information contact Dr. Glenn Paulson at paulsogl@umdnj.edu or Dr. George DiFerdinando at diferdge@umdnj.edu . THE NEW JERSEY CHILDREN'S HEALTH PROJECT: A PROGRAM OF THE UMDNJ-SN MOBILE HEALTHCARE PROJECT (SN) The UMDNJ School of Nursing (UMDNJ-SN), in a collaborative, joint partnership initiative with the Children's Health Fund and the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey, has implemented a Mobile Healthcare Projec t designed to improve access to care for the underserved residents of Newark, Irvington and Elizabeth, New Jersey. The Project staff provides primary care and screening services via a mobile healthcare facility designed to reduce the traditional barriers to health care access. This grant-funded initiative employs a collaborative approach and outcomes oriented focus for a nurse-faculty managed, university-based mobile healthcare project, in collaboration with the UMDNJ University Hospital. The Project effectively uses faculty-supervised nursing and medical students and an interdisciplinary mob ile healthcare team staff, in association with the clinical affiliates of UMDNJ, co mmunity-based organizations (CBOs) and faith- based healthcare initiatives. To foster community support, the Project uniquely creates public-private partnerships in the mutual goal to improve access to care for urban at-risk populations. The broad objectives of this nurse-faculty managed mobile healthcare project are: 1) to screen, identify and provide health promotion/disease management services for at-risk populations; 2) to foster community involvement in the health assessment and referral process; and, 3) to provide culturally and li nguistically sensitive health promotion/disease management health education. To implement this initiative, Dr Gloria J. McNeal, who serves as the Project Director, has secured over $2.5 million in federal and foundation grant awards from the Health Resources and Services Administration, The Robert Wood 151UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES Johnson Foundation, The Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey and the Children's Health Fund. Attesting to its widespread recognition, the Project has been showcased in the lay press and is the subject of numerous articles appearing in nursing publications. THE NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE FOR SUCCESSFUL AGING AND ITS NJ GERIATRIC EDUCATION CENTER (SOM) Administered through the New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging (NJISA), the New Jersey Geriatric Education Center (NJGEC) provides training in geriatrics and gerontology to health care professionals of multiple disciplines statewide, with a focus on minority and underserved communities. Federally funded by DHHS-HRSA's Bureau of Health Professions, the NJGEC has trained over 20,000 health care professionals from multiple disciplines since its inception in 1990. The current three-year grant cycle (2007-2010) focuses on \"Building Capacity and Optimizing Outcomes in Geriatric Care.\" The SOM NJISA and its NJGEC continue to work collaboratively with other institutions and organizations to provide training on a variety of aging-related topics. In November 2008, NJISA and the NJGEC participated in program planning and served as a co-sponsor for the annual conference of the New Jersey Geriatrics Society, in collaboration with the Long Term Care Leaders Coalition. The statewide conference, entitled, \"The Dollars and Sense of Prevention: Natural Progression of Eldercare,\" included nationally known speakers, and was attended by over 150 health care professionals from multiple disciplines from throughout the state. The NJGEC and NJISA continue to provide faculty support for the University Behavioral HealthCare-Technical Assistance Center as part of their contract with NJ Division of Mental Health Services. In June 2009, a two-day workshop, \"Mission Possible: Changing Culture, Changing Practice, Changing Care,\" was presented to \"champion teams\" of health care professionals from mu ltiple disciplines who work in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Content focused on systems change in facilities, within a context that addresses tolerance and capacity, cultural sensitivity, team process, and the use of assessment tools to enhance care. Introduction of a decisional algorithm for managing challenging behaviors and optimizing t eam input serves as the framework for facility-centered plans for change. This two-day workshop will serve as the basis for selection of five facilities that will become \"pilot\" sites for consultation and supportive intervention strategies for behavioral management, which is a project sponsored by NJGEC as it expands to include a larger state-supported initiative in \"transformational change\" in the mental health system. NJISA continues to offer clinical practicum experiences for nursing, social work and psychology, and nutrition students from UMDNJ sister schools, Drexel University, Rutgers School of Social Work, The College of New Jersey, and The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. In another joint research project, the UMDNJ-School of Health Related Professions and the NJISA provide medical nutrition therapy to community-dwelling seniors who use the NJISA for primary care medical services. Interventions include monitoring weight, blood 152PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 pressure, body fat and eating and exercise habits. This individually designed program provides participants with nutrition assessment ; identification of nutrition-related health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer; and diet counseling, behavioral modification, and dietary intervention, including how to track what they eat. There is also an exercise component, which includes a walking program. NEW JERSEY POISON INFORMATION AND EDUCATION SYSTEM (NJPIES) (NJMS) New Jersey's first poison center was established in the late 1950s. By 1975 there were 32 \"Poison Control Centers\" located in acute care hospitals throughout the state. In 1978, in response to a federal initiative to develop regional emergency medical services, New Jersey developed a task force to look into how to provide poison center services. In response to this initiative, the state legi slature passed enabling legislation calling upon the New Jersey Department of Health to develop a drug and poison information program for the State. In February 1983, as the result of this legislation and in a cooperative effort between the New Jersey Hospital Association and the New Jersey Department of Health the regional poison control system, New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES) was born. NJPIES is a member of the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) and is designated as a regional Poison Control Center under AAPCC guidelines. Additionally, NJPIES manages the Department of Health and Senior Services AIDS/STD hotline. The Center also serves as an information source for the NJDHSS in cases of product tampering or product recall and in food-borne illness incidents, performing a valuable public service in time of crisis. NJPIES provides 24-hour, 7-days-a-week emergency service statewide for poison exposures and for general poison and drug information. Specialists in poison informat ion, who are physicians, registered nurses or pharmacists, handle all calls. Many of the specialists are fluent in Spanish and several are fluent in additional languages. NJPIES also has a contract with a telephone interpretation service which allows immediate access to hundreds of languages and dialects. We offer TDD/TTY service for the hearing impaired. Specialist s answer questions about adverse effects of medications, possible risks for drug interaction or the potential effects of medicines on pregnancy or breast feeding. Specialists also answer questions prior to exposure to or use of a potentially poisonous or hazardous product, such as household chemicals, plants, cosmetics or environmental contamin ants like lead. They help the callers to assess the possibility for harm or damage and give recommendations for minimizing or eliminating risk. The Poison Control Center is funded through a contract with the State of New Jersey, Federal and other grants, and from private donations. Lead Poisoned Children Lead poisoning from deteriorating paint that contains lead is a major hazard for urban children. Severe lead poisoning can lead to seizures and death, while lower levels can impair performance in school and increase encounters with law enforcement authorities. The New Jersey Poison Information and Educat ion System (NJPIES) has established the New Jersey Lead Consortium, a monthly meeting where individuals from varied organizations such as DYFS, Medicaid and HMO's--as well as MDs, RNs, social workers and industrial hygienists--come together to discuss prevention/treatment of lead- 153UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES poisoned children. At the monthly meeting, problem childhood lead-poisoning cases are reviewed, appropriate speakers are invited, and/or current journal articles are presented and discussed. NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH HIV / AIDS (SHRP) This initiative, funded by Ryan White Title A and B, embodies UMDNJ's four missions: education, research, patient care and community service. For six years, SHRP's M.S. in Clinical Nutrition faculty has been providing nutrition services to individuals with HIV/AIDS in the Infectious Disease Practice at University Hospital and other Newark agencies. This program started in 1998 with Ryan White Title III funds (which initially supported a half-time Registered Dietitian) and gradually increased with Ryan White Title I monies to one full-time RD in 1999, the equivalent of 1.5 RD's in 2000, and then to two R.D.'s in 2002. Currently, there is one full-time RD in the clinic program. The program fulfills a critical need in Newark, a city with one of the largest HIV/AIDS populations in the U.S. Nutrition education services, food and clothing drives, a food bank for patients and education of staff and patients have helped to provide a valuable service to the New Jersey community. OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE (SPH) Centers for Education and Training The Centers for Education and Training (CET) provides training to over 3,000 men and women at its training facility annually, offering 250 continuing education short courses. The courses focus on environmental and occupational safety and health topics. Training is provided to professionals who are responsible for occupational safety and health or environmental management. Trainees include industr ial hygienists, safety professionals, occupational health nurses and occupational physicians. Courses include: Asbestos Training Confined Space Ergonomics Hazardous Materials & Waste Site Operations Hearing Conservation Indoor Air Quality Industrial Hygiene Lead Training for New Jersey and New York State Noise Protection Occupational Medicine Occupational Health & Safety OSHA Compliance Process Safety Management Respiratory Protection Spirometry Toxicology & Risk Assessment CET courses are held at the SPH Building in Piscataway. This central New Jersey facility affords excellent accessibility by public transportation, parking facilities adjacent to the building and easy access to downtown New Brunswick. CET's courses are held in modern classrooms and a hands-on workshop room . Additionally, CET provides off-site 154PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 training to industry and governmental agencies. Led by experts in the field, classes are structured to be small enough to allow active discussion and personal attention, yet large enough to provide for a diversified group of participants. The Office of Public Health Practice (OPHP) manages cooperative agr eements with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. New York / New Jersey Public Health Training Center The NY/NJ Public Health Training Center is a collaborative project between the UMDNJ- School of Public Health, the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, and the State University of New York at Albany School of Public Health. The mission of the Center is to enhance the ability of the current and future public health workforce to effectively deliver the Essential Public Heal th Services programs to the communities of New York and New Jersey. The Center is supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the New Jersey effort is based at OPHP. The Office of Public Health Practice collaborated in the development of the work plan for the upcoming years, including the developm ent of web-based training programs. The OPHP presented a seminar series on various public health topics, including dementia care; health literacy; multicultural health and health disparities; emergency preparedness and response for the public health professional; working with the medically underserved; public health response to sexual assault; challenges and opportunities in global environmental health; religion and health; and facing facts: sex and American teens. New Jersey Collaborative for Excellence in Public Health The NJ Collaborative for Excellence in Public Health (NJCEPH) was created as a result of the NJ Health Officer's Association (N JHOA) receiving a three-year Multi-state Learning Collaborative (MLC) grant. The MLC is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and managed by the National Ne twork of Public Health Institutes (NNPHI). It has been implemented in tandem with the efforts toward developing a national voluntary accreditation program for public health agencies. Because this is the third year such projects are being funded, it is referred to nationally as 'MLC-3.' NJCEPH is facilitated by a partnership of the NJ Health Officer's Association, UMDNJ- School of Public Health - Office of Public Health Practice, and the NJ Department of Health and Senior Services. Its goal, in the short term, is to provide members of New Jersey's public health system with tools, technical assistance, and training in quality improvement to help them identify ways of improving their organization's performance. In the long term, the outcomes of participation will contribute to the national standards/metrics to be used in the public health voluntary accreditation process, anticipated to begin in 2011. Emergency Personnel Safety and Health Learning Modules The Office of Public Health Practice is collaborating with Bandemar Networks (a small business) to develop learning modules to be delivered through cell phone technology. The project is funded by the NIEHS. The learning modules focus on reinforcing safety and health issues for skilled support personnel responding to emergencies. For more information on the Office of Public Health Practice, please contact Mr. Mitchel Rosen at mrosen@umdnj.edu . 155UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES ORIENTATION WEEK COMMUNITY SERVICE (SOM) The First Annual Orientation Week Community Service event took place on August 9, 2008. The event was designed to familiarize first-year students with several community service opportunities available in Camden. About 30 first-year student participated in community service activities at the Ronald McDonald House, as well as with the South Camden Citizens in Action Neighborhood Health Fair and the Urban Promise Community Block Party. On August 12, 2008, the International Federation of Medical Students' Association (IFMSA) of SOM hosted its first community concert to raise funds for international student medical rotations. Several professional organizations from UMDNJ-SOM participated in this first-time event to raise funds for their activities and local community service programs. PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICINE COURSE (RWJMS) RWJMS launched a new course in 2006, Patient-Centered Medicine , to provide students with more opportunities early in their education to learn in clinical settings, to integrate basic science and clinical information, to address ethical issues, to teach communication skills, to enhance cultural competency, and to strengthen community service links. All students participate in service learning activities providing health education workshops in the community. All students also visit agencies that provide care in the community for disabled and other vunerable populations. Patient-Centered Medicine fosters the value of community involvement and enhances opportunities for students to engage in community health programs. The course spans the first three years of the curriculum and provides longitudinal community exper iences in New Brunswick and Camden. PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (SHRP) The Department of Rehabilitation and Movement Sciences offers full physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluation and treatment services to public school children in Newark, Paterson, Morristown and some private schools. These services are part of the faculty practice plan of the Department but also include opportunities for physical therapy students to participate as part of the Department's community service expectations. The service is provided to classified students at all levels of primary and secondary education in the school system. This service is the largest of its kind in the country offered wholly by a physical therapy program. PRE-COLLEGE PROGRAM (SHRP) The College Bound program offered jointly with New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University-Newark serves approximately 500 students in grades 7-12 from Newark, Irvington and East Orange. The program provides academic support through the academic year and generally offers a six-week full-time program in the summer. 156PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PROJECT H.O.P.E. (SOM) H. Timothy Dombrowski, D.O., Chair of the UMDNJ-SOM Department of Internal Medicine, provides primary care to the homeless of Camden one afternoon per month in collaboration with Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center and the Volunteers of America Men's Shelter and Helen Smith House/Leavenhouse. This clinic is one aspect of the larger program that provides medical, social, outreach, and advocacy services to Camden City's homeless via a mobile outreach unit. The outreach unit provides health screenings, counseling, and case management; two weekly satellite primary care clinics that provide physicals, non-emergency care, and case management; and a weekly evening clinic at the Bergen Lanning Health Center for extended follow-up. Christopher Myers, M.S.N., A.P., the nurse practitioner from St. Luke's, volunteers eight hours per month at the Bergen Lanning Health Center. Among an estimated Camden homeless populati on of 3,500 to 6,500, 1,340 are Project H.O.P.E. users. Project H.O.P.E. is also a training site for the SOM Inner City Medicine rotation. RESPIRA (NJMS) The Children's RESPIRA Education Program (1-888-KID-ASMA) is a new program designed to provide bilingual medical and educational services to Latino families in Essex, Union, Hudson, Passaic, Morris and Middlesex Counties who have asthmatic children. The goal of RESPIRA is to increase compliance with therapy, decrease emergency room visits, hospitalizations and school absences, and improve quality of life for both parent and child by empowering families to be more proactive and comfortable with their child's asthma care. The program educates both parents and children about the development, triggers, and treatment of asthma. In addition, each participating child is provided with an individualized Asthma Action Plan, which is currently a state mandate. RESPIRA is a free program offered to all families, including those that do not have medical insurance. The UMDNJ-Pediatric Pulmonology/Asthma Center in Newark has found a great need to work with Latino families who may face limitations such as language barriers and difficult socioeconomic conditions. Some families may use the emergency room as the primary way for treating their child's asthma, and therefore have inconsistent health care providers. \"We have found that many fa milies lack the knowledge necessary to manage their children's asthma conditions and some are using ineffective folk remedies to treat symptoms and/or are incorrectly using prescribed asthma medications\" stated Dr. Montalvo Stanton, M.D., Principal Investigator-Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and Pediatric Pulmonologist. \"As a result, we have designed 'The Children's RESPIRA Education Program.'\" The program consists of one two-hour education session, subdivided into sessions for parents and children. This program is given at several sites in each county including the schools. After the initial education session, two home visits are conducted by a bilingual Health Educator and Public Health Repres entatives. At the home visits the RESPIRA staff members assess the child, obtain information about any hospitalizations or emergency room visits, assess asthma triggers in the home setting and provide 157UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES supplemental asthma education about avoiding allergens. Families who need social service assistance are referred for help. RESPIRATORY CARE (SHRP) The respiratory care faculty have launched the Asthma Education Program for Inner-City Children. This program provides school-aged children and their parents/guardians with educational information about the causes, management and treatment of asthma. Thus far, several parochial and public schools in northern New Jersey are participating in the program, and still others have expressed interest. RWJMS OFFICE OF MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS (RWJMS) The RWJMS Office of Multicultural Affairs/Office of Special Academic Programs sponsors programs to address health disparities or focus on culturally competent health care as a way of eliminating health disparities. Its goal is to educate the medical school community regarding cultural issues affecting quality health care as well as to foster diversity through recruitment and retention of students underrepresented in medicine. The Office develops, organizes and sponsors educational, cultural and summer program activities that focus on increasing awareness and sensitivity so that students, staff, and faculty gain a better appreciation and respect for the differences that exist in our society. RWJMS DEPARTMENTAL ACTIVITIES (RWJMS) Community service is at the core of many of the research and clinical activities of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine and the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI). The World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program provides outreach, diagnosis, support, and state-of-the-art- treatment to the virtual community of New Jersey responders who are still suffering after their work at this disaster site. On a smaller scale, much of the clinical work performed at the Clinical Center of EOHSI interfaces with neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces affected by exposures to toxic or hazardous pollutants, including some communities that receive ongoing medical surveillance for their prior exposures. In addition, research occurs in venues such as the New Jersey Turnpike and union halls across the region, as the Department and the EOHSI strive to understand the health hazards that affect our communities and workplaces. In conjunction with medical student training, faculty volunteers at The Promise Clinic in New Brunswick perform medical examinations for urban minorities. Faculty have developed a Healthy Homes Demonstration Project with Isles, Inc, of Trenton. Building on the previously successful efforts of Dust Does Not Discriminate, Healthy Homes Mold Project and Arrest the Pests in Your Nest , faculty developed a VHS and an English and Spanish language DVD training module on mold and other environmental contaminants in the home. Entitled \"the Healthy Homes Video,\" the target audience is urban minority residents. Another ongoing Department project is the work being done in the Camden community through many churc hes and community groups, including Heart of Camden, to address methods of reducing community exposure and risk to toxins in the South Camden area. The Department is also developing a pilot community assessment course for Trenton community members to learn how to re cognize, assess, evaluate and remediate 158PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 community hazards. In addition, a Community Based Sampling course is being developed for students in the graduate programs in Public Health, Toxicology, and Environmental Science to learn how to assess, sample and analyze an urban site and to deliver the information to the community. Faculty are again actively screening homes and residents for Chromium contamination in Jersey City and other Hudson County locations, a residue of past waste dumping practices. The Department of Family Medicine's Instit utional Profile involves students in community-based activities from the first y ear of medical school through the residency program in family medicine. The goals of the Department of Family Medicine's community-based initiatives are: 1. To encourage an ethic of community service and social responsibility in medical students and residents. This involves training them in the context of community service. 2. To equip the next generation of health professionals with the community oriented and culturally sensitive competencies needed to make a difference in the lives of their patients and clients and the communities they serve. 3. To foster partnerships between communi ty organizations and UMDNJ-RWJMS to promote the health of underserved/vulnerable populations. The Department of Family Medicine developed a number of community-based initiatives to help meet these goals. At the undergraduate level, during the third-year family medicine clerkship, all medical students participate in community-based service learning that has been incorporated into the curriculum. These activities are complemented by didactic sessions on community-oriented primary care and principles of population-based health care. In addition, students may elect to participate in an eight-week Community-Oriented Primary Care (COPC) Assistantship between the first and second year of medical school. Students in COPC, who must complete independent projects, are assigned to a community-based health care or social service organization and attend weekly seminars covering topics aimed at increasing student awareness about the principles and practice of COPC, health disparities, population assessments, and culturally competent clinical care. Students also participate in a tour of local botanicas and bodegas. The New Brunswick RWJMS Family Medicine Residents provide quality primary care services to many of greater New Brunswick's uninsured and underinsured citizens, many of whom are not documented. Patients are seen in the Family Medicine Service and at clinics within RWJUH; Family Medicine at Monument Square; St. John's Clinic; soup kitchens; homeless shelters; senior citizen apartments; long-term care facilities and in patients' own homes. Additionally, the New Brunswick RWJMS Fam ily Medicine Residents provide primary care services to the greater New Brunswick community. As part of their training, all 159UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES second-year residents participate in a cross-cultural community medicine rotation at St. John's Health Center in New Brunswick. The goal of the rotation is to encourage residents to practice in medically underse rved urban areas by offering a rewarding learning experience that enhances their skills in providing culturally sensitive, community-oriented primary care to a diverse and indigent population. Residents learn about different multicultural populations and became familiar with managing clinical issues prevalent in the community ( e.g. lead poisoning, immunizations, TB exposure, HIV, substance use, health problems exacerbated by poverty and homelessness). They participate in community-based health care activities including seeing patients at a child health conference, a pap/mammogram screening, and volunteering at a local soup kitchen. Community site visits included the Middlesex County Board of Social Services, a homeless shelter, a botanica and bodega, and accompanying St. John's prenatal and immunization outreach workers on home visits. In addition, residents conduct community presentations at the Edison Job Corps Academy, Ozanam Men's Homeless Shelter, and Naomi's Way, a transitional housing facility for women and their children. Presentation topics include personal hygiene, nutrition, and respiratory illnesses. As part of their longitudinal community medicine experience, Residents also participate in community- based activities such as school physicals, health fairs, pap and mammogram screenings, prostate cancer screenings, and community presentations. All residents, first year through the third y ear and many faculty members provide other educational and clinical care services to local communities. The following services were provided by residents and residency faculty: Community Affiliation Services St. John's Health Center, New Brunswick Clinical care for indigent populations American Academy of Family Physicians Tar Wars - Anti-smoking presentations for local 4th and 5th graders Trinity Health Center, Perth Amboy Clinical care for indigent populations Women's Health Center, Somerville Women's clinical health services Geriatric home visits Medical care for home-bound patients in the local New Brunswick area Jewish Renaissance Medical Center, Perth Amboy Screenings for breast, uterine and prostate cancer Naomi's Way, Catholic Charities, New Brunswick Presentations on preventive health care Old Bridge Township Elementary, Middle, and High Schools School physicals and pre-participation examinations 160PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 Ozanam Family Shelter, Edison Presentations on preventive health care Ozanam Men's Homeless Shelter, Catholic Charities, New Brunswick Presentations on preventive health care New Jersey State Division of Developmental Disabilities Medical care for over 250 patients and their caregivers New Brunswick High School Parent/Infant Care Center (PIC-C) Medical care for teenage moms and their children Parker Nursing Home, Piscataway and New Brunswick Center for Healthy Aging - Parker Stonegate Continuing education on medically related topics for nurses and staff Patient care for the elderly and employees at Parker Stonegate Puerto Rican Action Board (PRAB) and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Presentations for parents of children in PRAB's Day Care Centers about childhood health Read Across America Read books to local elementary and middle school students Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Community Health Fairs Health screenings, particularly for cancer Special Olympics Team doctors Woodbridge Township Health Department Edison Job Corps Academy Martin and Edith Stein Hospice Matheny Center of Medicine and Dentistry Screenings for breast, uterine and prostate cancer Screening students by providing physicals and medical clearance Clinical care for the elderly Patient care The Center for Healthy Families and Cultural Diversity , within the Department of Family Medicine, was created in 1988 to improv e the delivery of culturally responsive, family centered health care to diverse populations.

Dr. John Gentless, Mayor of Stratford, was on hand to participate in the festivities as well as to thank the School for the gift drive benefiting local children. SOM's leadership of the Steering Committee that formed the Stratford Business and Civic Association (SBCA) in 2004 has demonstrated support for the borough's business community. SOM's Director of Strategic Planning and Program Development served as the organization's first President in 2005. In April 2009, Dean Cavalieri hosted a breakfast meeting of the SBCA on the Stratford campus, with an overview of the school's vision for the years to come. UMDNJ-SOM supported the launching of the privately published \"Stratford Times\" newspaper in December 2008. This bimonthly guide to news of local interest is providing an important vehicle for communicating to the community the services available through the SOM-University Doctors. SPECIAL OLYMPICS SUMMER GAMES (NJDS and SHRP) For the 13th year, UMDNJ continues to prov ide services to the Special Olympics Summer Games. The Special Olympics-Special Smiles program : The mission of the Special Olympics-Special Smiles program is to increase access to dental care for Special Olympics athletes, as well as all people with intellectual disabilities. Dental screenings, oral hygiene instruction, nutrition education, blood pressure screening and the fabrication of sports mouth guards are part of a collaborative effort by NJDS and SHRP to focus attention on the dental health issues facing New Jersey's Special Olympics athletes, The two UMDNJ Schools also sponsor a health and wellness center for the Healthy Athletes Initiative of New Jersey Special Olympics, providing education and community service to New Jersey residents who join in Special Olympics activities. The Special Olympics-Healthy Choices program: The mission of the Special Olympics-Healthy Choices program is to increase awareness in the areas of nutrition education, infection control, dental home care and general healthy choices. Four health screenings occur: blood pressure screening, weight status evaluation, vascular health, and respiratory health. SHRP provides these services as part of its Special Olympics collaborative effort with NJDS. Students, staff and faculty participate in this inter-professional event. 168PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 In addition, SHRP faculty take a leadership role in the education and screenings provided by the American Physical Therapy Association. For the 13th year, data collected at the NJ Special Olympics Summer Games will help to generate a snapshot of the oral health of a representative sample of the hundreds of thousands of Special Olympics athletes around the world. This data is used to encourage increased education and funding. Oral and nutrition research projects identifying oral and nutrition health status of these athletes have been presented and published on the international level, and have been used to support the need for extended services to this population. STANDARDIZED PATIENT LABS (SOM) UMDNJ-SOM is a pioneer in developing Standardized Patient Labs that assess medical students caring for patient \"actors\", thereby providing evaluation not only of diagnostic skills but of cultural competency as well. The full survey of SOM by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) commended the school for inclusion of cultural competency in the Standardized Patient Lab. In recognition of SOM's leadership, the Governor came to the school's Stratford campus to tour the Standardized Patient Labs and sign legislation requiring cultural competency education as a requirement for medical licensure in the State. STATEWIDE NETWORK FOR COMMUNITY ORAL HEALTH EXTRAMURAL DENTAL CENTERS (NJDS) The New Jersey Dental School has shown its commitment to Newark and to the State of New Jersey with the creation of the Statewide Network for Community Oral Health. A needs assessment was performed which revealed that access to dental care was a problem for historically underserved populations; i.e., the low income, the indigent elderly, migrant workers and their families, those physically and mentally challenged, and patients living with HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the Statewide Network for Community Oral Health is to carry out the educational and service missions of the University and the Dental School. The Statewide Network provides dental services to communities throughout the State of New Jersey, with dental centers in Atlantic, Camden, and Somerset Counties. The Statewide Network and the New Jersey Dental School in Newark had over 130,000 patient visits this past year. The dental centers in the Statewide Network serve as a venue for increasing the number of oral health care providers in underserved communities in New Jersey; increasing access to quality oral health care; and expanding the educational component of training profici ent oral health care providers who are culturally competent and sensitive to the needs of the underserved. S.T.E.P.S. TO FIGHTING CHILDHOOD OBESITY (SOM) The Garden Area Health Education Center (AHEC), one of the three AHECs affiliated with UMDNJ-SOM for over 30 years, is managing a child obesity intervention program entitled Success through Exercise, Physical Fitness and Sharing Information (STEPS), which is funded by a grant from the RWJ Foundation N.J. Health Initiative awarded to South Jersey Healthcare. 169UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES STEPS is a health intervention program to assist families in the fight against childhood obesity. Through interactive educational sessions on nutrition and exercise, families learn how to implement and sustain necessary lifestyle changes to benefit their children's health. The program is targeted to Vineland students, aged 8 -12, who are over the 85th percentile of their recommended body mass index (BMI), or overweight. Students are referred by their physicians or school nurse. However, parents and guardians can also apply directly to the program. Studies indicate that parent participation is crucial to any health intervention program. In STEPS, parent participation is mandatory. An SJH registered dietitian works directly with parents to learn how to cook traditional foods healthier. Children learn the importance of portion size. The STEPS Sports Physiologist teaches the children and their parents how to incorporate play activities into their daily lives. ST. LUKE'S CATHOLIC MEDICAL SERVICES (SOM) Lesley A. D'Ambola, D.O., of the UMDNJ-SOM Department of Medicine, provides the medical directorship and clinical care at St. Luke's Catholic Medical Services in Camden, NJ. Christopher Myers, M.S.N., A.P., a nurse practitioner, joined Dr. D'Ambola in the practice in May 2004. St. Luke's is a primary care medical practice for the poor, uninsured and underinsured community of the City of Camden; it was founded in 1983 as a joint venture of the Diocese of Camden and the Jesuit Urban Service Team (J.U.S.T.). Since St. Luke's is one of the few medical practices with a fluent bilingual staff, it attracts a predominately Latino clientele. St. Luke's serves a population that is 60% Latino, 30% African-American, and 10% White. Thirty percent of its patients have no health insurance. Its professional staff includes a physician, a nurse, a nurse practitioner, three nursing assistants, and administrative staff. The addition of the nurse practitioner to the staff has enabled St. Luke's to add a home visit component to its service delivery model. In addition to primary care, St. Luke's staff provides individualized health education programs and preventive health care with a focus on cancer screening and immunizations. In 2008, there were over 6,500 patient visits at St. Luke's, with Type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and anemia the most common diagnoses. St. Luke's is a training site for the medical school. It provides UMDNJ-SOM's medical students, internal medicine residents, and geriatric fellows with a unique opportunity to learn about the practice of community-based, urban medicine. St. Luke's also offers a training experience designed to cultivate an appreciation of cultural diversity and to impart the knowledge and skills needed to provide culturally competent medical care. In addition, St. Luke's serves as the keystone training site for the UMDNJ-SOM Medicine Residency Program to train general internists to provide primary care to medically underserved populations. St. Luke's is also a tr aining site for SOM third- and fourth-year medical students. 170PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 STUDENT HEALTH ADVOCATES FOR RESOURCES & EDUCATION CENTER (S.H.A.R.E.) (NJMS) In 1996, students at the UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School created the S.H.A.R.E. Center, an organization dedicated to encouraging and mobilizing all medical students to become more involved with the Newark co mmunity. SHARE has three objectives: To establish and maintain community partnerships in order to improve the quality of outreach programs through ongoi ng community needs assessment. To encourage health promotion and disease prevention in the underserved Newark community and provide opportunities for patient and student education. To maintain the sustainable infrastructure that assumes responsibility for coordinating student projects and centralizes operations of existing community service programs at NJMS. SHARE is the student run umbrella organization that supports six different service groups, allowing NJMS students to pursue patient care, community education, youth mentoring, and more. SHARE activities provide insight into the Newark community and enhance classroom learning through Voices of SHARE, an academic elective offered to NJMS students. SHARE leaders also serve as a resource for fellow students and other student organizations interested in community outreach opportunities and plan events that help to initiate community service interest in Newark. SHARE supports the following groups: Students Teaching AIDS to Students (STATS) STATS is an outreach program in which first- and second-year medical students lead sexual health workshops for Newark's middle and high school students.

Activities include tutoring at the Academy Street Firehouse, mentoring children at the Francis Xavier Bagnoud (FXB) Center, and conducting educational events for medical students and the NJMS community. STATS also promotes HIV advocacy through World AIDS Day and World AIDS Week lectures, films, and discussions. Student Family Health Care Center (SFHCC) SFHCC is the student-run clinic at UMDNJ. Running for over 40 years, it was established immediately after the 1967 riots to meet the needs of the medically under- served. The student-run clinic offers free, quality health care to individuals in the Newark community who are lacking in health insurance and the resources necessary to pay for basic healthcare needs. Services incl ude physical examinations, chronic disease management, gynecological care, and psychosocial counseling. All services are provided by volunteer medical students under the supervision of board-certified physicians, many of whom are NJMS Al umni. The SFHCC provides free, quality medical care to the Newark community. Under NJMS faculty, teams of medical students treat individuals of all ages providing an opportunity for students to enhance their clinical skills. SFHCC provides a unique role in the under-served population of Newark. It gives patients the opportunity to maintain continuity of care with students and physicians, ensuring consistently high quality of personalized care. A significant role of the clinic is to offer preventative care to a population that is most in need, and most often neglected, 171UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES of such a crucial privilege. Over the past year, this has been accomplished through providing patients with flu vaccines, smoking cessation support, pedometers, and patient education. The clinic also gives patients access to additional resources for the uninsured, both inside and outside of the UMDNJ community. Relationships in Education for the Advancement of Community Health (REACH) REACH is an outreach organization that serves the Newark community through health promotion and disease prevention. This organization assesses community health needs at local health fairs and addresses these needs through interactive adult workshops. REACH also holds after-school workshops for Newark's youth to promote healthy lifestyles. Participation in REACH allows medical students to gain valuable skills in clinical medicine and patient education. REACH organizes health fairs at community sites once a month. Patients are provided free screenings for hypertension, diabetes, vision and body mass index by teams of medical students. Patients discuss their screening results with a medical student and attending physician and can request additional material on other health topics. If necessary, health fair patients are referred to the SFHCC clinic for follow-up appointments. New Moms Program In 2002, SHARE Center launched its latest initiative to impact the care of young mothers within the city of Newark. This program is designed to increase awareness about women's health among medical students as well as future mothers, and to encourage a healthy lifestyle during and after pregnancy. As a community-based health care organization, medical students will enter the Newark community and effectively communicate with pregnant women about pressing maternal and prenatal health issues, identify at-risk mothers, and provide interventional support to increase the health and well-being of mothers and children in the city. Early Start Mentoring Program This is a community outreach project that places trained mentors into Newark elementary schools to promote positive social behavior and non-aggressive conflict resolution. The focus of the program is to develop self-esteem and social problem- solving skills, while offering a caring and supportive outlet for Newark's youth. ESMP is designed to help provide these children with a foundation for accomplishing their future educational and social goals. Student Sight Savers This is an organization dedicated to eliminating preventable blindness through screening and education and to developing sustainable solutions to reduce health disparities. The NJMS chapter of Student Sight Savers is involved in the following activities: Preliminary vision screenings for children and adults in soup kitchens, homeless shelters, schools and at REACH health fairs.

Vision education program presentations teaching students and adults about eye anatomy and eye disease by examining the history of ophthalmology through unique perspectives, such as the comparison of ancient and modern 172PUBLIC/COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES UMDNJ-Annual Institutional Profile, September 1, 2009 ophthalmologic procedures, art history seminars addressing eye disease in eminent artists and discussing of the social history of eyeglasses. Program in Advocating Community Leader Empowerment (PINACLE) The goal of PINACLE is to establish a collaborative partnership between NJMS students and the permanent residents of the Newark community. Specifically, PINACLE seeks to develop a comprehensive primary health prevention program within the SHARE Center. The goals and objectives are as follows: To facilitate community access to NJMS services including those targeting the uninsured. To streamline efforts to avoid duplicati on of service by fostering collaboration between medical students, other health related students, and faculty. To facilitate networking among community interest groups and interested faculty and students. To ensure name recognition of the New Jersey Medical School within and beyond the immediate community. To gain a better understanding of the community including what resources are available and which populations are currently not being served. To better coordinate the service program s provided by University Hospital and other UMDNJ schools on the Newark campus. To improve the ability to identify and address which community health needs are being met and which are not. SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM (SOM) The Community Substance Abuse Unit, started in January 1993, is a 12-bed sub-acute care inpatient unit located in Kennedy Memorial Hospital-UMC at Cherry Hill.
