It is believed that each person has their own essence that is locked in a physical form \"our body\" and this way they can learn in body, mind and spirit. To be able to understand the roots of Native American traditional medicine, it is important to life sciences and medicine drawn from the Taoist traditions of the Yin-Yang and Five Elements The Chinese culture is built around thousands of years of tradition. Understanding these Chinese beliefs and social influences may benefit you when attending to someone of this culture. Values In Chinese culture, respect towards an authority figure is shown by giving a slight bow and to avoid making eye contact. If people The Glass Castle The Chinese philosophical symbol, the Yin Yang, can resemble and explain what life brings. The Yin Yang is basically a symbol created back in the 1000 B.C by a Taoist philosopher, to explain the forces of the natural world. The connotation behind this ancient symbol can indicate that, The concept of yin and yang is represented by two opposite principles in nature and in order for one to exist, the other must exist. Yin represents the feminine or negative nature of things and yang represent masculine or positive nature of things. One meaningful element in Confucianism is the Five Bonds. The Five Bonds are guidelines to the way things should be done in social life with family as the basic unit of the society. Many different forms of medicine are currently practiced in the world. In fact, as our text states, \"in all cultures, some people have become recognized as having special abilities to treat and diagnose health problems.\" (Miller 107) Without argument, phytomedicinal and supernatural healers are two forms of medical treatment that have been around for longer than any other, regardless of culture. It has been estimated that shamanism has been practiced for over ten thousand years (Tyson 3). Native American and Celtic healers are often known as shamans. Though the views of diseases and their cures were seen mostly in supernatural terms both the ancient Egyptians and Hebrews were also practical in terms of treatment and prevention is the question we would like to answer. Egyptian daily living was mostly made up of philosophies, their fear of the Yin and Yang are fundamental to the understanding of the Chinese religion since they believe that everything goes hand in hand and is never fully one way or another. The symbol represents a sunny and shady side, yet they go hand in hand to complete the circle. This represents in every day both sides will be present to be completed. For example, losing a loved one can hurt however that person gets to move to the next journey. Or it raining on a day off. Even though one might not be able to go out and get some sun on there day off the environment gets rain and plants get nourished, good comes with bad. Even thought many don't like being sad, one must be sad to understand happiness, which is an essential The historical film called, \"Where Did It Come From? Ancient Egypt: Modern Medicine\" was produced by Melody Shafir and distributed through the History Channel. Unfortunately, I have not heard of Melody Shafir. Although, I do watch the History Channel often. There is not any reason that the History Channel would provide inaccurate information. They use various professionals' such as doctors to scientists to conduct experiments or to provide information. Additionally, each professionals' experience is talked about and credited on the film. The film has a copyrighted date of 2006, so the information provided is about 10 years old. I do not believe that the information is that outdated, because artifacts are studied with 21st century technology HOLISM AND CHINESE CULTURE Dena Roberts Grand Canyon University - NUR 502 July 16, 2017 , In Chinese culture, the world is viewed as a detailed system demonstrated by the principles of yin-yang and the Five Phases. This theory was developed more than 2000 years ago and continues to play a major part in Chinese The Role of Yin and Yang in the Diffuse Religious Practices of China As explained in World Religions Today, in contemporary culture, the discoveries made through science are usually articulated in the structure of mathematical equations. These mathematical equations serve as proofs of the fundamental truths that the particular science reveals. Analogous to this idea is the symbolism in the Yi-Jing system of East Asian Religions. The symbolization of the Yi-Jing system enriches the conceptualization of the universe as incessantly changing. Within the Yi-Jing system, the yin-yang symbol exemplifies the most familiar representation of these uncovered fundamental truths (Esposito 502-3). In this essay, I intend to explain the meaning of the terms yin and yang and discuss the role they play in Chinese religions generally. Further, I will explain the way in which the symbolism of yin and yang contribute to the Chinese conception of the universe and the way that role is played out in religious practices. Tessa Vossen and colleagues illustrated the back-story of Suriname and its role in slavery, studies of illnesses as well as native medicines. Vossen's provides a combined analysis towards the role herbal plants and natural medicines in attempt to grasp the intersection of the relationship between slaves and type of medical care provided. \"Through the examination of distinct conceptions of the human body, physicians were able to demonstrate intellectual, social and physical constructs of healing for it\" . Perceptions of health and illness include ailments generally centered to certain geographic regions or cultural groups. Some cultural bound syndromes were often treated with medicinal plants with the aim of curing ailments that manifested during TAOIST PERSPECTIVE The Yin Yang is one of the primary principles of Taoist teachings. The concept of two forces present everywhere, completely opposite to each other yet balancing and enhancing each other. They cannot be separated because they exist together in comparison, and splitting one apart will only create the other anew. Although one force can take prevalence over the other for a short time, anything that is in a state of imbalance for long will cease to exist. The universe is composed of and held together by the tension of these two forces, and this concept is in Taoist writings on Abstraction. (A2) Even the illness etiology (e.g. evil wind) and the formulas of prescriptions (monarchs, ministers, assistants and emissaries) are also confusingly irrelevant to medicine (Lloyd & Sivin, p. 233). Indeed, they are the products of intuitive thinking and analogical reasoning by the ancient Chinese people, considerably different from the logical thinking and deductive/inductive reasoning in western culture. However, this is exactly the reason why the theoretical paradigm of TCM is so inclusive: the accumulation of medical knowledge is not based on logical experiments, but on intuitive experiences without standards or unity, hence it is multi-directional; the relationship between two things is not elicited from deductions or inductions which require clear preconditions, but from analogical similes, hence it is multi-faceted (Chang & Zhang, p. 12; Leung, p. 121). For instance, the concept pair \"Yang\" and \"Yin\" can be seen as a symbol of any two opposite yet complementary objects existing everywhere and perceived by everyone, such as day and night, hot and cold, man and woman (Unschuld, p. 55). The dynamic changing between Yang-qi and Yin-qi represents the mutual transformation from one natural force to another corresponding one (Leung, p. 20). This paradigm is like an infinite web into which anything can be included but not fixed. Traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, is one of the oldest systems of medicine to exist among humans, and it is extremely prominent to this day. According to legend, the system has been in use since the third millennium BCE. The views of such an old system differ greatly from those "}
