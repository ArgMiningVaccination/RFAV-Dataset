The stronger the immune system, the healthier your body will be and [the happier your life will get.](http://www.purposefairy.com/80411/letting-go-to-be-happy-21-day-happiness-challenge/) Today's guided meditation is meant to boost your immune system, making sure that your body and immunity run smoothly, keeping you strong, healthy and in perfect shape. \"Poor health is not caused by something you don't have; it's caused by disturbing something that you already have. Healthy is not something that you need to get, it's something you have already if you don't disturb it.\" ~ Dean Ornish Before you begin, remember to first, find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed for the next 45 minutes. Second, find a comfortable position to sit - it can be on a chair, crossed legged or on your knees, or lay down and when you're ready, press play. Once the meditation session is over, you can share your experience with all of us by commenting below. Enjoy Boost Your Immune System: "}
