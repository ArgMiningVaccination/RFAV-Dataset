The follow-up study is separately registered for the etiological evidence from vaccine poisoning. With the prior study's angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor inhibition therapy reaching desired power level and outcome, the participant's blood pressure. has dropped to normal range in a steady state without signs of sudden death risks. The separate study defines the treatment medicines in NCT05711810 as rescue medicines for discretions, and experiments with Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets with 20 mg per day, and Chinese herb compounded Anti-Viral Granules 12 g (total) in 3 times per day. The main ingredients for Anti-Viral Granules are the roots of Isatis indigotica L., patchouli oil, oil, and angelica dahurica tincture. | Combination Product: Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets | The intervention observes the effects of the medicines on the participant's health without the continued interventions on blood pressure. Rescue medicines will be used once if the blood pressure rise again beyond the healthy range. Other Name: Anti-Viral Granules - Total Cholesterol Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. It is hypothesized that total cholesterol levels indicate to the initial acidification for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry through vaccines with the degeneration of lipids. - Triglycerides Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. It is hypothesized that triglycerides levels indicate to the initial acidification for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry through vaccines. - HDL-C Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - LDL-C Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. It is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 hibernating viruses and viral proteins are hidden in the LDL-C. - Apolipoprotein A-I Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ] - Apolipoproteina B Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ] - Lipopoliproteina (a) Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ] - Eosinophil Absolute Number Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Eosinophil Percentage Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Basophil Absolute Number Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Basophil Percentage Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Mean Corpuscular Volume Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Red cell Distribution Width Coefficient of Variation Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Red cell Distribution Width Standard Deviation Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Plateletcrit Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Platelet Distribution Width Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Mean Platelet Volume Change [ Time Frame: 30 days ]The baseline characteristics is set at the beginning of the trial, with its rate of change metrified from initial intoxication. - Heart Rate Change [ Time Frame: 4 hours ]The blood pressure change will be compared with the baseline characteristics for observation on the risks of rebound to the previous intervention. Type I error testing defines Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure and heart rate as incremented. Heart rate variance indicates to immune responses. - Systolic Blood Pressure Change [ Time Frame: 4 hours ]The blood pressure change will be compared with the baseline characteristics for observation on the risks of rebound to the previous intervention. Type I error testing defines Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure and heart rate as incremented. SBP variance indicates to infection activities. - Diastolic Blood Pressure Change [ Time Frame: 4 hours ]The blood pressure change will be compared with the baseline characteristics for observation on the risks of rebound to the previous intervention. Type I error testing defines Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure and heart rate as incremented. DBP variance indicates to immune attack activities.
