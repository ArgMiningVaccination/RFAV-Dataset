ACUPUNCTURE CLINIC In person acupuncture treatment and herbal consults in the East Bay TELEHEALTH Herbal prescriptions and home-care treatment plans by Zoom, for COVID recovery and remote care (herb shipment to U.S. only) Praise - Leslie H. \"When I started seeing Lisa, I had tried most of the medical options for my symptoms. I had gone through diet and lifestyle changes, physical therapy, surgeries, expensive medications, and none of it gave me the relief that acupuncture does. I thought that how I felt then was the best that I could get. My quality of life is so much better in the last year than it's been in the last ten. Lisa sits down with me every visit and listens to all of my symptoms regardless of how many there are or how unrelated they may be, making her the most attentive practitioner I've ever met. I still have flares but they are no longer debilitating and less frequent. I wish I had started acupuncture sooner, but I'm very thankful to be here now.\" - Suzy K. \"Lisa is amazing. Her techniques are gentle yet effective. She is a great listener, empathetic, caring, and easy to open up to. She helped me with plantar fasciitis, hip flexor, and piriformis issues. I am an ultrarunner, so I really appreciate working with someone who understands athletes. I highly recommend Lisa!\" - Melissa G. \"Dr. Franzetta was part of my integrative medicine team when I underwent treatment for rectal cancer during COVID. She was easy to talk to, listened attentively, never made me feel rushed, and asked questions that my other doctors were not. In conjunction with acupuncture, Lisa recommended herbal supplements and exercises to prepare and treat my body through the various stages of treatment. This counterbalance to the powerful chemotherapy, radiation and surgeries was exactly the informed kind of care that helped me stay mentally & physically strong and supported.\" - Scott H. \"I began treatment with Lisa after an injury to my shoulder sustained while swimming. Lisa diagnosed an impinged ligament which limited the motion in my left arm, preventing me from continuing one of my favorite activities for exercise and relaxation. With the use of acupuncture and other treatments, I was able to regain full motion in my arm and am now continuing my swimming routine pain-free with the full range of motion in my arm and shoulder.\" - Lola N. \"Working with Lisa is so comforting as she creates a welcoming environment. She really takes the time to listen and ask great follow up questions. I wasn't even sure my post-pregnancy gynecological symptoms were treatable, and I got a lot of relief\u2014 so it never hurts to book a session and ask! Highly recommended.\" - Michelle D. \" I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and wanted to try acupuncture to complement the medications I need to take. Lisa's acupuncture treatments, her experience and her attention to the details about my health condition are beneficial in my healing process. Her kindness and compassion are always present with "}
