Program Doctoral Location Downers Grove, IL Duration 4 Years, Full-Time Class Size 205 Graduation Rate 94% The CCOM course of study is typically 4 academic years. The first 2 years cover primarily didactic instruction, followed by 2 years of primarily clinical rotations, including applicable didactic material. Upon graduation with the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree, CCOM graduates are eligible for postdoctoral residency training in all fields of medicine. As scientists and practitioners of the healing arts, osteopathic physicians subscribe to a philosophy that regards the body as an integrated whole with structure and function working interdependently. As an extension of this philosophy, osteopathic physicians treat their patients as unique persons with biological, psychological, and sociological needs, an approach that underscores the osteopathic commitment to patient-oriented versus disease-oriented health care. CCOM proactively modifies its curriculum to meet the needs of the practice of osteopathic medicine in the 21st century. To that end, the curriculum is being progressively enhanced with increasing alignment and integration of basic science and clinical sciences material. CCOM courses maintain rigorous standards by introducing the course material with interactive presentation methods in the manner that osteopathic physicians approach the patient in the clinical setting. To learn more about our current school year curriculum, please review the course catalog for the current year. Programmatic Level Objectives To produce excellent osteopathic physicians, CCOM's program emphasizes primary care but includes traditional specialties and subspecialties. Because the DO degree signifies the holder is a physician prepared for entry into the practice of medicine within postgraduate training programs, CCOM graduates must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care, including direct hands-on analysis and treatment. The following programmatic level objectives describe how CCOM's four-year curriculum prepares graduates to practice osteopathic medicine that is of high quality and focused on patient safety. I. Students will demonstrate knowledge of established and current biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and epidemiological concepts which are used in providing high value osteopathic medical care to patients. II. Students will provide osteopathic medical care to patients that promotes wellness, and when patients become ill, students will treat them with compassion using treatment plans that have been developed using sound clinical judgement that acknowledge patient beliefs and culture. III. During the pre-clinical and clinical years, students will conduct themselves in a professional manner which includes honesty, courtesy, and accountability. This professional behavior will be exhibited during interactions with patients, faculty, and colleagues of the health care team. IV. Students will demonstrate effective written and oral communication skills when interacting with patients, faculty, and colleagues. V. Students will develop the skills to become self-directed, life-long learners who incorporate evidence-based principles to provide safe, effective, osteopathic medical care. VI. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the U.S. healthcare system and its resources in order to provide patient-centered osteopathic medical care. This knowledge will be used to help improve patient safety and access to care.
