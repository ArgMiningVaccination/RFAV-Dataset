Licensed acupuncturist, Dr. Ryan Gauthier explains. The Chinese technique of acupuncture is one of the oldest, most commonly used integrative procedures in the world.

This sophisticated theory and philosophy factors in emotional, mental and physical well-being. Traditionally, acupuncture is used to help regulate disruptions in \"qi\" that can cause pain and illness. A great deal of research has since and continues to be done on acupuncture. Current research in Western medicine shows that acupuncture has an impact on many of the body's functions, receptors, and systems. It's demonstrated that it can be effective for a number of conditions.

During an acupuncture treatment, very thin needles are inserted into various areas of the body, such as hands, feet, ears or back. This is known as needling. What you feel depends on the area being needled and the intent of your acupuncturist. During needling, most people experience no pain and most often report feelings of relaxation. You may experience a variety of minor, brief sensations that usually quickly pass. These may include a dullness, achiness, or fullness at the site of insertion, as well as a traveling sensation moving away from the needle along a limb. Depending on the condition treated and the approach of your acupuncturist, you may remain clothed during treatment or be asked to wear a patient gown. During treatment, only the areas receiving acupuncture will be exposed. After treatment you should feel relaxed and ready to go about your day. Some patients notice minor bruising at the needling site. This is temporary and will fade. There is rarely any bleeding involved in acupuncture treatment. One of the benefits of receiving care at Henry Ford is that details about your care will entered into your medical record so your doctors will be aware of your treatment plan.
