Spiritual Consultant and Energy Healer", "date": "1999-01-01", "cleaned_text": "positivity | | HI! I'm Valerie (she/they). I work with Phenomenal People who care about our world to be more resourced, regulated, trauma-resilient, and spiritually-responsible. With decades of training in the social and sacred arts, I bring both sensitivity and rigor, along with the social and spiritual analysis to our work together. I can help you sidestep relentless, toxic positivity, avoid spiritual bypassing, and release the cultural binary that stops you from claiming your complexity, wholeness, human-ness, and individual spiritual expression. For you this means I'm not going to pave over your lived experience and I won't ask you to metaphysically transcend your humanity. I'm a companion, a guide, and a catalyst for your self awareness, spiritual practice, and your spiritually responsible leadership. We work together with the tools of nuance, discernment, paradox, and connection to lead you to wholeness, embodied spirituality, and embracing your complexity. When your WHOLE BEING (Body, Mind, Spirit, & Emotional well-being) is supported, the space and resources to fully flourish & be a force for good in the world are possible.
