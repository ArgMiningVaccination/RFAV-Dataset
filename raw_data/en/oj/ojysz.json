[Meet Our Team >>](https://crystalvaults.com/about-us) What Our Customers are Saying \"The only place I buy crystals online\" I've been burned in the past before buying crystals online. I've purchased fake crystals more than once from other websites. Once I found Crystal Vaults, it's the only place I will buy crystals online. I've only received high-quality, genuine crystals from them and I know it's a small business I can trust. - Tammy V., Southlake, Texas \"I highly recommend purchasing from Crystal Vaults\" I would like to express my gratitude and admiration for the professional and personal service I have received whilst purchasing crystals from the Crystal Vaults. Hank has been extremely helpful and has gone out of his way to assist me when purchasing my crystals, not just once but several times now. I highly recommend purchasing from the Crystal Vault to both new and professional collectors. - Elizabeth P., Sydney, Australia \"I'm so glad I found you\" Just wanted to say, this is an awesome website! Full of information! I'm so glad I found you. - Terri G., Meridian, Idaho \"Your selections are top quality and the best value\" Just wanted to express my appreciation for your splendid site and terrific service. I am especially grateful for your aesthetic sense of the crystal world. Your selections are top quality and in my opinion best value. I have ordered a window, isis, and now a faden quartz crystal from you. I have no reason to think that I will not be a repeat customer. - Jim R., Miami, Florida \"I'm a huge fan of crystal tea now\" As an avid tea drinker, I just wanted to say I'm so glad I tried this! I can't find crystal-infused tea anywhere else and it's become my go-to routine every morning. I'm a huge fan of crystal tea now. - Ronald P., Chesapeake, Virginia "}
