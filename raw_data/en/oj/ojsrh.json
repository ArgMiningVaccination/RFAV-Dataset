On May 11, 2023, the governor rescinded [Directive 22-13.1](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/directive/22-13.1%20-%20COVID-19%20Vaccination%20Standards%20for%20State%20Employees.pdf) ending the condition of employment related to COVID-19 vaccinations for state executive cabinet and small cabinet agencies. Although the federal public health emergency has ended, the work continues to limit the spread of COVID-19 and minimize the risk of serious illness and death. Public health officials encourage people to stay home when sick, wear a fitted face mask if exposed to the virus, and receive current bivalent vaccination shots. Is there any COVID-19 vaccination requirement for state employees? There are no requirements for state employees, contractors or volunteers regarding COVID-19 vaccination at [executive cabinet](https://www.governor.wa.gov/office-governor/office/executive-cabinet) and [small cabinet](https://www.governor.wa.gov/office-governor/office/small-cabinet) agency worksites. All agencies must continue meeting [requirements and following guidance](https://www.lni.wa.gov/safety-health/safety-topics/topics/coronavirus) for keeping workers safe from COVID-19. Offices of separately elected officials, independent agencies, boards, councils and commissions and institutions of higher education may choose to continue additional COVID-19 related measures. Can state employees who received booster vaccinations still qualify for incentive payments? Yes. Eligible employees who choose to provide their employer with proof of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination as recommended by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?s_cid=11748:%2Bcovid%20%2Bvaccine%20%2Bschedule:sem.b:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY22) at the point in time when proof is provided to the employer (between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023) will receive a one-time lump sum incentive payment. Incentive payments will be paid no earlier than July 25, 2023. Employees who are represented by a labor union should consult their applicable collective bargaining agreement for details on eligibility for the incentive payment. When did the governor's directive end? The governor rescinded [Directive 22-13.1](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/directive/22-13.1%20-%20COVID-19%20Vaccination%20Standards%20for%20State%20Employees.pdf) on May 11, 2023. The timing aligns with the Biden Administration's announcement that the national COVID-19 public health emergency ended May 11, 2023, and the World Health Organization's announcement on May 5, 2023, that ended the global health emergency for COVID-19. Do collective bargaining agreements need to be updated? Yes, any collective bargaining agreements containing provisions requiring COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of employment must be updated. The state Office of Financial Management (OFM) provided notice on May 11, 2023, of the rescission of the Governor's Directive 22-13.1. OFM will bargain with its labor partners to negotiate changes to the Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs) and engage in rulemaking to amend Title 357 WAC, Civil Service Rules to remove the requirement that employees and eligible candidates be vaccinated as a condition of employment. In the fall of 2022, the state reached an agreement with most unions representing cabinet agency employees to continue a vaccination requirement via an interim agreement until June 30, 2023. For the 2023-2025 biennium most CBAs contain a requirement that employees show proof of COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of employment. For both the interim agreements and the 2023-2025 CBA provisions, if agreement is not reached by the parties to modify those agreements, the parties will continue to adhere to the agreements. Does Title 357 WAC, Civil Service Rules, need to be updated? Yes, Title 357 Washington Administrative Code (WAC), the Civil Service Rules, which apply to nonrepresented employees must be updated. OFM conducted rulemaking activities effective November 4, 2022, implementing a COVID-19 vaccination requirement as a condition of employment for state executive and small cabinet agencies. OFM has filed an emergency rulemaking to align with the rescinding of the directive and permanent rulemaking will follow. Could employees who were previously separated from or left state employment due to COVID-19 vaccination requirements re-apply? An employee who was separated from or otherwise left state employment due to COVID-19 vaccination requirements who wishes to seek reemployment in a position at an executive or small cabinet agency can re-apply and participate in the same recruitment process as anyone else seeking that position.
