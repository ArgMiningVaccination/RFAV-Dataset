The contamination of these deeper tissues and aggravation of Vata and Kapha doshas leads to the formation of tinea versicolor. Another which is involved in tinea versicolor is Pitta dosha. It symbolizes heat or fire. Thus, it is a tridoshaj disorder, in which prime involved doshas are Vata and Kapha.
