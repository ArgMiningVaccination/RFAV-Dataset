Then, there is the relationship Stew had with his own father which can be viewed as a symbol that reflects on the relationship between Stew and Kitty. Stew admired his father, yet he rejected him: \"Its almost godlike stillness and expressionless filled him with admiration and reassurance, until one day, his father slowly looked up from his cereal, met his eyes and said, Stop staring at me you little shit.'\"(Gaitskill, 298) Kitty herself experienced similar from Stew himself: \"And if you ever try to come back here I'm going to spit Flashback throughout the story to show that Grandma has passed leaving Sek-Lung with her most important possession, the jade peony symbolizes their strong bond and love.

In Christina Baker Kline's Orphan Train, symbols function to convey Molly and Vivian's desire to maintain their connections to their pasts, their search for self-identity, and the trauma and loss they experience. Molly's turtle tattoo exemplifies Molly's personal identity and represents much of the loss she has experienced as a child.

The charm necklace that Molly wears signifies the connection to her late father, her own character, and the loss she has experienced.
