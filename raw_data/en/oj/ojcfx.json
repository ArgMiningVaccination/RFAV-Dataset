Notifications by the Dean of Students Office will be sent to each professor of the student currently not able to attend classes due to medical reasons. Thomas Jefferson University Health Services does not provide \"sick notes\" for students to professors for brief absences from class due to illness. We encourage students to communic ate directly with their professors about their absences. This is meant to encourage mature communication between student and professor, as well as encourage personal responsibility for class attendance decisions. Absences due to illness do not supersede the specific attendance policy for an instructor. Students are required to contact their professors about their academic standing in class either during or immediately following the medical problems. The determination of a student's academic standing in cl ass is completely within the discretion of the individual instructor. If a student is diagnosed with a communicable illness that poses a possible threat to the University community, a general notification may be sent to those at risk for exposure to the illness per the recommendation of the Philadelphia Health Department. Efforts will be made not to disclose the infected student's name. The University cannot assume responsibility for deductions and assumptions made by others, but will make every effort t o anticipate and address any concerns. Students who are diagnosed with a communicable disease and those not immunized against an offending vaccine -preventable disease may be required to leave campus until their illness is resolved. For information, cont act the Student Health Center at 215.951.2986. Academic Integrity I. UNIVERSITY POLICY STATEMENT and PROTOCOLS Academic integrity is the foundation of all Jefferson teaching, learning, and professional endeavors and is vital to advancing a culture of f airness, trust and respect. All members of the University community must maintain respect for the intellectual efforts of others and be honest in their own work, words, and ideas. II. SCOPE This policy applies to all full -time, part -time, matriculated and non-matriculated students at Thomas Jefferson University in all of their academic pursuits, including at non -Jefferson locations such as clinical, affiliated, and study away sites. Violations of academic integrity include plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, unauthorized use, bribery, identity misrepresentation, and denying access. III. DEFINITIONS 1. Plagiarism : The intentional use of another person's language, ideas, or other original (not common - knowledge) material without acknowledging its source; engaging and incorporating the exact or closely paraphrased ideas, words, data, or images of others without consent and/or citation to the author. 5 2. Cheating : Obtaining, attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain credit for work or improvement in performance t hrough dishonest or deceptive means, including feigning illness or emergency. 3. Fabrication : Invention or alteration of information, which is false or misleading, including the fabrication of clinical data or changing patient records after the records have b een reviewed and/or submitted. 4. Unauthorized Use : The use of sources without consent, which includes communication of confidential information without authorization, use of another person's work without consent for the specified purpose collaboration withou t express authorization, completion of work or revision of work without approval/citation, sharing unauthorized information or material, or use of unauthorized tools. 5. Bribery : Giving, offering, accepting or soliciting any item of value as a means of influe ncing the actions of another individual or individuals. 6. Identity Misrepresentation : Use of another person's name or identity in -person, online, or in signature or allowing use of your name or identity in -person, online, or in signature. 7. Denying Access : Withholding access to materials, equipment, process (reporting results without performance of test or procedure), or information that is commonly available for use. COMPONENTS Reporting If a faculty member believes that an academic integrity violation has oc curred, the incident must be reported in accordance with the following procedures: 1. Notice to Student : An allegation of a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy will be reported to the student(s) involved as soon as possible but no later than 30 busines s days following the incident or the report of the incident. The notice to student(s) may be verbal or written. See incident narrative requirements below. 2. Notice to College : The faculty member will write an incident narrative and share this narrative with the Program Director (PD) or Department Chair and Dean or designee. The Dean/designee, PD or Department Chair and faculty member will discuss their recommendation for sanctions above the College level, if any. The incident narrative must include the Colleg e sanction, if any, and a description of the violation. The incident narrative must be shared with the student so that the student may respond to the violation. The incident narrative will remain filed in the Dean's office for seven years. A sanction of re moval from an academic program or college may be recommended by the Dean via the Academic Integrity Violation Form, which will trigger a Community Standards Board hearing. Additionally, if the alleged violation involves identity misrepresentation, includin g misuse of identity verification information such as password and login, the matter shall be referred to the Community Standards Board. 3. Notice to Community Standards Board In keeping with academic unit protocol and University policy, the Dean/designee may decide to report the incident to the University Dean of Students/Student Affairs Officer. Reports are made on the Academic Integrity Violation Form found at https:/ /cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?Jefferson&layout_id=12 . 6 Reports to the University using the Academic Integrity Violation Form must be made within two weeks of the incident. Reports to the University may be submitted for: a) Documentation purposes only. This type of documentation assumes no further action. b) Community Standards Board (CSB) referral. This documentation triggers further inquiry by the University Community Standards Board. Sanctions Sanctions administered within the college will be appro priate to the violation and are within the purview of the faculty, up to removal from the program or College. Separation from the program, College or University (expulsion or suspension, may be recommended to the CS by the Dean through the Academic Integri ty Violation Form; the final determination will be made through the CSB hearing process. A failing grade that results in removal from the program/ College must also be sent to the CSB via the Academic Integrity Form. College recommendations of removal from the program or College will also include notification to the Office of the Provost. At the graduate level, a sanction of removal from the program or College may necessitate removal from the University. At the undergraduate level, the student may apply to another program, following the protocols outlined in the Student Handbook. The student retains active status until the CSB has finalized its review and come to a determination. The CSB, which determines sanctions outside of the College, has discretion to r ecord the violation on the student's permanent record and will determine sanctions as outlined in their policies and procedures. The Community Standards Board is comprised of members of the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs and has representation from East Falls and Center City campuses. In accordance with LCME guidelines, SKMC will use a Community Standards Board comprised of its own faculty and students. More information about the Community Standards Board is available on the Community Standards page. Appeals Students may appeal sanctions within the College by writing a letter of appeal to the Dean and/or designee. The student appeal must be received within two weeks of the sanction and the Dean must respond with a decision within two weeks. If the sanction is unresolved in the College, either party may consult with the Office of the Provost. If a sanction at the College level results in dismissal from the program (i.e., the student is awarded a failing grade, which results in dismissal), the student may appeal to the CSB. Students may appeal an Academic Integrity violation decision made by the Community Standards Board by following t he appeal process set out in the Community Standards page. The Academic Integrity Violations Form may be accessed at https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?Jefferson&layout_id=12 ) Refer to the Academic Integrity Process Chart for an illustration of the Academ ic Integrity Policy chronology. 7 Academic Standing Students' academic records are reviewed at the end of each semester, including summer, to evaluate academic standing and satisfactory progress toward degree requirements. The program director or coordinator will notify the student when problems i n academic performance may jeopardize a student's good standing. Official notification of probation or dismissal will be in writing and sent directly to the student by the Office of the Registrar. Probation Students who fall below the minimum GPA of 3.0 ar e placed on Academic Probation. Academic probation is a means of emphatically informing students that their record is unsatisfactory while there is still time to remedy the situation. Probation is not intended to be a penalty, but should be interpreted as a serious warning to improve the quality of academic work. In order to be placed on academic probation by their respective programs, students in the College of Architecture & the Built Environment must have earned a cumulative grade point average below 3.0 for one semester. Dismissal Students on academic probation will be required to achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 in the number of semesters (fall and spring) determined by the total credits in the student's graduate program. (Student is eligible t o appeal the dismissal by following the approved protocol.) For students who are required to take 50 or fewer credits to complete a degree program, a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 must be achieved in two (2) semesters, beginning with the semester when the student is placed on probation or twelve (12) attempted credit hours, whichever is longer. For students who are required to complete program requirements above 50 credits, a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 must be achieved in three (3) semesters, beginning with the semester when the student is placed on probation or eighteen (18) attempted hours, whichever is longer. If a student is placed on a second probation, a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 must be achieved in one additional semester or (6) credits, whichever is longer. A third probation is not permissible. Students who are not in good academic standing after attempting the academic hours or the allowed number of semesters will be dismissed from the program , college and university. Appeal Process Students will receive written notification of academic dismissal from the Office of the Registrar. Students may appeal for reinstatement by submitting a written request for reinstatement to the East Falls Academi c Appeals committee by the date listed in the letter. The written request for reinstatement should be submitted to the following email address: TJU_EF -AcademicAppeals@jefferson.edu . The petition for reinstatement should include: I. An explanation of the poor academic performance that led to the dismissal, i.e. 8 Insufficient credits earned and/or low GPA. 2. An explanation of whether the student worked with the director of the student's program, s ought tutoring assistance or accessed other support services to address academic performance. 3. Documentation concerning any mitigating circumstances that may have contributed to poor performance. This includes but is not limited to medical or psychologi cal documentation. 4. A plan for improving GPA to minimum standards and preventing recurrence of these academic difficulties and for raising credits and/or the GPA above the minimum standard for continued enrollment. 5. Letters of support from professors or other support staff (optional). Members of the CABE Academic Standing Committee (ad hoc committee), consisting of a quorum of program directors (not including the student's program director), will review petitions for academic reinstatement. Written not ification will be made as soon as practical, no later than one business day prior to the beginning of the enrollment period for which the student is seeking reinstatement. Dismissal and Reapplication If a student has been dismissed from a CABE graduate program, college and university, the student may reapply to the program, college, and university after a minimum of one semester (fall or spring). The student must present evidence of academic improvement activities such as university coursework, employment experience, and any online courses, tutorials and workshops, etc. The student must follow the standard application process with Graduate Admissions and the application will be reviewed by the CABE Academic Standing Committee (ad hoc committee). Readmis sion is not guaranteed. Written notification will be made as soon as practical, no later than one business day prior to the beginning of the enrollment period for which the student is seeking reinstatement. Academic Standing and Cha nge of Major Studen ts must meet the admissions criteria for the program to which they will be applying. This policy also applies to a student who chooses to change their original program for any reason. A student who does not meet the program -specific \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" requirements of their graduate program may apply to transfer to another academic program within Thomas Jefferson University. Academic Internships An internship is a form of experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theory learne d in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. Internships provide students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in the professional fields they are considering for career paths. Academic internships at Jefferson -East Falls aid students in professional preparation through a work experience directly related to their major and career goals. All academic internships must meet the NACE criteria for an experience to be 9 considere d an internship (visit www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/careerservices/Internships/index for details). Academic internships are offered during the fall, spring and 12 -week summer term. Multiple graduate -level internship options exist in 0.5 credit, 1 cr edit, or 3 -credit increments. Students may only enroll in an internship course during the semester of the internship experience; credit is not issued retroactively or for future experiences. All internships for credit are completed as academic courses b ased in a course syllabus focuses on professional skill -building and written assignments. While the primary emphasis of the course is on the internship work experience, course assignments are incorporated to prompt reflection on the internship. This reflec tion is an integral component of experiential learning and a student's overall career and professional development. The Career Services Center and designated Faculty Internship Advisor (FIA) from the student's major provide support and guidance during the semester of participation. Career Services staff is also available to assist students with internship search strategies prior to the internship. At the conclusion of the internship semester, all students are evaluated by their employer and FIA, receivin g a grade derived from successful performance as determined by the employer, the quality of academic assignments submitted to faculty, and completion of minimum required hours. Graduate internships (when administered by the Career Services Center) require a minimum of 12 weeks in length and a minimum of 144 hours per semester on site. All required hours and coursework must be completed within the semester dates for which the student is enrolled in the internship course. Internship course registration may only occur once an offer has been received and accepted from the employer. Several steps are required in order to register, and the Registrar's Office ultimately enrolls each student in the internship course once all required paperwork is completed and su bmitted. The deadline to register for academic internships is the last day to add class for the semester of intended participation as established by the Registrar's Office. (Refer to the academic calendar for specific dates.) Students are strongly encourag ed to apply early and to contact Career Services for assistance, which provides the best success in finding an appropriate experience in time to meet registration deadlines. To learn more about the registration process, visit www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/careerservices/Internships/InternshipsForCredit/index . All full - time and part-time students are encouraged to participate in academic internships. Minimum Requirements for Participation: Good academic standing within one's academic program Maintain full -time status during the reg ular academic year International Students: Meet criteria above as relevant to program enrollment 10 Must be eligible for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) - contact the Office of International Student Programs and visit www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/careerservices/internships for details. Note: Students not meeting minimum requirements may be considered by submitting a formal appeal. Contact Career Services for additional information.

Implementation Date : Summer 2018 Appeal of Adverse Decisions Students have the right to appeal decisions that are made regarding them by any faculty, official or committee of the University. The Dean or Program Director can advise students on the appeals process. Students should first discuss the decision with the individual who made the adverse decision. If a satisfactory resolution of the problem cannot be reached at that level, students may file a subsequent appeal with the dean or the person to whom that faculty or staff membe r reports. In the event a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached at that level, or if there is no intermediary, an appeal may be submitted to the Dean of the College or School. The Dean is the final appeal. In the event a University committee rendere d a decision, the student may file a second appeal with that same committee if there is new information that would have a bearing on the outcome of the case. The University committee is the final appeal. For additional information see http://www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/studentgrievances /. Appeal Procedures Appeal Procedures Appeal Process 1b Dismissal from University - Graduate Students Appeal the dismissal from the University to the college or school dean 2 Permission To Take Classes at Another Institution If the permission form is denied, appeal to Dean.

If the subject is not covered by the national testing agencies (see National Testing Agencies), a student may receive credit for courses offered by the University by making arrangements for an examination to be given by the college offering the course. Satisfactory evidence of adequate and appropriate preparation must be presented before the examination is prepared. If it appears that the student has adequate preparation, the student pays a fee (sum of 1 credit), presents the receipt to the college manager of academic operations, and takes an examination. The college will send the Office of the University Registrar the receipt for the examination fee along with written notification of a passing grade for the examination. Only one examination will be allowed for any one course. Students are ineligible for a challenge examination if they have previously enrolled in or audited the same course at Thomas Jefferson University. See \"Financial Information .\" Computer Resources The Office of Information Resources (OIR) is responsible for management, operation, security and support of the information -technology environment at Jefferson -East Falls. In accordance with established policies, all members of th e Thomas Jefferson University community are responsible for effective, efficient, ethical and acceptable use of information resources. Course -by-Appointment (CBA) The intended course -by-appointment must currently exist in the University catalog, i.e. c ourse number and course name already have been created by the Registrar. All prerequisites for the existing course must have been met prior to the CBA. A written proposal detailing how the existing syllabus will be modified to allow equivalent classroom experiences during the term must be attached to the required approval form. This form is obtained online at the University Registrar's website at www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registar and, if approved, the student must submit the form to the Registrar before the \"last day to add\" deadline (see Academic Calendar). Further details are provided on the form. Students may also be permitted to take CBA for an existing catalog course that anticipates low enrollment. In such cases the University Registrar lists such courses on the master schedule without indicating days or times. The assigned faculty member subsequ ently contacts all students who register, and a mutually convenient day and time is established. The completed form, with the required signatures, will be submitted to the manager of academic operations of the college in which the course is given, or the S chool of Continuing and Professional Studies if appropriate, and must be presented to the Registrar before the \"last day to add\" deadline. 13 The University reserves the right to identify courses that may not be taken by appointment regardless of scheduli ng conflict or anticipated date of graduation. See \"Independent Study. Course Descriptions Descriptions for courses offered at the East Falls campus can be found online at http://www.jefferson.edu/handb ook. Credit Hour Definition of a \"Credit Hour\" - Semester Credits The calculation for credit hour for all courses at Thomas Jefferson University is consistent with the U.S. department of Education a nd the Pennsylvania Department of Education credit hour definition as defined below. U.S. Department of Education: The Code of Federal Regulations, Title 34: Education, Part 600. Institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amen ded. Subpart A -General Section 600.2 states the following: Credit hour : Except as provided in 34 CFR 668.8(k) and (l) , a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably app roximates not less than \u2014 (1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one q uarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or (2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE): 22 Pa. Code, Chapter 31, 31.21 -31.22. \"A semester credit hour represents a unit of curricular mat erial that normally can be taught in a minimum of 14 hours of classroom instruction, plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty\". Thomas Jefferson University's formats and modes of instruction appear below based on the calculation of these modes of delivery for one credit hour per week: Lecture : A credit hour is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out -of- class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks. 14 Laboratory/Studio : The conventional suggestion is two hours of instruction and at least four hours of work outside of class in the semester. Independent Study : In additio n to earning credits through formal courses, students may earn credit through a supervised learning experience in which the student plays a significant part in determining the learning objectives and anticipated outcomes. An independent study provides stud ents a unique opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor, while studying a subject of their own choice. This learning experience, however, should not duplicate the content of an existing catalog course. The meeting time established by student and fa culty must meet the minimum instructional time and out of class student work per week as in the established time for lectures, labs or studios. Additional requirements are detailed in the current catalog, and each School/Program may have requirements beyon d those at the University level. Internship : An internship is a form of experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. Internships provide students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. Academic internships at Thomas Jefferson University aid students in professional preparation through a work expe rience directly related to their major and career goals. All academic internships must meet the NACE criteria for an experience to be considered an internship. Details can be found at: www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/careerservices/students/internships . When administered by the Career Services Center, internships require a minimum of 12 weeks in length and a minimu m of 144 hours on-site. All required hours and coursework must be completed within the semester dates for which the student is enrolled in the internship course. Course by Appointment : Students may be permitted to take a \"course -by-appointment\" for an existing catalog course. The assigned faculty member subsequently contacts all students who register, and a mutually convenient day and time is established. The course follows the normal syllabus, assignments, and examinations. Additional requirements are detailed in the current catalog and each School/Program may have requirements beyond those at the University level. Online : Thomas Jefferson University follows the definiti on of Distance Education/Distance Learning consistent with HEOA, PDE and Middle States standards and guidelines for all distance learning degree or certificate programs. Online education is an alternate format to onsite based instruction using various tech nologies to deliver faculty directed instruction to students who are not physically present in an onsite setting. These methods could be synchronously or asynchronously and technologies may include but are not limited to the internet; one -way and two -way t ransmissions through open broadcast, discussion boards, satellite, wireless communications devices; audio conferencing; or Video cassettes, DVDs, and CD -ROMs, when used in a course in conjunction with any of the technologies listed. All our online courses satisfy the PDE guidelines for \"equivalent instruction .\" See below for PDE parameters for curricular content that that are equivalent to classroom based instruction. (PA Code 31.21) According to PDE clarification, equivalent content: should be related directly to the objectives of the course/program, should be measurable for grading purposes. 15 should have the direct oversight or supervision of the faculty member teaching the course should in some form be equivalent of an activity conducted in the clas sroom. PDE states that equivalent content may not be: homework assignments focused on \"time spent,\" that is, the amount of time the student spends accomplishing the task Hybrid : Hybrid courses are a combination of onsite (face -to-face) and online f ormats. The instruction hours must reflect the total of both methods and comparable time to out of class requirements as in traditional onsite courses. Accelerated Courses : Thomas Jefferson University offers courses that are outside of the standard 15 week semester. Courses in the College of Continuing and Professional Studies are offered in 8 week terms. These courses go through the same curriculum governance as courses in the standard semesters and are subject to the same standards. All accelerated cou rses must meet the required instruction time and out of class work time as defined for their traditional counterparts. Short Courses : These are Faculty -led short courses away or abroad. These courses provide students with appreciation and understanding of the global or national environments. Short away courses help students value intercultural/diversity experiences as they develop an ethical & professional awareness of their discipline within the global/national community. Students also gain insight into the historical, cultural, social, political and geographic contexts of the site of study while applying their resourcefulness, flexibility, interdependence and the ability to collaborate and work in a group. All short courses whether away or abroad, must meet the required instruction time as traditional onsite courses. Academic Year : It is important to note that regardless of terms, format or mode of delivery, all programs in all terms follow the established credit hour definition. Traditional Programs - All traditional programs at Thomas Jefferson University follow the standard semester format with Fall and Spring semesters totaling a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time. (DOE CFR Title 34 668.3 #1i) These weeks do not include reading days or fina l exams. The traditional programs also utilize the twelve week summer term or the two six week summer terms. Determining and Monitoring Amount and Level of Credits : Credit hours are determined by the faculty and the college deans in collaboration with th e University Registrar's Office which enforces the credit hour policies listed above. All curriculum proposals go through the East Falls Academic Opportunities and Oversight committee and are approved by their College Education Committees. These committees guide, review, evaluate, and coordinate curriculum proposals for all curriculum in the university. All undergraduate courses indicate the number of credits proposed and the number of hours for lecture, lab etc. per week for the course e.g . 3-2-3 which ind icates that this 3 -credit course will have 3 hours of lecture and 2 hours of Lab/Studio instruction per week. The graduate courses specify the number of credits for the proposed course and the syllabi show the weekly task/instruction. Furthermore, at the s ubmission of the semester course schedule the Registrar's office reviews all submissions to ensure they are meeting the credit hour requirement. 16 Program Review and Content Specialty Accreditation : Through the regular process of Program Review as well as individual program accreditation, credit hour assignment is monitored by the colleges themselves and visiting accrediting teams. The majority of programs in both the college of Architecture and the Built Environment are reaccredited every 5 -7 years, as ar e some of our design programs, engineering and health sciences programs. Credit by Exam (waiver examinations) Students may request to take a waiver examination instead of taking a course. The student must have experience in the field covered by the cou rse or must have studied it elsewhere. Students may take waiver examinations for up to two courses in their degree programs. Credits earned by a waiver examination are not considered transfer credits. The cost of taking a waiver examination is equivalent to one credit hour of the current graduate tuition. Consult with your program director for specific details. Credit/No credit Some graduate courses are graded on a \"Credit/No Credit\" (CR/NC) basis. To obtain credit for these courses, students must earn the equivalent of a \"B -\" or better in the course. The grade point average will not be affected whether credit is received for the course or not. Cross -Level Course A cross -level course is a course offered at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Graduate expectations are to be commensurate with the level of graduate course listed. Requirements for the graduate course must clearly delineate greater expectations in quantity and/or quality for the graduate students appropriate to the field of study as determined by the program director. The expectations may be differentiated through any of the following methods: additional or higher level learning objectives assessment methods adjusted grading rubrics additional or alternate topical work, assignm ents, readings and/or activities Cross -Listed Courses A cross -listed course is a course offered by more than one department/program at the same level, i.e. graduate/graduate. The cross -listed course will have the identical catalog description in each listing and the same learning objectives. Degree Options The following are degree options outside of the standard graduate degree programs. Offerings for these types of degree programs may be found at eastfalls.jefferson.edu/catalog/Introduction/GradABList . 17 \"2+\" Option \u2014A \"2+\" undergraduate pathway for students completing pre -professional requirements on the East Falls campus in preparation for admission to professional programs on the Center City campus. Combined Degree program \u2014A Combined Degree program is reserved for fields in which the master's degree is the required credential for a professional license. Students are admitted as freshmen to a Combined Degree program (BS/MS). This pathway may shorten the time to the graduate degree. Undergraduate students must ma intain the program's academic progression criteria to remain in the Combined Degree program and to retain admission to the graduate program. \"4 +\" or \"5+\" Option \"sub -matriculation\" \u2014A \"4+\" Option an accelerated pathway to a graduate degree. Undergr aduate students may apply to a designated graduate program and begin graduate coursework, i.e., submatriculate into the graduate program. The graduate degree is completed after the baccalaureate, in additional semesters depending upon the graduate curricul um. Dual Degree program \u2014A Dual Degree program is designed to offer an accelerated pathway to the two degrees at the same level. The two degrees may be completed concurrently or consecutively. 1+1 Option (GRAD+GRAD) \u2014This is an efficient option, whi ch may reduce the credits that would have been required to pursue both degrees separately. Disability Services Thomas Jefferson University does not discriminate on the basis of disability, in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Se ction 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The University provides accommodations for students with disabilities, who are eligible for accommodations and who seek accommodations. All students interested in receiving accommodations must contact the Office of Disability Services by email at AccessibilityServices@philau.edu , phone at (215.951.6830) or by visiting our office (Kanbar 102D). Students requesting accommodations in the classroom must present a current accommodation letter from the Office of Acce ssibilty Services to the instructor before accommodations may be provided. Thomas Jefferson University works with students with disabilities regarding equal access to all services and programs. Requests for accommodations may be made at any time (although accommodations are not retroactive). The University encourages all students who have any inquiries to contact Accessibilty Services. Dropping Courses, Adding Courses, and Schedule Changes Schedule changes, such as adding a course, changing a section, replacing a course or section, etc., must be made by the \"last day to add\" in the Academic Calendar. See Academic Calendar online. 18 Students may drop a course with no notation on the transcript if the drop is completed before \"last day to drop without ' W' grade\" deadline on the Academic Calendar. After the \"last day to drop without W grade,\" a student may withdraw from a course prior to or on the \"last day to withdraw from a course\" (see Academic Calendar). When a student withdraws from a course, a \"W \" will appear on the transcript for that course and this will affect the student's Academic Standing. To withdraw from a course, all students must submit a signed Course Withdrawal form to the University Registrar. Forms may be found online at the Registra r's website: http://www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar. If the student officially withdraws after the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" a \"WF\" will appear in the transcript and affec t the GPA calculations and Academic Standing. If the student fails to officially withdraw from a course before the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" a grade of \"F\" will appear on his/her transcript and affect the student's GPA calculations and Academic Standing. Specific deadlines for dropping special accelerated courses or summer session courses are published by the Campus Registrar. These deadlines will determine the drop period for summer terms. In exceptional cases a student may request specia l permission from the Director of the Academic Success Center to drop a course after the \"last day to withdraw from a course\" deadline. In such cases a grade of \"W\" will appear on the transcript for that course and this will affect Academic Standing. Students may not drop or withdraw from fundamentals courses. Final Examinations Final examinations are scheduled during a one -week period at the end of each semester. Examination periods are two hours in length. The University has a policy prohibi ting the administration of any final examinations during the last \"instructional\" week of the semester in place of an examination during the scheduled final exam week. No student is required to take more than three final examinations during a given day. If, because of this policy, it is necessary for a student to have any examinations rescheduled, arrangements must be made with the University Registrar no later than a week in advance of the start of exam week. Grade Changes All grades become part o f the permanent records of the University at the end of the semester. Following this, no grades may be changed without the written approval of the faculty and associate dean of the college offering the course. Forms for change of grades may be found online on the University Registrar's website , www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar. 19 This in no way affects the institutional policy regarding the grade of \"Incomplete.\" Grade Reports Current students can access and print their grade reports using BannerWeb. Grade reports are not mailed to students. Grad e Equivalencies The University uses a plus/minus grading system. The passing grades for graduate courses are \"CR ,\" \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" . A gra de of \"F\" signifies that the course has been failed. The grade of \"C\" is the minimum passing grade . Students who receive a C - , D+, D or F will be required to retake the course. Several graduate programs offered in the College of Architecture & the Bui lt Environment require that a student progress successfully through a sequence of studio -based courses. Students must receive a B - or above to matriculate to the next design studio. Students who receive a C+ or below in any studio must retake the studio before moving to the next studio in the sequence A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 for all courses in the student's graduate program is required for graduation. The unit of credit is the semester hour. A quality point average is use d to determine scholastic standing. Quality points are assigned according to the following scale: A (4.00) B+ (3.33) B - (2.67) C (2.0 D+ (1.33) F (0.0) A- (3.67) B (3.00) C+ (2.33) C- (1.67) D (1.0 0) WF (0.0) NOTE: The College of Architecture & the Built Environment does not recognize grades of A+ or D -. To calculate the grade point average for a given semester, divide the number of grade points awarded by the number of GPA credits. To calculate the cumulative grade point average, the total number of grade points awarded is divided by the total number of GPA credits. Thesis Extension (\"TH\") Grading Policy Students who are judged to be incapable of successfully c ompleting & defending their Thesis/Masters' Project during the prescribed time limit, as determined by the Instructor, Advisor, and Program Director, will receive the grade of \"Thesis Extension\" (\"TH\") for their coursework. In this case, the student must r e-register for the Thesis/Masters' Project Extension Course in the subsequent fall or spring semester immediately following the semester in which they enrolled in the Thesis/Masters' Project to remain in good standing. Tuition equal to one (1) graduate cre dit hour will be assessed for subsequent coursework. Students have only 2 attempts to add the Thesis/Masters' Project Extension Course (summer, fall & spring). After 2 attempts/semesters, students will add the full Thesis/Masters' Project Course and full tuition will be assessed for subsequent coursework. When the Thesis/Masters' Project is successfully completed, the Instructor will submit a final grade for the Thesis/Project. The \"I\" (Incomplete) grade is used to indicate that a student has missed some p ortion of the required work because of illness or other emergencies beyond his/her control. It indicates that the student will most probably 20 complete the missing requirements within the prescribed time limit and, when they do, will probably receive a passi ng grade* If there is no possibility of passing the course, then it is inappropriate to assign an \"I\" grade. Both the student and faculty member assigning the grade must sign the \"Agreement for the Completion of Work Outstanding.\" Copies of this form are available online on the Registrar's website, http://www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar/ - An \"I\" grade automatically becomes an \"F\" (failure) unless changed by the end of the 4th week counting from the last day of the end of the semester in which the cou rse was taken. Graduate Status Thomas Jefferson University - East Falls defines graduate credit hours in the following way: 6 & > Credits is equal to full -time 3 to 5.999 credits is equal to half -time, and 0.5 to 2.999 is equal to less than half -time. See also financial aid guidelines. Graduation Requirements To graduate, students must fulfil the credit -hour requirements and complete the required courses for their specific graduate program. To be certified for graduation, a candidate must have: A minimum 3.0 cumulative grade point average Students must also complete all requirements for the doctoral dissertation or the master's thesis in programs that require them. See the online \"Thesis Guidelines\" or \"PhD Thesis Manual\" for f urther information. https://www.jefferson.edu/search.html?q=thesis+requirements Students must complete an Application for Graduation prior to the semester in which they plan to gr aduate. This form is available online from the Registrar's website. Students are billed online for graduation fees. Graduate Certificates In order to be awarded a certificate in a College of Architecture & the Built Environment graduate program, a student must achieve a minimum 3.0 cumulative grade point average. Independent Study (IS) Students may earn credit through a supervised learning experience in which the student plays a significant part in determining the learning objectives and anticipated outcomes. IS provides students a unique opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor while studying a subject of their own choice. This learning experience, however, should not duplicate material delivered within an existing course catalog. Only stud ents who are prepared to devote considerable time and effort should undertake IS. Planning of the scope and structure of this learning experience should begin in the semester preceding enrollment, not during the term of the IS. Before registering for th e IS, students must secure the written approval of a faculty member who has agreed to supervise the work. Approval of IS can be expected if the faculty member has the time and 21 the interest to supervise the student's work, and if the supervisor and the stud ent can agree in advance on a suitable subject for independent study. Faculty members may choose which applicants they wish to supervise. The decision will be determined by the faculty member's time available, professional interests and his/her estimate of an applicant's prospects for doing suitable work. The student plans specific activities and goals with the help of the cooperating faculty member. The student must then receive approval for the plans and complete the Independent Study agreement form, w hich is available online at the Registrar's website , www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar. T he student is responsible for bring ing the completed and signed form to the Campus Registrar for official enrollment purposes. International Students International students should consult with the director of International Student Programs concerning specific policies applicable to th em. The director of International Student Programs offers assistance to these students in many areas, such as providing orientation assistance, academic advising assistance, referral to language classes as a result of placement testing, and administrative liaison with governmental agencies. All international students, including transfer students, must report to the International Student Programs office, located in the Kanbar Student Center, to certify their registration and to provide a local address. The office is open on a walk -in basis and by appointment. For additional information, see www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/internationalservices . Leave of Absence Policy A leave of absence is a leave from the University with the intention of returning within two full academic semest ers or a calendar year to complete coursework. The deadline to take a leave of absence from the University without any record of courses or grades of the current semester is the same as the \"last day to drop without a W grade.\" (See Academic Calendar.) If a student takes a leave of absence from the University before the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" all LOA grades will be a \"W\" and will affect the student's Academic Standing. If a student takes a leave of absence after the \"last day to withdra w from a course\" all LOA grades will be a \"WF\" and will affect the student's GPA calculations and Academic Standing. When a student takes a leave of absence during a semester, the effective date of the leave of absence will be determined when the Office of the University Registrar receives the completed leave of absence form (see University Registrar's website for appropriate form). Students must check with the Student Accounts Office to determine their financial responsibility for tuition and other fees , such as housing and meal plans. Any student who is in good academic standing is eligible to take a leave of absence from the University for up to one calendar year. A leave of absence allows students to re -enter the University within one 22 calendar year from the date on which the leave was approved without the need for completing a new application. The leave of absence also enables the student to retain degree requirements from the catalog under which they originally matriculated. Any student may, how ever, choose to re -enter under requirements in the current catalog. A student whose leave of absence extends beyond two full academic semesters must complete a new application to re -enter the University. Graduation requirements will be determined from the catalog in effect on the date of acceptance for re -entry by the Office of Admissions. Students who are not in good academic standing are permitted to apply for withdrawal, but not leave of absence. (See \"Withdrawal from University.\") For information a bout the financial aspects of the leave of absence policy, please refer to the \"Refund Policy\" included in the \"Financial Information\" section of the catalog. Matriculation Maintenance In order to earn credit for the completion of the dissertation, t hesis, capstone project or clinical experience, a student must be registered in the appropriate graduate program (either in residence or absentia) during the semester in which the course work is completed or the dissertation or theses are defended, and mus t be enrolled in the appropriate course. If a student is capable of defending or presenting his/her work within the grace period (approximately four weeks into the next semester, including summer sessions*), the grade of \"Incomplete\" will be awarded. Following successful completion and submission of coursework (or in the case of thesis or dissertation, a final version of the thesis or dissertation), a change of grade will be submitted by the faculty of record. Students who fail to complete the requirem ents during the grace period must re -register for dissertation, thesis, capstone project or clinical experience until they successfully meet all requirements. Students who are judged by the faculty, dissertation or thesis chair, or advisor to be incapab le of completing the requirements during the grace period will receive the grade of \"TH\" (which indicates the course requirements have not been satisfactorily completed, but work is progressing). In addition to being enrolled in the appropriate program, students must re -register in the original course for dissertation, thesis, capstone project or clinical experience coursework in the subsequent fall or spring semester immediately following the semester in which they enrolled to maintain continuous enroll ment and to remain in good standing**. Tuition equal to one graduate credit will be assessed for subsequent courses in dissertation, thesis, capstone project and clinical experience. When the dissertation, thesis, capstone project or clinical experience is successfully completed, the faculty, program director or advisor will submit a final grade for course completion and the student will earn one to nine graduate credits (depending on the major field) for the semester during which the dissertation, thesi s, capstone project or clinical experience was successfully completed. 23 * The grace period ends on the date corresponding to when current semester \"I\" or incomplete grades are changed to \"F\" or failing in the subsequent semester; these are listed on the Academic Calendar which is available on the university website. ** These courses will have an identical course number with an \"e\" indicating a matriculation extension. Non -Degree Status Enrollment Students may apply for non -degree status and regist er for courses at Philadelphia University. Students with non -degree status are permitted to register for a total of 15 earned credits and thereafter must apply for matriculating status. Credits earned under non -degree status cannot be used to receive a ce rtificate, minor, specialization/concentration or any degree without matriculating. Contact the University Registrar's office for more information on applying and registering as a non - degree student. Credits earned under non -degree status cannot be u sed to receive a certificate, minor, specialization/concentration, or any degree without matriculating. Registration: Students are expected to register on the published dates for registration. Fees are payable in advance or upon the registration date. S tudents will receive grades for all courses for which they are registered. Official Class Roster A student who is not on the official class roster (signaling they are not registered for the course) cannot attend nor participate in the class, regardless is the student is taking the course for credit or auditing. Any student who is not on the class roster has until the listed deadline to add the appropriate academic calendar to register. A student should meet with the advising advocate for their major for directions if anything is preventing registration for the course. Students cannot attend a class while attempting to resolve the issue that is preventing registration. Repeating a Course Students who fail a required course must repeat the same cours e during the next term in which it is offered if the course is the only course that will satisfy the requirement, or if they wish to have the failing grade replaced in GPA on the transcript. (The old grade is not removed.) A student will be permitted to enroll in a course for a second time without conditions, regardless of the grade earned in the course previously. A student who has failed a course twice will be permitted to re -enroll for a course for a third time when the student presents the Campus Registrar with written approval from their advisor. A student who has passed a class twice and wishes to take it a third time for any reason, will need to complete the \"Repeating a Course\" form and get the appropriate signatures to be allowed to enroll 24 for the course. Appropriate forms for approval are available online on the Campus Registrar's webpage, www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar . When a cours e is repeated, the original grade will remain on the transcript, but it will be removed from the calculation of the grade point average. The new grade will enter into the calculation of the grade point average, even if it is lower than the grade originally earned. Grades of \"NC\" or \"AUDIT\" will not replace a former grade in a repeated course. A course failed at Thomas Jefferson University may not be repeated at another institution without prior written approval. See the \"Permission to Take Courses at Ano ther Institution\" form on Academic Success websit e www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/successcenter . The most recent grade earned is also the one applied to graduation requirements, even if it is lower than the original grade. Any successfully completed course can be applied to graduation requirements only once, no matter how many times it may be ta ken and passed. Retention of Student Work Thomas Jefferson University is committed to providing excellent and innovative educational opportunities to its students. To help maintain quality academic offerings and to conform to professional accreditation requirements where relevant, the University and its programs regularly examine the effectiveness of the curricula, teaching, services, and programs the University provides. As Thomas Jefferson University sees appropriate, it may retain representative exam ples or copies of student work from all courses. This might include papers, exams, creative works, or portfolios developed and submitted in courses or to satisfy the requirements for degree programs as well as surveys, focus group information, and reflecti ve exercises. Time Restriction The maximum time for completion of the degree program is seven years from the date of first enrollment in master's and doctora l programs. Students who have not earned the graduate degree during this period will have their academic records reviewed and may be asked to meet additional requirements in order to graduate. Transcripts Process for requesting a transcript can be found on the web at www.eastfalls.j efferson.edu/registrar/forms The fee for a transcript is $12 per copy. If express service is needed, there is an additional fee of $25 for domestic express mail, and an additional fee of $40 for international express mail. Walk in request for overnight service must be received by 10 a.m. Please note that unofficial copies of the transcript are available to currently enrolled students through their BannerWeb account. Transfer of credi ts - Graduate Students may transfer a maximum of 30% of the total credits required in the graduate program, provided permission of the graduate program director has been obtained and the student is in compliance with program residency requirements as publ ished by the program. Transfer credit for 25 graduate courses previously taken and awarded a grade no less than a \"B\" from other institutions may be accepted, in all modes of delivery. Courses completed at institutions that are neither regionally accredited n or accredited by agencies listed as accreditors by the United Stated Department of Education may be considered for Thomas Jefferson University transfer equivalencies. Exceptions to the policy may be made by the program director for students studying abroad in university -approved graduate programs. Please note that if a course was used to satisfy the requirements of a completed degree, the credits cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of another degree. Students wishing to transfer credits should be pre pared to submit course outlines and texts used so that proper credit may be given. Students wishing to transfer credits of prior graduate work must inform the program director at the point of admission. Students already enrolled in a Thomas Jefferson Unive rsity graduate degree program must have advanced permission from the respective director in order to enroll in courses with the intent to transfer credit. Transfer to a New Degree Program or Concentration Students who have been admitted to a master's deg ree program at Thomas Jefferson University and who wish to transfer to another degree program, or to change their concentration must file a Change of Graduate Program Request form. The form is found online at the Academic Success webpage www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/successcenter . The student's academic record will be reviewed by the director of the proposed new program. Approval or denial of the request will be sent to the student. An additional application fee is not required and, ordinarily, admissions credentials need not be resubmitted. Credits already earned in the original program may ap ply to the program if, in the opinion of the program director, they are appropriate to the new degree. Verification of Identity for Distance Learning In order to verify that the student registered for Thomas Jefferson University distance education courses or programs actually is the individual participating in and receiving credit for the course or program, one or more of the following methods are used to verify identity: 1) An individual secure login and password is assigned to each matriculated and registered student 2) Pedagogical and related practices that are effective in verifying student identity (faculty training, questioning students, frequent participation in the course, etc.) Secure Login and Password All campus and remot e students are provided with secure login credentials, referred to as a \"campus key\" to all academic systems. Pedagogical and Related Practices For the majority of courses and programs, open source, open reference testing as well as project based final grades are the norm for Thomas Jefferson University distance learning courses and programs. However, on -line instructors have a responsibility to identify changes in students' activity in on -line courses. Examples of changes could be a sudden change in ac ademic performance, change in writing style, and odd statements by students in discussions or email. Faculty are advised to provide more than one kind of assessment type and to ask students to share important ideas learned from references. FERPA PROT ECTION 26 All methods of verifying student identity in distance learning must protect the privacy of student information. Personally identifiable information collected by the College may be used, at the discretion of the Institution, as the basis for identit y verification. For instance, students requesting that their learning management system password be reset may be asked to provide two or more pieces of information for comparison with data on file. RESPONSIBILITIES All users of the University's learnin g management system are responsible for maintaining the security of usernames, passwords, and any other access credentials assigned. The student ID (username) is not a secure credential and may be displayed at various areas in the learning management syste m. The password used to enter the system is a sequence of random numbers and letters. Access passwords may not be shared or given to anyone other than the user to whom they were assigned for any reason. Faculty teaching courses through distance educatio n methods have the primary responsibility for ensuring that their courses comply with the provisions of this policy. Because technology and personal accountability may not verify identity absolutely or ensure academic integrity completely, faculty are enco uraged, when feasible and pedagogically sound, to design courses that employ assignments and evaluations unique to the course and that support academic integrity. TRAINING FOR FACULTY AND STUDENTS The Program Directors and Course Coordinators provide faculty with appropriate training to use pedagogical approaches and technology to promote academic integrity. Additionally, the University provides information about the importance of maintaining academic integrity through a variety of resources. They are widely disseminated in the Student Handbook, the University Catalog, and on Blackboard. Syllabi, the University Catalog and orientations include information for students on the rigors of maintaining academic i ntegrity. Withdrawal from the University It is absolutely essential that students follow the proper withdrawal procedure in order to be assured of an honorable dismissal from the University. Students ar e considered in attendance until this formal notification is completed and returned to the University Registrar. The deadline to withdraw from the University without any record of courses or grades of the current semester is the same as the \"last day to dr op without a W grade.\" (See Academic Calendar.) If a student withdraws from the University before the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" all withdrawal grades will be a \"W\" and will affect the student's Academic Standing upon return to the University. I f a student withdraws after the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" all withdrawal grades will be a \"WF\" and will affect the G.P.A calculations and Academic Standing upon return to the University. If they are withdrawing during the exam period, they will receive \"WF\" grades for all their courses. If an instructor has entered a grade, the grade entered by the instructor will not be changed. Please note that an \"F\" and \"WF\" grade have the same effect on the GPA and Academic Standing. The \"WF\" grade identifi es a late withdrawal. Students who need to leave the University after the \"last day to withdraw from a course\" due to serious circumstances must seek permission from the Dean of Students for late withdrawal. Students who receive permission will receive \"W \" grades. Withdrawal forms are available online on the University Registrar's webpage http://www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar . To return to the University after withdrawal, see the section on \"Re -entry to "}
