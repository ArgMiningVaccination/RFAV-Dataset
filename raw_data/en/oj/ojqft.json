In addition, the observed beneficial effects of [these prebiotics] may improve the immune system by optimizing gut microbiota composition and metabolic function.\" HMOs Prebiotics are defined as \"non-digestible substances that provide a beneficial physiological effect on the host by selectively stimulating the favorable growth or activity of a limited number of indigenous bacteria\". The prebiotic potential of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) have been reported many times in the literature. Human milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs, form a significant portion of human breast milk (about 12%) but they are not easily digested. Experts postulate that their purpose is to jump-start the infant's microbiome (ie. they're prebiotics). The majority of the focus to-date has been on 2\u00b4-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) because it's the most abundant HMO in human milk, but lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) is also commercially available. Players actively investigating HMOs DuPont, Friesland Campina, Glycom A/S, Evolve Bioscience, Abbott, and Nestl\u00e9. details The new study used 2'-FL combined with scGOS and lcFOS to replace 2.2% (wt/wt) of carbohydrates in the standard mouse diet. Mice were randomly assigned to receive a standard diet or the prebiotic supplemented diet for 45 days. After 14 days of intervention, the mice were given a flu vaccine, and they received a booster vaccination at day 21. Results showed that, compared to mice consuming the control diet, mice fed the prebiotic diet had significantly higher immune responses, including 3.2-fold and 1.2-fold increases in IgG1 and IgG2a, respectively. The prebiotic-fed mice also had statistically significant higher percentages of activated immune cells, including B cells, regulatory T cells, and T-helper 1 cells, said the researchers. \"We demonstrate that a dietary intervention with a combination of 2FL and scGOS/lcFOS, more effectively enhances mucosal immune responsiveness to influenza vaccination,\" wrote the researchers. \"Specifically, we demonstrate that a GF2F diet-induced improvement in vaccine responses is modulated via intestinal mucosal sites by inducing profound changes within immune cells, microbial composition, and metabolites. This reveals a key role for microbiota in promoting immunity to vaccinations. \"Our findings may provide for a novel and effective strategy to improve the vaccine responsiveness by targeting the mucosal immune system.\" Source: [Journal Long-Chain Fructo-Oligosaccharides that Enhance Influenza Vaccine Responses Is Associated with Mucosal Immune Regulation in Mice\" Authors: L.
