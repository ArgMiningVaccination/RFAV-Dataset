Chief Residents 2022-2023 Clinical Base Year The Stony Brook Anesthesiology Residency Program is a four-year program. During the clinical year (PGY- 1), our interns rotate through the Emergency Room, Surgery, Medicine, MICU, Echo, OB and Anesthesiology and have introductory experiences in acute and chronic pain assessments management. They also have a two-week Patient Safety rotation. Clinical Divisions and Rotations The department is organized into clinical Divisions that emphasize the many subspecialties of anesthesiology. Use the links below to meet the members of each Division, learn about their academic and research activities, and discover what a Day-in-the-Life-of-a-Resident is like! Clinical Skills Center and Simulation Simulation is a component of our residents' educational experience. There are numerous values to simulation. These include standardization of education, allowing residents to have their medical decisions proceed to a logical conclusion without attending intervention, identification of weaknesses in knowledge base as well as improving technical ability and learning through a kinesthetic teaching process. The Clinical Skills Center at Stony Brook Medicine is a 4,000 square foot state-of-the-art training center that can be used as a resource for specialized training of physicians and other healthcare professionals. The Department of Anesthesiology has played a critical role in this Center from its inception. An operating room, complete with a high fidelity mannequin and a realistic setting, makes this an exciting educational experience. The majority of the Wednesday teaching sessions include a simulator component. The simulator is used to create rare and dangerous situations that the resident may never see during the course of a residency. Examples include airway fires, malignant hyperthermia, anaphylaxis and the incapacitated surgeon. In addition, more routine types of cases and complications can be taught in the simulator, so the resident can encounter such scenarios as \"cannot intubate, cannot ventilate\" or serious arrhythmias in a safe environment. They can practice clinical skills such as intubate and placing lines on mannequins instead of \"real patients\". Clinical Training From the outset, the department has maintained a fully accredited residency training program. We are a four-year program. The Clinical Base Year (CBY) consists of rotations in the Departments of Medicine, Surgery and Emergency Medicine, including 12 weeks of medicine, 8 weeks of MICU, 12 weeks of surgery, 4 weeks in the Emergency Room, 4 weeks in Anesthesiology and 4-6 weeks in Pain Management. The CBY residents will have the opportunity to interact with faculty and residents in the Department of Anesthesiology. Three groups of residents undergo training in each of the three clinical anesthesia years of training (CA-1, 2 and 3 years equivalent to PGY 2, 3 and 4). There is large variety in a very substantial caseload. All specialties and subspecialties are represented. All anesthetics are delivered by residents under the direction of an attending anesthesiologist. This supervision is given 24 hours per day, either on a one-to-one basis or, at most, in a ratio of one attending for two residents. It is an expression of our standard: optimal care, for all patients, at all hours. This applies not only in the operating rooms, but also in the obstetrical delivery suite, the intensive care units and the pain clinic. This clinical instruction may be strenuous and demanding; it is alleviated by the strong personal relationship between attending and resident and by certain amenities, such as breaks throughout the working day, an attending late call system to allow timely resident relief, education days that break up the clinical routine and wellness sessions to provide self-care education and social support. In addition, we have a night float call system. Residents on OR night float are off on all weekends for the rotation. Weekend call for other rotations averages 1-2 weekends/resident/month. Duty hours range from 47-55 hours/week if not on weekend call, 65-74 hours/week if on weekend call. Clinical Training Sites Community Outreach Dr. Ursula Landman, Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, is the Walk Leader for the Stony Brook Medicine Chapter of \" Diversity and Inclusion The Department of Anesthesiology at Stony Brook University Hospital is committed to building an inclusive culture that celebrates the diverse voices in our residents, faculty and staff. We do not discriminate based on race, sex, gender, religion, ethnicity, disability, citizenship, or any other values that makes us each unique. The voices of our different viewpoints and perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences are valued. Dr. Tracie Saunders, Professor of Clinical Anesthesiology, serves as a Diversity Ambassador for the Department of Anesthesiology and Stony Brook University Hospital. As Diversity Ambassador, Dr. Saunders serves as a liaison between the anesthesiology department and the SBU Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Intercultural Initiatives. We celebrate diversity and seek to promote the inclusion of everyone in our residency program. Our residents, faculty, students, support staff and patients represent a wide range of countries, cultures, socio-economic backgrounds, and sexual identities, all which reflect and enhance our medical community and all those whom we serve. For further information on how our institution is committed to inclusion and diversity, please visit: The Department of Anesthesiology and Stony Brook Medical Center partnered with the American Medical Association (AMA) in their shared commitment to dismantling structural racism and increasing diversity in the physician workforce. Members of our department, including residents, have participated in the Education Wednesday 7 AM Conferences Wednesday 8:00am- 3:00pm Conferences (1 CA cohort per week; 1-2 times/month/CA class) Faculty There are over 80 faculty members in the Department of Anesthesiology. Many of them are involved in all three aspects of the department: clinical care, teaching and research. Some of them, including eight Ph.D scientists, focus on one particular aspect. Faculty members have joint appointments in other departments and training programs in the Medical School including Physiology & Biophysics, Pharmacological Sciences, Health Sciences, Biochemistry, Neurological Surgery, Pediatrics, Dental Medicine and Urology. Many are active in the field of anesthesiology at the state, national and international levels. Fellowship Matches 30-70% of our residents pursue fellowships 40-60% of the graduates enter private practice Global Health The Department of Anesthesiology supports Residents and Attendings to participate in I went to Zambia during my last year of residency. I was so lucky to go - it was definitely an eye opener. I saw and learned SO much! it gave me a totally different perspective on medicine, how it can be done so differently with minimal resources. It forced me to get out of my comfort zone, and to still provide safe medical care. Now as an attending who is going on medical missions, I would recommend this experience to everyone! -Dr. Anna Kogan, former Stony Brook Resident and current Stony Brook Attending -Drs. Justin Smith and Minxi Wang, class of 2018.

Telephone information: 631-632-6770 House Staff Office: 631-444-2754. Sample Resident Main OR Weekend Call and Night Float Schedule Teaching Hospitals Resident training in Anesthesiology is provided in two medical centers: Stony Brook University Medical Center and the Northport Veterans Administration Hospital. Since we began providing care in 1980, the staff of Teaching Opportunities There are plenty of opportunities to teach as a resident. Because anesthesiology is a mandatory 2-week medical student rotation at Stony Brook, we have 140 students rotating through the OR each year to learn clinical anesthesia and often an additional 15- 25 elective medical students. The medical students are paired to work with residents, and residents typically enjoy having an opportunity to teach students during their clinical day. We also have a variety of other learners that are paired with the residents in the main OR for their anesthesia experience. They include dental residents, periodontal residents, dental students, EM residents, ENT residents, neurosurgery residents, and orthopedic surgery residents. One Chief Resident per year serves as the \"Chief Resident for Medical Student Education.\" This Chief assigns the students to specific ORs each day to assist the students with meeting their goals and objectives for the rotation. Senior residents have an opportunity to teach junior residents when on call and on OB. In our program, the CA3s act as a junior attendings when on call to learn how to triage cases and assist with the supervision of the CA1s and CA2s for induction, emergence and intraoperative care. Regarding classroom teaching, our department gives 12-18 medical student lectures each month. Residents can volunteer to teach some of these lectures if they like. All of our Education Day resident lectures are given by faculty, but residents have an opportunity to teach their peers and faculty during Journal Club presentations, QA grand rounds and their senior presentations. We have a \"Residents as Teachers\" sub curriculum that allows residents to receive feedback on both their clinical and didactic teaching. There are also 12 teaching awards available for residents to receive each year (3 per quarter). The awards are great for the residents' CVs, and residents receive $50 added to their education fund for each award. There is one summative \"Resident Teacher of the Year Award\" given each June to the resident who has received the most votes from students. This recipient receives a certificate and engraved plaque. In sum, there are plenty of opportunities to teach and be rewarded for doing a good job. Teaching Videos Testimonials \"Completing my residency in Anesthesiology at Stony Brook has been a fantastic experience. In general, I think we have a well-balanced work-life dynamic, which allows us to spend time with our families and friends and get top-tier educational experiences. The area surrounding the hospital is a beautiful suburb of Long Island that is safe and family-friendly. Most residents live a short drive from the hospital and don't have to worry about congested traffic patterns. During the spring, there are beautiful arboretums and gardens to visit. In the summer, the Patchogue Village hosts the Alive at Five festival, a regular meeting ground for residents to hear live music and grab a drink. I would describe our training as both robust and eclectic, with a strong case mix Index, as documented by CMS. We are exposed to a wide array of cases, and residents have an appropriate amount of supervision at first, which matures into more autonomy as we grow our clinical skills. As a CA-1, we get our reps in on general cases, but as a CA-3 resident, we function as junior attendings. Helping to manage the OR Front Board and build the daily OR schedule while simultaneously developing our anesthetic plans and delivering them in the OR. Our clinical skills are cultivated by a robust educational program, which our faculty lead. Every month we as a class are excused from clinical responsibilities to attend simulation sessions and lectures, in which the department caters food for lunch and faculty members discuss keywords and topics pertinent to our board exams and future practice. Above all the amazing clinical and educational experiences Stony Brook offers, I also value the personal relationship I have developed with my classmates, faculty, and residents from within the department and from various other specialties in the Hospital. Weekly meet-ups with classmates, snowboarding trips, academic conferences, and even summer getaways to Fire Island are memories I will never forget. All in all, I had an amazing experience at Stony Brook. The program has only elevated my clinical and academic skills, making me the physician I am today.\" Giacomo Scorsese, DO 2023 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2023-24 Cardiac Anesthesiology Fellowship, Mt. Sinai East, New York \"My experience during my anesthesiology training at Stony Brook was nothing short of phenomenal. This program not only checks off all the boxes, but certainly exceeds expectations in multiple categories. To start, the emphasis on education, both inside (world-class faculty with innate eagerness to teach) and outside (all-day education days) of the operating room has allowed me to excel on exams and build a strong knowledge base. Furthermore, Stony Brook is nestled in the north shore of eastern Long Island and as such, is one of the only tertiary care level 1 trauma centers in the county. This fact alone owes itself to no shortage of high acuity cases whose patients bear complex pathology. My clinical experience here definitively has allowed me to develop into a competent and confident anesthesiologist. Above all, the truly intangible reason that I love Stony Brook so much is the people I surrounded myself with daily for many long hours - coresidents, attendings, program director, nurses, CRNAs, residents from other specialties. These are people I am fortunate enough to call some of my best friends, my mentors, and even one who is now my fianc\u00e9. Without a doubt, they will be important people in my life for years to come. And for that alone, I am truly grateful for my experience at Stony Brook. So, if you are looking for a program that has a robust didactic program with the case selection to back it up, Stony Brook's Anesthesiology residency program is by far simply one of the best there is.\" Christopher Seiter, DO 2023 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2023-24 Cardiac Anesthesiology Fellowship, Vanderbilt University \" Choosing the anesthesiology training program at Stony Brook is a decision that I would make over and over again. The breadth and complexity of cases that I've been involved in have prepared me well to confidently approach even the most challenging of cases as a future attending. As a resident, I have been given autonomy and independence, while always knowing that I have the full support of my faculty and mentors, should I need it. All of this, coupled with a program that truly cares about and fosters its residents' well-being and personal development, is the reason why I wholeheartedly recommend this training program.\" Aria Shafai, MD 2023 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2023-24 Obstetric Anesthesiology Fellowship, Columbia Presbyterian \" When I reflect on my time back at Stony Brook I cannot help but notice a smile come to my face. Repeatedly I get asked what I loved about the program and the answer is always the same: the people. It energized me as I walked in the lobby everyday, knowing that whatever challenges or hardship I was coming into, I would face them with colleagues that threw themselves utterly and completely into what they did, threading their care with compassion, and molding me into the best anesthesiologist that I could become. In fact, I see small aspects of everyone that mentored me in the care that I provide and find myself muttering phrases that were drilled into me as I work through tense moments ie.'head on a swivel, Karim'. The entire Stony Brook family was tight knit and there was seriousness but also an almost playful banter that accompanied our day to day work. Everybody had some knowledge to pass on and their approachability made it easy to pick that knowledge up. The adage 'The People Make the Place' has never rang more true. I left Stony Brook with confidence that the versatile skills that I had learned had given me a solid foundation to tackle any case that I may encounter in my career. Being the largest medical center in the area, Stony Brook, provided me the opportunity to see a wide range of pathology and an unparalleled breadth of cases. Equally important, if not more so, I left Stony Brook still feeling human, I never felt that I was a 'cog in the machine'. It was actually quite the opposite, the priority was to have residents placed in the clinical environments that would have the most teaching potential. In fact, entire days have clinical duties shaved away so that residents could focus on didactics and 'life stuff' which meant I never got a cavity during residency because I always knew when I could schedule a dental appointment. During my final year of residency I ran the recruitment process for incoming applicants and the question that I heard the most was 'How do I go about ranking programs?'. Personally, the program you choose should have an environment or 'feel' that will help you thrive. So the question becomes, what is Stony Brook's 'feel'. The answer: cosy atmosphere at a big institution. \" Karim Shuaib, MD 2022 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Fellowship, Columbia Presbyterian \" Stony Brook's Anesthesia residency program both met and exceeded my expectations as a training program. I thoroughly enjoyed the pro-resident environment that they fostered and that they valued work-life balance above all else (something that is hard to come by these days). I made special connections with several faculty members that I will keep forever. I am extremely grateful for all the opportunities this training program gave me. I am confident with the knowledge and skills this program has helped me develop and trust in myself to provide excellent care to my patients. Without hesitation, I highly recommend this training program to any aspiring anesthesiologist.\" Carlos Figueroa, MD 2022 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2022-23 Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellow, Hofstra \" One of the first things that I noticed during my interview at Stony Brook was the camaraderie amongst the residents and faculty. The location, the quality of training, and most importantly the environment were some of the reasons I ranked Stony Brook so highly and I could not have been happier with my decision. The learning environment at Stony Brook is unparalleled. A program director who genuinely cares, faculty who are extremely supportive of their residents and co-residents who became close friends are only a few of the reasons why I enjoyed coming to work. Furthermore, the clinical volume and complexity of cases provided exceptional training. After spending the last four years here, not only have I developed the skills and knowledge to become an excellent anesthesiologist, but I have also developed friendships and relationships with mentors which I will carry for many years beyond residency.\" Ashley Mathew, MD 2022 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department Anesthesiology 2022-23 Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellow, DC Childrens \"The Anesthesiology Residency Program at Stony Brook University is one of the best training programs in the country. From the clinical experience to the research exposure, and the faculty mentorship - choosing to pursue my training at Stony Brook was one of the best decisions I have ever made. As the only level 1 trauma center in Suffolk County, residents are exposed to a full spectrum of cases. After finishing my training, I feel confident in my abilities to handle any type of case that comes in the door. Aside from my excellent clinical experience, the research program within the department has helped me develop skills to not only ask but also answer my own clinical questions. In four years, I was able to co-author 37 poster presentations, 9 oral presentations, 2 book chapters, and 2 manuscripts. Lastly, guidance from my faculty mentors was invaluable as I began to shape my plans to pursue a fellowship in pain medicine. The program at Stony Brook has all the tools to help residents succeed and become leaders in anesthesiology. \" Ramanjot Kang, MD 2022 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2022-23 Pain Fellow, Cornell \"Stony Brook Hospital has the benefit of being a large academic center while maintaining a warm and personalized teaching environment. Since my interview here with our Anesthesiology department, I've always felt welcomed and listened to. Leaders of the department ensure that resident concerns are very promptly addressed and changes implemented in an efficient manner. Anesthesiology attendings are well-versed in evidence-based medicine and enjoy teaching and allowing for resident independence where appropriate. Further, the cases encountered here represent a great range of complexity. I've felt privileged to be a part of a diverse and motivated group of people who not only provide the highest level of patient care but are also enjoyable to be around in a clinical and non-clinical setting. I have never questioned my decision to come to train in Anesthesiology at Stony Brook Hospital and would do it exactly the same way all over again!\" Ishu Kant, MD 2022 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2022-23 Pain Fellow, Mt. Sinai West \"Stony Brook department of anesthesiology was an excellent place to undergo my anesthesiology training. Not only do I feel very well prepared to practice on my own, but the overall environment during training was phenomenal. The residents and the attending physicians, as well as CRNAs, get along very well and have a very familial relationship. This allowed me to not only thrive during training but enjoy every day that I came to work. The program sets it's residents up for success and I truly believe is the main reason I was able to match at my number one fellowship choice. I will absolutely miss the people and friendships that were made during my training at Stony Brook.\" Lucas Bracero, MD 2022 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2022-23 Chronic Pain Fellow, Cornell University Medical Center \"Since the day I came to the Stony Brook Anesthesiology family, I have felt nothing but support from all levels of the department. I came in ambitious and goal-oriented, and I can honestly say I accomplished everything that I set out do. With the help of our attending anesthesiologists, I am ready to hit the ground running when it comes to plying my trade as an attending. With the support of the research department, I have been able to add meaningful publications to the academic world. With the backing of my program director and chair of anesthesiology, I was able to take on leadership positions on a local and national level, in addition to completing an MBA program. My co-residents were nothing short of amazing and will undoubtedly become lifelong friends. I truly feel blessed to have been able to complete my anesthesiology residency at Stony Brook, as I feel I could not have had this experience anywhere else in the country, As I start a family and move on to the next chapter of my career, I know that I will miss the family I made right here at Stony Brook. \" Duran Ryan Mitchell, MD, MBA 2021 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2021 MBA Graduate, Brandeis University 2021-22 Chronic Pain Fellow, Duke University Department of Anesthesiology \"I have had an amazing experience at Stony Brook. For me, the biggest strength of the program is the people. The attendings are invested in teaching, and the program truly cultivates a supportive learning environment. Due to the combination of high case volume and the fact that residents do all complex cases, we graduate feeling very ready to practice independently. In addition, having ample opportunity to get involved in medical student education is something that I have very much enjoyed. On the whole, I could not have asked for a better place to learn how to become an outstanding anesthesiologist.\" Josiah Miles, MD, 2021 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2021-22 Cardiac Anesthesiology Fellow, Albert Einstein Medical Center Before Fellowship \"Stony Brook Anesthesia residency is an excellent program with great faculty and amazing co-residents! This program prepares you well to take on the real world, whether it be private or academic practice. Our residents always match well to fellowships in the fields they want and have amazing support from our faculty. We do plenty of complex cases and have the opportunity to do many, many procedures. There are actually no anesthesia subspecialty fellows here, so we work directly with pediatric, cardiac, and pain attendings and get plenty of 1-on-1 teaching. Intern year acclimates you to the system and you work with your future subspecialty colleagues. Other benefits are that we have an academic day every three weeks where we get to come together as a class, enjoy a free meal, and get lectures from our attendings. All of our residents look forward to this day. We also get a generous education stipend which helps pay for our licensing and board exams. They even give us additional education funds if we do well on our in-training exams. Lastly, we have an amazing program director who really goes above and beyond for the residents. She is a true resident advocate who supports us and stands up for us. I think the program is small enough (10 residents per class) that we all get to know each other really well, but it's big enough that we get to do a wide variety of cases. Overall, residency was a great experience, and it has taught me to become a confident anesthesiologist!\" After Fellowship \"Stony Brook's anesthesia residency program does a great job of preparing you for the next step, whether it is fellowship or private practice. During fellowship, I appreciated how much I got to do during residency at Stony Brook because I was not competing for cases or procedures with fellows. The residents at Stony Brook get to work directly with attendings and learn from them 1 on 1, even in the most complex, high risk cases. I also realized during fellowship that a medium-sized residency program is great because you can actually keep in touch with all of your co-residents after residency and see that everyone is doing well. Stony Brook did an excellent job of preparing me for fellowship\" Manuel Lee, MD 2020 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellow 2021-22 Department of Anesthesiology & Critical Care Medicine Johns Hopkins School of Medicine \"As my residency ends with Stony Brook Anesthesiology, I will never forget what an outstanding experience this program provides. Stony Brook Anesthesiology has innovative teaching techniques, for example, full day Academic Wednesdays where you get excused from the OR duties to attend lectures and simulations. There is a diverse array of clinical experiences including outpatient pain procedures, complex cardiac cases and mechanical support, offsite anesthesia, a bustling neuro-intervention suite, interesting OB cases, and anesthesiologist intensivists teaching critical care. There is abundant availability to become involved in clinical and basic science research, and there is opportunity to present at major conferences including ASRA, ASA, PGA, and IARS. The environment at Stony Brook is a great place to work thanks to all the faculty, nurses, and clinical staff, and Long Island is a great place to live. If I had to make my rank list again today, there is no doubt in my mind that Stony Brook Anesthesiology would be #1!\" RIchard Tenure, MD 2020 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2020-21 Critical Care Fellow, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania 2021-22 Cardiac Anesthesia Fellow, Massachusetts General Hospital Before Fellowship \"If I were making my rank list again today, I would 100% without hesitation put Stony Brook as my #1 choice for anesthesia residency. I could not be happier with the training and experience I received. During my tenure there and afterwards, the faculty invested in my education and professional development. It is remarkable what can be achieved with mentors and faculty that invest in you as a physician and adult learner. I was an average medical student at best. The experience, resources, and opportunities at Stony Brook Anesthesia propelled me to one of the most competitive fellowship positions in our field, first author on original research and book chapters, and ready to take on any challenge the day after graduation.\" After Fellowship \"Having completed cardiac fellowship I now see how lucky I was to have done my general anesthesia training at Stony Brook. We got to do all of the most complex cases with attendings who were focusing on getting you as an individual to the next level of practicing anesthesia. Little did I know when I was in residency how well recognized our attendings are on the state and national stage as teachers, clinicians, and researchers. So many times during the last year I remember using things my attendings at SB had taught me to guide me through an acute situation in the OR...and yes, referencing all of Dr. Poppers' handouts. Residency at Stony Brook 100% put me ahead of the curve to start fellowship.\" Leif Ericksen, MD 2020 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2020-21 Cardiac Anesthesia Fellow, NYU Department of Anesthesiology \"I just finished my cardiac anesthesiology fellowship. After having close interactions with another residency program during fellowship, I am glad to report that I feel that Stony Brook's anesthesiology program is exceptional in every aspect and prepares graduates for future success.\" Demetri Adrahtas, MD 2019 Resident Graduate, Stony Brook Department of Anesthesiology 2020 Cardiac Anesthesiology Fellow, Rutgers University \"My experience and education during residency had exceeded my expectations and milestones that were required.\" Michael Khalili, MD 2019 Residency Graduate, Stony Brook University Department of Anesthesiology 2019-2020 Pain Management Fellow, Columbia University Department of Anesthesiology \"I have to admit that I was not thrilled about starting residency at the same institution where I had just completed medical school. I wanted to try living in another part of the country. Life, however, dictated my fate... and I could not be happier. Aside from meeting some of my best friends during residency (and I still have one as a colleague here ), I feel incredibly well trained. I have friends all over the country in anesthesia, and we often compare our exposure to cases, especially traumas and neurointerventional procedures (my division). I can honestly say that I can work anywhere and feel confident in any case at any time because of my anesthesiology training at Stony Brook. Stony Brook Anesthesiology has a large enthusiastic group of young faculty members who are eager to teach, help and try new things. Residents feed off of this and often become good friends, not just trainees, with the faculty. The department is also willing to change and incorporate new ideas into every day resident life (e.g. night float system, international medical missions, opportunities for mini-fellowships CA3 year, etc). What I have learned is that when you are happy, you do well. I think you would be happy at Stony Brook.\" Sofia Geralemou, MD Graduate, Stony Brook Residency Program 2011 Stony Brook Anesthesia: Excellent Training in a Great Environment \"The best way I would describe my experience in anesthesia at Stony Brook is an excellent place for clinical training, with knowledgeable and friendly faculty, and great educational resources. Add to that the location of being in Long Island, with many different active and entertaining venues on its own, not to mention that it's just a train ride away from NYC, being here is the complete package. The department at Stony Brook was recently ranked #6 nationwide in NIH funding to an anesthesia department, and this is the result of the commitment they put into education and research. In fact, I was able to begin my research career here through the 6 month research track they offered during the 3rd year of my anesthesia residency. This research flourished and after receiving grant funding for my work, I decided to continue my research as faculty here at Stony Brook Anesthesiology. I am excited at the direction our department is moving, as we continue to grow and expand, and I look forward to working with each new resident group that joins our department. I certainly found the perfect anesthesia residency match for me and my career, hope you are able to find the same for you. Good luck!\" Rany Makaryus, MD Graduate, Stony Brook Residency Program 2010 \"Hi, my name is Dr. Jason Daras. I graduated from the Stony Brook Anesthesiology Residency Program in 2010. Through my years at Stony Brook, I had many wonderful experiences in the areas of academics, didactics, clinical anesthesia as well as research. The level of teaching at the program was far superior than I ever expected. Attending physicians stayed late or came in early to go over cases for board prep. They would give mock orals for our oral boards preparation starting in the CA1 year. I was able to easily pass my writing and oral boards on the first attempts. I came out of Stony Brook feeling extremely comfortable providing anesthesia for my patients and, quickly, my new practice had confidence in me. I really attribute this to the amount of attention each resident receives at Stony Brook as they do their clinical work. The feedback I received from the residency program allowed me to adjust my skills to make me the safest and most efficient anesthesiologist I could be. And further, the exposure to all anesthesia related procedures is unbeatable by any program in the U.S. in my opinion. I graduated from the program able to easily and quickly insert various central lines, arterial lines, and perform peripheral nerve blocks for regional anesthesia. I came out of Stony Brook highly proficient in regional anesthesia. As an attending for 7 years, I have seen many new graduates incapable at performing regional anesthesia at the level of any graduates of the Stony Brook Anesthesiology Program that have joined my practice after me. As a result of my experience at Stony Brook, I not only passed my boards on the first attempt, I joined the largest physician run anesthesia group in New Jersey, Morris Anesthesia Group. I quickly took on a leadership role and in my first year was promoted to Director of Regional Anesthesia. I truly believe Stony Brook brings something special to the table and that is teaching its residents how to be leaders in the world of anesthesia. Now, 7 years out of residency, I am not only a managing partner of Morris Anesthesia, but I was just named Chief of Anesthesia at our hospital. I attribute this great achievement to the place it all started. The experience that residents get at Stony Brook is priceless and I cherish my decision in listing Stony Brook as my number one choice for anesthesia residency.\" Jason Daras, DO Graduate, Stony Brook Residency Program 2010 Director of Regional Anesthesia Morris Anesthesia Group, Parsippany, NJ Mark Kim, MD and Jonathan Tan, MD (Graduates, Stony Brook Residency Program 2013) discuss their residency experience at Stony Brook Anesthesiology. University/Community Stony Brook University From its beginnings in 1957, Stony Brook's reach extends from its 1,100-acre campus on Long Island's North Shore: encompassing the main academic areas, an 8,300-seat stadium & sports complex, a performing arts center, Stony Brook University Medical Center, the Health Sciences Center, and the Veterans Home to Stony Brook Manhattan, a new Research and Development Park, three business incubators and the new Stony Brook Southampton campus on Long Island's East End.

To the students, the scholars, the health professionals, the entrepreneurs, and all the valued members who make up the vibrant Stony Brook community, this is a not only a great local and national university, but one that is making an impact on a global scale. Surrounding Community The Stony Brook area is one of the most attractive residential communities in the Northeast. Amid the hilly dunes near Long Island Sound the woods and fields along the water offer a variety of scenic delights. Fishing, boating, golf and horseback riding are among the many opportunities for recreation. Small wonder that the area has always been attractive to artists and scholars. The local museums and neighboring communities provide recreation and educational experience. Videos Visiting Professors The department sponsors a monthly Visiting Professor lecture series. Invited speakers present clinical and/or research topics at our Wednesday morning Grand Rounds. Whenever possible, the Visiting Professor makes a separate presentation to the Residents on Tuesday afternoon. The Visiting Professorship in April or May is combined with our annual Wellness The Department of Anesthesiology is so committed to the wellness of their residents that it has a dedicated Wellness Chief/Social Chair for the Residency Program! The Wellness Chief selects and coordinates social events for the program and keeps tabs on the overall morale and wellness of the residents. Previous program wellness events have included fishing trips, Spartan Race, BBQs, pool parties, baseball games, skeet shooting, dinners, ski trips, bowling parties, holiday parties, paintball, Halloween parties,... Institutional wellness events have included annual puppy socials, BBQs on the patio, ice cream socials, and wellness fairs. In addition to the departmental and institutional social events, the anesthesiology residents receive 1-2 all-day, nonclinical education days for their class each month. These all-day education days further promote wellness and peer support by regularly bringing each residency class together during scheduled breaks from the hustle and bustle of clinical training.
