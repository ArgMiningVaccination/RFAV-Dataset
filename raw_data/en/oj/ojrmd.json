Research - Mycobacterial Pathogenesis - Vaccine Development Against Human and Animal Infections. - Evolution of Bacterial and Viral Genomes The research in my laboratory involves developing new technologies and innovative approaches to understand bacterial pathogenesis and to generate useful therapies (drugs and vaccines) against human and animal infections. My research team developed novel approaches to address specific questions relevant to bacterial pathogenesis such as the identification of types of genes expressed during infection and the host responses to such gene products. Currently, we are working on the functional genomics of M. tuberculosis (M. tb) and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (M. ap). In particular, we are investigating questions related to the role of copper metabolism on M. tb persistence and the role played by key global gene regulators on M. ap survival during infection. We are also taking advantage of genetically modified organisms to develop more effective vaccines against tuberculosis (againt M. tb, M. bovis) and Johne's disease. Recently, we initiated a project to employ nanotechnology in developing vaccines and novel adjuvant systems against important poultry diseases (e.g. Avian Influenza, Infectious Bronchitis Virus and Infectious Bursal Disease). Our goal is to develop nanovaccines as a platform technology against diseases that threaten both the dairy and poultry industries. Patents: - Inventor: Adel M. Talaat, Bassam Abomoelak and Sarah K.
