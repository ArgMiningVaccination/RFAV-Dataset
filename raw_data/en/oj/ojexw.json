The facts are clear: at least 85 percent of all illnesses are the result of an unhealthy lifestyle. Drugs and surgery are occasionally helpful in treating illness; but maintaining health is your responsibility - and is a probability if you follow the program in Body of Health. Listening to your intuitive intelligence provides the foundation for a healthy life. Dr. McCartney created the term Intuition Medicine and teaches how the best approach to remain healthy and to restore health is to develop your intuition to understand your body and its relation to mind, emotions, and spirit. Body of Health teaches you to be self-aware and healthy and to embrace intuition to transform your life. Dr. McCartney's thorough explanation of the human energy system is exceptionally useful. From theory to integration, Body of Health provides useful tools for enhancing your personal intuitive healing. Building on a discussion of the wide variety of intuitive skills we all share, Dr. McCartney also provides useful self-assessment tools to evaluate your natural intuitive intelligence. Then you move into the critical practice of grounding or centering. You are introduced to physical, visual, and auditory methods that enhance intuition and meditative exercises. The rich variety of exercises provides a solid foundation for building your medicine chest of intuitive tools. The recommendation to keep an intuition journal is valuable in helping you develop your skills and provide you with feedback on your progress. Body of Health is a marvelous antidote to the stress of modern life. With insights into energy blocks and clues to open them, here is your opportunity to study and practice the medicine of the twenty-first century \u2014 Intuition Medicine. Far more important than drugs, preventing illness and maintaining health are the keys to optimizing your life. I hope this brief overview of this gem of a book encourages you to read and practice the wisdom presented. Your health and happiness will be the happy recipients. C. Norman Shealy, MD, PhD President, Holos Institutes of Health, Inc. President, Holos University Graduate Seminary Founder, American Holistic Medical Association Keeping your body healthy is an expression of gratitude to the whole cosmos \u2014 the trees, the clouds, everything. \u2014 Thich Nhat Hanh Human beings are much more than bodies; our physical, emotional, and spiritual components are inextricably linked to create our personal universe. Body of Health presents a map for a human wholeness journey \u2014 a practice of living in health and balance, with all senses receiving gifts of guidance toward self-awareness while embracing the experience of the world. This, I believe, is what it means to live in a state of grace, and it calls for listening to your intuitive intelligence, your wisdom voice. We live in a small world \u2014 an aggregated cosmology of reality, with personal universes entangled as one global consciousness. In this complex living organism, the health of one affects the whole. Many sciences and philosophies view the vital force of an individual as intrinsically linked with the collective whole, even given differences of time and distance. They see organisms as constantly exchanging energy and information with their surroundings in a complex field of life. At its best, this energetic interdependence brings strength when there are harmonious support systems and healthy communication. However, it can also be a cause of dis-ease, especially for a sensitive individual when discord and destructive elements are present. Body of Health presents a whole-human perspective of wellness, grounded in the belief that health of the individual contributes to health of the whole. Body of Health will teach you how to be self-aware and healthy in your body, mind, and spirit while living in a world abundant with diverse energies and people. By paying attention to the messages that you receive nonverbally through your body and through your own sensations, you can begin to appreciate your life on a deeper level. You will begin responding to your world in a new way, and the number and scope of the messages you receive will increase. This journey consists of listening to, trusting, and following your intuition. Your journey's guide, intuition, is the capacity to understand your interconnectedness in the universe with quick insight and direct knowledge. INTUITIVE EXPLORATION Becoming more aware of your intuitive sense changes your experience of life. This book is an invitation to participate in a transformative journey of intuitive exploration. When you embrace intuition along with your other five senses, your perspective on life opens up, you are presented with more possibilities, and you are given choices that directly influence your health, balance, and vital energy. Read this book with the mind-set of an experimenter. Test the hypotheses, practice with new ideas, play with insights, and put what you learn into thought and practice. When you do this, your intuition will develop and work with your other senses. As your intuitive ability expands, you will tune into signals from each element of your being and discover how disturbances and changes in one area can affect your entire system. In this book, I will introduce you to three essential methods for accessing your intuitive intelligence: Diagnosis or recognition: Owning your intuitive abilities and using them to diagnose your current state of health. Clearing and balancing: Increasing your level of overall health by clearing blockages and balancing your energy. Protection or self-possession: Creating a positively charged protection field in and around your personal universe and claiming full possession of your energetic space. Like the elements of your personal universe, these categories cannot be neatly delineated; as you develop your skills in one area, your abilities in the other areas will improve and your entire intuitive awareness will be transformed. With practice and observation, you will begin to see how energetic systems operate. In the same way that musicians increase the sensitivity of their ears through exercises and training, you will learn to increase your intuitive abilities by working with the wisdom tools presented in this book. The system of Intuition Medicine is a study of human consciousness. This body of work is presented as an empirical methodology that harkens back to the time before a rationalistic/linear/dualistic worldview took precedence in scientific research. Before this Cartesian approach gained dominance, the scientist's subjective experience was naturally included as part of research data, rather than being regarded as interfering with the validity of the results. I hope that, as you read this book, your understanding of what it means to be human will greatly expand. I invite you to discover that the science of human consciousness is not a technique or methodology, but a process that reveals itself when given attention. HOW TO USE THIS BOOK The tools you will find in Body of Health are meant to be used creatively to heal, enhance, and design your life. I present the information on many levels so that everyone from the beginner to the advanced student of life can glean something new. My intention is that you will receive a fulfilling amount of information whenever you approach this work. This also allows you to read the book more than once, gaining more insight each time. In this way, the book is designed to support your growth as you practice the Intuition Medicine tools and discover more about yourself. While you are free to use Body of Health in any way that works for you, I believe that the following suggestions will help you get the most from this journey. Keep an Intuition Journal You will benefit from creating a personal book specifically to track your intuitive development and language. Use a lined, bound journal or ringed notebook, whichever you prefer. Journaling will allow you to keep track of your insights from the intuitive inquiry lists that are found through the book. You can record your answers to questions that accompany the meditations and make notes of the personal intuitive language that will develop. One of the main purposes of keeping a journal is to build trust in your intuition and observations. Read from Front to Back I recommend that you read the chapters in order, at least the first time through this book; your absorption of material in later chapters will be enhanced if you have read the earlier ones. Please read this book as a presentation of a new science that asks you to think nonlinearly and outside of the usual boxes. Once you have read the entire book, feel free to review any of the chapters in any order. Reflect on the Theoretical Chapters This book is structured around two types of chapters: theory with stories chapters and practice with integration chapters. In each theoretical chapter, you will find an exploration of a specific concept and related theories, interlaced with real-life stories that demonstrate the humanness of the material. All the stories and lists that describe various ways to experience states of intuitive awareness in the book are written by students and practitioners of Intuition Medicine; I have collected these stories from their journals, personal communications, and questionnaires completed during their formal study of Intuition Medicine. These chapters also include reflective portions in which I ask you to stop for a moment and connect the concepts you have just read about with your personal experience. I have found that doing so helps integrate intuition with our other senses. This approach is designed to move you into simultaneously knowing, feeling, and thinking \u2014 the steps that will aid your alignment with the subtle sense of intuition. Intuition is a learned life skill that develops when you pay attention to it. The theory with stories chapters also include lists that I have developed over many years of teaching with the help of my students and other practitioners. You can use these lists to understand the language of intuition in order to interpret subtle interactions with others and to get a clearer sense of why you feel comfortable or uncomfortable in various situations. Originally used, in part, to assess my methods and their effectiveness in helping others learn these skills, they eventually served as self-assessment tools for students. As you work with the exercises and techniques in the book, they can serve as a way to describe your own experiences with intuition. If these lists seem tedious the first time you read them, come back to them when they offer pertinent knowledge and healing. I trust that your intuition will direct you to revisit these lists when the information holds value for you. Practice with the Integration Chapters The practice with integration chapters include formal step-by-step meditations, questions to answer before and after meditation, daily awareness practices, experiments, and affirmations. The meditations are quite detailed; I do not expect you to sit with the book on your lap and meditate while reading each step (however, if that works for you, please do so!). I suggest that you read the steps of the meditation, then close the book and intuitively move through it by following what you recall; with repeated practice, you will create a personal contemplative ritual that works for you. If you prefer, you can record the meditations on an audiotape and play them back to guide your meditation. Or you may purchase my guided meditation audio recordings by visiting my website at www.intuitionmedicine.org. You may want to set aside a regular meditation time on a daily or weekly basis to do the guided meditations, as if you were in a formal class. Or you may consider being flexible about the meditation practices, reading the book and doing the meditations when you feel the need or have the time. Before you do the guided meditations, it is a good idea to prepare your space and yourself. Choose a comfortable location where you will not be disturbed. Draw the shades or dim the lights. Turn off the telephone. Put a do not disturb sign on your door. Then take a few moments to get into a calm, quiet mood. Put aside as many of your daily concerns as you can, and bring all your attention into the present moment and your present activity. Then, when you feel calm and quiet, begin the meditation. After completing the post-meditation questions and exercises, you may want to write any additional thoughts or comments in your journal. Your journal will become your personal book for the language of intuition. In addition to doing the guided meditations, set aside a short, quiet meditation time each day. Just five to ten minutes daily will make a huge difference in your intuitive development. Some people meditate for a few minutes in the morning; others do it before going to bed. Some schedule five minutes of meditation into their lunch breaks. Intuit the best time and frequency for your personal meditation, and follow through on the answers you receive. In each practice chapter, you will also find experiments, affirmations, and techniques. Play with the Try This! experiments as a prove it to yourself activity. Or you might want to spend an entire day simply repeating the affirmations from one of the practice chapters or focusing on one technique, such as grounding. The next day, focus on a different technique, such as communicating from your meditation sanctuary. At the end of the day, note the difference in your attitude, awareness, and general health. Stay Aware Every Day Each day, pay attention to your intuitive insights as they occur; many significant discoveries have been made during self-reflective moments, when the quick, clear I know this! intuitive insight occurs. Pay attention to the subtleties of life, as wisdom is a quiet invocation. As with any new skill, practice is an important part of the learning process. You will find that Intuition Medicine will naturally become part of your daily life. Intuition Medicine is a body of health to be lived every day. But you can expedite that process by working with these tools on a daily basis. Focusing several times a day on any of the exercises will help you more quickly integrate this intuitive work into your life. As you become more familiar with this body of health work, you will find yourself naturally stopping to meditate and using the skills throughout your day. You will take time to use the health tools before a big meeting, interview, or date. Or you will stop before visiting someone who tends to leave you unbalanced. Whenever you notice something amiss in your energy system, you will give yourself the time you need. Trust Yourself Remember that these are only guidelines. Everyone learns in different ways. If your intuition suggests an alternative, by all means trust yourself. Perhaps you need to read the entire book before doing the meditations. Or maybe you need to answer all the questions, read the book, and then go back and practice the exercises. There is no right or wrong way to do this. Trust your intuition. AN OVERVIEW OF THIS BOOK Body of Health begins with my personal story. This chapter describes how I first encountered my own perceptions of intuition and what it had to teach me. These experiences prompted me to begin my studies, and eventually led me to teaching and research. They are included as part of my vitae of teaching and writings. In chapter 2, 1 explain the various types of intuitive awareness. Chapter 3 provides an easy and fun self-assessment tool that will give you a baseline against which to measure your aptitude for operating with your intuitive sense. I give the same test as part of the entrance requirement for the three-year Intuition Medicine program which I am the founder and president of. If some of the technical language in this chapter or any others, is uninteresting to you I encourage you to skip over it and move on to the rest of the chapters. Subsequent chapters focus on aspects of the human energy system and its intuitive health. In my experience, caring for your energy anatomy is as vital to your health and well-being as caring for your physical anatomy. To help you acknowledge and work with your energy anatomy, I provide a series of information and practice chapters to acquaint you with the processes of Intuition Medicine. These chapters include charts and diagrams to assist you in visualizing what I am writing about. The charts will show you how I clairvoyantly see the energy anatomy systems. In chapters 4 and 5, I explain how grounding is your emotional centering connection. Strong grounding will provide you with a stable foundation of well-being from which to operate in your daily life and contemplatively explore other components of your energy system. Chapters 6 and 7 present the concept of meditation as a physical location in your body where you train yourself to rest your attention. This practice will allow you to function with a perception of living in the present moment. Chapters 8 and 9 introduce my methodology of using life-force energy and earth energy as your personal healing energies. Life-force energy is your personal signature energy; it is unique to you, just like your fingerprint. The earth emits a natural electromagnetic energy, which has a healing effect on our bodies. The blend of these energies supplies you with vital force and emotional strength. Chapters 10 and 11 acquaint you with chakras as the focal points of your energy system; imagine them as your personal computers of energy and information. The "}
