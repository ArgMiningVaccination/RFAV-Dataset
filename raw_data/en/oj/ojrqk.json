New parents use them to squeeze water on their sore perineum (the area between your vaginal opening and anus) after birth. Peri bottles help cleanse the area and relieve postpartum discomfort. \"It's basically a squirt bottle that allows you to clean your bottom easily and gently after the delivery of a baby,\" says Christina Dothager, M.D., an OB-GYN with Ob Hospitalist Group in Greenville, Illinois and Terre Haute, Indiana. Keep reading to learn more about the benefits of peri bottles after birth, plus tips for using one effectively. Vaginal Tearing During Childbirth: What You Need To Know What Is a Peri Bottle Used For? \"Peri\" is short for perineum, the area between your vaginal opening and anus. If you gave birth vaginally or pushed for any length of time, your perineum will be sore, possibly torn, maybe stitched, and peeing might make it feel like it's all on fire. Peri bottles are simple device that offer gentle cooling while you heal. \"After delivery, your entire perineum can be sore and swollen, even without any stitches,\" says Clara Ward, M.D., a maternal-fetal medicine physician with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth/UT Physicians in Houston. \"What happens after birth to the perineal area isn't fun, exciting, or cute to talk about, and often doesn't get discussed in childbirth classes or even before you leave the hospital.\" In addition, peri bottles can effectively clean the perineum area. \"The normal discharge called lochia, a combination of blood and the sloughed uterine lining, can persist for a few days to weeks,\" says Dr. Ward. It's often a surprise for new parents just how much discharge and bleeding happen during this healing process. Lochia can last for up to six to eight weeks after birth. The peri bottle can help cleanse this discharge and bleeding. Benefits of Using a Peri Bottle Personal hygiene can be a challenge for new parents, and the \"perineal irrigation\" offered by a peri bottle can really help. Essentially, the peri bottle allows you to keep this sensitive, inflamed area clean and feeling fresh during recovery without wiping or otherwise disturbing already irritated skin. Here are some of the benefits of using a peri bottle: Helps with personal cleansingLessens the need for wiping or touching the sensitive perineal areaOffers a naturally cooling soothing sensation (the perineal area can feel hot and achy after birth)Dilutes your urine so that it's less likely to sting when it touches abraded skinHelps prevent infectionReduces itching and swellingSaves time (compared to showering or bathing)Speeds recovery Plus, it just feels really nice. \"So much focus and energy now goes to caring for your new baby, it's important to talk about simple things to help your day-to-day healing become just a little easier on you,\" says Dr. Dothager. The peri bottle does just that! A Guide to Your Postpartum Vagina How to Use a Peri Bottle The peri bottle couldn't be easier to use. \"You simply fill with warm water and while sitting on the toilet, point the opened tip towards the region you would like to cleanse and squeeze the bottle to squirt the fluid over the region,\" says Dr. Dothager. Once you're done, dab gently or air dry. Often, the best time to use the peri bottle is while peeing. \"A lot of women experience burning during urination after delivery, so the bottle dilutes the urine, making it sting less,\" says Dr. Ward. \"Start the stream of water, begin peeing, then continue the stream. You can dry the area after with toilet paper by patting, but avoid wiping, which can be abrasive.\" You can also use fragrance-free baby wipes, but check if they should be disposed of in the toilet or garbage. Some people like to mix a bit of witch hazel into the water for added relief. The doctors we talked to approved this cooling plant extract for perineum use\u2014although Dr. Ward cautions against using essential oils, lotions, or powders, which can be irritating to this sensitive area. How Long Do You Use a Peri Bottle After Birth? Most people begin using a peri bottle right after childbirth, and you can use the bottle for as long as you feel you need to. \"Generally, people may use the peri bottle for about a week after the birth of a baby, until your bottom feels better or is healed,\" says Dr. Dothager. But how long you want to use it may vary. Some people will find it helpful for two or more weeks. So, feel free to use the peri bottle for as long as it's helpful in your daily hygiene. The 22 Best Skin Care Products for Kids, Tested by Parents and Their Little Ones Should You Use a Peri Bottle After C-Section? The many benefits of the peri bottle absolutely extend to people whose babies are born by C-section. While your perineal area may not be as sore after a C-section as with a vaginal delivery, you will still have prolonged discharge to rinse away. Plus, if you labored or did any pushing before having your C-section, you may have discomfort or inflammation in the perineal area, even if you ultimately delivered surgically. \"If you were in labor before your C-section, your perineum may still be swollen and sensitive,\" says Dr. Ward. \"Even if your C-section was planned, it may be painful or difficult to bend over or reach to wipe because of the incision.\" What to Expect If You Have a C-Section Where to Buy a Peri Bottle Many new parents will receive a peri bottle in the hospital or birth center after delivery, but they might not get an explanation of what to do with it. \"As a physician with three children myself, I remember coming home with my first baby and wondering, 'What is that for?'\" says Dr. Dothager. \"Not one nurse showed me how to use it because they assumed I knew what it was.\" If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask your postpartum nurse. If you don't get one, ask! Hospital staff might have them on hand but have forgotten to give you one. You can also buy peri bottles at many pharmacies, big box stores, and online. The \"free\" hospital bottles are pretty basic, but you can purchase fancier models elsewhere. \"Bottles with ergonomic features such as angled spouts and special valves that control the stream can make them easier to use and get to the hard-to-reach spots,\" explains Dr. Ward. Some options include the Frida Mom Upside Down Peri Bottle or Brondell GpSpa Travel Bidet. If you're interested in trying a specialty peri bottle, stock up before the baby comes, as you'll want to begin using it soon after childbirth. You may even consider having one for each bathroom you'll be regularly using once you're home. Additionally, if you don't have a peri bottle handy, you can use a shower head, bidet, or cup to pour water over the perineal area. Alternatively, you might already have a water bottle with a spray top that could work in a pinch. Or try poking holes in the cap of a plastic water bottle to make your own peri bottle. Just make sure that whatever you're using has been cleaned and rinsed thoroughly. 6 Post-Delivery Body Surprises to Expect More Postpartum Pain Soothers Along with the peri bottle, the doctors we talked to had some other suggestions to make your perineal area feel better after giving birth. Ice packs: You can buy these at the store, or make your own by dampening a pad, placing it in a plastic baggie, and freezing overnight. When applying to the perineal area, wrap it in a cloth before putting it against your skin. Witch hazel: You can also get this herbal remedy in pads and sprays. If you have hemorrhoids (another common postpartum problem), try folding the little pads in half and sticking them right between your butt cheeks against your anus for 20 minutes. Witch hazel pads, or pads infused with witch hazel, can also be kept in the fridge or freezer for added relief. Sitz baths: Sitz baths entail sitting in warm water up to your hips in the tub, or you can buy a basin to put on your toilet seat. Dr. Ward advises sitting for 20 minutes, two to three times a day. You can also put witch hazel in the water during the soak. Dermoplast spray: Dr. Dothager recommends this medicated numbing spray containing benzocaine. You can find it in the pharmacy section, but she advises that you make sure to buy the version that's formulated for the genital region. Mesh underwear: Wearing mesh underwear is surprisingly comfortable and can help manage the huge pads you'll be wearing. (Yes, those magic stretchy undies can actually hold them in place.) The hospital will likely provide these for you as well\u2014and don't hesitate to ask for more. Stool softener: Passing stool can be very uncomfortable after childbirth. Taking a stool softener can help things come out easier with less straining and stress to the perineum during bowel movements, especially if you have constipation or hemorrhoids. In addition, stay hydrated, eat lots of fiber, and sit on a pillow or foam doughnut if that feels more comfortable. The Bottom Line Many first-time parents-to-be go into the delivery room not knowing what to expect after you're expecting. The peri bottle is just one example. \"Something simple, like a bottle full of warm water to relieve the burning when you pee, may have been a nice thing to have known when I came home [after my first birth] 10 years ago,\" says Dr. Dothager. Talking about the less glamorous parts of childbirth, such as the very sore perineal area and the few weeks of lochia, can help us deal with its physical and emotional upheavals.
