Here's what you need to know about your visit to any of our locations: - At all of our clinics, we recommend that only 1 parent or adult caregiver come with a patient to their appointment. However, up to 4 people may come to the appointment with the patient. We do not allow more than 4 people without an exception. Siblings who are younger than 1 year old can come and are not included in the total number of people allowed at the visit. For patients staying at the hospital overnight: Single and double rooms allow parents or other adults to be identified as caregivers. Up to 4 people are allowed in the room with the patient at a time during visiting hours and 2 overnight. For patients staying in the Special Isolation Unit: Up to 4 caregivers may be designated as visitors but only 2 caregivers are allowed in a room at a time and 2 caregivers can stay overnight. - Upon arrival, patients and families are asked screening questions for signs of illness. Please contact your child's provider if your child develops a new illness like fever, cough or runny nose before your scheduled visit. - We recommend that patients, families and visitors wear a medical mask, especially if you have respiratory symptoms like coughing, sneezing, sore throat, runny nose or fever. We will have masks available as you enter if you do not have your own mask. - A member of our team will contact patients and conduct a phone screening to determine if COVID-19 testing is required before a procedure or admission. If testing is required, we will coordinate and inform you of next steps. - Staff follow our standard work restriction policy as it applies to them if they are ill. This means they should not come to work if they have certain respiratory symptoms.
