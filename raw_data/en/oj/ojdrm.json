A lot of parents know that rigorous studies, peer reviewed, published in scientific journals and indexed on Pubmed are the standard in discussions about medical care. Therefore, the anti-vaccine brigade are trying to maintain that, really, countless scientific studies across the globe have shown that vaccines are bad for you. The anti-vaccine, pro-any-conspiracy theory website Whale.to (the citation of which automatically invokes [Skopie's Law](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scopie%27s_Law) ), provides a neat [shopping list](http://www.whale.to/vaccine/mercola_wakefield.html) that staunch supporters of the long debunked \"MMR causes inflammation of the gut which somehow causes autism and Andrew Wakefield is really a hero\" notion can use to spam evidence based discussions, as recently [seen](http://shotofprevention.com/2011/04/27/what-we-have-is-a-failure-to-communicate/#comment-2907) on the Shot of Prevention blog where Marsha McClelland of the \"We the People United for Vaccine Education Misinformation\" [Yahoo group](http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/WeThePeopleUnitedForVaccinationEducation) copied and pasted in support for Andrew Wakefield. She \"writes\": In the years after his initial controversial finding, linking the MMR vaccine to Crohn's disease and autism, he published another 19 papers on the vaccine-induced disorder. All were peer reviewed. However, strangely enough, none of these 19 papers are ever discussed in the media. The only study that keeps seeing the light of day is the original study from 1998, along with the original questions about conflicts of interest, which he explains in great detail in this interview. (my comment - that refers to the Mercola [interview](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/04/10/wakefield-interview.aspx) with Andrew Wakefield). Note the buzz word \"peer reviewed\" - also note the fundamental misconception that anyone would give a toss whether Wakefield believes that Wakefield was correct. She goes on: This is very interesting indeed, because not only has he continued his own studies, but since then, a large number of replication studies have been performed around the world, by other researchers, that confirm his initial findings. It's been replicated in Canada, in the US., in Venezuela, in Italy [but] they never get mentioned. All you ever hear is that no one else has ever been able to replicate the findings. That - Martha and friends - is because no one (apart from Wakefield and his buddies) has ever been able to replicate Wakefield's claims. I had previously looked at [5 studies](http://justthevax.blogspot.com/2010/02/independent-wakefield-way-really.html) supposedly independently\" replicating Wakefield, but this list was 28 citations long (I guess the length is supposed to duly impress AND to keep anyone from checking). To quote [Kenneth Branagh](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214382/) : \"There is safety in numbers\". Luckily, both [Chris](http://shotofprevention.com/2011/04/27/what-we-have-is-a-failure-to-communicate/#comment-3256) and [Liz Ditz](http://shotofprevention.com/2011/04/29/moms-who-vaccinate-and-those-who-wish-they-had/#comment-3525) were bothered enough to spend their valuable time to debunk the list (THANK YOU!) - I have created a synthesis of their and my previous searches and comments to create the \"one stop copy and paste resource for the evidence minded\". Links add extra depth - sorry about the length, it may exceed the number of characters allowed for blog comments... To summarize re-using Martha's words: you may have been tricked into believing that Andrew Wakefield's claims had been independently verified in 28 publications from 5 different countries. I'm afraid that is false. For those of you who have swallowed this type of reporting hook line and sinker, the below debunks each of the 28 studies from around the world that have been cited in his support. 1. The Journal of Pediatrics November 1999; 135(5):559-63 = Horvath K., J.T. with autism. [J. Pediatrics 135: 559-563](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10547242) . This study did not look for measles virus. Instead it looks at gastrointestinal (GI) malabsoption as an underlying mechanism for autism. It does not appear to have controls with autism & without GI symptoms OR controls without autism & with similar GI symptoms. Most children with autism & GI symptoms had upper GI problems such as refluxThis in no way \"replicates\" or \"supports\" Wakefield's \"findings\", which have been shown repeatedly to have been manufactured or the result of laboratory contamination. 2. The Journal of Pediatrics 2000; 138(3): 366-372 = Furlano RI, Anthony A , Day R, Brown A, McGarvey L, Thomson MA , Davies SE , Berelowitz M , Forbes Walker-Smith JA, Murch SH . Colonic CD8 and T cell filtration with epithelial damage in children with autism. [J Pediatr 2001;138:366-72.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11241044) This paper claims to have \"confirm[ed] a distinct lymphocytic colitis in autistic spectrum disorders\", which is something that no other research groups find and has been the center of the recent GMC hearings against Wakefield. The extreme \"engineering\" towards a specific gut pathology has been [summarized](http://briandeer.com/solved/bmj-enterocolitis.htm) by Brian Deer.Note the emergence of a theme: Wakefield is a co-author and no fewer than 7 of this paper's authors are also authors on the retracted paper in The Lancet; this paper cannot be said to independently \"replicate\" or \"support\" Wakefield's \"findings\". 3. = Ashwood P, Anthony A, Pellicer AA, Torrente F, Wakefield AJ. Intestinal lymphocyte populations in children with regressive autism: evidence for extensive mucosal immunopathology. [Journal of Clinical Immunology, 2003;23:504-517. ](http://www.springerlink.com/content/g05122w22n4w7220/) to further claim \"a pan-enteric mucosal immunopathology in children with regressive autism that is apparently distinct from other inflammatory bowel diseases\", but we know that Wakefield et al. are the only researchers who have \"found\" this in the past 15 or so years.Same theme: Wakefield (and Anthony) is a co-author; cannot be said to support his own work. 4. Journal of Neuroimmunology 2005 A meaningless citation as this would be a whole volume of a journal - this happens if you just copy and paste without any regard to the content. Supports nothing except maybe the notion that the anti-vaccine folk cannot cite biomedical literature properly. If you go back to whale.to, John was kind enough to link to to the paper, which is Ashwood P, Wakefield AJ. Immune activation of peripheral blood and mucosal CD3+ lymphocyte cytokine profiles in children with symptoms. [J Neuroimmunol. 2006 Apr;173(1-2):126-34.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16494951)doesn't mention MMR, instead, the authors start from their own wrong premise \"Gastrointestinal pathology, characterized by lymphoid nodular hyperplasia and entero-colitis, has been demonstrated in a cohort of children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD).\" and continue to find \"In both peripheral blood and mucosa, [intracellular] CD3+ IFNgamma+ were increased in ASD children\" , has Wakefield as senior author, therefore no independent replication of his results. 5. Brain, Behavior and Immunity 1993; 7: 97-103 = Singh VK, Warren RP, Odell JD, Cole WP. Antibodies to myelin basic protein in children with autistic behavior. [Brain, Behavior and Immunity 1993;7:97-103](Brain, Behavior and Immunity 1993;7:97-103) Found some but not all children with autism had specific antibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP). Study did not look for measles virus, nor did study look for mumps or rubella virus or administration of the MMR. It precedes the Lancet paper and in no way \"replicates\" or \"supports\" Wakefield's claims. 6. Pediatric Neurology 2003; 28(4): 1-3 Citation not found. According to whale.to, this is Singh VK, Jensen RL Elevated levels of measles antibodies in children with autism [Pediatric Neurology 2003; 28(4): 292-294.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=singh%20vk%20jensen) To the best of our knowledge, this study has not been replicated, and the findings refuted by several other studies, such as Baird G, Pickles A, Simonoff E, Charman T, Sullivan P, Chandler S, Loucas T, Meldrum D, Afzal M, Thomas B, Jin L, Brown D. Measles vaccination and antibody response in autism spectrum disorders. Arch Dis Child. 2008 Oct;93(10):832-7. This study does not support Wakefield's claims. 7.

This paper makes assertions that are not supported by the evidence base in the paper. It is mainly a summary of research, with no mention of what children were looked at. Chris found the actual paper (https://www.aacp.com/Pages.asp?AID=7937&issue=&page=C&UID=), and among the data used it included a Wakefield paper = not independent. Also included in the references are papers from questionable journals like Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons and Medical Veritas, which all suddenly makes sense if you see that Singh is [associated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijendra_K._Singh) with these [folk](www.BrainStateTechnologies.com) that tick the \"our treatment heals everything\" quack box (see one Singh [study](http://www.brainstatetech.com/resources/case-studies/neurorehabilitation-post-traumatic-stress-and-depressive-behaviors-brain-stat) on PTSD). This looks like it would support a connection between MMR and autism, but since no-one has independently reproduced this and the author stands to make money off the claims this review has to be viewed with extreme reservations. 12.

Walker-Smith and Andrews report on the investigation of alpha-1-antitrypsin levels in 8 children with autism vs in children with untreated and treated celiac disease and control children and finds levels in children with autism and celiac disease are similar.
