This includes all University of Arizona Health Sciences faculty and staff who are also employed by Banner Health. Banner Health has shared the following memo with general information about the policy, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, general information and additional information for team members. Why do I have to get the COVID-19 vaccine? As Banner team members, we're committed to unparalleled safety, quality, service and innovation. Many of us have already been vaccinated, but we must be at 100% to help stop the spread of this deadly virus and keep our patients, visitors and colleagues safe. As members of the health care industry, any steps we can take to protect our patients and one another are the right thing to do. Why are we making the vaccine mandatory now? We have encouraged team members to get the COVID-19 vaccine since they were first made available. Now that cases and variants are increasing, we feel it's our duty caring for the most vulnerable of our communities that we take every step possible to safeguard our patients and our teams from this deadly disease. What should I do to get a vaccine? Check your local public health resources for information on available vaccine locations. You can text your ZIP code to 438829 or enter it at vaccines.gov/search to get an instant list of nearby locations. What do I tell my family and friends about when they can get vaccinated? We encourage you to have conversations with your friends and family about getting the vaccine. They too can text their ZIP code to 438829 or enter it at vaccines.gov/search. Does the vaccine cost anything? There is no out-of-pocket cost for team members. Insurance will be billed for the administration fee only. Does getting vaccinated mean I can ease up on wearing masks and social distancing? Vaccine is an additional tool to slow the transmission of this virus, but a lot is still unknown regarding longterm immunity and we should continue to adhere to our current protocols when in the community. This means we must continue to wash hands, mask, social distance, vaccinate, quarantine when needed, perform contact tracing, limit group gatherings and anything else to help slow the spread of this virus. We have recently updated our Business Practices around masking in meetings, during breaks and meals, and other activities that involve close contact with coworkers. These protocols are tied to the current gating status within our facilities. Further information will be available on the COVID-19 toolkit. Why should I get vaccinated? This vaccination offers you an opportunity to be less at risk for getting COVID-19. It not only protects you but helps your loved ones, patients and colleagues be safer too. It is a critical tool in our fight against COVID-19. SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF COVID-19 VACCINES How do we know that the vaccines are safe? To develop the drug, Pfizer and Moderna staged clinical trials that involved nearly 100,000 people, half of whom received the vaccine. July 2021 COVID-19 Vaccination In addition to the FDA review, the vaccines were also reviewed by two other non-governmental groups: Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), made up of outside scientific and public health experts from around the country. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a non-political national group of experts that acts as an advisory committee to review vaccine safety and effectiveness. The Johnson & Johnson Janssen Vaccine underwent a similar clinical trial and review process. In addition, the Banner Pharmacy and Therapeutics Clinical Consensus Group, which consists of a team of pharmacists and other clinical experts, reviewed and approved use of the vaccines. In reviewing COVID-19 vaccines, we follow the same rigorous clinical review procedures that we do for all our pharmaceuticals and treatments at Banner. Do the vaccines work? Based on clinical trial participants who received two doses of the same Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective and Moderna vaccine 94% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease. Clinical trial participants receiving a single dose of the Janssen (J&J) vaccine was 85% effective against severe COVID-19. How fast do they work? Protection will take 1-2 weeks following the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine to be fully vaccinated and 2 weeks after the single dose of the Janssen (J&J) vaccine to be fully vaccinated. Is the vaccine safe? Symptoms - like what happens when a person receives a flu shot -- are usually mild or moderate and go away in a few days. Reactions, if any, were more likely to occur after the second dose and were more likely to occur in patients under age 55. There were no cases of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) within the clinical trials; Severe allergic reactions have been reported during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials, although very rare. I'm pregnant. Should I get the vaccine What about if I am breastfeeding? Pregnant and lactating women may choose to get the vaccine. We recommend you discuss this with your provider who can go into further detail about the vaccine's benefits and risks. Are there concerns with the vaccine and getting a mammogram? Banner Imaging is recommending that all breast screening exams (mammograms, ultrasounds and MRIs) be performed before vaccination or four weeks after the second dose. All Breast imaging in symptomatic patients should proceed promptly, with history of vaccination (date and arm injected) recorded and available for the interpreting radiologist. These recommendations are in compliance with the Society of Breast Imaging. What if I'm allergic? According to ACIP, individuals with the following allergies can get vaccinated: - Food, pet, insect, venom, environmental, latex allergies - Allergy to oral medications (including the oral equivalent to an injectable medication) - Non-serious allergy to vaccines or other injectables (e.g. no anaphylaxis) - Family history of anaphylaxis ACIP recommends that vaccines should be used with caution in individuals with - Any immediate allergic reaction to other vaccines or injectable therapies July 2021 COVID-19 Vaccination ACIP recommends that vaccines should not be administered to individuals with - a severe allergic reaction (i.e. anaphylaxis) after a prior dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or to a component of the vaccine - an immediate allergic reaction of any severity after a previous dose or known (diagnosed) allergy to a component of the vaccine What accommodations will be made for people with allergies? You may still receive the vaccine if not contraindicated. You will be monitored for 15 to 30 minutes after vaccination based on allergy history. I have some existing health problems, should I be vaccinated? Vaccines may be administered to persons with underlying chronic medical conditions who have no contraindications. I already had COVID-19, should I get vaccinated? Yes, you can get vaccinated if you have recovered from acute illness and have met criteria to end isolation (10 days after symptom onset (or positive test if asymptomatic) or 21 days if you were critically ill and required ICU care.) What about if I have received monoclonal antibody treatment? If you received monoclonal antibody treatment, vaccination should be delayed until 90 days after completing therapy. Is the vaccine a live vaccine? No. The vaccine is not a live vaccine and contains no virus or viral cells at all. Can I get the virus from the vaccine? No. The vaccine does not contain any virus or viral cells. How is the vaccine administered? The vaccine is administered by injection to your upper arm, like other vaccines you receive such as the flu shot. Are there components of the vaccine that may cause an allergic reaction such as eggs? The vaccine is manufactured in a cell-free laboratory process and does not include any major allergens or preservatives. Can my allergy shots affect my COVID-19 vaccination? Allergy shots should not influence your ability to respond to the vaccine immunologically. We would recommend that you schedule your vaccination and allergy shots at least a day apart to make sure any side effects can be accurately attributed and to ensure any local swelling at allergy shot injection site is resolved. How did the vaccine-development process move so quickly? It's true it can take years, sometimes decades, to develop a vaccine. One reason COVID-19 vaccinations were developed rather quickly is that there was funding on a global scale for their development. COVID-19 vaccines were also being given top priority over almost all other products in the pipeline. How do they work? mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) vaccines give our body the instructions, in the form of messenger RNA, for making a little piece of this coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) \u2014 specifically a spike protein. When our body gets these instructions, it starts producing the spike protein, which triggers our immune system that recognizes the spike protein as \"foreign,\" to make antibodies against it. When we get infected with the real virus, our body is already prepared to fight it. The mRNA does not combine with your DNA. Your cells \"read\" the mRNA segment. July 2021 COVID-19 Vaccination Viral vector (Janssen) vaccine uses another virus to carry instructions into your body on making the spike protein which results in your body developing antibodies. For coronavirus vaccine, an adenovirus (type of common cold) is modified and used. Which vaccine should I get? All available vaccines report similar safety and efficacy results. The best vaccine to get is the one you can most easily accessible to you. What happens if we run out of Pfizer vaccine, can I get use Moderna for my second vaccination? You must receive your second dose from the same manufacturer. What about the mutations (variants) that I am hearing about? How does that affect my vaccination? At this time, all indications are that the current vaccines will protect against the known mutated strains of the virus. The manufacturers will continue to test and we will share information as it is available. INFORMATION FOR TEAM MEMBERS Is there anything I should do prior to my appointment? As with any vaccination, we recommend you come well-hydrated. It's a good idea to have a snack or meal prior to vaccination to keep blood sugar levels steady. If you are coming for your second dose, please bring your vaccination card with you. What kind of side effects can I expect? Research shows that a vast majority of people who receive the vaccine didn't suffer side effects. Those who did experienced redness and pain at the injection site as well as fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches that lasted up to a day and half. It is not recommended to take over-the-counter medicines before your vaccination to ward off any potential symptoms; there is a lack of information on impact of use on vaccine-induced antibody responses. Should I be worried about the side effects? Side effects generally last one to two days and over-the-counter medications can help alleviate their symptoms. The symptoms indicate that the vaccine is working. How can I tell if I am experiencing vaccination side effects or if I am actually COVID-19 positive? Should I get the second dose of the vaccine if I experience side effects after the first dose? If you had a reaction to your first dose requiring medical treatment (e.g. Epinephrine or Benadryl) or were transported to an ED for evaluation of a hypersensitivity reaction, you will not be eligible to receive your second dose. We are following CDC guidelines and want to keep you safe. Should I get tested for antibodies before I get vaccinated? There are currently no recommendations to perform an antibody test in relationship to the vaccine. In fact, the CDC recommends getting vaccinated even if you have had a COVID-19 infection, which is what antibody tests look for. If you are still interested in getting an antibody test, you can order it on your own through SQL MyLabRequest. MyLabRequest testing is self-ordered testing that is paid 100% out of pocket by the patient (no insurance coverage.) Will I receive compensation? Banner is offering non-exempt team members two hours' compensation to get the vaccine. We believe this payment will cover most people's drive time and provide time to get the vaccine. We will also pay a flat $25 for mileage for both non-exempt and exempt team members. Because team members need to get vaccinated twice, they will receive compensation and mileage for both doses. To receive compensation, please email a photocopy of your card to your leader. Why do I need a vaccine card? You will be provided proof of vaccination following your first vaccination. The vaccine card should be kept in a secure place as you will need to provide a copy to your leader for travel time reimbursement. Additionally, the vaccine card will need to be shown when you arrive for your second vaccine dose appointment. What happens if I experience side effects after being vaccinated? Banner employees will be allowed to continue working after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination as long as: - They feel well enough to work; - They develop post-vaccination symptoms within 24 hours of receiving the vaccination; and - The symptoms completely, or largely, resolve within 24-48 hours of their onset. Banner employees will be excluded from work after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, except if working remotely, if: - They do not feel well enough to do their job; - They develop additional symptoms not known to be associated with a vaccine reaction (e.g., cough, high fever, respiratory or other symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or other infectious process); - They develop symptoms of fever, chills, muscle aches, etc. beginning more than 24 hours after the injection; - Symptoms develop within 24 hours of receiving the injection but show no signs of abating or are continuing to worsen 24-48 hours after their onset. If Banner team member is excluded from work due to the four points listed, they will not be allowed to return until an acceptable alternate explanation for the symptoms has been identified and the team member has met the standard criteria for returning to work as a Banner health care worker. Team members will need to be cleared by Banner Occupational Health & Wellness. How do I get my second dose of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? Typically the appointments for your second vaccination are made at the time of your first vaccine, however each location is different. Please ask the site where you are receiving your first vaccine to schedule you for a second if they don't automatically do it. Second vaccinations need to take place 21 to 28 days after the first vaccine. Please bring your vaccination card when you receive your second dose. Are the side effects from the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine different from the first? Some team members report that after receiving the second dose the experience more pronounced side effects that last for longer periods of time. Please be aware of this as you schedule your second dose and plan accordingly around your work schedule. What happens if I forget to get my second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and more than 21-28 days have passed? Dosing should be completed as close to the schedule as possible. Please be aware of any personal conflicts you may have that would impact your ability to receive your second dose so your first dose can be scheduled appropriately. In rare instances, such as illness, team members can receive vaccinations later than those timeframes. Can I still give blood if I receive a COVID-19 vaccine? What about plasma? If you have been vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, there is no deferral time. Remember to bring your vaccination card to where you are donating blood. If you have been vaccinated, you are not eligible to donate convalescent plasma. Will I receive MyWell-Being points for getting vaccinated? By completing the vaccination series and submitting a photo of your vaccine card to Banner Occupational Health Services (BOHS), you will earn 500 MyWell-Being points. Here are easy-to-follow instructions to submit your card. Your completion of the required steps will be reported quarterly by BOHS to the MyWell-Being Program. MyWell-Being points will be added to Virgin Pulse at the end of each quarter for those that have submitted their vaccination cards during that quarter. Note that this activity is not eligible for double points.
