The holistic approach endeavours to treat the \"origin\" of the problem and not just the symptoms or manifestation of disease. Naturopathy integrates conventional health sciences with a range of natural therapies and traditional medicines that assist in treating the individual's mental, emotional, spiritual and physical being. Naturopathy is suitable for everyone, from infants to the matured. Naturopathic treatments aim at supporting the body's innate healing ability through the use of: - Diet and lifestyle changes - Vitamin and mineral supplementation - Herbal medicine - Flower Essences - Homeopathy Live Blood Analysis (LBA) A drop of blood is examined under a specialised microscope; this is also viewed by the patient on a screen. LBA provides information on shape, size, colour and mobility of red and white blood cells and platelets. Other elements including microbes, crystals, fatty deposits, oxidative stress and vitamin deficiency can be identified. Observations noticed assist the practitioner in determining the best dietary and lifestyle programme for the individual to improve your health. Not only will you feel the difference you will also see changes in your blood as your treatment progresses. Iridology The study of the Iris which is the coloured part of the eye can reveal changing conditions in organs, inherited weakness and strengths. A Naturopath uses iridology to assist in guiding the individual to nourish and care for areas that may show weakness or stress. Kinesiology Neuro-Training (NT) Kinesiology is a solution orientated process beneficial for all ages that works with the individuals' mental conflicts, emotional traumas, physical stressors and spiritual being. Many people can be consciously or subconsciously suppressing hurts from the past or unresolved emotions and issues that no longer serve them but are keeping them from moving forward and recuperating NT Kinesiology can help release and resolve the inappropriate adaption's by retraining the nervous system to adapt appropriately and develop new solutions for the particular problems. Muscle monitoring is used to reveal and identify the inappropriate adaptations and recognize the correct neural pathways. The solution can then be easily implemented by applying the appropriate combination of techniques that will enhance your own natural healing ability. |Naturopathy Price Schedule| |Initial "}
