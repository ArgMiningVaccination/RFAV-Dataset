There are two COVID vaccine products and both are proven to be safe and effective.

There is no preference for the Moderna vaccine or the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. Parents are strongly encouraged to have their infants and young children vaccinated with either vaccine. Vaccination against COVID-19 is the best way to reduce the negative impact of this pandemic in all age groups.

The original COVID vaccine and updated (bivalent) COVID-19 vaccines are [recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s1209-covid-vaccine.html) for kids age 6 months and older. Vaccination is the best way to prepare your child's immune system to immediately recognize and resist COVID. The [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2022-058700) (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly recommend that all eligible kids and teens get the COVID vaccine. You [or your child](/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/getting-my-covid-vaccine-a-picture-story-for-kids.aspx) may have questions about COVID prevention. Your pediatrician is here to help. Here's what you need to know. Which pediatric COVID vaccine should I choose? COVID vaccines made by two manufacturers (Moderna and Pfizer- BioNTech) are authorized for babies and young children. The AAP does not recommend one vaccine product over another. Children age 6 months through 4 years will receive the vaccine from the same manufacturer (unless unavailable or unknown) for all doses. First your baby or young child will receive two doses of the original vaccine. Then, they will get a third dose of an updated vaccine. Receiving these vaccines helps your child's body develop immunity to protect them from serious illness. The updated COVID vaccine dose boosts immunity to the original virus and recent variants. If your child is age 6 months through 4 years and received three doses of the original vaccine (Pfizer), they should get a booster dose of bivalent vaccine at least 2 months after their third dose. Children will have highest degree of protection two weeks after they get the last recommended dose. Where can babies and young kids get a COVID vaccine? It is always best to [begin](/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Getting-Your-Child-Ready-for-the-COVID-19-Vaccine.aspx) with your child's pediatrician. Pediatricians are a trusted source, and they know your child best. If your child is not up to date on other vaccinations, ask to receive them with their COVID vaccine at the same visit. Immunizations help your child stay healthy, so their immune system is ready to respond to diseases like COVID, measles, polio, whooping cough and the flu. If your child's pediatrician does not have the COVID vaccine, they can help you sort through options. Depending on your child's age, the vaccine may be available through public health agencies, many clinic settings and pharmacies.

Will my baby have side effects after the COVID shot? Most parents are familiar with minor side effects as their child's immune system learns to make antibodies against a disease. Side effects may include things like soreness and redness where the shot goes in. Some babies and children don't feel well later in the day of the shot or on the next day. A small number of children develop a fever\u2014and very few get high fever. Usually, it lasts only a day or two while their immunity is building up. What if my child already had COVID-19? If your child had a COVID infection, they should still receive a COVID vaccination according to CDC guidelines. It is possible to be infected again with the virus. Vaccines help protect your child by providing extra protection from COVID, even after they have had a COVID infection. People who already had COVID and do not get vaccinated after they recover are [more likely to get COVID again](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm) than those who get vaccinated after they recover. Remember Just like the rest of us, babies and young kids deserve to get the same immune-boosting benefits against COVID. Plus, they are helping to keep others healthy! For example, infants under age 6 months are too young to get the vaccine. Between January 2020 and October 2022, there were [265 babies](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Age-in-Years-/3apk-4u4f/data) under age 6 months who died of COVID. And that is why it is very important for [pregnant and breastfeeding](/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/covid-19-vaccines-during-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding-parent-faqs.aspx) people\u2014and all other people who are around babies\u2014to protect the baby by getting vaccinated.
