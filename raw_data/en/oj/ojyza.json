Naturopathic medicine blends centuries-old natural, non-toxic therapies with current advances in the study of health and human systems. It is a distinct health care profession that was formed in America in 1896 to train doctors to use a combination of the best natural healing methods available within a certain philosophical and principled framework. What if blood tests or lab work is required? Laboratory Tests are ordered by Dr. Healy and performed off-site. For common tests, we suggest using our link here to [Direct Labs](https://www.directlabs.com/helenhealynd). Regarding specialty tests, we have or will request collection kits for assessing the following: food sensitivities, adrenal function, neurotransmitter balance, gut microorganisms, hormone balance, Galectin-3 levels, Lyme Disease, mineral analysis, heavy metal burden, HPV DNA testing for men and women, cardiovascular testing, etc. The cost of lab work is dependent upon the type of test and you will be made aware of the cost before the test is ordered. Do you accept Insurance? If you have an HSA (Health Savings Account), Helen Healy's consultations and prescribed supplements are allowable, tax-free expenditures. Health Savings Accounts allow you to take control of your health care expenses and treatment options, however, many are unaware this choice exists. We strongly urge you to look into an HSA as an alternative insurance choice. Currently, insurance companies and HMO's in Minnesota do not cover naturopathic services. Flexible Spending programs also allow for naturopathic health care deductions. We recommend that everyone ask their insurance providers to allow coverage for natural healthcare expenses. are my visits private? Your treatment at Wellspring and with Dr. Healy is 100% confidential and protected as a patient-physician relationship. Do you offer natural medicine and supplements?
