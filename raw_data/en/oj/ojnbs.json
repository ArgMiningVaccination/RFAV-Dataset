I've wanted to share what natural products my family uses and what I keep in my medicine cabinet on the regular. Especially with cold and flu season at the peak right now, I thought what a perfect time to really showcase what I'm using for natural products. *Affiliate Disclosure: I do have affiliate links in this blog post.

Building A Natural Medicine Cabinet It might seem intimidating at first to swap out all your conventional products when building out your medicine cabinet. However, let me fill you in on a secret- you don't have too! I recommend swapping out the most common products, or the most used products first and then the more specific products when you absolutely need them. For example, a kid's multivitamin is a great staple to have in your routine always, but maybe not the specific kid's cough syrup as you won't be using that everyday, but maybe once or twice a year. Swap out the products you'll use daily first. I'll always have Vitamin C on hand and probiotics, but maybe not Elderberry Syrup because that's more season specific. Where to Shop To Stock Up Your Natural Medicine Cabinet I like to shop from reputable sources when replacing my medicine cabinet. I don't just go to Amazon and start buying supplements. Since we know supplements are a big business and there aren't a lot of checks and balances for manufacturers it's important to do your research and know who you're buying from. I take advice from my Naturopathic Physician and get brands he recommends. That way I know the formulas are clean and effective. Some places I like to shop for supplements: What I Keep In My Natural Medicine Cabinet [Vitamin C Liposomal from Seeking Health-](https://www.seekinghealth.com/products/optimal-liposomal-vitamin-c-30-servings?rfsn=2572139.df0212&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=2572139.df0212) I take this everyday. It comes in a liquid form, that's why it's called a liposomal. Liposomals are often easier to absorb. Vitamin C supports the immune system, as it a strong antioxidant. According to [several studies](https://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/ijsn.7.1.1), vitamin C can help increase antioxidants in your blood which end up helping you fight inflammation in your body. It has also shown to be effective in [helping shorten a cold length](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440782), even in kids. Get [Optimal Liposomal Vitamin C Plus here!](https://www.seekinghealth.com/products/optimal-liposomal-vitamin-c-30-servings?rfsn=2572139.df0212&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=2572139.df0212) Probiotics- A couple months ago I started taking Just Thrive probiotics and have been loving them. After learning how most probiotics don't actually make it to your intestine I was determined to find a probiotic that did. After doing some research I found Just Thrive. They are unique in that when you take them, you know that they will actually end up in your gut where they should be! They probiotics once there are very different and have the ability to do so much more than traditional probiotics. This is why so many customers have seen such a positive change compared to other probiotics. I'm hooked! Use code: GURLGONEGREEN for 15% off. [This is the one I take.](https://justthrivehealth.com/products/probiotic-90-day-supply?rfsn=6962080.cf26dc&selling_plan=678658113) Elderberry- We've been taking this for years. Elderberry is known for being rich in flavonoids- specifically anthocyanins, they're antioxidants that keep the bodies immune system strong and resilient. They help the production of cytokines, which are messengers within the immune system. Cytokines help to to improve the bodies immune response. Elderberries are also believed to contain antiviral properties as well. Literally deactivating viruses. Viruses can't increase in number by themselves, they have to get inside a healthy cell in order to replicate. Research has also shown they can kill common pathogens.

Both my girls got a nasty cold and my hubs and I started taking this right away to boost our immune system. Well, we didn't get it! You are supposed to take them at the first sign of a cold. I can't recommend them enough. They are in pill form and contain an array of powerful antioxidants, elderberry and amino acids.

They literally remind me if I don't remember- they love them. I love that they don't have any added junk in them and are free of artificial dyes, added sugar and synthetic vitamins. I give my 7 year old 2 a day and my 5 year old 2 a day and my 1 year old 1 a day. [Get them here!](https://drwholeness.refersion.com/l/c91.738684) Dr. Wholeness Flora Start For Kids(probiotic)- This is the probiotic I give my kids. It comes in a powder and easily dissolves in water. The formula contains three strains of Lactobacilli and three strains of Bifidobacteria, as well as Streptococcus thermophilus and Saccharomyces boulardii, an extensively researched microorganism shown to help restore microflora balance by enhancing commensal organism function. [ Get it here!](https://drwholeness.refersion.com/l/a78.872552) Dr. Wholeness Head Start Multivitamin For Infants & Kids- This multivitamin is great because it comes in a powder form so you can easily add it to a bottle for an infant, or water for your older child. The b-vitamins are methylated, supporting maximum absorption and utilization. This powder is well rounded with the key fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), as well as vitamin C, key minerals like calcium and magnesium, and even extra support for a growing body with choline and marigold extract for antioxidant benefits. It is an unflavored, non-gmo powder that mixes easily and has no aftertaste, making it enjoyable for even the most picky eaters.

They make it from plants and tree resins. As it lines the hive it helps to protect the bees from the outside germs. It is pretty powerful stuff! Propolis has over 300 powerful natural compounds known for supporting immunity. I love the [ B Powered](http://beekeepersnaturals.pxf.io/RyKMjb)- I'll take a teaspoon a day or add to a tea. I also love their throat sprays. They have them for adults and kids! Finley, my 7 year old, loves spraying it in her mouth daily.

It helps to soothe sore throats, and good for allergies. It contains an array of powerful herbs. We always have this in our natural medicine cabinet! [Grab it here!](https://biocidin.com/products/biocidin-throat-spray) Activated Charcoal- This is great to have in the medicine cabinet. I have them in capsules. Charcoal binds to some poisons, heavy metals, and other toxins and flushes them out of the body. I've been taking this as I've gotten my amalgam fillings removed. To get rid of the heavy metal content I may have been exposed to. I also have given it to kids in applesauce when they've had a stomach bug. [Get some here!](https://www.integrativepro.com/products/gastrointestinal/activated-charcoal) Gaia Herbs- I like a lot of their tinctures. They have high standards when it comes to their herbs, the organic certification and how they process them. The formula's then in return are potent and effective, without added chemicals. We have used the [Kid's Elderberry Syrup](http://pharmaca.pxf.io/Ea2MXK), their [Bronchial Wellness for kids and adults-](http://pharmaca.pxf.io/JrBMaE) (great for throat and respiratory health), and [Lemon Balm](http://pharmaca.pxf.io/BXBvQq)(good for immune system and balances nervous system). They have so many herbal formulas. [You can check more of them out here](http://pharmaca.pxf.io/WDgMaX). Oil Of Oregano- I take these in a capsule from from Seeking Health. Oil Of Oregano is known for it's anti-fungal properties, and natural antibiotic properties. I'll take this at the first sign of symptoms. But you don't want to take it for longer than a week from what I've read. [Get it here!](https://www.vitacost.com/gaia-herbs-single-herbs-oil-of-oregano?1:pos3:751063996693) Fire Cider- I've made a little tonic like this before when my hubs or I have had sore throats. I've made mine before from apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, fresh ginger, honey, garlic and some cayenne pepper. It's like taking a shot of really strong medicine! It will burn but in a good way. A brand actually sells Fire Cider specifically now and has trademarked the name. They add a few more things to their Fire Cider. It's also a great option when you're just not into making one on your own. You can take this everyday to really give you a kick in the pants and energy and immune support. Once you start to feel something come on you can take it every couple hours.

I like adding this in to my supplement routine as winter approaches. [This is the one I take here!](https://www.seekinghealth.com/products/optimal-zinc-lozenge-60-lozenges?rfsn=2572139.df0212&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=2572139.df0212) Host Defense Mushrooms Spray- I've been using this for a while and both my hubs and I really like it!

[Grab it here!](http://pharmaca.pxf.io/GjEM5L) Herb Pharm Mullein Garlic Pure Ear Oil- Finley got her first ear ache when she was two and this literally took the pain away. She hasn't had one since but I like to keep it on hand just in case. I just apply one drop in each ear. [Get them here!](http://pharmaca.pxf.io/kjVrXd) Dr. Wholeness Vitamin D3 + K2- I love having a liquid Vitamin D3-K2 that I can give my kids, since they're not into swelling pills yet. Having adequate Vitamin D levels help to strengthen your immune system. A must for really keeping your body's immune system in tip top shape! I take a drop of this a day in the winter. I give my 4 year old a drop a couple times a week. [Snag it here!](https://drwholeness.myshopify.com/collections/nutritional-supplements/products/vitamin-d3-k2-liquid?rfsn=2709134.0b89e5&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=2709134.0b89e5) Seeking Health NAC- This has been one of most used supplements in my routine this year. It helps to combat congestion and respiratory issues. I had the virus going around and this is one supplement I took consistently. It helps to thin mucus and increase glutathione levels in your body- glutathione is your master antioxidant in your body. [Get it here!](https://www.seekinghealth.com/products/nac-n-acetyl-l-cysteine-90-capsules?rfsn=2572139.df0212&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=2572139.df0212) Doterra Breathe Oil- I actually received this from my friend Steph and love it. I had diffused this when my kids were sick with a cold and super congested. I also would take steamy showers with them to help open up the congestion and put a few drops in the shower to breathe in. It's a combination of Laurel Leaf, Eucalyptus Leaf, Peppermint Plant, Melaleuca Leaf, Lemon Peel, Ravensara Leaf, and Cardamom Seed. I also will be using this when I need to do an aromatherapy steam session for headaches. I don't get headaches, usually only when pregnant. But I've found if I add this to boiling water and then wait a couple minutes, then put a towel over my head and breathe in for 15 minutes my headache will go away. It works every time! This Breathe Oil has all the essentials oils I would normally use and more! [Get it here!](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/site/stephdufordlifestyle) Peppermint Oil- This can be used to help bring down a fever sometimes. Don't put directly on skin with kids or babies dilute with a carrier oil like coconut oil or olive oil first. I apply it to the bottom's of feet and back of neck. [Check out Peppermint Oil here.](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/site/stephdufordlifestyle) Some Things You Might Not Find In The Medicine Cabinet You might not find these following things in the medicine cabinet but they're great holistic natural remedies to have in your back pocket for helping when sick. Traditional Medicinal Teas- This is one tea brand I really love and trust. I always have their Throat Coat tea on hand, Ginger and their Peppermint tea. The Throat Coat is great for soothing sore throats. I'll add a teaspoon of honey for added benefit. [Check it out here!](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XZKCXVK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07XZKCXVK&linkCode=as2&tag=gurlgonegre07-20&linkId=8e39d8d4c511389e0b94082eda9c085f) Vapor Rub- I really like [ZOE Organic's Breathe Balm](https://www.zoeorganics.com/products/breathe-balm?variant=271286742). We've used this before on our kid's chests when they are having congestion or a cough. You can also make your own too! Wellness Mama has a good recipe [here](https://wellnessmama.com/3527/vapor-rub/). Infrared Sauna- I didn't really realize the benefits for immune support until my sister in law was telling me about it. Then I looked it up and was amazed! Infrared Saunas raise core body temperature which helps to keep the immune system strong. They also can increase white blood cell counts too in some studies, which can represent a strong immune system. Bone Broth- Not only can this help support a healthy immune system but it also can be a great way to get some nutrients when sick. Bone broth helps support a healthy gut with it's collagen and amino acids. Since we know that the majority of our immune system lives in the gut it's important to have a healthy gut. You can make your own bone broth here or buy this bone broth from [Kettle and Fire here](https://kettleandfire.com?afmc=gurlgonegreen). Wet Sock Treatment- This one my brother taught me. You put on a pair of wool socks, then you freeze a pair of regular cotton socks. Once frozen, put them on over the wool socks. Then sleep with them on overnight. I know it sounds crazy but it really does work! It quickly can bring down a fever, release pressure and make you feel better in the morning. Get Sleep- It's no surprise that getting enough sleep is SO important. When you don't get proper sleep your immune system gets worn down and in turn so does your body. Eat The Rainbow- Eating real food is going to be your best friend in keeping sickness out of your house. When we eat real food it's going to nourish and feed our bodies living cells that will in turn bring life to our body. I would stick to real foods and avoid processed foods so your body can function optimally. Avoid Sugar- I know I just said to eat real food, but I had to also put avoid sugar! Sugar literally is going to bring your immune system down, making it harder to fight sickness.
