Naturopathic doctors are specially trained in disease prevention and can educate individuals on achieving optimal health and wellness. Naturopathic Medicine is the oldest form of effective Medicine, dating back hundreds of years. The appearance of symptoms in the body during a diseased condition is simply a signal that there is something wrong within the body due to improper diet, nutritional deficiencies, environmental factors, toxicities, injury, and stress, to merely name a few examples. Naturopaths emphasize allowing the body to heal while using methods and medicines that minimize the risk of harmful side effects. Our Naturopathic Doctors at Health Bound integrate standard medical diagnostics with a broad range of natural therapies and provide individualized treatment that includes the consideration of the physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, and social factors, therefore regarding the person as a whole. WHAT IS NATUROPATHY WHAT TO EXPECT ON YOUR FIRST VISIT Your first visit with your naturopathic doctor will consist of a 60 to the 90-minute appointment where you can expect a thorough intake of your initial health concern or state of health. A focused physical exam can also be a part of the initial consultation or may be extended to the follow-up appointment, depending on time restrictions. A follow-up appointment will be booked as necessary, and an individualized treatment plan will be implemented. A treatment plan will depend on the diagnosis made in the prior visit, and various natural therapies will be applied depending on the individual to bring health back to balance. A zinc deficiency test and urinalysis test are included in the cost of your first visit.
