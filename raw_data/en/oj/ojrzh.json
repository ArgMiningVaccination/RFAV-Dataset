Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is the term for medical products and practicesthat are not partof standardmedical care. 1Complementary medicine, CAM, integrated medicine or integrative medicine, and holistic medicine are among many re-brandings of the same phenomenon.2CAM modalities can be divided into ve categories:\u0081Alternative medical systems. Examples of these systems include traditional Chinese medicine, ayurvedic medi-cine, homeopathy, and naturopathy. \u0081Mind -body interventions , which include practices that are based on the human mind, but that have an effect on thehuman body and physical health, such as meditation, prayer, and mental healing.Keywords ruqyah cancer spiritual careAbstract In this article, we reviewed ruqyah from past to present and its use among patients with cancer to attract attention to the importance of ruqyah. Ruqyah, one of the mind -body interventions among complementary and alternative medicine therapies, refers to thehealing method based on the Quran and hadith through the recitation of the Quran,seeking of refuge, remembrance, and dua (supplication) that is used as a means of treating sickness and other problems, by reading ayats of the Quran, the names and attributes of Allah, or by using the duas in Arabic or in an understandable language.Ruqyah is frequently used in patients with cancer in combination with medicaltreatment, and many patients bene t from ruqyah practices. It is usually used to improve emotional and physical well-being , relax, cope with the disease, strengthen the immune system, increase vitality, decrease pain and stress, treat disease, acceler-ate the healing process, increase the duration of life, improve sleep quality, reduce sideeffects associated with treatment, and to be self-suf cient. Ruqyah is a complementary method for modern cancer treatment. It is not an alternative to chemotherapy and cannot directly replace medical treatment. Patients can perform ruqyah by themselveswithout applying to Muslim faith healers or spiritual healing centers. It can be byeveryone regardless of their religion and belief. Although ruqyah has been successfullyused in various social, mental, spiritual, an dp h y s i c a ld i s o r d e r sf o ro v e r1 , 4 4 0y e a r s , there are limited randomized controlled trials about its use in patients with cancer dueto lack of cooperation between health professionals and Muslim faith healers applyingruqyah. Therefore, we suggest that health professionals develop joint projects and studies with Muslim faith healers and Islamic religion professionals on this subject. Finally, we strongly believe that ruqyah must be integrated into mainstream modernmedicine as in the \"Malaysia model \"in both developing and developed countries. received November 5, 2022 accepted after revisionFebruary 19, 2023DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0043-1764498.

These themes include providing treatment or cure, supporting treatment or cure, being part of life, preventing cancer and recurrence, substi-tution for conventional treatment, and as a last resort. 4 Ruqyah, a mind -body intervention, refers to the healing method based on the Quran and hadith through the recita-tion of the Quran, seeking of refuge, remembrance, and dua (supplication) that is used as a means of treating sickness and other problems, by reading ayats of the Quran, the names andattributes of Allah, or by using the duas in Arabic or in an understandable language. 5In this article, we review ruqyah and its use among patients with cancer to attract attention tothe importance of ruqyah. Ruqyah: From Past to Present People have been praying to Allah since Prophet Adam(Alayhi As-Salam), the rst man and the rst prophet. The dua of Prophet Adam (Alayhi As-Salam) and his wife Hawwa (Eve) is mentioned in the Quran as follows: \"They said: Our Lord! We have wronged our own souls: If Thou forgive us notand bestow not upon us Thy Mercy, we shall certainly be lost. \" 6Today, most major religions involve prayer in one way or the other; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may bepracticed spontaneously by anyone at any time. 7 Preservation of life is one of the ve universal principles in Islam.8The Quran commands as \"Nor kill (or destroy) yourselves: for verily Allah hath been to you Most Merciful! \"9 So it is forbidden for people to harm themselves materially and spiritually in Islam. The word dua means \"calling, ask for, request help, \"\"demand and supplication that occurs from small to big, from bottom to top. \"The texts expressing the requests to be submitted to Allah verbally or in writing arealso called dua. In the Islamic literature, it refers to the servant 's confession of his helplessness in the face of Allah 's majesty, and asking for His grace and help in feelings of loveand reverence. 10 Ruqyah means \"to read and blow a part of the Quran, Divine names and attributes or a dua for the purpose ofhealing or protection. \" 11Ruqyah (plural: ruqa) derives from the past tense of the verb raqa. It consists of words said or written in the form of dua or dhikr for the purpose ofprotection or cure. It is sometimes accompanied by other actions, such as blowing or wiping over the thing that it is applied to. \"It should be done by reciting the words of Allah,may He be exalted, or His names and attributes, and in Arabic or in a language the meaning of which is understood, andwith the belief that ruqyah has no effect in and of itself; rather it is only effective by the will of Allah, may He be exalted. \" 12The form of these duas written and carried on paper is called amulet.11 Ruqyah and amulet were used by Arabs during the Age of Ignorance. The Jahiliyyah Arabs wore amulets with differentnames on their necks to eliminate the effects of secret powers and to protect them from the evil eye. They believed that soothsayers and sorcerers who read and breathed by holdingthe head or aching organ of the sick gave them health. 11The age of ignorance (jahiliyyah) is an Islamic concept referring to the period of time and state of affairs in Arabia before theadvent of Islam in the 610th year of the Common Era. The term jahiliyyah is derived from the Arabic verbal root jahala, which means \"to be ignorant or stupid, to act stupidly. \" 13 The ayats of the Quran are comprehensive in that they denote and indicate all the categories of speech and true knowledge and human needs, like command and prohibi-tion, promise and threat, encouragement and deterring, restraint and guidance, stories and comparisons, the Divine ordinances and teachings, the sciences related to the uni-verse, and the laws and conditions of personal life, social life, the life of the heart, spiritual life, and the life hereafter. So the truth of the saying, \"Take whatever you want from the Quran for whatever you want \"has come to be accepted to such a degree by the people of reality that it has become proverbial among them. There is such comprehensiveness in the ayats ofthe Quran that they may be the cure for every ill and the sustenance for every need. 14 The Quran is both a reminder, an idea, wisdom, science, truth, shariah, shifa (cure) for hearts, and a guidance and a mercy for believers. The Quran is strength and food for the hearts and healing for the souls.15It has been recorded that the Quran is shifa in various ayats.16-18In addition, it is advised to seek refuge in Allah from the evil of evil creatures,especially Satan, approaching people with his delusions, in the Quran. 19-23In the Quran, the words blow. \"In Surah Al-Qiyamah, when a person who is about to die is in his throat, \"Isn't there someone who can save him from this situation and curehim? \"The desire of his relatives to seek a doctor is expressed with the word \"blower \"(raki). Interpreters of the Quran note that this means \"the reader who is resorted to as a last measure in case of helplessness. \"Both believers and unbe- lievers apply to it as a nal consolation. 25 There are many hadiths about the ruqyah that was applied to Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wa Sallam [SAW]) by Gabriel when he was sick, that Prophet Muhammad (SAW) applied ruqyah to himself, that He (SAW) applied and advisedruqyah to his family and people for healing and protection from evil. 10,26H.adith is a record of the words, actions, and silent approval of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad (SAW) astransmitted through chains of narrators. In other words, h . adiths are transmitted reports about what Prophet Muham- mad (SAW) said and did. 27 Journal of Child Science Vol. 13 No. 1/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Ruqyah in Cancer \u00c7aksen e21 It was narrated that Abu Hurayra28(one of the compan- ions of Prophet Muhammad [SAW] and the most proli c narrator of hadiths) said: \"The Prophet (SAW) came to visit me (when I was sick), and said to me: 'Shall I not recite for you a ruqyah that Gabriel brought to me? 'I said: 'May my father and mother be ransomed for you! Yes, O Messenger of Allah! 'Bismillah arqika, wallahu min sharri hasidin idha hasad '(In the Name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you, from every disease that is in you, and from the evil of those who [practice witchcraft when they] blow in the knots, andfrom the evil of the envier when he envies), three times. \" 29 Aisha (wife of Prophet Muhammed [SAW]) reported that whenever Allah 's Messenger (SAW) became ill, he used to recite the Muawidhatan (i.e., the last two Surahs of the Quran: Surah Al-Falaq and Surah An-Nas) and blow his breath over himself (after their recitation) and rubbed hishands over his body. So when he was af flicted with his fatal illness, she started reciting the Muawidhatan and blowing her breath over him as he used to do and then she rubbed thehand of the Prophet (SAW) over his body. 30Aside from physical disorders, the Prophet (SAW) commanded ruqyah for snakebites, scorpion stings, and to treat the evil eye.31,32 One of the events that took place about ruqyah in the period of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) is as follows: Some of the companions of the Prophet (SAW) came across a tribeamong the tribes of the Arabs, and that tribe did not entertain them. While they were in that state, the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion). They said (tothe companions of the Prophet [SAW]), \"Have you got any medicine with you or anybody who can treat with ruqyah? \" The Prophet 's companions said, \"You refuse to entertain us, so we will not treat (your chief) unless you pay us for it. \"So they agreed to pay with a flock of sheep. One of them (the Prophet 's companions) started reciting Surah Al-Fatihah and gathering his saliva and spitting it (at the snake bite). The patient got cured and his people presented the sheep tothem, but they said, \"We will not take it unless we ask the Prophet (whether it is lawful). \"When they asked him, he smiled and said, \"How do you know that Surah Al-Fatihah is a ruqyah? Take it ( flock of sheep) and assign a share for me. \" 33 Based on the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (SAW), ruqyah is not exclusively performed by certain group ofMuslims. As a form of dua and incantation, asking from the only all over powering Allah, for the healing of any ailments, Prophet Muhammad (SAW) taught his companionsvarious forms of ruqyah, originating from the hadith and the Quran. 34Some other specialties and training are not needed to practice ruqyah. Patients themselves or their relatives orfriends without applying to Muslim faith healers or spiritual healing centers can perform ruqyah. Ruqyah can be applied not only for Muslims but also for all patients, regardless oflanguage, religion, race, or color. Ruqyah is not exclusively for conditions thought to be caused by jinn disturbance. It can be used in all material and spiritual diseases or disorders. Islamic scholars have noted that ruqyah made for the purpose of healing or protection from evil are permissible, while ruqyah practices that lead to shirk and abuse areharam. 11T\u00fcrkiye Presidency of Religious Affairs High Council of Religious Affairs has stated that it is permissible to recitethe Quran and duas about healing to the sick, hoping for a cure from Allah, and it is religiously forbidden to practice a healer to deceive the public and inform about the unseen. 11 Allah rules the universe with His absolute will, and every- thing in the universe happens by the will and will of Allah. The Originator of the heavens and the earth: When Hedecreeth a matter, He saith to it: 'Be,'and it is. 35So ruqyah is only effective by the will of Allah. One 's ihlas (sincerity) is also important for the ruqyah to be effective. Whatever aman seeks with ihlas, Allah will grant him it. 36Ihlas means pure, clean, sincere, and without hypocrisy. Ihlas is observing only the consent of Allah in every work and especially inworship, and avoiding showing off, hypocrisy, cheating, and deceit. 36 Although ruqyah has been used in various social, mental, spiritual, and physical disorders for over 1,440 years, there are limited randomized controlled trials about its use in the modern literature. Ruqyah practice can improve one 'sc a l m - ness, spiritual quality, and happiness as a characteristic of an individual 's mental health. Ruqyah practices are an effort to restore human trah (nature) that has inner peace and happiness.37Dein and Illaiee38noted that embracing com- plementary treatment options such as ruqyah will help engagement and concordance, and possibly enhance theservice user 's well-being. Ruqyah is widely used by Muslim faith healers, playing an important role, and is popular among patients seekingtreatment in Malaysia. 39,40An Islamic spiritual healing center is open to all races and religions in Malaysia. Islamic spiritual healing practitioners deal with a multitude ofproblems. There are no speci cations the kind of problems they treat. People have a range of reasons from asking prayers for the newborn, common ailments, serious illnesses like cancers and stroke, and illnesses af flicted by supernatu- ral agents. 41Many organizations in Malaysia representing faith healers, for example, Gabungan Pengamal Pengubatan Islam Malaysia, the Federation of Islamic Faith Healers Organizations of Malaysia, Gabungan Pertubuhan PengamalPerubatan Melayu Malaysia, and the Federation of Malay Traditional Healers Organizations of Malaysia, are trying to integrate \"ruqyah \"as a treatment into mainstream modern medicine, via the Ministry of Health. 39Drug addicts are successfully treated by using ruqyah in various Islamic drug rehabilitation centers integrated with modern medi-cine in Malaysia. 42Razali et al43integrated the use of ruqyah with modern medicine, and have emphasized that ruqyah would not merely serve as complementary but as a crucialpart in an integrated treatment system. Ruqyah therapy has begun to be popular in Indonesia in 2003. 44The editorial board of Ghoib Magazine introduced ruqyah to its readers and explained how to apply ruqyah in people 's lives by attracting the attention of the readers.45Then ruqyah therapy has been a hope for many people with thespread of information about ruqyah. Ruqyah is effectively used in the treatment of patients with mental and physical disor- ders in ruqyah clinics in many districts in Indonesia. 44,46 Journal of Child Science Vol. 1 3 No. 1/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).Ruqyah in Cancer \u00c7aksen e22 Ruqyah is also practiced in certain places that provide of cial medical treatment and on television and YouTube inIndonesia. 47 In Saudi Arabia, ruqyah (roqia or ruqia) is commonly used by patients with many acute and chronic disorders such aseczema, mood disorders, and psychiatric conditions includ- ing anxiety, depression, and suicide ideations. 48Faith healing is common in Iraq and ruqyah is used in about half of patientswith psychiatric illnesses. 49Ruqyah is also frequently used in the treatment of mental disorders by Muslim faith healers in Ghana (Kpobi).50 In T\u00fcrkiye, ruqyah is frequently used in coping social, mental, spiritual, and physical disorders and is usually practiced by Muslim faith healers (hoca, hoja or hodja).Hocas provide various services, including counseling and advice; social and spiritual support; reciting the Quran; and dua to the patient directly or to drinks or foods thatthe patient consumes such as water, wheat, rice, or barley. They also perform amulet comprising ayats of the Quran for protection, use of incense for protection, break sihr (magic)casts by an adversary, remove evil eye, remove jinn from body, and cupping. On the other hand, people themselves and/or their relatives without applying to hocas performruqyah by using dua, al 51studied Muslim faith healers 'treatment procedures and results, and they reported that physical, psychosocial, and spiritual symptoms in vast majority of patients improved after using ruqyah. Although ruqyah is frequently used in T\u00fcrkiye and many patients havenoted its positive effects, scarce studies have been done on the ef ciency of ruqyah for the following reasons: \u0081Most physicians do not know that one of four dimensions of health de ned by the World Health Organization is spiritual health. 52So physicians are almost always inter- ested in the physical health of a man, but not the spiritual health. \u0081Most physicians do not know what ruqyah is because of limited studies about the effect of ruqyah on health in the medical literature. \u0081There is a lack of cooperation between health professio- nals and hocas applying ruqyah. Health professionals and hocas work independently of each other, trying to treat patients. Use of Ruqyah in Cancer Spirituality plays a prominent role in the lives of most palliative patients whether or not they formally adhere to a speci c religion and belief.53Turning to faith in Allah or a higher spiritual power is a common way of coping with life- threatening disease such as cancer.54Martel et al55noted that the most used CAM is spiritual/mental strategies amongchildren with cancer. A positive and signi cant relationship between spiritual well-being, mental health, and quality of life was found in cancer patients. 56Bahakim57noted that faith in and reliance on Allah were the immediate factors that helped parents cope with the diagnosis of cancer. Although most patients with chronic diseases, mostly cancer, do prayfor relief from their physical and mental suffering, the intention of their prayers is not only for healing but alsoprayers can be a resource that allows patients to positively transform the experience of their illness. 58Among 31,044 participants, 1,904 had a prior diagnosis of cancer, of whom40% reported CAM and 62% reported the use of prayer for health during the year before the survey. Controlling for socioeconomic factors, it was found that cancer survivorssignicantly used more CAM and prayer for health than the general population in the United States. 59Jors et al58 reported the reasons and topics of prayers can be classi ed intove main categories: (1) disease-centered prayer, (2) assurance-centered prayer, (3) prayer, (4) others-centered prayer, and (5) lamentations. Ruqyah hassome differences from these prayers in the following ways: \"Ruqyah should be done by reciting the words of Allah and He or His names and attributes may be exalted, in Arabic or inan understandable language. It should be performed with the belief that ruqyah has no effect in and of itself; rather it is only effective by the will of Allah, may He be exalted. \" 12 The use of CAM including ruqyah is very common among oncology patients ( Table 1 ). Montazeri et al60reported that 35% cancer patients used CAM and the most commonly(75.7%) used CAM was prayer and spiritual healing. Atteiah et al 61noted that 68.1% patients with brain tumor used CAM and the most common types of CAM were zamzam (wateroriginating from the holy land in Makkah [93.9%]), ruqyah (85.7%), and holy water (water upon which the Quran has been read [73.5%]). In the series of Jazieh et al, 6290.5% patients with cancer used CAM: reciting the Quran (74.8%), zamzam water (59.8%), holy water (29.8%), dua (16%), and supplications to the patient directly or to foods or drinks thata patient consumes, such as honey or water (13%). The majority of patients (90%) used CAM as a cancer treatment and the rest used it for various reasons, such as symptom control or supportive treatment. Only 18% of the patients discussed CAM use with their physicians, compared with 68%discussing it with religious clergymen (Sheikhs). 62In anoth- er series, the prevalence of CAM use was 69.9% in patients with cancer; dua was used in 95.4% of patients with cancer,Quran recitation in 88.1% of patients, zamzam in 84.4% of patients, and holy water in 63.3% of patients. Most patients (75%) used CAM to treat cancer, enhance mood (18.3%),control pain (11.9%), enhance immune system (11%), in- crease physical tness (6.4%), and improve appetite (4.6%). Thirty percent of CAM users had discussed the issue withtheir doctors; only 7.7% had done so with their nurses. 63 Akhu-Zaheya and Alkhasawneh64found a positive correla- tion between chemotherapy and the number of CAM thera-pies used in oncology patients. The highest stress-reducing CAM techniques included reading the Quran (74.8%), dua (69.9%), and ruqyah (34.1%). 64In another study, a signi cant improvement in the general subjective feeling in cancer patients was observed after ruqyah application.65Hematti et al66found that listening, reading, and watching the text of the Quran were useful for increasing life expectancy in palliative radiotherapy patients. More than 60% of the patients stated that more frequent recitation would lead to Journal of Child Science Vol. 13 No. 1/2023 \u00a9 2023.

The authors concluded that spiritual intervention based on Islamic principles can bring back mentalhealth, increase hope and quality of life, and eventually change dopamine gene receptor expressions resulting in reduction of cell proliferation, thus better prevention and management inbreast cancer patients compared with other forms of treat- ment. 69Saliva cortisol levels and depression scores were lower, but the quality of life and spiritual life quality valueswere higher in patients with cancer who applied self-ruqyah treatment program than those of the control group. 70 CAM comprising ruqyah is frequently used in patients with cancer in T\u00fcrkiye. It is usually used for the following purposes: to improve emotional and physical well-being, relax, cope with disease, strengthen immune system, in-crease vitality, decrease pain and stress, treat disease, accel- erate the healing process, increase the duration of life, improve sleep quality, reduce side effects associated withtreatment, and to be self-suf cient. 71All patients used at least one CAM in a series consisting 1,499 patients with cancer and the most commonly used CAM was prayer(99%). 72Can et al73noted that all 96 patients with cancer used one or more CAM therapies. The CAM used were prayer (77.1%), worship (32.3%), meditation (5.2%), prayer support (3.1%), visiting saints (3.1%), and amulet (1.0%). In other two series, use of praying was 81.60%68and use of prayer and spiritual healing was 49%.74Karal et al75reported 73.3% parents of children with cancer used at least one CAM method and 43.2% families used body -mind practices such as offerings, animal sacri ce, amulets, referring to prayer leaders, and visiting tombs. In a series including 112 children with cancer, 77% parents used at least one CAM and 55%parents used the bind -body method (prayer). 76G\u00f6z\u00fcm et al77reported that of the 88 parents of children with cancer, 48.9% parents reported the use of one or more CAM therapiesand 18.9% parents used spiritual healing. In another series, 61% cancer patients used at least one CAM including amulet and prayer and 53.2% patients reported CAM to be bene - cial. 78The word \"ruqyah \"has not been mentioned in these studies conducted in T\u00fcrkiye. The terms \"pray, \"\"prayer, \" \"praying, \"\"prayer support, \"or\"spiritual healing \"have been used to express words with many different meanings such as \"ruqyah, \"\"dua, \"\"dhikr, \"\"salah, \"or\"worship. \" There are some dif culties and limitations about the use of ruqyah in hospitals. First, hospital of cials, health pro- fessionals, and caregivers have insuf cient knowledge about ruqyah. Second, ruqyah is incorrectly perceived as prosely-tizing by some people. As a consequence, health professio- nals who know the importance of ruqyah cannot recommendruqyah to their patients due to the reactions of nongovern- mental organizations and associations. Third, patients who want to practice ruqyah cannot do ruqyah in hospitalsbecause they are afraid of the reactions of health professio- nals. Additionally, there are no prayer rug, rosary, the Quran, tafsir, and prayer books for patients who want to practiceruqyah in wards. Finally, there are no imams or clergymen to perform ruqyah in most hospitals. Conclusion Ruqyah means \"to read and blow a part of the Quran, Divine names and attributes or a dua for the purpose of healing or protection. \"Ruqyah should be performed with the belief that ruqyah has no effect in and of itself; rather it is only effectiveby the will of Allah. Surah al-Fatihah in the Quran is one of ruqa. It can be used in all material and spiritual diseases or disorders. Patients themselves or their relatives or friendswithout applying to Muslim faith healers or spiritual healing centers can perform ruqyah. Ruqyah can be applied in everyone regardless of their religion and belief. Ruqyah, one of the mind -body interventions in CAM therapies, is a complementary method for modern cancer treatment. It is not an alternative to chemotherapy andcannot directly replace medical treatment. Ruqyah is fre- quently used in patients with cancer in combination with medical treatment and many patients bene t from ruqyah practices. Ruqyah provides a source of comfort and guidance for many patients with cancer. So we think that ruqyah is the right of every patient. Although ruqyah has been successfullyused in the treatment of various disorders for centuries, there are limited randomized controlled trials about its use in patients with cancer because of lack of cooperation between health professionals and Muslim faith healers in applying ruqyah. Therefore, we suggest that health profes-sionals develop joint projects and studies with Muslim faith healers and Islamic religion professionals on this subject. On the other hand, we strongly believe that ruqyah must beintegrated into mainstream modern medicine like the \"Malaysia model \"in both developing and developed coun- tries. For this purpose, rst, physicians should be informed about the use of ruqyah and then more randomized con- trolled trials should be performed on this subject. Second, ruqyah should be promoted to patients with cancer and theirrelatives through scienti c societies, civilian organizations, and the media. Third, the ministry of health of cials should be informed that some patients greatly bene t from ruqyah practices in addition to chemotherapy. Conflict of Interest None declared.
