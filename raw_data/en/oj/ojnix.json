Chignolli , MS, APRN -CNP The Ohio State University 2019 DNP Project Committee: Clark Graham, PhD, APRN INFLUENZA PROJECT 2 Abstract Nature and scope of the project: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that influenza vaccination prevented approximately 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits , 109,000 hospitalizations , and 8,000 deaths in the United States during the 201 7- 2018 influenza season (CDC, 201 9). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends influenza vaccination as a primary prevention measure against infection in all individuals six months and older who do not have contraindications (Grohskopf , Sokolow, Broder, Walter, Fry, & Jernigan, 2018). The objectives of this quality improvement project were to (a) address common barriers to influenza vaccination; (b) develop a standardized process for influenza vaccination delivery at a Convenience Care Clinic (CCC); (c) evaluat e the impact of this process change on the CCC's influenza vaccination rates. Synthe sis and analysis of supporting literature: A comprehensive literature review of best practices for improving vaccination rates revealed three impactful strategies including : 1. Educating health care providers (HCP) on missed opportunities to vaccinate . 2. Includ ing immunizations in patient reminder systems. 3. Providing various forms of patient education. Project implementation: An educational quality improvement project was guided by Lewin's Change Model and Rosswurm and Larrabee's Model for Evidence -Based Practice Change. The 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program is an evidence -based educational and support program developed by the University of Pittsburgh and funded by the CDC to increase immunization rates (4 Pillars , 201 9), and this serve d as a model for project implementation. Evaluation criteria: Data collection in October 2018 included the number of patients that presented for an acute illness at the CCC compared to the number of patients that presented for INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 3 an acute illness that were vaccinated for infl uenza at that encounter. This was compared to retrospective data from October 2017. Patient a ge and gender , as well as vaccinations ordered per HCP, were measured to evaluate for trends. HCP s track ed reasons the vaccine was not administered or offered. Outcomes: The proportion of patients presenting for acute illness management at the CCC that received an influenza vaccine at that encounter was 2.5% in 2017 and 33.9% in 2018 during the observed time period . This was found to be statistically significant with an estimated 31.4% increase from 2017 to 2018 in vaccinating patients against influenza when presenting for acute illness management . Patient age and gender were not found to impact vaccination rates. Most HCPs demonstrated statistically significant i mprovements in vaccinating against influenza from 2017 to 2018. \"Personal choice\" was the most frequent reason that vaccine eligible patients declined immuniza tion. Recommendations: Recommendations include developing a standardized process for offering influenza vaccination to all eligible patients and understanding the common missed opportunities and barriers to influenza vaccination so that this may be used to inform future educational efforts .

INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 6 Implementation of a Quality Improvement Influenza Immunization Project in a Convenience Care Clinic Section One: Nature of the Problem Introduction Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infects approximately five to twenty percent of the population in the United States (U.S.) annually (American Lung Association, 201 8). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that influenza vaccination prevented approximately 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits , 109,00 0 hospitalizations , and 8,000 deaths in the U .S. during the 201 7- 2018 influenza seaso n (CDC, 201 9). Consequences of influenza infection range from mild to severe, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends influenza vaccination as a primary prevention measure against infection in all individuals six months and older who do not have contraindications ( Grohskopf , Sokolow, Broder, Walter, Fry, & Jernigan, 2018). The World Health Organization also emphasizes that v accination is essential in reducing infectious disease burden and is a critical public health measure in ensuring healthcare equity and safety (Andre et al., 2008). Therefore, it is vital to population health to explore opportunities where influenza immuni zation practices have the potential for improvement. An analysis of the 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey found that for adolescents at the national level, 61% of vaccinations are given in preventive visits, 26% are given in immunization -only encounter s, while only 12% of vaccines are given at acute and follow up visits (Rand & Goldstein, 2018). With a lower percentage of vaccine administration occurring at acute encounters, it is important to consider practice patterns at settings that primarily offer these services such as convenience care clinics (CCC) , also known as retail clinics . Many patient visits INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 7 at CCC s are focused on treatment of acute routine illness (Bachrach, Frohlich, Garcimonde , & Nevitt 2015), and it has been identified that only a small number of immunizations are administered at these encounters (Uscher -Pines, Harris, Burns, & Mehro tra, 2012). A clinical problem occurs when health care providers (HCP) forego education and encouragement of immunizations with vaccine -eligible patients, including those with mild acute illness (CDC, 2016). Every primary care encounter presents an opportunity for preventive care and HCPs at CCCs are gene rally not actively encouraging vaccinations in patients presenting for acute illness management (Uscher -Pines et al., 2012). This is a healthcare quality and safety issue as it results in significant missed opportunities to vaccinate and to decrease transm ission of vaccine -preventable infections including influenza. Uscher -Pines et al. (2012) assessed that HCPs in CCCs can potentially increase vaccinations delivered if vaccination histories are reviewed and patients are counseled on the benefits of vaccinat ion during acute illness encounters. A large medical center in the Midwest operates a CCC which provides same -day services primarily focused on acute illness management. A n opportunity was identified to improve influenza vaccination rates at this CCC, as it was observed that patients were infrequently vaccinated unless presenting specifically with this request. Some patients at the CCC do not see another HCP during influenza season and many do not have a primary care provider (PCP) ; therefore, it was vital to capture these opportunities to immunize. This project plan ned to address this issue so that more patients at the CCC could be vaccinated and protected against influenza. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 8 Purpose of Project The purpose of the quality improvement (QI) project was to impact influenza immunization rates at this CCC through the implementation of an evidence -based practice (EBP) chan ge. HCP interventions and providing patient reminders for vaccination ha ve been demonstrated to impact immunization rates ( Jacobson Vann, Jacobson, Coyne -Beasley, Asafu - Adjei, & Szilagyi, 2018 ); therefore, improved HCP efforts to educate and encourage vaccination at all appropriate encounters could potentially improve influenza vaccination acceptance. Th is QI project focused on assisting HCPs to implement a practice change that encourage d patients to be immunized against influenza at all possible opportunities. It is vital to consider how influenza vaccination rates can improve as missed opportunities may result in serious health consequences, including increased morbidity and mortality as well as greater healthcare spending (Grohskopf et al., 201 8; Putri, Muscatello, Stockwell, & Newall, 2018 ). Population of interest and setting. The CCC operated by employees of the large medical center in the Midwest provides same day walk in services to a ny individual 18 months of age and older, and all patients presenting to this CCC were potentially eligible for the intervention. The clinic is located within a few miles of the medical center 's main campus . The clinic is staffed daily by one to two certified nurse practitioners (CNP) , a medical assistant (MA) , and registration personnel. Introduction of intervention. This QI project utilize d an EBP toolkit called the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program as a model for implementation. The 4 Pillars Immunization Toolkit Materials are an evidence -based educational and support program developed by the University of Pittsburgh and funded by the CDC to increase immunization rates (4 Pillars, 201 9). The CDC and the American Board of Family Medicine support the 4 INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 9 Pillars Practice Transformation Program as a strategy for improving vaccinat ion rates (CDC, 2016). It has been shown to be an effective, influential tool in improving immunization rates in outpatient settings (Nowalk et al., 2014). There are three sections to the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program , and a ll sections of the toolkit guide d the QI intervention at this CCC. Project goal and objectives. The goal of this QI project was to create a 25 percent improvement in influenza vaccination r ates for patients presenting to the CCC for acute illness concerns. If this was not met, positive trends in immunization rates would still demonstrate improvement. The proposed objectives of this QI project were to: Address common barriers to influenza vaccination including false contraindications such as mild acute illness and frequent reasons for patient vaccination refusal ; Develop a standardized, efficient, and streamlined process for influenza vaccination delivery at the CCC ; Evaluate the impact of this process change on influenza vaccination rates at the CCC in order to make recommendations for a sustainable practice change . INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 10 Section Two: Review of the Literature Clinical Practice Problem Statement A clinical question asked in the PICOT format ( population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and time) re sults in an effective literature search yielding the best and most relevant evidence (Stillwell, Fineout -Overholt, Melnyk, & Williamson, 2010). The identified clinical practice problem was that missed opportunities to administer influenza vaccination frequently occurred at the CCC. The population considered in the literature search was ambulatory patients, which included patients at CCCs . The intervention was patient vaccine coaching, compared to no patient vaccine coaching. The outcome of interest was to examine how this intervention versus no intervention impact ed immunization rates, with an emphasis on influenza vaccination. The PICOT \"time\" component was not applicable to this search. The following PICO T question was developed to guide a comprehensi ve literature search: \"In ambulatory patients, how does vaccine coaching compared to no vaccine coaching impact (influenza) immunization rates? \" Evaluation of Evidence Literature search method. A comprehensive literature review served to gain an understanding of missed opportunities to vaccinate, a CCC's role in immunization, as well as best practices for impacting vaccination rates. The literature search was completed utilizing a variety of databases to understand the history of the clinical problem and to support a QI intervention. An extensive search was completed in Cochrane Database, PubMed, and CINAHL. Search terms in Cochrane Database included: immunization and vaccination. Search terms in PubMed and CINAHL included: ambulatory care (MeSh term), convenience care clinic, retail clinic, vaccine education, vaccine coaching, (influenza) immunization rates, (influenza) vaccination rates, missed opportunities, and vaccination toolkit. The Boolean operators AND and INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 11 OR were both utilized. The initial literature search was broad to ensure that it was exhaustive , and articles were later narrowed to those most specific to ambulatory settings and CCCs, articles primarily published within the past ten years, and those with higher levels of evidence such as systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials . Only articles written in English were considered. See Appendix A for the Levels of Evidence Synthesis Table related to the intervention . Background significance . Influenza and the influenza vaccine. The CDC (2016) describes influenza as a rapid - onset, contagious respiratory illness. Depending on the season, i nfluenza results in 114,018 to 633,001 hospitalizations and 4,866 to 27,810 deaths in the U.S annually ( Reed et al., 201 5). The yearly U.S. economic burden of influenza is estimated at $3.2 billion in direct medical costs and $8 billion in lost earnings ( Putri et al. , 2018 ). Costs to treat influenza vary significantly but become expensive with medical visits, testing, treatment, and even hospitalization to manage symptoms. Challenger, Gray and Christmas (2018) explain that the average hourly wage from the Bureau of Labor Stati stics in 2018 was $26.74. Missing four eight -hour shifts could cost an individual $855.68 in wages (Challenger et al., 2018). Putri et al. (2018) actually estimates six days of lost productivity per person that contracts influenza. This results in signific ant financial implications for both empl oyers as well as individuals or families that contract influenza. ACIP recommends that all people six months and older without a contraindication are immunized against influenza (Grohskopf et al., 201 8). A Cochrane S ystematic Review found that healthy adults receiving influenza vaccine probably experienced less influenza and influenza like illness (ILI) than those who were unvaccinated (Demicheli, Jefferson, Ferroni, Rivetti, & Di Pietrantonj, 2018). For children ages 3 to 16 , another substantial Cochrane Systematic Review INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 12 demonstrated the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing cases of influenza (Jefferson, Rivetti, Di Pietrantonj, & Demicheli, 201 8). While influenza vaccine efficacy varies each season, it reduces influenza and ILI by 40 to 60 percent when the circulating influenza viruses match the vaccine (CDC, 201 8). Missed opportunities. Missed opportunities are health care visits where vaccine -eligible patients are seen for a health concern but are not vaccinated (4 Pillars , 2019). One of the primary barriers associated with missed opportunities are false contraindications encountered by HCPs such as a history of febrile seizures, living with pregnant or immunosuppressed individuals, recent antibiotic u se, relatives with allergies, and recent vaccination (Ngoh & Ng, 2016 ). Favin, Steinglass, Fields, Banerjee, and Sawhney (2012) found that not immunizing a sick child was the most common false contraindication to vaccination, and that HCPs delayed vaccinat ion due to concern that the vaccine would be blamed if an illness worsened. The CDC (2016) provides a list of invalid contraindications to vaccination which comprises mild acute illness. Mild acute illness includes upper respiratory infections, low -grade fevers, otitis media, and mild diarrhea (CDC, 2016). Individuals with mild acute illness should be vaccinated without delay. Because low -grade fever is not a contraindication to vaccination, the decision to vaccinate should be based on the patient's overal l disposition rather than body temperature (CDC, 2016). Patients may receive the influenza vaccine while undergoing most antimicrobial therap ies, and i t is also advised to offer influenza vaccination to hospitalized candidates (CDC, 2016). There is no evidence that acute illness lessens vaccin e effectiveness or causes adverse events, however the CDC (2016) recommends withholding vaccination for moderate to severe acute illness due to concern that a vaccine side effect could complicate a INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 13 severely ill ind ividual's management. The decision to delay vaccination for acute illness depends on symptom severity and illness etiology. Role of convenience care clinics. It is crucial to understand the role that CCCs play in vaccine delivery. Because of their accessi bility and convenience, more patients are fulfilling their healthcare needs in these settings ( Postema & Breiman, 2000 ). Patients often cite convenience as a primary reason for visiting a CCC; the efficient yet high quality care provided by these clinics leads to enhanced customer satisfaction (Tu & Boukus, 2013). The number of CCCs has increased nearly 900 percent between 2006 and 2014, and the amount of visits has increased sevenfold from approximately 1.5 million in 2006 to 10.5 million in 2012 (Bachrach et al., 2015). In 2008 there were approximately 200 CCCs in the U.S., and by 2018 an estimated 2,800 of these clinics existed (Statistica, 2019). Most patient visits at CCCs are focused on treatment of acute illness (Bachrach et al., 2015), and only a small number of immunizations are administered at these encounters (Uscher -Pines et al., 2012). Uscher -Pines et al. (2012) assessed that HCPs in CCCs can potentially increase vaccinations delivered if education and encouragement for vaccination occur s at acute illness encounters. Many adults receive their vaccines during evening, weekend, and holiday hours (Goad, Taitel, Fensterheim, & Cannon, 2013), and CCCs are positioned to aid in vaccinating these patients. Synthesis of intervention evidence. Fourteen important articles were identified in relation to the clinical question. Appendix B provides evaluation tables of evidence regarding the impact of various HCP interventions on vaccination rates in outpatient/ambulatory care settings. Appendix C provides a synthesis of the interventions evaluated in these articles : HCP reminders, HCP and staff education, information handouts, and patient outreach. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 14 Several article s demonstrate the positive impact of HCP discussion and reminders on vaccin e acceptance (Benjamin & Barr, 2016; Grivas & Dub\u00e9, al., 2014; Pennant al., 2015; Pierson , Malone & Haas, 2 015; & Williams et al., 2017 ). HCPs providing confident recommendations for vaccination has been repeatedly demonstrated to influence patient vaccine acceptance (MacDonald & Dub\u00e9, 2018). According to Williams et al. (2017), awareness of the need for vaccinations among adults is low and this population relies on HCPs for recommendations to be immunized. From the 2009 to 2010 through 2014 to 2015 influenza seasons, less than 45% of adults were vaccinated against influenza (Willi ams et al., 2017). This is significantly lower than Healthy People 2020's goal of 70% of adults being vaccinated annually against influenza, so it is essential that all patients visiting a HCP receive a strong recommendation for this vaccine during influen za season (Williams et al., 2017). Achiev ing Healthy People 2020's goal requires strong public health interventions and leadership efforts to promote vacci nation (Benjamin & Barr, 2016). In a Cochrane Systematic Review of 75 studies, a positive correlation between patient reminder/recall systems and rates of immunization was found (Jacobson Vann et al., 2018). Several types of reminder systems proved to be effective, including strategies focused on HCPs such as education to reduce missed opportunities and p roviding prompts for patient discussion. An essential finding was that if patients were reminded in some way to get vaccinated, immunization rates increased (Jacobson Vann et al., 2018). In another systematic review featuring 106 studies, Lau et al. (2012) assessed that adults in the community achieved higher vaccination rates if activated through personal contact with a HCP. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 15 HCP education has also been shown to improve immunization rates (Benjamin & Barr, 2016; Clark, Jackson, Hodges, Gilliam, & Lane, 2015; Favin et al., 2012; Jacobson Vann et al., 2018 ; Leung et al., 2017; MacDonald & Dub\u00e9 ., 2018; Nowalk Real et al., 2017 ). HCPs must be kept up to date on how to convey info rmation related to vaccines in an accurate and positive manner (MacDonald & Dub\u00e9, 2018). Clark et al. (2015) demonstrated that structured education, feedback, and reinforcement to staff has a significant impact on immunization rates. Real et al. (2017) fou nd that a provider virtual reality training program for communication strategies to combat vaccine hesitancy was quite effective in decreasing influenza vaccine refusal. Interventions should focus on patient education al efforts that address the safety and relevance of the influenza vaccine, as well as dispelling common vaccine misconceptions (Benjamin & Barr, 2016). In an intervention to increase vaccination rates in four ambulatory specialty practices, many patients were not aware of the risks of contracti ng vaccine preventable infections, and staff education improved rates of vaccine delivery (Pennant et al., 2015). Humiston et al. (2011) and Leung et al. (2017) found that face to face vaccine education was highly effective in increasing influenza vaccinat ion rates for older adults, while Favin et al. (2012) concluded that parents are very receptive of HCP recommendations for vaccination of their children. Simple interventions such as HCP prompts or laminated reminders make an impact on influenza vaccinatio n rates (Grivas et al., 2017; Pierson et al., 2015). In a resident clinic, a project using a simple paper -based prompt for HCPs demonstrated that providing patient education increased influenza vaccine delivery (Pierson et al., 2015). Grivas et al. (2017) found that includ ing patient -focused reminders in their multi -modal approach such as post ing INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 16 educational information about influenza vaccination and how to get vaccinated increased immunization rates . It is evident that educating HCPs on missed opportuniti es and best ways to discuss vaccination with patients , patient reminder systems, an d various forms of patient education make a s ignificant impact on immunization rates. Critical appraisal of evidence. There are a variety of levels of evidence represented i n this literature review of interventions , including two substantive quantitative systematic reviews and one qualitative systematic review (see Appendix A). Evaluation of intervention implementation strategies demonstrate the overall positive impact that HCP education, HCP reminder s, information handout s, and patient outreach interventions have on vaccination rates . There was less evidence specifically related to CCCs but more robust results were yielded when searching for ambulatory care settings . In addi tion, searches frequently yielded articles focused on influenza vaccination of ambulatory clinic staff rather than of patients. It was also challenging to find interventions specific to influenza vaccination, as studies in outpatient settings frequently looked at other vaccines such as pneumococcal and human papilloma virus vaccines. Overall, the interventions evaluated in this literature review that were the most impactful focused on HCPs reminding and educating patients regarding vaccination. There seems to be less evidence pertaining to the role that CCCs can specifically have in immunizing patients , and more evidence on how clinics in ambulatory or outpatient settings can impact vaccination rates . However, t here are large systematic reviews as well as o ther intervention studies that are generalizable to support this intervention. The gathered evidence demonstrates the usefulness of an educational intervention to impact vaccination rates at this CCC. As CCCs continue to serve more patients, new research i s needed in these settings. Newer data is also needed specifically regarding vaccination in the CCC setting. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 17 Theoretical Basis Conceptual framework. A change theory is key to implementing a successful change within an organization (Shirey, 2013). Kurt Lewin developed Lewin's Change Model in the 1940s (Lewin, 1951), and this model was used as a theoretical framework for implementing a practice change among the staff at the CCC. Lewin's Change Model explains that individuals and groups are challenged by r estraining forces that maintain the status quo, which are opposed by driving forces that seek positive change (Lewin, 1951). These opposing forces maintain equilibrium, until change initiatives are implemented using the three stages of the theory (Lewin, 1951). The three stages in this change theory are: unfreeze , change , and refreeze (Petiprin, 2016) (see Figure 1). Manchester et al. (2014) explain that by considering Lewin's Change Model while planning an EBP change, it is possible to be prepared to overcome resistance to the change. In the unfreezing stage, identifying stakeholders and champions of the change early will most likely facilitate the uptake and sustainability of the practice change (Manchester et al., 2014). It was essential to have strong internal and external evidence to demonstrate the need for disrupting the status quo at the CCC related to immunizin g patients against influenza. Getting initial feedback from the HCPs during planning about how to improve influenza vaccination rates increased their interest and investment in the QI project. In the change stage, HCPs at the CCC attended a CE course tha t provided information about best practice and their involvement in the upcoming practice change. The QI project was then implemented by involving all staff and stakeholders in the process, and frequently checking in to provide support. In the refreezing stage, the HCPs and clinic staff were provided with data to demonstrate and celebrate their success in improving influenza vaccination rates. Managers and INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 18 administrators were provided with this data including the impact on health care spending and patient o utcomes to support the sustainability of the practice change. This stage demands stabilizing the change so that it can be maintained over time (Petiprin, 2016), and the support from organization al leaders will be key so that this practice change can be em bedded into the culture of the CCC. Figure 1. Stages of Lewin's Change Model ( Lock, 2018 ) EBP models. The Model for Evidence -Based Practice Change developed by Rosswurm and Larrabee serve d as a guide for implementation and dissemination of the QI project (see Figure 2) . This model assists and directs projects seeking to change practice (Rosswurm & Larrabee, 1999). The Model for Evidence -Based Practice Change encourages defining the practice problem through assessing both internal and external data (Rosswurm & Larrabee, 1999). Having a strong understanding of the problem at the CCC that c ould be demonstrated through internal data, accompanied by strong evidence -based external data, w as vital in INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 19 supporting the QI project. The model defines critically appraising the strength of the evidence as well as synthesizing the evidence as key actions to determining if the practi ce change is supported (Rosswurm & Larrabee, 1999). Through careful analysis of the best available evidence, this QI project was designed and carefully implemented. This model also strongly encourages evaluation and monitoring of outcomes so that the pract ice change can be maintained (Rosswurm & Larrabee, 1999). This was essential to the sustainability and long -term success of the intervention, a nd minor adjustments can be made in the future as necessary so that the practice change can be upheld and become standard of care at the CCC. Figure 2. Steps of the Model for Evidence -Based Practice Change (Larrabee, 2009) INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 20 Also key to the future sustainability of the practice change is consideration of the Advancing Research and Clinical Practice through Close Collaboration (ARCC) Model conceptualized by Bernadette Melnyk in 1999 (Melnyk & Fineout -Overholt, 2002) (see Figure 3). The authors of this model emphasize assessment of the organizational culture to adopt EBP and the utilization of EBP ment ors to assist with system -wide implementation (Melnyk & Fineout -Overholt, 2002). Having individuals serve as EBP mentors and promote the CCC's evidence -based practice change among the ambulatory care setting of the large medical center will be essential to obtaining buy in from key stakeholders . This will facilitate the sustainability and disseminat ion of the practice change to other settings within the department and promote the culture of utilizing EBP to improve patient outcomes across the medical center . Figure 3. The ARCC Model (Melnyk & Fineout -Overholt, 2005) INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 21 Organizational strategic plan. The large medical center in the Midwest that operates the CCC highly values research, acquisition of knowledge, and patient care. It is supportive of EBP and encourages QI projects that aim to improve patient outcomes. One element of the medical center's strategic plan highlights the importance of innovation , through encouraging leaders within the organization to champion an environmen t of continued learning. It emphasizes the idea of being curious and putting new perspectives and concepts into practice. Another key construct of the strategic plan is inclusiveness, where multidisciplinary collaboration and working together as a diverse team to achieve success is encouraged. Determination is additionally emphasized through actively monitoring organizational processes to identify areas for improvement. This element of the strategic plan urges employees to strive for excellence and to create meaningful contributions to their work environment. Historically there have been fewer projects completed in the ambulatory care setting compared to the inpatient hospital setting at this large medical center . With no former projects completed at t his CCC, it was important to get key stakeholders involved to heighten enthusiasm for this QI project so that it ha d the greatest potential for success. Utility and Feasibility Data collected in this project serve d to support a change in practice and reinforce the importance of providing innovative patient care at the medical center . One of the project's objectives was to create a streamlined process for offering and administering the influenza vaccine to all applicable patients. If the process proved to be minimally time intensive and simple to implement , it w ould be easier to continue utilizing it in the future. If a positive impact on influenza vaccination rates was evident based on data collected, future support from leaders such as administrators a nd directors w ould be more likely. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 22 Stakeholders of this project include d clinic HCPs (all HCPs at the clinic are CNPs ), MAs , managers, the vaccine supply coordinator, and information technology (IT) support for data collection. Other stakeholders include d medical center administrators, the finance department, insurance companies, and patients. Involvement of key stakeholders and a transformational leader that mentor ed, encourage d, and communicate d with team members to innovate and improve the present syst em was essential in making a practice change (Anonson et al., 2014). Financial expenses for this project were minimal. Additional influenza vaccine supply including supply from the Vaccines for Children program was ordered, but the cost was compensated whe n patients and their insurance companies pa id for the vaccination. Additional time involvement include d a one-hour continuing education ( CE) course for clinic HCPs and MAs over their lunch break , and approximately 30 seconds to one minute of discussion per patient during influenza season. Medical assistants spent additional time vaccinating patients, but this time was minimal with a streamlined process. There was the option to move patients to a conference room next to the clinic exam ination rooms while waiting for the vaccination if needed to decrease disruption of clinic flow. Recommendations for Practice Based on the literature and studies available, an intervention to impact influenza immuniz ation rates at the CCC was supported. There was sufficient evidence to support an intervention guided by the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program (CDC, 2016) . Prior to developing a plan for implementation, it was crucial to consider potential barrier s and facilitators that m ight come into play so that they c ould be addressed while planning the execution of the intervention. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 23 Potential barriers. Time is a factor that likely deters HCP s from discussing vaccinations as the visit length from start to finish is scheduled for twenty minutes. A higher acuity encounter may take longer than twenty minutes, and to continue to provide quick service and minimize falling behind on the schedule, a vaccination discussion may be omitted. Patients also present to CCCs for convenience and may decline vaccination due to time constraints. There are several task factors involved in giving a vaccine and this increased workload is an additional barrier. There is a common misconception of several false contraindications to all vaccina tions (Ngoh & Ng, 2016). A missed opportunity occurs when HCP s withhold or patients decline vaccination s due to misconceptions, and a large portion of the population that should b e vaccinated is missed. In addition, some patients refuse vaccination s based on false beliefs about side effects. Last, organizational factors must be considered as HCP s at this CCC ha d not historically been urged to offer vaccines . Without this encouragement from managers and organizational leaders, they were less likely to independently make this practice change. Strategies to address barriers . Strategies to successfully implement this QI project focus ed on overcoming potential ba rriers . It was key to streamline and simplify the vaccination process for clinic staff (HCPs and MAs) as well as for patients, so that minimal time was added to the visit length. On busier days, this include d utilizing a conference room designated for immu nizing patients instead of vaccinat ing in the clinic's exam ination rooms. In addition, MAs initiated the order for the influenza vaccination for all patients at the time of collecting vital signs so that HCPs were reminded to have the vaccine discussion. HCPs c ould then simply sign or cancel the order as needed. Clinic staff additionally prepare d every morning prior to the clinic opening by getting influenza vaccines ready to administer. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 24 The CE course offered to the CCC's HCPs and MAs serve d as a reminder of false contraindications to vaccination, and also equip ped HCPs with quick discussion points that address ed the most common reasons for patient vaccine refusal . A handout, accessible in the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program 's toolkit, was print ed and laminated for MAs to give to patients while waiting for the HCP in the examination room. This provided additional education regarding influenza vaccine importance and common misconceptions (see Appendix D). This reading material was meant to facilitate discussion and decrease the amount of time spent in conversation . Manager s and organizational leaders helped facilitate the project by prais ing employees for their efforts. Potential facilitators and strategy to engage. The project w ould be mos t successful if there was full engagement of all team members and stakeholders. HCPs and MAs at the clinic receive d training and one hour of CE credit (with pharmacology credit) during their lunch break. Two dates and times were offered to attend so the clinic staff did not need to come in on a day off for this education. MAs were also educated about the QI project and their role in implementation during their monthly staff meeting. The 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program encourages motivat ional strategies to engage staff , and there was a plan to initiate a fun challenge among HCP s for the most influenza vaccines given over the course of the intervention period. The office manager and lead clinician were continuously updated to support staff in their efforts . Other support for the project include d the office supply coordinator stock ing additional influenza vaccines and administration supplies. Support from the IT Department w as essential in data collection and gathering of reports. Other sta keholders inclu ded PCPs whose patients were being immunized, the finance department, insurance companies, and patients. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 25 Section Three: Methods Recommendations for Implementation of Practice Change After reviewing evidence in the literature as well as the observed need for improv ing influenza vaccination practices for patients presenting for acute visits at this CCC, the proposed practice change was to implement an evidence -based practice intervention that impact ed influenza immunization pra ctices at the CCC . Every patient presenting to the CCC would be assessed for influenza immunization status as well as appropriateness for vaccination against influenza. The influenza vaccine order w as to be initiate d by MAs at visit onset so as not to miss any potential patients for vaccination, and after consideration and discussion, HCPs were then to sign or cancel this order. If the order was signed, HCPs electronically place d a \"red dot\" next to the patient's name on the schedule as an indication to the MA to check orders for any additional testing or work that need ed to be completed. The MA c ould then administer the influenza vaccination in the exam room or nearby conference room depending on the clinic schedule. Plan for Implementation Sample and sett ing. The CCC setting for this QI project is operated by a large medical center in the Midwest . It is located in a suburb within a few miles of the medical center's main campus . The patient population presenting to the CCC is varied and attracts all ages of local residents, medical center employees, students, and visitors to the area . Patients must be at least 18 months of age. Some patients at the CCC do not have a primary care provider (PCP), while others do have a PCP bu t come to the CCC due to accessibility and convenience. The clinic is open 361 days per year, including evening s, weekend s, and most holiday s. Patients present to this clinic for a variety of acute illnesses and for preventive care including physical exams and vaccinations. In the summer months, the HCPs may see as few as fifteen patients per day, and in INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 26 other seasons they may see more than forty patients per day. This QI project was implemented in the month of October during the busy influenza vaccination season. This setting was selected as it was the only C CC operated by the medical center , and a need for improving influenza immunization rates at this practice site was identified. Patient population. There is substantial evidence supporting a comparison of this practice site and patient population with those described in literature. A Cochrane Systematic Review found that several studies have demonstrated the positive impact that HCP education of patie nts has on vaccine acceptance regardless of practice site ( Jacobson Vann et al., 2018 ). Uscher -Pines et al. (2012) analyzed over 8.9 million CCC visits in a three year period to conclude the substantial significance of missed opportunities to immunize and potential to improve vaccination rates in CCCs . Several other studies also demonstrate the benefit of practice changes in primary or convenient care settings to improve immunization rates (Nowalk et al., 2014; Pennant et al., 2015; Pierson et al. , 2015). Patients that present to this CCC are varied in their circumstances and backgrounds, however the majority share a preference for quick, convenient care. They value high quality medical care and present because they value their health and want to feel bette r. Most have respect for the HCP s seeing them in the CCC, and value their management advice and expertise. Procedure. The Chair of the department that oversees the CCC approved the implementation of this QI project for all patients presenting to the CCC . The office manager, lead clinician, Ambulatory Advanced Practice Manager, and Manager of Advanced Practice at the medical center were all aware of and supportive of this project. Additionally, sufficient influenza vaccine supply and administration material s (needles, syringes, alcohol pads, and band - aids) to support this intervention were ordered and stocked . INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 27 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program . The intervention utilize d an EBP toolkit called the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program as a model for implementation. Approval from 4 Pillars to reference and utilize their work as an intervention framework was established. As previously explain ed, the 4 Pillars Immunization Toolkit Materials are an evidenc e-based educational and support program developed by the University of Pittsburgh and funded by the CDC to increase immunization rates (4 Pillars , 2017) . This toolkit has been shown to be an effective, influential tool in improving immunization rates in o utpatient settings (Nowalk et al., 2014). There are three sections to the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program. The first section encourages understanding the practice site's current vaccination rates to aid with planning and goal setting (4 Pillars , 2017). This can be evaluated through internal review of historical data to better identify the current problem, which is also a key component to Rosswurm and Larrabee's Model for Evidence -Based Practice Change (1999). The second section includes selecti on and implementation of evidence -based strategies from each of the four pillars of the program. It is recommended to select at least one evidence -based strategy from each of the 4 Pillar strategies. These pillars include convenience and easy access, pati ent communication, enhanced vaccination systems, and motivation (4 Pillars, 2017). Similar to the 4 Pillar evidence -based strategies, the Model for Evidence -Based Practice Change emphasizes the utilization of evidence -based strategies to guide the QI int ervention ( Rosswurm & Larrabee, 1999). The final section of the program emphasizes evaluation of improvement, which allows for assessment of progress with the intervention (4 Pillars, 2017). First, careful consideration was given to both internal and external data to establish support of the QI intervention. The intervention design at the CCC was then based on each of the INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 28 four pillars. The first pillar, convenience and easy access , emphasizes the use of all encounters as opportunities to vaccinate (4 Pillars, 2017). HCPs at th e CCC receive d education at the CE course about common missed opportunities and false contraindications to influenza vaccination, with an emphasis on mild acute illness. In addition to information regar ding missed opportunities to vaccinate, the presentation provide d HCPs with discussion prompts that encourage d patients to be vaccinated based on common reasons for vaccine refusal . HCPs at this CCC w ere encouraged to recommend influenza vaccination at acu te illness encounters to combat this frequent missed opportunity. When recommendation was not enough, implementation of CDC's SHARE mnemonic (Share, Highlight, Address, Remind, Explain) (2018) was taught during the CE to HCPs so that patients could make in formed decisions about vaccination. The second pillar stresses patient communication strategies, where HCPs are urged to discuss vaccine -preventable diseases at the beginning of every visit (4 Pillars, 2017). This w as very important to this QI intervention, as HCPs w ere encouraged to educate about the serious nature of influenza and the value of immunization at visit onset with all vaccine eligible patients. Posters, handouts, and website postings also promote immunization (4 Pillars, 2017), therefore a laminated handout from the 4 Pillars toolkit was placed in the examination rooms at the CCC to educate patients and encourage influenza vaccination . MAs were instructed to encourage patients to review the handout while wait ing in the examination room to see the HCP. The third pillar, enhanced vaccination systems, involves a systematic process of assessing immunization status immediately after vital signs and ensuring sufficient vaccine supply for new demands (4 Pillars, 201 7). MAs routinely initiated the order for the influenza vaccine for all patients to serve as a reminder to HCPs at the CCC. HCPs w ere then encouraged to ask about influenza vaccine status immediately after reviewing vital signs and before reviewing other INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 29 medical history. HCPs notif ied MAs of patient acceptance of influenza vaccination by signing the order and placing an electronic \"red dot\" next to the patient's name on the schedule. The MA could either immunize the patient in the exam ination room or move the individual to the conference room in the same hallway to vaccinate when the clinic was busy. This ensure d efficiency in maintaining clinic flow. In addition, a red laminated reminder that said \"influenza vaccine\" was temporarily secured o n an upper corner of each of the CCC's computer screen s to serve as another reminder of the new process. Advanced planning with the supply coordinator for the CCC ensure d sufficient vaccine and administration supplies for the intervention. The fourth pill ar emphasizes motivational strategies including HCPs receiving ongoing feedback about their progress in vaccinating patients (4 Pillars, 2017). Throughout the intervention, quick daily to more thorough weekly check -ins to encourage and motivate clinic staff support ed pillar four. There was also a fun challenge among HCPs for the most vaccines administered during the intervention period . To address the final section of the program, evaluation of improvement, HCPs w ere asked to record reasons that patients c ontinued to decline vaccination and reasons that vaccination was not offered. This was done by marking tallies on a document that was placed on a clipboard next to the computer in each exam room. Potential options that could be marked for reasons patients declined vaccination include d fear of side effects, belief that the influenza vaccine does not work, and desire to wait until feeling better. Reasons for not offering a vaccine include d patient already vaccinated, time constraint, and moderate to severe illness (HCP discretion). This data can be used to inform future interventions at this CCC to further impact influenza vaccination rates. Additionally, data analysis provide d an understan ding of the intervention's impact on influenza vaccin ation rates. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 30 Outcome measurement. Demonstrating that the intervention improved patient outcomes was imperative to sustained support of the practice change (Brewer & Wojner Alexandrov, 2015). The primary outcomes that w ere measured in this project consider ed the number of patients that present ed to the CCC for an acute illness that also receive d an influenza vaccination during that same encounter compared to the total number of patients that present ed for acute illness management. This counted the number of patients who presented to the CCC for a concern such as a n upper respiratory infection or a rash, who also received a n influenza vaccination at that time. Data report ed included age and gender of patients to assess for trends in those who did and did not get vaccinated against influenza. Data was also report ed for the number of influenza vaccines ordered per HCP as part of the motivational challenge. As previously explained, a n additional outcome measure evaluate d reasons patients declined vaccination after receiving education and reasons that HCP s did not offer the vaccine. HCP s mark ed a tally next to a common reason that was given . This data could then be used to inform future interventions at the CCC, thereby improving vaccination rates and patient health. The safety of the human subjects in this QI project was protected as the intervention was based on EBP that has been shown to be safe and effective. There was no research conducted, and all data that was collected for analysis w as free of patient identifiers. Instruments to measure outcomes . Data collection for this QI project w as retrospective as it retriev ed data stored by the medical center' s Info rmation Warehouse . Data w as collected from October 11 through October 20 and October 24 through October 29, 2017 (retrospective) and the same dates in October 2018 (prospective) . This is the height of influenza vaccination season a nd allow ed for comparison of data from the 2017 season to the time of the 2018 QI intervention. Data w as stratified by the total number of patients seen each day for an acute illness INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 31 during the time interval in October . This was found by identifying patients that re ceived a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code of 99203, 99213, 99204 , or 99214, as these signified patients being treated for a medical condition. This group of patients was then analyzed for whether an influenza vaccine was ordered at that encounter. It did not include patients that presented solely for an influenza vaccination or patients that sought preventive care such as a physical exam . Age and gender of patients vaccinated against influenza at an acute illness encounter and the number of influen za vaccines ordered per HCP was collected. HCP s recorded reasons that influenza vaccination w as not offered, and reasons patients declin ed immunization. Data collection. Data w as collected for the period of October 11 through October 20 and October 24 through October 29 of both 2017 and 2018. This include d ten days of data collection, a three day intermission, followed by six additional days of data collection. This three day intermission exist ed to limit any contamination of data that could have occur red due to this Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student working at the clinic on October 21, 2017 through October 23, 2017. This DNP student did not work at the CCC for the duration of the intervention period in 2018. A report was generated in Excel for both the October 2017 and 2018 data, and the report for both of these time periods was produced by the same person working in the medical center's IT Department . Having one person generate all historical data made it possible to eliminate the concern for inter-rater reliability. A statistician from O hio State University 's College of Nursing then assisted in analyzing these reports. This DNP student collect ed and analyzed the tallied reports of reasons the influenza vaccine w as not offered and reasons it wa s declined . There were two sheets per clinical day (one from each exam ination room) . There were six general options to select for reasons the vaccine was not offered and eight general options to select for reasons INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 32 patients decline d vaccination (see Appendix E) . These results were entered into an Excel spreadsheet on a secured personal laptop that require d a password for entry. There was no identifiable patient information stored on this computer. There was also double entry of data by this DNP student to ensure no mistakes in transcription. An anticipated barrier in data collection was that the Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) does not ask HCPs to indicate when immunizations are offered. There was no baseline data for how often vaccines were off ered but rather when they were administered. The data from the EMR did not account for patients who declin ed vaccination because they were already immunized in outside facilities , however this w as tallied by HCPs during the intervention. There were also likely inaccuracies of record -keeping on the paper forms, as HCPs may have forgotten to mark tallies. In addition, it was difficult to account for patients that presented for care more than once during the data collection period . Institutional Review Boa rd (IRB) approval was not necessary for this project, as verified through the Human Subjects Research Assessment Form . The intervention was a QI project for the CCC and was not intended to contribute to generalizable knowledge . The medical center's policy requires a Data Quality Release Form to be completed . The QI project was presented to a Feasibility Review Committee for approval. In addition, t he Chief Safety Officer approved the proposal prior to project implementation. This allow ed for access to the E MR system. The Feasibility Review Committee also assist ed in acquisition of necessary data for the project. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 33 Section Four: Findings Results/Outcomes On the dates specified for data collection, October 11 through October 20 and October 24 through October 29, 142 patients in 2017 (retrospective group) and 294 patients in 2018 (prospective group) were identified as presenting to the CCC for mild acute ill ness management. Patients with recorded influenza vaccinations in the EMR system within the past 90 days were eliminated as these patients were not eligible for an influenza vaccination at their visit. Demographics. There was a total of 351 patients included in the results. Based on EMR data demonstrating prior vaccination against influenza in the past 90 days, 24 patients were eliminated from the 2017 total and 61 patients were eliminated from the 2018 total. Results are subsequently based on a sample of 118 patients in 2017 and 233 patients in 2018 (see Table 1). Table 1 Number of patients per year and influenza vaccination status Year Vaccine in past 90 days: No Vaccine in past 90 days: Yes Total patients presentin g to CCC for acute illness needs 2017 118 (83.1%) 24 (16.9%) 142 2018 233 (79.25%) 61 (20.75%) 294 Total 351 85 436 Influenza vaccination administered at visit. In the 2017 retrospective group, three of the 118 likely eligible patients were vaccinated against influenza during their encounter at the CCC. The proportion of patients presenting for acute illness management that received an influenza vaccine in 2017 was 2.5%. In the prospective group in 20 18, 79 of the 233 likely eligible patients were vaccinated against influenza at their visit. The proportion of patients INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 34 presenting for acute illness management that received an influenza vaccine in 201 8 was 33.9%. A Pearson chi square statistical test of w hether the rate of vaccinations differed between 2017 and 2018 was statistically significant and there is evidence of a rate increase ( see Table 2) . There was an estimated 31.4% increase in vaccinating patients against influenza when presenting for acute i llness management from the 2017 to the 2018 influenza season (see Figure 4).

Data was collected for both 2017 (see Table 3) and 2018 (see Table 4) for vaccination rate as a function of patient age and patient gender. Data was not statistically significant to demonstrate an association between patient age or gender and rates of infl uenza vaccination.

Note. The p value is from an exact Pearson chi square test of a relationship between a background variable and vaccine status. Data was analyzed for changes in practice for HCPs from 2017 to 2018. There were four HCPs that worked at the CCC during the evaluated time period in both 2017 and 2018. A statistically significant improvement in vaccination rates was noted in HCP 1, HCP 2 and HCP 3 (see Table 5). Overall , all four HCPs made clinically significant improvement s in vaccination rates in 2018 (see Figure 5). There were three additional HCPs at the clinic in 2018 that received the CE course and implemented the practice change, and their proportions of vaccinati ng patients against influenza were 42.9%, 33.3%, and 37.5%. Data was used from the prospective analysis to announce the HCP who ordered the most influenza vaccinations in 2018 to support Pillar 4.

Proportion of patients vaccinated/not vaccinated per HCP in 2017 compared to 3 HCP 4INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 38 Reasons patients not vaccinated. In the paper documentation completed by the HCPs for reasons vaccination did not occur, the patient already receiving the influenza vaccine was the most frequent reason cited for not vaccinating. As these patients were not eligible for the intervention, th ey were not included in the analysis with the other cited reasons. \"Personal choice\" was the most frequently cited reason that HCPs reported for patients declining vaccination. This occurred for an estimated 23% of patients that were likely eligible and no t vaccinated . Other frequently cited reasons included patients wanting to delay vaccination to another day or that they had plans to get the vaccine elsewhere such as with their PCP or at work. HCPs did not offer the influenza vaccine due to the patient's physical illness only an estimated 6% of the time (see Figure 6). Figure 6. Reasons tracked by HCPs through tallies that influenza vaccination Administered Patient personal choice Patient wants to delay Plan to get vaccine elsewhere Patient concern for side effects HCP forgot to offer Time constraint Moderate/severe illness (HCP discretion) Patient believes it is ineffective Patient fear of needles CostINFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 39 Discussion The purpose of thi s project was to impact influenza immunization rates at this CCC through the implementation of an evidence -based practice change. The project focused on assisting HCPs to implement a multi -modal practice change that encouraged patients to be immunized agai nst influenza at all opportunities. After addressing common barriers to influenza vaccination at a CE session, a streamlined process for offering and administering this vaccine was implemented at the CCC. A statistically significant increase in influenza vaccination rates occurred when comparing the 2017 retrospective data to the 2018 prospective data, with an estimated 31.4% improvement in immunizi ng eligible patients against influenza. With this information, it was assumed that the 4 Pillars Practice Tr ansformation Program was beneficial to utilize as a model for project implementation . The CDC estimates that the influenza vaccine reduces influenza illness between 40 and 60 percent in years when the virus is well -matched to the vaccine (CDC, 2018). Pre liminary reports estimate 47% effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in the 2018 -2019 season ( Doyle et al., 2019). The CCC gave 79 influenza vaccines during the evaluated time interval in October 2018. If 47% of those patients did not experience influenza as a result of being vaccinated, the CCC may have prevented approximately 37 cases of influenza by vaccinat ing patients during this time interval. With the significant impacts to health and cost s incurred from influenza, preventing cases of influenza can have major implications on patient outcomes and health care spending. Developing an understanding of the d emographics of patients most likely to accept or decline vaccination could be very beneficial to informing future interventions. However, there INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 40 were no noted trends of statistical significance for patient age or gender. There was , however, a statistically significant improvement in vaccination rates for most of the HCPs when comparing 2017 to 2018. HCP 1 vaccinated zero patients presenting for acute illness needs in 2017 but vaccinated 40.8% of patients in 2018 (p=0.008) . HCP 2 vaccinated 1.5% of patients i n 2017 and 35.7% of patients in 2018 (p<0.001), while HCP 3 increased vaccination rates from 8.7% to 32.6% (p=0.0375). Though not statistically significant, HCP 4 improved from vaccinating zero patients in 2017 at acute illness encounters to 23.6% in 2018 (p=0.1912) . Three additional HCPs worked at the CCC on the specified dates in 2018 and received the CE course , and their rates of vaccinating patients ranged from 33.3% to 42.9%. This data served not only to demonstrate the benefits of the QI project in improving influenza vaccination rates, but also allowed the HCPs to be acknowledged for their hard work. Sharin g these findings with the HCPs supported the fourth pillar by motivating and challenging them to improve vaccination rates among their patients (4 Pillars, 2017). This QI project also focused on addressing common barriers to influenza vaccination and understanding potential missed opportunities that could result in serious health consequences. For patients that had not yet been vaccinated against influenza on the day of their encounter, HCPs cited \"personal choice\" as the most frequent re ason that patien ts declined vaccination. HCPs wrote comments such as \"does not want,\" \" not interested ,\" and \"mother says no\" as feedback that they received from patients. 17% of likely eligible patients that declined vaccination wish ed to delay to another day. HCP comment s explain reasons provided by patients such as recently received a different vaccine, weight lifting that afternoon, and \"having too many other problems right now to be worried about a flu shot.\" Other notable reasons for declining include 10% of patients explaining that the vaccine made them sick and 15% of patients INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 41 choosing to have the vaccine later at their PCP office or at work. HCPs admitted to forgetting to offer the vaccine 8% of the time and not offering the vaccine due to patient's current medical state only 6% of the time. These findings may be very beneficial in planning future educational efforts to improve influenza vaccination rates at this CCC. Limitations One limitation of this QI project was the limited period of time evaluated. To minimize bias in the findings, it was important to exclude dates when this DNP student was working at the CCC. In October 2017, there were 10 consecutive dates and 6 consecutive dates where this student did not work at the CCC. This student did not work on these s ame dates in 2018, however this DNP student working at the CCC decreased the volume of dates that could be evaluated. The CCC moved in November 2017 to a new building across the parking lot. In the 2017 intervention period, the CCC was located inside of a grocery store. In the 2018 intervention period , the CCC had moved to its current location in a large medical building. This has increased patient volume into the clinic as well as the number of HCPs working at the clinic. Though it is still a CCC with sev eral of the same HCPs and the same clinic name, the new location and subsequent higher patient volume was beyond the control of this DNP student. Additionally, there was no place in the EMR to evaluate whether an influenza vaccination had been offered but declined . Data could only be extracted for when an influenza vaccination was ordered and administered. There was also no way to evaluate within the EMR whether a patient had already received their influenza vaccination from an outside healthcare facility . This data would have been helpful in further understanding the impact of the QI project. Though INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 42 seldom occurring, there was no way to evaluate whether a patient was seen twice during the evaluation period. Some of the staff at the CCC expressed concerns for increased workload and time involvement when all patients were offered an influenza vaccine. Several of the MAs did not attend the CE sessions, so individualized education occurred to prepare them for the project. Some HCPs initially expressed confusi on with the forms in the exam ination rooms for documenting reasons the influenza vaccination was declined or not offered, but that confusion was quickly resolved after their initial shifts during the implementation period. Frequent check - ins and developing routines for this new clinic process facilitated implementation and staff acceptance. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 43 Section Five: Recommendations for Practice Project Summary This QI project evaluated the impact of an EBP intervention that changed influenza immunization practices at a CCC operated by a large medical center in the Midwest . ACIP recommends influenza vaccination as a primary prevention measure against infection (Grohskopf et al., 2017) . Every primary ca re encounter presents an opportunity for preventive care and HCPs at CCCs are generally not actively encouraging vaccinations in patients presenting for acute illness management (Uscher -Pines et al., 2012). Uscher -Pines et al. (2012) assessed that HCPs in CCCs can potentially increase vaccinations delivered if vaccination histories are reviewed and patients are counseled on the benefits of vaccination during acute illness encounters. A comprehensive literature review revealed that HCP s providing patient edu cation and encourag ing vaccination largely impact s immunization rates ( Jacobson Vann et al., 2018 ). The 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program served as a guide for project implementation. Data collection in October 2018 included the number of patients that presented for an acute illness compared to the number of patients that presented for an acute illness that were vaccinated for influenza at that encounter. This was compared to retrospective data from October 2017. HCPs tracked reasons the vaccine was not administered or offered. Results showed a n estimated 31.4% statistically significant improvement in influenza vaccination rates from 2017 to 2018 for patients presenting for acute illness management. A standardized process for offering influenza vaccination to all eligible patients and understanding the common missed opportunities and barriers to influenza vaccination may be beneficial in impr oving influenza vaccination rates. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 44 Implications for Practice DNP Essentials. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN ) developed the eight DNP Essentials for the curricular elements and competencies that are essential for all DNP graduates (AACN, 2006). It is imperative that DNP leaders are prepared to incorporate all eight of the Essentials into their daily practice when interacting with both colleagues and patients so that they can practice at the highest level to impact patient care deliv ery and outcomes. Essential I, Scientific Underpinnings for Practice. The first Essential emphasizes the ability of the DNP graduate to translate scientific knowledge in ways that benefit patients , and it includes the ability to incorporate theories into practice (AACN, 2006). It was essential to have a strong understanding of the influenza virus and the magnit ude of contracting this infection. Lewin's Change Model served as a theoretical framework for this project to plan and implement a streamlined and e ffective practice change among staff at the CCC that could be sustained with stakeholder support. Having a strong scientific foundation is key to addressing practice issues and was the basis for implementing this project. Essential II, Organization al and Systems Leadership for Quality Improvement and Systems Thinking. DNPs are prepared to serve as leaders in QI initiatives and process changes that impact patient outcomes in the health care system (AACN, 2006). Strong leadership skills were required to obtain buy -in from key stakeholders and to implement this QI project at the CCC, and will continue to be necessary to sustain this practice change. Essential III, Clinical Scholarship and Analytical Methods for Evidence -Based Practice. Critically apprais ing existing literature and implementing the best evidence into practice is a vital skill of the DNP (AACN, 2006) . Thi s QI project was developed based on Rosswurm and Larrabee's Model for Evidence Based Practice Change which included a INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 45 comprehensive literature search and critical appraisal of existing evidence. This DNP student also considered Melnyk's ARCC Model for potentially implementing this EBP change on a broader scale across the department. The best available evidence was utilize d to guide the QI project and to make recommendations for a practice change and dissemination of findings. Essential IV, Information Systems/Technology and Patient Care Technology for the Improvement and Transformation of Health Care. The DNP should be pr oficient in utilizing technology to analyze data and execute plans based on extracted data (AACN, 2006). Having a strong understanding of the elements that were measured and being able to analyze the gathered data was paramount to drawing conclusions and m aking future recommendations in this QI project. Essential V, Health Care Policy for Advocacy in Health Care. This essential emphasizes the importance of influencing health policy and advocating for the nursing profession. The DNP should demonstrate leadership in policy at the institutional, local, state, national, and international levels (AACN, 2006). As there w as no standard of practice for offering influenza vaccinations at the CCC, this project sought to standardize this process to improve the quality of care provided to patients. In the future it may be beneficial to develop a clinical practice guideline rela ted to this practice within the institution. Essential VI, Interprofessional Collaboration for Improving Patient and Population Health Outcomes. Establishing and leading interprofessional teams is key to creating positive change in the health care arena ( AACN, 2006). In the QI project, this DNP student collaborated among various professions and in cluded important stakeholders to successfully implement the intervention. Incorporating team members with various strengths and backgrounds is important in collab orating to improve patient and population health outcomes. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 46 Essential VII, Clinical Prevention and Population Health for Improving the Nation's Health . This essential addresses health promotion and disease prevention efforts while also increasing access an d decreasing gaps in care (AACN, 2006). This QI project was focused on a gap in care and improving access to the influenza vaccine for patients presenting to the CCC. Many patients at the CCC d o not have a PCP and may not otherwise have been educated about getting an influenza vaccine. The primary prevention measuring of vaccinating patients is vital to improving the health of the population. Essential VIII, Advanced Nursing Practice. DNP graduates are specialized in an area of practice with in the nursing domain ; they demonstrate advanced levels of clinical judgment and the ability to evaluate EBP to improve the care provided to patients (AACN, 2006). Based on years of service as a family nurse practitioner in the CCC setting, this DNP studen t was able to identify a clinical practice problem and evaluate best practice patterns to make recommendations for a practice change. Recommendations. It is recommended that this influenza vaccination process continue and become standardized at this CCC a nnually from September through April (or while influenza remains active in the community) . The strategic plan at this large medical center emphasizes the importance of innovation in healthcare delivery models as well as improving the health and wellness of the community, and this project aligns precisely with these strategies. In the future, HCPs at the CCC should consider several of the reasons that patients declined vaccination in the 2018 season to expand their educational efforts with patients. It is ke y to understand the common missed opportunities and barriers to influenza vaccination so that this may be used to inform future interventions. It is important to obtain feedback from clinic staff for ways to further improve flow and implementation of this practice INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 47 chance for future influenza seasons so that any additional barriers can be understood and overcome. It is also recommended that this p rocess be expanded to the two new CCCs within the medical center. Developing a clinical practice guideline within the organization would facilitate the standardization of this practice change. There is the opportunity for any CCC not routinely offering the influenza vaccination to adopt this practice to improve influenza vaccination rates. Additionally, developing a prompt in the EMR that requires HCPs to ask every patient about the influenza vaccine in this setting would further facilitate this practice ch ange. Methods for Dissemination The primary goal of disseminating evidence is to transfer research findings into clinical practice and patient care (Majid et al., 2011). The information gathered in this QI project will be disseminated in several ways. Results of this project were shared internally at both an office meeting with all sta ff from the clinic as well as at the quarterly advanced practice provider meeting. The project was announced in a newsletter for employees in the building where the CCC is located. This student submitted an abstract for a poster presentation at the medical center's annual Advanced Practice Provider Conference in 2019. In addition to disseminating the findings of this QI project internally within the organization , the results will also be shared in external forums. This student's abstract was selected for a poster competition and presentation at the Midwest Nursing Research Society's Annual Conference in Kansas City , Missouri in March 2019. Submission for publication in a peer-reviewed journal such as WorldViews on Evidence Based Nursing or Journal of Docto ral Nursing Practice is planned in 2019. Additionally, this student plans to submit an abstract to present a podium presentation at a local or national conference in 2020. INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION PROJECT 48 References 4 Pillars. (201 9).
