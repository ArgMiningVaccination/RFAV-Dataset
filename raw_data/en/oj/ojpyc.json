These activities may help promote a less sedentary lifestyle and may have positive effects on health. The objective of the present study is to understand the prevalence and trends of MBP in US adults and the factors associated with their use in a population-based adult lifespan sample.Methods: We used data from three waves of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey (1995, 2005, and 2015), a population-based longitudinal study of community-dwelling adults. Only data from participants withvalid observations across three waves (N = 2262) aged 24-74 years at baseline (M = 46;SD= 11) were used. We examined the prevalence of MBP, longitudinal patterns, and correlates of MBP use over 20 years. Results: Rates of MBP use were relatively stable over time in this sample, with 20%, 17%, and 18% of partici- pants using MBP at wave 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A number of sociodemographic and health variables were independently related to frequency of MBP use over 20 years: Women, participants with higher levels of edu-cation, never married participants, and participants who suffered from multiple chronic health conditions were more likely to use MBP. Discussion: Our findings suggest that MBP may provide an opportunity for physical activity for individuals suffering from chronic health conditions. More research is needed to understand whether this, in turn, results in better health outcomes for these individuals. 1. Introduction A major public health challenge has been the disconnect between the strong scientific evidence base for the importance of physical ac- tivities and the persistently low levels of their practice, and con- comitantly high levels of chronic disease burden among the US popu- lation. Physical activity is associated with reduced risks of morbiditiesand mortality. 1,2It is well-established that a sedentary lifestyle is among the major causes of metabolic diseases, hypertension, and car-diovascular diseases. 3,4Recent data suggests that 6 in every 10 adults in the US have a chronic disease, and 4 in every 10 US adults have two ormore. 5Currently, only a small proportion of US adults meet the De- partment of Health and Human Services guidelines for physical activity,with decreasing adherence as age increases. For example, in 2017, only 24% of all US adults met aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening guidelines, 6while only 16% of those aged 65-74 years and 9% of adults aged 75+ years met the physical activity guidelines. Given this challenge, mind-body practice (MBP) may offer a broader array of health-promoting physical activity options for the adult po-pulation. MBP may complement and supplement the traditional phy- sical activities due to high adaptability to individual capabilities,relatively low cost, and their potential for integrative benefits to mul- tiple physiological systems and mental processes. MBP may be defined as \"...techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms''. 7Despite relatively low practice rates, MBP (such as yoga, tai-chi, or pilates) have gained in popularity in the United States in recent decades.8All these activities consist of both exercise and meditative components; thus, they may promote positive interactions between various physiological and mental functions.9,10 Yoga is an ancient Indian technique of mind-body interrelated practicethat consists of physical movement (asanas), breathing exercises (pra- nayama), and meditation (dhyana), and has been shown to have a positive impact on health status. 11-14Tai-chi is a traditional Chinese introspective practice that consists of balance exercises and movementsequences combined with concentration and relaxation techniques. 15,16 Pilates is a physical exercise which consists of low-impact flexibility andmuscular strength and endurance movements. 17,18The use of these complementary health practices may be an accessible and cost-effectivesolution to increase physical activity in order to improve health. Improvements in physical and mental health have also been ob- served in previous intervention studies that focused on MBP. 13,19-22 Because of cultural predisposition, to date, most of the studies on MBPs https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2020.102501 Received 21 May 2020; Received in revised form 10 June 2020; Accepted 1 July 2020Corresponding author at: School of Aging Studies, 4202 E Tampa, FL 33620, USA.

Twere performed among Eastern populations.13However, MBP may be equally effective in Western cultures. To date, little population-based data are available on how US adults engage in MBP and factors asso- ciated with this practice. Despite the volume of recent scientific evidence,10,23it remains unclear the primary facilitators and barriers in the use of MBPs for health promotion. The goal of the present study is to examine, for the first time, the long-term trend in the use of MBPs spanning three dec- ades (1990s-2010s), including different practices such as yoga, tai-chi, or pilates, which share similar exercise and meditative components. Previous studies primarily examined the use of MBPs for medical pur- poses. Second, in addition to studying MBP at a given time point, we also examine the correlates of persistent MBP over 20 years. Third, the inclusion of a wide range of health measures, including various health conditions, functional status, health behaviors, and self-rated physical and mental health enables us to examine important questions regarding the differences in health status between users and non-users using the unique and rich dataset of the longitudinal Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study to address the following research questions: (1) How prevalent is MBP among United States adults from the 1990s to 2010s? (2) What are the key individual factors related to long-term engagement in MBP? 2. Method 2.1. Participantsandprocedure We used longitudinal data from the MIDUS study obtained from a national sample of US adults. The first longitudinal wave (MIDUS 1) was conducted with 7108 participants in 1995-1996 through random digit dialing of US households in the 48 contiguous states.24In MIDUS 1, participants' age ranged from 24 to 75 years (M = 46, SD = 13).25 Longitudinal follow-ups of the original MIDUS study were conducted in 2004-2006 (MIDUS 2) and 2013-2015 (MIDUS 3), respectively. MIDUS 2 was conducted with 4963 participants (75% of the original re- spondents in MIDUS 1), while MIDUS 3 was conducted with 3294 participants (including 77% of MIDUS 2 participants).26All data were collected directly from respondents. For the current analyses, we used data from participants who had valid information on all study variables at all 3 waves. This resulted in asample of 2262 participants. We did not seek IRB approval for the current study because analyses are based on data that are publicly available through the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). 2.2. Measuresandprocedure 2.2.1. Dependentvariable The dependent variable is MBP use. Participants were asked the following question: \"In the past 12 months, either to treat a physical health problem, to treat an emotional or personal problem, to maintain or enhance your wellness, or to prevent the onset of illness, how often did you use - exercise or movement therapy (yoga, pilates, tai chi, etc.)?\" Participants rated their practice status on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (\"performing a lot\") to 5 (\"never\"). To quantify the prevalence of MBP, this variable was transformed into a binary variable with 1 indicating engagement in MBP (\"a lot,\" \"often,\" (\"never\"). 2.2.2. Independentvariable.Healthandfunctionalstatus Participants rated their current physical and mental health on a five- point scale from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Because few participants endorsed the categories fair and poor, we grouped these variables into four categories: excellent, very good, good, and fair/poor. Participants were asked whether they had functional limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL).Responses indicating any limitations (\"a little\" to \"a lot\") were coded as1, responses indicating no limitation were recoded 0. The scores for ADL and IADL limitations indicated the sum of limitations reported by each participant. Participants were asked whether they engaged in vigorous and moderate physical activities with the questions \"How often do you engage in vigorous physical activity that causes your heart to beat so rapidly that you can feel it in your chest and you perform the activity long enough to work up a good sweat and to breath heavily?\" and \"How often do you engage in moderate physical activity, that is not physically exhausting, but it causes your heart rate to increase slightly and you typically work up a sweat?\", respectively. Participants rated their answers on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (\"several times a week or more\") to 6 (\"never\"). We coded the responses as 1 (doing physical activities regularly, i.e., \"several times a week or more\") or 0 (not doing physical activities regularly, i.e., either in lesser frequencies or \"never\"), for both summer and winter. Finally, we created a binary variable, each indicating whether participants engaged in physical activity regularly in any season (coded as 1) or not (coded as 0) separately for vigorous and moderate physical activity, respectively. Other health variables included body mass index (BMI; 1 = underweight [<18.5], 2 = normal [18.524.9], 3 = overweight [>24.9-29.9], and 4 = obese [>29.9]), using tobacco (1 = current smoker, or 0 = not) or alcohol (1 = regular drinker, or 0 = not), and number of chronic health condi- tions (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more). Participants were asked whether they had (1= yes, 0 = no) recent history (within past 12 months) of blood pressure (BP), stroke, heart problems, diabetes/high blood sugar, cancer, aches/joint stiffness (last 30 days), and chronic sleep problems. Mental health was assessed with a single binary item, indicating whe- ther participants felt sad/depressed for more than two weeks (1 = yes, 0 = no) within the past 12 months. 2.3. Covariates 2.3.1. Demographics In our analyses, we used data on six core demographic variables including age group (<=34, 3544, 4554, 5564, 65), gender (0 = male, 1 = female), race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Other), marital status (1 = married, 2 = separated/divorced, 3 = widowed, 4 = never married), education (1 = no/some school, 2 = high school graduate/in college, 3 = graduated from college, 4 = having Master's/professional degree), and employment (1 = currently working, 2 = self-employed, 3 = retired, 4 = unemployed, 5 = other). 2.4. Statisticalanalysis Statistical analyses were conducted in 2715.1 (College Station, TX). Descriptive analyses indicated the prevalence of MBP and differences between participants who engaged in MBP vs. not. We then examined differences between participants who engaged in MBP in all waves vs. those who practiced to some extent or not at all using an ordinal logistic regression model. Persistent MBP was defined as the outcome variable indicating MBP frequency (0: never, 1: at one wave, 2: at two waves, 3: at all waves). This model only included predictor variables that showed significant group differences associated with MBP frequency. Because this study is based on a large national population-based sample, sta- tistical significance was evaluated at p<.01 (two-sided) for a more rigorous test. We also report odds ratios (OR) and 99% confidence in-tervals (CI). 3. Results Table 1 shows prevalence of MBP separately for all three time points, as well as frequencies of different longitudinal patterns with three waves of data. Among the participants, who took part in all three waves, in the first wave (1995), the prevalence of MBP was low, with 80% of participants reporting never having engaged in any MBP in theK.K.Bhattacharyya,etal. Complementary Thera pies in Medicine 52 (2020) 102501 2past 12 months. Only 20% of participants reported having engaged in MBP in varied intensity (from a lot or often to rarely). This rate was 17% in the second wave in 2004 and 18% in the third wave in 2013. Table 1 also shows the longitudinal patterns with three waves of data showing 62% never used MBP in any of the three waves, 26% used MBP in at least one wave, 9% used MBP in any two of the three waves, and only 4% participants used MBP in all the three waves. Table 2 presents differences between those who engaged in MBP at all waves vs. at some waves vs. at no waves. Women, more educated people, and those who were never married were more likely to engage in MBP throughout the study period. Participants who engaged in moderate and vigorous physical activity at baseline were more likely to engage in MBP in a persistent way at subsequent waves. Participants having functional health limitations with IADL reported higher rate of engagement with MBP. Participants experiencing a chronic sleep pro- blem at baseline, participants who felt sad/depressed for more than two weeks in the last 12 months at baseline, and participants experiencing more chronic conditions were more likely to engage in MBP persistently at subsequent waves. Table 3shows results from an ordinal logistic regression analysis with persistent MBP as the outcome. In this analysis, female gender (OR = 1.73, 99% CI = 1.37, 2.19), having higher education, i.e., Master's/ professional degree (OR = 1.91, 99% CI = 1.07, 3.40, reference: no/ some school), and being never married (OR = 1.85, 99% CI = 1.30, 2.63, reference: married) continued to be associated with persistent MBP. Participants suffering from two (OR = 1.52, 99% CI = 1.07, 2.14), four (OR = 1.74, 99% CI = 1.12, 2.71), and five or more (OR = 1.67, 99% CI = 1.11, 2.51) chronic diseases (reference: no chronic disease) were more likely to engage in MBP over 20 years persistently. 4. Discussion In the present study, we examined the prevalence, trend, and cor- relates of MBP use over a 20-year span in a population-based sample of US adults. This study measured MBP more broadly than previous stu- dies (which primarily focused on single MBPs) and incorporated a wide range of sociodemographic and health variables as predictors. Furthermore, our study adds to previous research by examining the correlates of persistent MBP over 20 years. Our first research question was related to the prevalence of MBP in US adults. In the present study, 20%, 17%, and 18% of participants reported having engaged in MBP in the past 12 months in the wave 1, 2, and 3 respectively. These numbers as well as longitudinal patterns of MBP use suggest that participants' MBP use was relatively stable over the 20-year period. Our estimate of MBP prevalence is in line with previous research by Wolsko and colleagues (2004). They reported that 19% of US adults in a population-based survey engaged in MBP, even though their study focused on mind-body therapies for medical pur- poses only. Several more recent studies also examined the prevalence of different MBPs in the US. Some studies reported increase in MBP useTable 1 Prevalence of mind-body practice: Frequencies and trends (n = 2262).

Complementary Thera pies in Medicine 52 (2020) 102501 3over time: Using cross-sectional data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),28,29found that lifetime and 12-month pre- valence of yoga practice among US adults (N = 34,525) were 13% and 9%, respectively. Another study found that the age-adjusted rate of yoga practice has increased from 9.5%-14.3% between 2012-2017 (4.1%-14.2% for meditation).30Wang et al.31found the participation rates of yoga, tai-chi, and qigong have increased from 5.8% (2002) to 14.5% (2017). All studies to date suggest that the rates for some MBPs continued to be low: Based on the 2002, 2007, and 2012 waves of the NHIS, participation rates for tai-chi were 1% at all three waves.8The finding that rates of MBP use are increasing in cross-sectional, but arestable in longitudinal analysis indicates that cohort differences might be at play. More recent generations of US adults may be more likely to engage in MBP, thus leading in increase in prevalence rates. However, looking at the same historical time, participants from earlier genera- tions did not increase in MBP use. While the increase in different MBPsis encouraging, there still remain great opportunities for growth, especially in older generations who may not be as familiar with MBP as more recent generations. Our second research question was related to correlates of persistent engagement in MBP. We focused on a broad range of sociodemographic and health factors, including health behaviors, functional health, self- rated mental and physical health, and number of chronic health con- ditions. In line with earlier research on yoga practice, 32,33women, more educated, and unmarried participants were more likely to engage inMBP over 20 years. Previous research on this topic found that people practiced yoga for specific health purposes, such as managing back pain (20%), stress (6%), and arthritis (6%). Analyzing data from a large sample of US adults in the 2002 wave of the NHIS (N = 31,044), Birdee and colleagues (2008) examined correlates of yoga practice for health. Participants who practiced yoga were more likely to be White, female, young, and college-educated. 34,35Also, participants who suffered from musculoskeletal conditions, mental health conditions, severe sprains,and asthma were more likely to practice yoga. 34These same health conditions were also related to the practice of tai-chi and qigong forhealth. 16However, participants with hypertension and chronic ob- structive lung disease were less likely to practice yoga.34In a survey of 4307 individuals randomly selected from yoga studios across the country, the majority of participants reported that yoga improved their happiness (87%), energy (85%), sleep (69%), social relationships (67%), and weight (57%).36In sum, people experiencing various health conditions reported practicing yoga and experienced that the practiceimproved some of their symptoms. Adding to this previous research, our findings showed that comorbidity, indicated by experiencing mul- tiple health conditions was related to a higher frequency of MBP use over 20 years independent of key sociodemographic characteristics. This finding suggests that those engaging in MBP might do so because they expect positive health benefits. Also, MBP may give individuals suffering from health conditions an opportunity to remain physically active. Taken together, our findings have several implications for the health promotion community. First, the finding that only a relatively small minority (17-20%) of participants have engaged in MBP suggests there may be a lack of knowledge and opportunities related to MBP, despite its increasing popularity in recent generations. Second, our finding that MBP is significantly associated with chronic health conditions suggests that it may be used by people with poor health who seek alternative therapies to alleviate their symptoms. These findings will help re- searchers, clinicians, payers, and policymakers design better strategies to promote their use in community and clinical populations in the US and beyond. The present study had several limitations. First, we did not have any information on why people engaged in MBP or if there was any subsidy for MBP through a health insurance product. For example, it is not clear whether it was a leisure activity or used for therapeutic purposes (e.g. the MBP was part of an intervention). Second, there was no information about how participants engaged in MBP, for example, whether they received instruction or practiced with others vs. on their own. Third, our measure of persistent engagement was based on three measure- ments over 20 years, because more frequent assessments were not available. Finally, we defined MBP based on the MIDUS question that used the terminology \"exercise or movement therapy\" that included yoga, tai-chi, pilates etc., which might create confusion among the re- spondents regarding the activities that would qualify as MBP. Despite these limitations, this is the first large population-based data on a re- presentative US sample with a follow-up over 20 years. 5. Conclusion In the present study, we examined the prevalence and correlates of MBP in a population-based sample of US adults over 20 years.

Women, more educated, and unmarried individuals were more likely to engage in MBP. Furthermore, the current findings suggest that MBP may provide an opportunity for physical activity for individuals suffering from chronic health conditions. More research is needed to understand whether the use of MBP is associated with better distal health outcomes for these individuals. Future research is also needed to determine whether MBP participation changes when costs are subsized by health promotion or health insurance programs.
