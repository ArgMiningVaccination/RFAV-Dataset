Vaccines are a safe way of teaching your immune system to recognise and mount an attack against a potential threat without the pressure of having the actual illness. If you have the vaccine and come into contact with the live virus later on, you will already have the antibodies needed to fight it off. Some vaccines, like the one made by Pfizer, use a technology called mRNA or messenger molecules. These carry a small part of the genetic instructions from the coronavirus (not the whole virus) into your body. This teaches your body to make the protein spikes found on the outside of the Covid virus molecules (again not the whole virus), so that the body can learn to recognise these spikes and make antibodies to mount an attack against them. The messenger instructions cannot be combined with your DNA and are destroyed by the body soon after they are used. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a weakened version of the common cold virus, an adenovirus from chimpanzees, to carry a small part of the genetic instructions from the coronavirus (not the whole virus) into your body. This teaches your body to make the protein spikes found on the outside of the Covid virus molecules (again not the whole virus) so that the body can learn to recognise these spikes and make antibodies to mount an attack against them.
