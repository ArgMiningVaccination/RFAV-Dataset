The GEC is working with two other universities, a rural hospital, a hospital system, two public community health centers, a senior center and a health non-profit to join in an ambitious plan that addresses the significant shortage in underserved urban and rural areas of health care professionals who know how to care for older adults. The project will involve professionals and students in geriatric medicine, geriatric psychiatry, nursing, social work, physical therapy, oc - cupational therapy and interpro - fessional education. \"Providing the care our older adults deserve is a huge challenge that requires the commitment of many different professionals from many institutions,\" said John Morley, M.B., B.Ch., Chair, Division of Geriatric Medicine at Saint Louis University and Marla Berg-Weger Ph.D, LCSW, and Executive Director of the Gate - way GEC, who is the project's Co-Director. \"As our state has significant shortages of primary care health professionals and rapidly increas - ing numbers of older adults, we 2 Aging Successfully , V ol.

Little Dr. Frederick Yap Dr. Gerald Mahon Best Doctors 2015 2 Aging Successfully , V XXV , No. 1 3 EDITORIAL John E. Morley, MB, BChIn 1996 , there were 8,424 geriatricians in the United States, whereas today , there are fewer than 7,500 . In 2000, there were 4.7 geriatricians for every 10,000 persons in the U.S. who were 75 years and over. This number is expected to shrink to 1.5 per 10,000 by 2050. Clearly, this is a catastrophe of gigantic proportions for the future of our aging population . WHERE HA VE ALL THE GERIATRICIANS GONE? There is no question that geriatricians are key to assess - ing, diagnosing, and treating the more difficult to manage conditions experienced by older adults. Geriatricians also teach medical students, residents and practicing phy - sicians how to care for older patients and strategies for or - ganizing health care systems that are focused on seniors. Those members of the baby boom generation are rightly going to expect higher quality care than has been given in the past to older persons. The reasons for the dearth of geriatricians are multifacto - rial. First, geriatricians earn approximately half the sal - ary of other specialist physi -cians\u2014$184,000/year compared to $498,127 for a ra - diologist. Secondly, geriatricians are af - forded less respect by their colleagues who believe that anyone can provide medical care for old - er persons. My col - league, Dr. An gela Sanford, reflects on this issue in her poignant \"Pep Talk for Geriatricians\" ( see p. 15). Finally, many graduating medical schools do not view geriatric care as being as excit - ing as other areas of medicine. It is time that all of us who care about the future of ag - ing baby boomers to begin to agitate the system to make the geri - atric specialization a more desirable career option for future generations of physicians. In part, this effort will require that we demand better pay for geriatricians, but it will also re - quire a major pub - lic education campaign with our general society as well as the physician and health care commu - nities regarding the key role that geriatricians play in the role of the older adults.EDITORIAL4 Aging Successfully , V aging@slu.edu Questions?

I'm energized that so many organizations and people are joining SLU in bring - ing life to a plan that will improve the quality of life for aging Missourians,\" said Morley, who also is a SLUCare Physician Group geriatrician. Leading a Team Collaborative partners include A. T. Still Univer - sity Osteopathic Medi - cal School/Missouri Area Health Education Centers in Kirksville and Perry County Memorial Hospital. University and community partners are Washington University in St. Louis, SSM Health, Myrtle Hilliard Davis and John C. Murphy Health Centers, Northside Youth and Senior Services and the St. Louis Alzheim - er's Asso ciation. The grant to SLU is funded through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the main federal agency in the De - partment of Health and Human Ser - vices charged with improving health care for those who are uninsured, isolat ed, or medically vulnerable. Slightly more than a quar - ter of the institutions that submitted applications for federal funding received it. The project is one of 44 Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Programs in the U.S. and one of two in HRSA region VII, which includes Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska. The initiative targets underserved areas: urban north St. Louis city and county and rural Perry County and an eight county region in northeast Missouri, where the impact of the shortage of health care providers who understand the special needs of geri - atric patients is amplified. Graying of Missouri Older adults comprise a larger proportion of Missouri's population than in the greater United States. In 2011, 14.2 percent of Missourians were older adults, compared to 13 percent of U.S. residents. By 2030, the percentage of older Missourians is expected to increase to 21 percent, compared to 19 percent in the U.S. \"To keep pace with the growth of the older adult population who often have multiple health problems and complex conditions that require more medical care, the number of primary care providers needs to increase by 34 percent,\" said Marla Berg-Weger, Ph.D., LCSW, profes - sor of social work at SLU and co-project director. \"With 40 percent of the state's population living in rural areas and only 25 percent of physicians prac - ticing in these areas, the need for a well-trained geri - atric workforce is at a crisis point.\" Further, because the number of geriatric practi - tioners is insufficient to care for our growing number of older adults, developing ge - riatric evaluation teams is essential for the health and quality of life of our aging population. Tackling from Many Angles The project, which is called the Gateway Geri - atric Education Center Workforce Enhancement Program, attacks the problem on multiple fronts by: Educating 1,100 health care students and providers on a team-approach that brings together professionals from multiple health disciplines to best care for older adults Health professions students and those who provide care at the senior center, health centers and rural phy - sician practices will be trained to work in interprofessional teams as they conduct physical and cognitive screenings, assessments, and pro - vide interventions. Students and care providers will learn to use screen - ing tools, including many created at Saint Louis University, to detect cognitive impairment, frailty and caregiver well-being. They also will learn to deliver cognitive stimulation therapy, which is a non-pharmaceu - tical intervention for persons with de - mentia that stimulates socialization, Transforming Geriatric Care 4 Aging Successfully XXV , No. 1 5 Services of the Division of Geriatric Medicine include clinics in the following areas: Aging and Developmental Disabilities Bone Metabolism Falls: Assessment/Preven tion Geriatric Assessment Geriatric Diabetes Rheumatology Sexual Dysfunction Urinary Incontinence Call 314-977-6055 (at Saint Louis University) or 314-966-9313 (at Des Peres Hospital) SERVICES S L U G E M S A V AILABLE ONLINE!

As a chronic, progressive issue, dementia can lead to decreased cogni - tion, decreased social stimula-tion, and increased behavioral issues. Individuals diagnosed with dementia and their care - givers might feel helpless. Medications are available to slow the progression of the disease. However, some people are hesitant to try them or are looking for other non-pharmacologic thera - pies to complement their medication regimen. As healthcare providers for older adults, we need to have a work - ing knowledge of the options avail - able to persons with these diagnoses. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is an evidence-based, non-pharmacologic individual and group intervention for persons with mild to moderate dementia. Developed in the United Kingdom by a team led by Drs. Aimee Spector and Martin Orrell, CST was created by combining the most effective aspects of several non-phar - macologic interventions and is based in reality orientation. CST is the only non-pharmacologic treat - ment endorsed by the UK Govern - ment National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), regard - less of drug regimen. Although CST is well-known and well-used in the UK, its benefits are just beginning to become apparent here in the US. At the GEC at Saint Louis Uni - versity, an interprofessional group of faculty, practitioners, and students have collaborated to create a CST Train-the-Trainer toolkit and train - ing session for healthcare profes - sionals to learn more about CST. Our goal is to provide information and inspire healthcare students and providers to consider the possibility of implementing a CST program in their own programs and facilities. There are three types of CST: Standard CST, Maintenance CST (MCST), and Individual CST (iCST). The creators of CST have published manuals that guide fa - cilitators through the sessions for all three types of CST. To learn about the origins of CST and obtain information on training and manu - als, visit http://www.cstdementia.com/. The manu als also include guiding principles that s hould be incorporated into each sessio n (Table 1). The GEC Train- the-Trainer toolkit provides information on forming groups, selecting co-facilita - tors, managing group members' behaviors, adjusting sessions to be culturally ap - propriate, and other helpful ideas. When used t ogether, providers can develop a CST program. CST-related research has shown that people who participate in CST often see improved cognition scores, improved self-measured quality of life ratings, decreased levels of de - pression, and improved language skills. The standard CST sessions are held twice a week for seven weeks and last 45 minutes to an hour. Groups ideally consist of five to eight people with two co-leaders, although the size of the groups can vary based on members' functional status. The groups actively engage members through organized, theme-based group activities. Structure is important to the success of CST, and each group session should flow in the same basic order. Sessions begin with introductions (of individual members, the group in general, the day and weather, and any Michele Sakamoto (center), who received her MSW from SLU in 2015, guides patients in chair yoga, a gentle type of yoga that improves strength, flexibility and mental acuity.

Encourage new ideas, thoughts, and associations 3. Use orientation sensitively and implicitly 4. Focus on opinions rather than facts 5. Use reminiscence as an aid to the here-and-now 6. Provide triggers to aid recall: Using all five senses is encouraged 7. Continuity and Consistency is necessary between sessions* 8. Focus on implicit (rather than explicit) learning* 9. Stimulate language: Encourage group members in language use 10. Stimulate executive functioning: Encourage \"mental organization\" 11. Person Centerdness: Treat people as individuals 12. Respect: Allow differences and avoid exposing people's difficulties* 13. Involvement: encourage individual contributions* 14. Inclusion of all opinions* 15. Choice: Group members help shape the group 16. Fun! 17. Maximize potential using the \"Just Right\" challenge 18. Build/strengthen relationships between group members and leaders *Standard CST and MCST principle only important events that have occurred since the last session). The group then sings the group theme song, which is chosen by group members during the initial session. This activity pro - motes group cohesion and a sense of structure. An article from a local or national news source is then distrib - uted to members and discussed. Facil - itators can invite the group members to provide opinions about the current event and compare the issue/event to a past memory. Following the article discussion, the main group activity is completed as it is outlined in the CST manuals. Topics vary each week and have a lot of room for creativity and adaptation. The group then ends with a time of closure, which includes reviewing that session and discussing plans for the next session. After the initial seven-week ses - sion, maintenance (MCST) groups can be provided. MCST researc h has demonstrated that, after six months, particip ants' self-rated quality of life measures were higher than those who did not participate in the groups. When persons with dementia partic - ipate in MCST after completing standard CST, their cognition continues to improve slightly while their counterparts who do not continue with maintenance tend to decline. The sessions are usually held once a week for approxi - mately the same length of time as the original sessions with a similar format: introductions, theme song, current event, group activ - ity, closure. What can vary from the stan - dard CST, besides the times per week the groups meet, is the group cohesion. As the standard seven- week sessions end, some members may want to carry on into maintenance groups while some may not. If a program has standard groups starting and ending every seven weeks, maintenance groups will have new members entering at different in - tervals, which may change the group dynamics. Leaders must monitor group size and determine members who no longer benefit from CST. Individual CST (iCST) is de - signed for individuals who may not be comfortable with or are no longer appropriate for a group setting. iCST is meant to be provided by a care partner who has regular contact with the person with dementia, often times a spouse or adult child of the individ - ual or a professional caregiver. While cognitive function and quality of life outcomes have not been shown to be significantly improved with iCST, individuals with dementia report the relationship with their care partners improved with iCST sessions. Care - givers' self-reported quality of life scores improved. Finally, individuals with dementia and their care partners value the mental stimulation that iCST provided. Individual sessions are held three times per week for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. The iCST manual provides for 25 weeks of iCST, or 75 separate sessions. As with the other forms of CST, each session should follow a similar structure. Begin with warming up body movements, music, and a discussion of the weather or current events. This is followed by current events, refreshment, and a main activity, adapted as needed. All types of cognitive stimulation therapy have positive effects on an in - dividual with dementia. This form of non-pharmacologic treatment can be a cost-effective alternative to main - taining and improving cognition, quality of life, and socialization/lan - guage skills while decreasing depres - sion. These improvements not only affect the individual with dementia, but also people who provide care to the indi vidual. Use of the manuals and the GEC Train-the-Trainer tool - kit can assist any facility or program in beginning a new CST program.

In order to ade-quately create an environment of engaging interprofessional education, five main issues are being addressed. The first is positive professional role iden - tification of oneself and others. Second, identify and address hierarchical roles (both posi - tive and negative). Third, provide adequate incen - tives for interprofes - sional collaboration and acknowledgment of team members' strengths and suc - cesses. Fourth, measure team function and outcomes in or - der to improve teamwork and collaboration. Last, emphasize the role of reflection and team facilitation. Reflection and de-brief should take place fre- quently and should be part of one's daily work life. As part of the Geriatric Workforce Enhance - ment Pro - g r a m a t Saint Louis University, several inter - professional geriatrics education opportuni - ties have been devel - oped to ad - dress those five issues. Coordina -tors Dr. Helen Lach and Dr. Milta Little have been work - ing to integrate the Rapid Geriatric Assessment (RG A) into the curriculum in health science class - rooms across the Saint Louis University cam - pus, including social work, occupational therapy, physical ther - apy, nursing, medi - cine, medical family therapy, and commu - nication sciences and disorders. Students trained to perform the RGA have been able to participate in commu - nity screenings across the St. Louis region. Pictured above: Students and faculty who participated in geriatric case competition Competition winners (l to r): Danielle Thomas (Department of Family & Community Medicine, Medical Family Therapy Program), Colin Gallagher (School of Medicine), Tara Dauer (School of Nursing), and Kylee Sachtleben (Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders).8 Aging Successfully , No. 1 9Students from across the health professions also partici - pated in the first annual \"Ge- riatric Case Competition\" in February 2016. Nine teams - each with students from mul - tiple disciplines were charged with becoming an interpro - fessional team and developing a plan of care for a geriatric patient based on a standard - ized case. Students met over one month and had access to a faculty mentor. Each team made a formal presentation of their plan, and they were rated on the quality of their plan and interprofessional collaboration. Winners were announced at a reception to congratulate all the students on their exceptional work. The competition was mod - eled after a similar program at A. T. Still University, a part - ner in the Geriatric Work - force Enhancement Program grant from the Health Re-sources Services Administration (HRSA). Student professions included medicine, nursing, physical therapy, communica - tion sciences and disorders, medical family therapy, social work, and public health. Students enjoyed the chal - lenge and opportunity to work with peers from other profes - sions. One student enjoyed \"the opportunity to really dig into a case from so many perspec - tives.\" Another found the com - petition \"a safe environment to learn about other profes - sionals and learn how to work on a team.\" Another student stated: \"I really enjoyed the case competition. I thought it was a great opportunity to be exposed to other professions.\" Organizers Dr. Milta Lit - tle and Dr. Helen Lach were impressed with the quality of the student's work. \"These students had a range of expe- riences and knowledge and were creative and resourceful in addressing this patient's problems\" reports Lach. Little further noted \"this is what we want our students to do - take this geriatric experience and think about how they can use it in their future roles to become change agents and improve care for older adults.\" They anticipate the competi - tion will be an annual event, and is being held in the Fall 2016 semester on Thursday, October 27, 2016. For more information on the case com - petition, email aging@slu.edu. To build on the training and work with students across the University, an Interpro - fessional Geriatric Interest Group has been started with a kickoff event March 29 th for Careers in Ag - ing Week. Students had the opportunity to hear a lecture by Dr. Little on Successful Aging and engage in \"speed mentoring\" with ge-riatric professionals.Interprofessional Education 10 Aging 314-771-8575 The Rapid Geriatric Assessment At Saint Louis University, we have developed the Rapid Geri - atric Assessment (RGA).1 The purpose of the RGA is to allow primary care physicians to do simple case-finding for the pres - ence of geriatric syndromes in older persons. The RGA screens for frailty, sarcopenia (muscle weakness), anorexia, and cog - nitive dysfunction. The RGA is presented in its entirety in the centerfold of this newsletter.If the associated algorithm is followed within these screening measures, the majority of persons with depression, sleep apnea, weight loss, polypharmacy, inap - propriate drug use, and e ndocrine disorders ( e.g., hypothyroidism and vitamin B 12 deficiency) can be iden - tified . Figure 1 provides additional information on the algorithm. The simple screens that are used have been well validated psychometrically. Both the frailty (FRAIL) screen 2,3,4,5 and the sarcopenia measure (SARC-F) have been validated on four continents 6,7 while the nutrition assessment (SNAQ) has been studied and validated on three continents 8,9,10. The Rapid Cog - nitive Scree n (RCS) is derived from the Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) exami - nation and is available in 30 lan - guages 11,12 which are available at http://aging.slu.edu. Figure 1. Algorithm for Management of Frailty10 Aging Successfully XXV , No. 1 11 In addition to assessing the four areas noted here, the RGA includes an item to determine if the older adult has completed an advance directive to guide future and end-of-life care. Advance directives are a key to appropri - ate health care in persons of all ages, and need to be obtained while the person still has the capacity to be involved in their own decisions. Here at Saint Louis Uni - versity, as part of the current Geriatric Workforce Enhance - ment Program (GWEP), we have developed a computer-assisted management system for primary care health professionals to use in making appropriate diagnostic and treatment decisions. In addi - tion to making the RGA available in paper and electronic formats, we have developed health litera - cy appropriate patient handouts which stress lifestyle changes such as exercise and high protein diet for frailty and sarcopenia. Patient materials are also provid - ed on issues related to exercise, mental stimulation, and a Medi - terranean diet with extra virgin olive oil (polyphenols) for mild cognitive impairment. GWEP faculty, staff, and students pro - vide this assessment protocol to physicians of those persons who screened positive on the SNAQ, the MEALS-on-WHEELS mne -monic for treatable causes of weight loss. These informational materials are available in their entirety in this newsletter. Utilizing our Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Pro - gram (GWEP) grant, faculty are integrating the RGA into the clin - ical services provided by Saint Louis University, Perry County Memorial Hospital, Northside Youth and Senior Services and two community health centers\u2014 Myrtle Hilliard Davis Health Care Center in North St. Louis and the St. Louis County Health Centers in North St. Louis Coun - ty. The map that accompanies this article provides an overview of the geographic areas being served in the St. Louis area. Uti - lizing GWEP faculty, staff, and health professions students, we are also providing screening in the St. Louis community. We are very excited at our success utilizing the RGA to al - low primary care health profes - sionals to improve outcomes for older persons in Missouri. The RGA can be used as part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (G0439) along with a depression screen (SLU \"AM SAD\" Tool), immunizations, listing of medi - cal conditions, female history, listing of medications and aller - gies, vital signs and weight.

Congratulations to Dr. Gammack! Cruz-Oliver Developing Care ResourcesDr. Dulce Cruz-Oliver has been se - lected as one of the ten members of the 2015 Cambria Foundation Sojourns Scholar Leadership Program. Dr. Cruz is focusin g her project on develop - ing the first Hospice and Palliative Medicine fellowship program in Mis - souri and creating the first outpatient clinic for palliative care services in the St. Louis region. Dr. Cruz-Oliver's passion for this work is clear in her statement about this opp ortunity: \"Several factors motivated me to become a doctor. Most importantly, I like to talk to people, especially elderly people with advanced illness. I was inspired by my grandmother who always received sick people i n her house where she cared for them with prayers and home remedies, and by my grandfather, who due to prolonged illness, lived in my home where I helped take care of him. Most recently, I have seen a close friend go through c ancer and chemotherapy treatment. She encoun - tered many difficulties and challenges, some resulting from the fragmented palliative care services in St. Louis, which caused her and all of us arou nd her to suffer. This program will advance improving care for patients in St. Louis who are being treated for a serious illness\" (http://www.cambia - healthfoundation.org/). Dr. Cruz-OliverEllen Kaehr, MD, has joined Divi - sion of Geriatric Medicine as an Assis - tant Professor. Dr. Kaehr is a graduate of the Medical College of Wisconsin, completed her residency in Internal Medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine, and is an alumnus of the Saint Louis University School of Medi - cine Fellowship in Geriatrics. She is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in Geriatics. Dr. Gammack Dr. KaehrMilta O. Little, D.O., is the new director of the Geriatric Medicine Fellowship Program.

He introduced himself as \"Dr. Important Surgeon\" and asked me when I would be completing residency (strike one against \"Dr. Important Surgeon\"). The geriatric fellow who was working with me an - grily responded, \"This is my attend - ing! She is done with her training!\" Completely perplexed, he asked why I liked geriatrics and I went into my usual spiel about the medical care of older patients being a challenge and how much I enjoy working with the older patient population and their families, particularly in the nursing home setting. He responded shame - lessly with, \"I thought only doctors who couldn't get jobs worked in the nursing home!\" and then proceeded to hand me his card and say that he would be happy for any refer - rals that I sent his way (strike two against \"Dr. Important Surgeon\"). Being the passive-aggressive indi - vidual that I am and not knowing how to express my anger in an appropriate way, I walked over to the trashcan and ripped up \"Dr. Important Surgeon's\" card directly in eye - sight. I have never forgotten that day and luckily, have never run into \"Dr. Impor - tant Surgeon\" again. I assume he is still walk - ing the halls of the operating room ignorantly believing that nursing home physicians are the \"reject doc - tors,\" last in their medical school class, who were unable to match into any other specialty. Have you ever heard anyone say to an inter - ventional cardiologist, \"Wow, I am shocked you would ever choose that field! I guess you weren't good enough to do anything else?\" No, of course not, because that would be absurd! Had I recovered quicker from my shock on that pivotal day, I would have informed this physician of the importance of my specialty. Namely, that geriatricians routinely provide medical care to the frailest and most vulnerable patient popu - lation. It takes a very special skill set to manage numerous complex medical comorbidities, all while weighing the risks and benefits of each intervention. I am constantly evaluating whether or not what I am about to prescribe or recommend will improve quality of life or harm the patient, and more often than not, there is a fine line between the two. To add complexity, our patients do not fit into our most popular treat - ment algorithms because they are not the healthy 50-year-olds en - rolled in the studies that were used to formulate the algorithms. I would undoubtedly cause harm if I treated every older patient's blood pressure to 120/80 mmHg and started him/her on a statin because of a remote history of a myocardial infarction 30 years ago. Another pet peeve that I have encountered on numerous occasions is the sentiment that a fellowship in geriat - rics is not particularly useful because other specialties ( i.e., in- ternal medicine or family practice) treat older adults. Yes, that may well be, as the supply of geria tricians cannot meet the demand, but I \"... geriatricians routinely provide medical care to the frailest and most vul - nerable... I am constantly evaluating whether or not what I am about to prescribe or recommend will improve quality of life or harm the patient...\" (continued on page 16)16 Aging Successfully , aging@slu.edu Questions? FAX: 314-771-8575 guarantee that there are specific issues and conditions that geriatri - cians are better at diagnosing and managing. Take falls, for instance. What other specialty treats falls as well as we do? Geriatricians understand that falls are multi - factorial and have the skills to comprehensively evaluate gait, balance, lower extremity strength, polypharmacy, orthostasis, possi - bility of cardiac arrhythmia, and the numerous other factors that contribute to fall risk. Patients who are falling have been referred to me when \"no doctor could fix mom's falls,\" and have been able to markedly decrease falls and fall risk by checking a simple ortho - static blood pressure or stopping nighttime Benadryl \u00ae. Granted, it is not always that easy, but when it is, I might as well wear my bat - man cape instead of my white coat because I feel like a superhero doctor. Similarly, consider dementia. Yes, probably any specialty could perform a screening test and di - agnose dementia, but I think geri - atricians develop a sixth sense to detect cognitive issues and the ability to work up potential con - tributing factors and causes in a comprehensive manner. Just last week, a patient was referred to me for \"Alzheimer's disease.\" I did a simple screening for de - pression and out of fifteen questions, she answered positively on thirteen of them. She was severely de - pressed and I am sure that this depression is contributing to her \"Alzheimer's disease.\" We put a plan in place to begin treatment for depression with an antidepressant and cognitive behavioral therapy and I look forward to administer - ing another cognitive screening test in the future. This patient had seen numerous doctors and had not been diagnosed with depres - sion by any of them. Again, roll out the superhero cape because geriatricians are superheroes! As geriatricians, we need to unite and spread the word about how important we are. We are too meek and humble and allow oth - ers to underestimate our abilities to truly improve patient care in our older population. Yes, most physicians can care for older adults, but we do it better! Our Geriatrics Division at Saint Louis University had the fortune to film a 30-minute special with our local television news station earlier this year that featured three members of our department*. We provided the basics of geriatric care and the reasons we are \"super-specialized specialists.\" Since that airing, we have had hundreds of calls from older adults and their families seeking comprehensive geriatric assessment. Based on these results, it is imperative that we lobby for the mainstream geriatric health soci - eties to advertise and advocate on our behalf. The general popula - tion, as well as other physicians, have littl e understanding of the advantage we can provide. As patients and physicians begin to see our inherent value, more medical stu- d e n t s a n d r e s i d e n t s will become in - terested in the field. In addi tion to increasing re - cruit ment efforts is, of course, increasing reimbursement from Medicare and other health care insurers, but that deserves a commentary article of its own and would require changing an entire culture. In summary, geriatricians need a pep talk. We need to ral - ly and exclaim in droves that we are the best at caring for older adults. While most of us truly believe this in our hearts, we let others' misperceptions cloud our own self-worth. We are part of one of the most fulfilling specialties and it is time for us to tell others how important we are! *To view the KMOV special, \"The Science of Healing,\" www.aging.slu.edu. Pep Talk(continued page 15)16 Aging No. 1 17Who's Hearing Their Voices? Attending to the Needs of Dementia Caregivers By Max Zubatsky, PhD, LMFT and Sue Tebb, PhD, MSW, RYT-500 Entering her 70s, Joyce never thought that life would be this de - manding after retirement. Working as a paralegal for much of her life, she was ready to enjoy this new phase without the daily grind of work to stress her. Her upcoming trips with friends to South America and Europe were all planned. Joyce was also excited to get back to craft - ing and photography classes. She could finally spend more time see - ing her young granddaughters who live only two hours away. Unfortu - nately, her plans were dramatically changed. Over the next six months, Joyce's husband, Joe, started week - ly to misplace multiple items in the home and lost track of the location of his parked car. Joyce was also concerned with Joe's new problems in which he had difficulty verbal - izing thoughts or writing complete sentences. Joe was a long-time ac - countant and took pride in ordering his life based on numbers and cal - culations of tasks. After a series of memory tests administered by their physician, Joyce and Joe were told that he had early-stage Alzheimer's disease. Joyce was given few re - sources from Joe's care team and was directed to monitor his new dementia medications. Throughout the first few years of Joe's disease, Joyce received very little support from family and friends, most of whom lived out of town. She was never asked by the medical team about Joe's condition or her own overall health and well - ness. As time went on, Joe's muscle strength started to decline. Joyce sacrificed thousands of hours tak - ing Joe to appointments, making meals, dressing and bathing him, (continued on page 18) 18 Aging Successfully , V ol. XXV , No. 1 email: aging@slu.edu Questions? FAX: 314-771-8575and transferring him from the chair to the bed and back. She came to the stark realization that \"this is going to be the road for the rest of my life.\" Joyce's story is all too familiar. Family members and close friends often follow similar struggles and challenges in the early years of their caregiving role. After a diagnosis of dementia is received, primary caregivers are often left alone won - dering, \"Where do I even go from here?\" Instead of transitioning into a \"non-work\" role during one's empty nest years, later life caregiv - ing places individuals in a new full-time job for which they received no training or preparation. When care - givers are faced with these daunt - ing tasks of attending to their loved one's daily living needs, the moti - vation to attend to their own needs and find meaning in their lives is often diminished or even lost. Had the care team included Joyce as a member of the team and helped sup - port her through this initial phase, providing her with the necessary resources and tools, the pain of this journey may have been slightly alle - viated. Now, the question becomes: who will take care of Joyce if her emotional and physical health starts to decline as well? Family caregiving for persons with a dementia diagnosis has be - come more commonplace in the United States. An estimated eighty-five percent of un - paid caregivers who provide services to a diagnosed in - dividual are family members. 1 These caregivers often want to be the primary mode of assistance because 1) they (and others) desire to keep the family member in the home, 2) the proximity they have to the person, and 3) the perceived ob -ligation they have to help the parent, partner or spouse. 2 As those suf - fering from the disease are living longer, increased strains regarding finances, medication management, assistance with activities of daily living, and medical appointments often overwhelm first time care - givers. These constant sacrifices for a loved one can frequently and quickly take a toll. Long term de - mentia caregivers have increased risk of facing emotional, medical or financial hardships along the way. 3 Health care professionals have found the care management for those with dementia harder than most chronic health conditions 4 with several unpredictable demands and challenges regarding symptoms and disease management for both the patient and family. 5,6 Primary care providers have particularly difficult challenges with this diagnosis, con - sidering that dementia is just one of hundreds of diagnoses they make in routine care of patients. Diagnoses often go undocumented in the pa - tient's chart or misdiag nosed based on a limited amount of assessment from the patient. 7 Little is known about the way in which physicians deliver effective care to dementia patients and work with families around the patient's cognitive symp - toms and medication management. 8 Many providers even sidestep the conversation of dementia with fami - lies, fearing negative reactions or a lack of trust in their diagnosis of the patient. 2 With these important conversations lacking during medi - cal appointments, caregivers are left unsure as to the road of their loved one's health moving forward. Healthcare provid ers should consider the following questions when working with dementia care - givers following a family member's diagnosis: How much does the caregiver know about the diagnosis and term dementia? Many times, caregivers are lost and unprepared when attempting to identify signs and symptoms in a loved one following a physician's diagnosis. Their Voices? (continued from page 17) 18 Aging Successfully , V , No. 1 19What level of stress is the care - giver going through? Caregivers vary considerably in the levels of stress they can endure during the initial phase of the disease. Low tolerance of stress for caregivers can often lead to poorer health out - comes for both themselves and their loved ones over time. What is the reaction of the caregiver following the delivery of a diagnosis? While some caregiv - ers may have predetermined a di - agnosis of dementia in their mind, others can be taken back even in - timidated by the words \"dementia,\" \"Alzheimer's\" or Parkinson's dis - ease.\" Does the caregiver have out - side support through family, friends, and other resources? An overlooked aspect of caregivers' strain is the lack of outside support from immediate or extended family. Those who assume all of the for - mal caregiving responsibilities are prone to enduring significant strain and sacrifices in the quality of their own lives. Is the caregiver going through her or his own life issues (work, mental health, physical health, or family circumstances)? Dementia caregiving is, in itself, a full-time job that requires a significant amount of sacrifice for loved ones. Detecting any barriers or challenges in the caregiver's life can be valuable for physicians and other professionals when directing individuals to refer - rals and resources. Currently, there are two focus group studies in the Saint Louis University Department of Medi - cal Family Therapy and the School of Social Work that are aimed at exploring the experiences and well-being of dementia caregivers. In one study, the format of these groups is centered on what medi - cal, mental health, and community resources caregivers have utilized and their percep - tions of the journey car - ing for a loved one with dementia. Participants are being asked to report personal challenges and frustrations with their medical team (physi - cians, geriatri cians, nurses, and other profes - sionals) regarding the overall dementia care for the patient and care - giver. The second study is examining the use of available and supportive caregiving resources by health care providers and caregivers, specifically under-utilization and ex - isting barriers to use. For more information on these projects, contact Dr. Zubatsky at zubatsky - jm@slu.edu. The Gateway Geriatric Educa - tion Center (GEC) has several proj - ects that are striving to address the needs of dementia caregivers at all stages of the disease. \"Caregivers Like Me\" helps Latino caregivers find strategies through the support of health care workers to keep their loved ones in their homes longer. Developed by Dr. Dulce Cruz- Oliver, the curriculum is available in English and Spanish on the GEC website http://aging.slu.edu. An innovative approach to im - prove memory and cognitive abil - ity for individuals with dementia, called \"Cognitive Stimulation Ther - apy,\" has been implemented in sev - eral medical clinics, residential care facilities and community centers in the area. Professionals are now seeking ways to include caregivers in these groups, further impacting the cognitive capacity and physi - cal mobility of individuals with dementia. Lectures, seminars, and geriatric activities are provided by GEC faculty on a local and national level to highlight strategies for cop - ing, prevention of burnout, and as - sistance of loved one's needs. More information for both dementia care - givers and healthcare professionals can be found at the GEC website at: http://aging.slu.edu. If providers are going to curb the stress and burn - out being experienced by dementia caregivers, inter - vention at the initial diagno - sis is critical. Caregivers are often the best reporters of \"early warning signs\" for their loved one's condi - tion and must be listened to more closely at appointments and made \"Dementia caregiving is, in itself, a full-time job that requires a significant amount of sacrifice for loved ones.\"Their Voices?
