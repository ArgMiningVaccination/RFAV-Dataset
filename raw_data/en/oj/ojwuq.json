Their participation and help enabled metowrite about Korean women's experiences. To protect their privacy and that ofpeople mentioned inthis dissertation, Ihave used pseudonyms for women, medical practitioners and the city. Iamgrateful to mydissertation committee and American friends atthe University ofCalifornia Francisco and Berkeley. Iwould like gratitude tomy advisor, Judith Justice who Iwanted towork with before coming tothe United States when Iread herarticle about the cultural context ofinternational health. She has advised on myAmerican academic life and witnessed my academic development inmedical anthropology. She always encouraged meinwhatever Iwanted tostudy and gave me moral and academic help whenever needed. Without her advice and assistance, myPh.D. studies may never have been finished. Ialso thank Nancy Scheper-Hughes who introduced metothe anthropological study ofthe body. Her insightful comments deepened myconcerns about women's experience of medicalized reproductive bodies. Iespecially thank Aihwa Ong for her invaluable criticism and encouragement in iVdeveloping the concept ofpower ingender construction. Aihwa Ong was sympathetic towomen's new experiences in industrializing East Asian countries and gave meinsights how tosituate the making ofKorean women's gender subjectivity interms ofthe broad context ofmodernity and the biopower. Many also helped, particulary stage of mydissertation. Iamespecially indebted toJane Margold. Wehad many discussions about writing ethnography. Jane's assistance was very valuable inreading most chapters and editing myEnglish. Linda-Ann Rehbun also read some of mywork and edited achapter. Myfellow-graduate students, Lisa Handwerker, Jiemine Bao, Nancy Chen, Donna Goldstein, Sydney White and I,all shared the same long and isolating experience ofwriting our dissertations. Iappreciated their moral support and friendship. Ialso thank Vincanne Adams for her concern about mywork and her friendship. Laurel Kendall (anAnthropologist who has published several books onKorean culture) was always helpful, listening tomyideas with patience and interest and giving meher comments on mywork inaconstructive way. I appreciate her and her family's hospitality and encouragement while Ihave been inAmerica. Ialso thank Sohier Morsy for her warm interest inmywork and her dearest friendship. Iwould also like tothank Hyunmee Kim who helped mein collecting data during myfieldwork as aresearch assistant. VSince the fieldwork, she has been afriend and colleague and helped meinfinding some statistical data and giving meher time todiscuss mymaterial.

Iappreciate the telephone calls and postcards that Ireceived from Professors Haejong Cho, Oakla Cho, Uhn Cho and Kim Sengnai during mywriting period. Itwas touching and encouraging to have support from Korean senior professors and colleagues. Igive special thanks toDr. Sook Bang, who introduced metothe field ofmedical anthropology and taught meabout therelationship between medicine and culture. Dr. Bang's pioneering works inKorean family planning has inspired me tostudy women's reproductive body.

ViThe Making ofthe Modern Female Gender: The Politics ofGender inReproductive Practices inKorea Eun-Shil Kim ABSTRACT This dissertation isabout how the modernization discourse created the new experience offemale gender in Korean society. Particulary Ifocus onthe medico-political control ofwomen's bodies through medicine asone ofthe most critical effects of amodernization project. For this inquiry, Istudy the lives oftwo groups ofwomen in acity inSeoul's metropolitan middle-class women and working-class Chapter 2deals with middle-class women's experience of \"the modern\" through the new space of\"apartment culture\" in which housewives were engineering and creating the life style ofthe urban middle-class. Inchapter 3,Idescribe the way inwhich middle-class women's bodies become a medical subject and how institutional powers such asthe cultural ideology ofwomen's \"proper\" conduct, the in-law family, the traditional medico-religious belief of pregnancy, educational and medical knowledge clash over the social relations ofwomen's marriage, sexuality and pregnancy. Inchapter 4,Idiscuss working-class women's experience ofKorean modernization through their spatial migration from therural community tothe factory and tothe vii.urban poor district. Ialso describe their way ofachieving the status ofadult womanhood and how the hegemony of Western medicine isincorporated into their reproductive bodies particularly incomparison tomiddle-class 5isabout Iask whether the practice ofwomen's control over their reproductive bodies erodes the power structure ofgender relations inwomen's lives. Myresearch shows that through the process of modernization, differentiated socio-economic classes were formed and people ineach class began tohave different experiences indaily life. Depending onwomen's class position, therefore, women's gender agency isdifferently constituted. However, the cultural discourses about \"sameness\" among discursively construction ofgender subjectivity, forcing women toexperience their gender as the real and factual through their bodily practices of reproduction. viii`s--- \\essessessTable ofContents Dedication Class, and Women's Bodies ...... . 2.

(Adrienne Rich 1986: 284)Chapter I.Introduction: Writing One's Own Culture asaPractice One ofthese isthe apparently simple idea that women are asintrinsically human asmen, that neither women nor men are merely the enlargement ofacontact sheet ofgenetic encoding, biological givens. Experience shapes us, randomness shapes us, the stars and weather, our own accommodations, and rebellions, above all, the social order around us. (Adrienne Rich 1986: xv) (But) when it comes to producing anthropological discourse inthe forms ofdescription, analysis, and theoretical conclusions, the same ethnographers will often forget ordisavow their experiences ofcoevalness with the people they studied. (...) coevalness aims at recognizing contemporality asthe condition for 1983 for my Ph.D., mygrandmother took metoaspot near her house in Cheju Island and implored metoget married. She said, \"A woman needs ahusband and ason even though without adependable man. Ifyou haven't given birth toeven one child, you will not have anyone totrust and you will eventually become lonely. Ahusband isessentially a stranger to awife; you can't even trust your husband unless you have given him anoffspring. Women can't betreated as a whole person ifthey have not given birth. The best thing for awoman todoistomarry agood, wealthy man and give birth toachild. All other things are secondary for women.\" Mygrandmother was 78years old, sick, and very for her towalk and totalk tome, asshe was short of breath. She sighed alot, talked slowly, and did not say much even though Iasked her many questions about her life with great anthropological curiosity. However, her agenda was clear. She sought topersuade metomarry before Iwent tothe United States because she thought she might die before Ireturned (and infact, she did die). Mygrandmother was infertile throughout her life. She had moved into mygrandfather's house when myfather's mother died, almost 35years ago. Ihad found out that she was myfather's step-mother when Iwas injunior-high because myfather and myuncles did not emotionally accept her astheir mother even though almost twenty years had passed since she moved into their family. Mygrandmother's first marriage failed because she could not give birth. After that, she had lived with another man and made a fortune with that man's help before she came tomyfamily. She experienced the kind oflife aninfertile woman goes through inKorean society with resentment. She was afraid that ifIdidn't get married, Imight have alife similar to hers --insecure, lonely and without achieving real membership in afamily. She didn't think that she could trust any ofher step-children, including myfather. Thus, she always worried about her death, particularly about who would perform her ancestral ceremonies and sweep her grave. She believed inthe power ofmoney and the therapeuticefficacy ofshamanic ghosts that she had served all her life. She was anenthusiastic client ofseveral big Cheju shamans. She had kept her property separate from that of my grandfather's since she had moved in. Since the oldest son should serve thespirits oflegitimate ancestors, she had chosen the youngest uncle asher major heir. Itwas hewho would observe her ancestral ceremony and sweep her grave because ayoungest son does not have obligations tohis ancestors. She left all her property tothe youngest uncle toperform ancestral services after her death. Toacquire apersonhood, mygrandmother argued, awoman must engage with the in-law family through sons born from her own body. Without sons, awoman would not have asocial and cultural channel for connecting with any institutional relations. Mygrandmother used tosay toherdaughters-in law that awoman should not voice her sufferings but should bury them inher heart; that isawoman's virtue. She told methat she could not speak loudly because she had hwa pyo'ng (fire disease: see chapter 4). This disease, which squeezed and burned her heart and generated inner hot energy, was caused by adual agony ofhaving been born an infertile woman and thinking about her fate ofnothingness inthis world after her death. She often sought medical services, visited clinics, and was frequently hospitalized. Sometime doctors recommended that she bedischarged from hospitals when mygrandmother wanted tostay inthehospital. Although she did not trust Western physicians, she trusted them more than she trusted her step-children and their wives. She had some ideas that Western medicine itself was more trustworthy than family members who were not born from her own body because drugs had animpersonal and objective substance that could save her when she was in trouble. However, she thought her own physical constitution was better suited tothe care ofshamans and ghosts, because they could hear and understand the problems that earthly affairs caused her. She held several big shamanic rituals every year, and put the best food for ghosts inthe corners ofher modern two-story, bedifferent from hers. However, mygrandmother told methat even though the world ischanging, all women's lives are essentially the same because awoman does not have apenis. Nomatter what women achieve, women cannot help depending onmen inorder tohave a\"correct\" life. The next day, mygrandmother decided to take metoher shaman. She woke meupatdawn and took me out without saying much. She told her shaman that her granddaughter was planning togofar away without getting married and asked her for advice. The shaman, who looked at meand smiled, said toher, \"Your grand-daughter has a strong fate, and she will not have any problems in aforeign land. Inaddition, there isnosign ofmarriage inher fateinthe next couple ofyears.\" After hearing this advice, my grandmother stopped mentioning marriage. Mygrandmother's experience ofaninsecure, vulnerable and resented identity inKorean society was common for women who were infertile. They could not achieve women's social personhood, because itwas the performance ofthe successive assigned roles ofchaste woman, devoted wife, and dedicated mother that endowed awomen with asocial being. Only through the identity ofwife and mother could awoman of my grandmother's generation incorporate awoman's selfhood, which was located socially and spatially within \"the inner room ofthe household (Kendall and Peterson: 1983)\" and bring itinto the outer social arena, achieving what might be called the \"truth\" ofbeing born awoman. Inmy grandmother's experience ofher life, there was no distinction between sex and gender; living as awoman meant being born as awoman. Women's infertility was anabnormal manifestation ofher sex/gender; Therefore, herlife could not have legitimacy at abiological and social level. Not only women themselves, such as mygrandmother, but also most Korean men, believe that nature made men and women different and the culture and sexual division oflabor were the products ofaccommodating tothe immutable differences ofNature (Eisenstein 1988: 59; cf.Irigaray 1985). Itis nature that defines the woman byher sexual difference and this natural truth isclearly and factually realized whenthe woman's body ispregnant. The pregnant female body, as one and the same asthe mother's body, istodefine female sex as\"different\" from the male body. The women's reproductive capacity --awoman asthe maternal-feminine (Whitford 1991: 7)--is away toobtain social membership female gender and toachieve awoman's agency (Ong 1990; Strathern 1987) inKorean culture within which the women's experience isjustified and interpreted meaningfully interms ofthe social relations ofphallocentric social order. However, the difference inthe female body is understood asbeing unequal ineveryday life. conducted myfieldwork inrural Korea in1984-1986, Ihad seen somany women who were fertile and suffered from their reproductive capacity through frequent pregnancies, childbirths, miscarriages and abortions. These women indeed wanted tocontrol their reproductive capacities and their bodies. They did not want tobeinfertile but they did not want tohave many pregnancies astheir bodies allowed. The women considered their consecutive pregnancies tobethe karma effects ofbeing born women. Men's lives, onthe other hand, were not affected directly bytheir biological condition. InKorean society, there have been social and culturaldiscourses' that treated sex and gender asone and the same, creating anexclusive axiomatic truth; that is, awoman's body isnot aman's body and they occupy different spheres. Therefore, thehistorical and cultural experience ofwomen's lives simply tends tobereduced towomen's biological condition inwhich awoman areproductive capacity; in this capacity, women's \"factual\" and \"real\" gender has been inscribed. Women's lives, in ageneral sense, mean maternal lives, signifying that thebiological practices of reproduction are the essence offemale gender (cf: Eisenstein 1989; Petchesky 1989; Gordon 1977; Martin many old women inthe rural areas inthe *My use of the term \"discourse\" and its operational application originates from Foucault (1978 [1991 :53-61] ).The language, spoken and written, isthe condition ofdiscourse, and the study ofdiscourse isthe awareness that power isconstructed inand through language, embodying the positions and standpoints from which people speak and the institutions which prompted to speak (Macdonell 1986) and creating subversive powers. Regarding the study ofdiscourse, Foucault said (1991 [1968] :60-61]), \"Ido notquestion discourses about their silently intended meanings, but about thefact and the conditions oftheir manifest appearance; not about the contents which they may conceal, but about the transformations which they have effected; not about the sense preserved within them like aperpetual origin, but about thefield where they co-exist, reside and Itisaquestion ofan analysis ofthe discourses inthe dimension consequences: (1) Totreat discourse not as atheme ofreviving commentary, but as amonument tobe described inits ofconstruction ofdiscourse, asisdone bythose who usestructural methods, but its conditions (3) Torelate the discourse not to athought, mind orsubject which engenderedit, but tothe practical field inwhich itisdeployed\" (my emphasis). Iamalso indebted toMacdonell (1986) regarding the understanding of (Althusser's) ideology indiscourses and toEisenstein's somewhat flat definition ofdiscourse (Eisenstein 1988: 10-11).mid-1980s, they had welcomed the government policy offamily planning, which had been executed as amodernization project. Regarding myprevious meetings with rural Korean women, myinquiry was afeminist anthropological one in which the idea challenged the idea ofthe \"naturalness\" and \"sameness\" offemale gender. Further, I wanted toknow how the modern was incorporated into women's understanding oftheir reproductive bodies. Since the Korean government launched its modernization project inthe 1960s, new modern biopowers (Foucault family-planning policy, which has been acrucial part ofthe Korean modernization project, exercised what Foucault has termed \"biopower\" onthe population, implementing anidea ofthe \"modern\" that includes control, regulation and planning ofwomen's reproductive practices. I situated the Korean family-planning policy, which was the first formal discourse that separated women's sexuality from reproduction inKorean culture, asanimportant momentum in organizing women's experience oftheir bodies industrializing \"modernizing\" urban environment. *The term designates forms ofpower exercised over persons specifically insofar asthey are thought of as livingbeings; apolitics concerned with subjects as members of apopulation, inwhich issues ofindividual sexual and reproductiveconduct interconnect with 1980)Ireturned campaign offamily planning and medical interventions inpregnancy and contraception had re-organized women's experience oftheir reproductive bodies into the \"modern\" arrangement ofgender relations inKorean culture. Ithought this research project could show \"the modern\" way ofexperiencing Korean female gender through reproductive body practices. Assoon asI mentioned myproject, (particularly the word \"family planning\"), many scholars (mainly male social scientists) and male graduate students dropped their interest inmy study. They wondered how women's reproduction, which has already been considerably controlled bythestate's policy, could be agood dissertation topic. They thought Icould write mydissertation quickly and easily bysummarizing existing family- planning literature inKorean. Some scholars mentioned that Icould find many research reports onthe cultural factors that underlay non-compliance with contraception, and onthe successful acceptance offamily planning policy since the 1960s. Itried tosay that Iwas not going tostudy compliance issues with respect to contraception but gender politics; however, some scholars added that family-planning policy was nolonger necessary because Korean couples did not want tohave more than two children. They delivered the message clearly that women's 10reproductive problems were solved and this kind ofstudy was outdated inKorea; however, some students who went toget their doctoral degrees inthe United States repeated this kind ofstudy because American professors onthe dissertation committee did not know the Korean situation. Or, some American professors regarded foreign students' study oftheir own societies asjust acase study written in English that added torelated existing literature. Inaddition, some Korean male graduate students mentioned that studying my own culture was aneasy choice but out-of-date. They implied that itwas anold practice in which Korean anthropologists followed inthe steps of Western anthropologists tostudy Korean culture, treating Korean culture asOther. However, more recently, Korean anthropologists had begun todo\"authentic\" anthropology which studied non-Korean cultures asWestern anthropologists study other cultures. (Iwondered ifthese students mentioned the same concerns totheir male senior colleagues who had done fieldwork inKorean society). From the connotation that studying the other culture isthe way of authentically practicing anthropology, the students' suggestion sounded like aneffort to\"modernize\" Korean anthropology (cf: Marcus and Fischer 1986; Clifford and Marcus 1986) byputting themselves inthe position of Western anthropologists who sanctioned anideological process inwhich relations between the West and its Other, 11between anthropology andits object, were conceived not only asentailing difference, but distance inspace and time (Fabian 1983 :147) . Writing about one's own culture inanother cultural context in aforeign language creates many theoretical and moral conflicts with respect towhat and for whom Iam writing. I--asananthropology student who has studied and read many ethnographies about non-Western societies written byWestern anthropologists --amalways afraid that my ethnography of my own culture would add another case study ofnon-Western societies from aWestern mimic perspective (cf: Bhabha 1984). Many Western anthropologists and non Western scholars, including me, understand experiential \"coevalness\" or\"contemporality\" with people beyond our own cultural and national boundaries inthe late capitalist world (Jameson 1984; Harvey 1989). But the experience of simultaneity has been denied inthepractice ofwriting culture bythe situating ofsubject peoples in adifferent time and space bymany Western anthropologists (Fabian 1983 :33). This kind ofWestern anthropologists' practice has also been mimicked bynative scholars who are writing of their own culture, putting their own societies within a reinvented frame ofWestern knowledge. For many Korean scholars, the problematization of women's everyday life, focusing onreproduction, was not 12taken seriously asresearch. Everyday life, itwas assumed, might be asubject for foreign scholars who are not familiar with Korean culture, sothat they could write about everyday life with curiosity. Many Koreans seemed tothink that writing about everyday life by aKorean for Koreans was pointless because they thought that they knew what itlooked like and what was normal and natural. However, they might think itpossible ifIwrote for foreigners who did not know about Korean culture. Ipartly write this dissertation about culturally \"natural\" and yet invisible and never-articulated Korean women's experiences --particularly genuinely female experiences ofreproduction --for Koreans. Idosoasa cultural critique. Ishow how the \"natural\" state ofwomen's lives isanhistorical and cultural construction, and how the \"natural\" state ofgender relations isapolitical state (Butler and Scott 1992). Inorder tomake this dissertation acultural critique, Iuse two techniques; critical strategy 1986:137); Bypresenting narratives byKorean women who have been \"Other\" and never formally voiced their private bodily experiences, Iintend tocreate effects that can derive from switching positions from the other tothe subject inKorean culture. Korean women inthis dissertation position 13themselves asthe subject and speak their experiences. Defamiliarization isrelated which is the \"antagonism ofstrategies\" (Foucault 1982:211) :As Foucault has said, \"to find out what our society means by sanity, perhaps weshould investigate what ishappening in the field ofinsanity (Foucault women's experience toshow discursive phallocentric power inKorean culture rather than analyzing patriarchal social system from the point ofview ofits internal rationality. Iconducted myfieldwork from Seoul. Namyang was located inthe middle ofthe most notoriously crowded metropolitan subway line between Seoul and Inchon. Namyang was one ofSeoul's many satellite cities; abyproduct of rapid urbanization and industrialization. Among the many satellite cities, Namyang was the most rapidly and explosively populated. Itbecame the most densely populated city inthe Metropolitan area in1990. Thefirst visible characteristics ofthe city were its crowds ofpeople, cars and buildings. The entrance and exit ofthe subway toSeoul was packed tothe limit inthe morning and inthe evening, sothat everybody complained that there were too many people inKorea tobeaccommodated inthe small land. People inthe packed subway factually truth ofone ofthe 14catchy-phrases ofthe family planning slogans; \"limit having children and decrease population for the society and for the family.\" Namyang was mainly afruit cultivation area but along with industrialization inthe 1970s ithad been changing into afactory area, accommodating many workers who migrated from rural areas. Inaddition, the population explosion and the high price ofhousing inSeoul had pushed many young couples tomake their homes inoutskirts cities near Seoul like Namyang. As aresult, the population ofthe city in 1990 was about 650, 000 and the movement rate ofthe population was ashigh as 66% in1988. One survey done by a social scientist team in auniversity within the city showed that the population ofNamyang city was mainly composed of middle-class people pushed out bySeoul and workers who had migrated from rural areas.\" Ingeneral, thepopulation of the city was young, sothat population was under 39years old in1989; 82.2% ofthe total households were nuclear families, comprising husband, wife and their children (S. J. Lee 1989: 2). Imet two groups ofwomen inNamyang: one was agroup ofmiddle-class women who were living inapartment complexes; the other group were working-class women who had 3 Asurvey showed that the population distribution of occupations inNamyang city was self-employed (27.0%), professional and engineering (5.5%), administrative and managerial (8.1%),clerical factory worker (5.6%) 2) . 15been factory workers. Most ofthese women were working in factories during myfieldwork. Atthefirst meeting, my informants and Italked about their children. Inmany cases, the women seemed toexpect meto comment ontheir concerns because Iwas doing doctoral in aPh.D program created alot ofpower for meindealing with informants infield research whether My itpossible topractice acertain kind ofauthority incollecting data within a Korean cultural context inwhich academic capital was very much respected. The nature ofethnographic information isabsolutely related tothepolitics of afieldworker and asubject people. Itis, thus, necessary topresent the standpoint of the ethnographer tosocially situate ethnographic information. Ethnography isthe description ofthe anthropologist, who defines the way inwhich people spoke for themselves during fieldwork. Thus, the whole ethnography isincontrol ofthe information that the anthropologist collected. The trend ofreflexivity inwriting culture, which decodes and contextualizes the way inwhich our informants' everyday life istransformed into ethnographic data, has become critical tothe exploration ofthe way anthropological knowledge isproduced and made (Clifford and Marcus 1986; Kondo 1989). Reflexivity, however, consolidates the authority ofthe 16ethnographer through his/her practice ofknowledge/power in which informants' voices are legitimized bybeing written down and transformed into the text byanauthor (Scott 1992). Reflexivity often reduces the anthropologist's moral burden incontrolling the whole procedures ofcollecting data, but Ifeel sometimes Iwas presented as awoman who was inagraduate program in America. One group abook assigned tothem ofautobiographical story about awoman's devoted love toher disabled fiance. The women exchanged their feelings about the book bysaying, \"As awoman Ihave sympathy kind were all provided bythe women themselves. Iwas expected togive some comment about their discussion. However, Iwas much more curious about them and wanted toknow what kind ofideas they had about themselves and other women's lives. Thus, inorder toprompt them to speak, Iswitched myposition from What is 17our society?\" They did not say anything; they merely looked atme. And Ibegan toask passivity, life-long using another man tomarry simply in order befree from her family pressure instead of confronting her family's resistance tothe disabled fiance, her idea ofvirginity and social naivete, etc. These women inthe meeting told methat they had never thought about these issues and did not read the book with this kind of perspective. They read the woman's story asanother's story which had nothing todowith their real lives. They liked the way Ipresented the woman's character and they thought myideas came from mybackground ofeducation. However, at the same time, they came towonder how Icould understand the woman's complicated feelings and sexuality issues when I was single and had never been married. Doing fieldwork inmyown culture entailed many expectations ofanunmarried woman. Myposition as asingle woman, doing aPh.D inthe United States, and having knowledge about women's bodies, gave mymarried women informants ambivalent feelings about me. However, my informants continuously tried tofind the cultural and female sameness in me. Throughout myfieldwork mystatus asanunmarried woman \"Why isshe single? and \"how could she know many things about married 18life and how could she understand getting pregnant and child-birth?\" One informant told methat they gossiped about why Iwas single byguessing that Imight have had a heartbreaking experience orImight have aboy friend inthe United States. Unmarried women who are supposed toget married eventually are expected tobeinnocent about sexuality and women's bodily functions regardless ofhow old the women are. This isnormal inthe Korean cultural sense. Unmarried college professors intheir mid-thirties, women labor activists, aswell asjust-married middle-class women, all insisted that they did not know anything about women's bodies and sexuality. Before they regraded meas a fieldworker, these women saw meas aKorean to beculturally the same asthey were; ifIhad been aforeign anthropologist, their expectation and their curiosity would have been very different. They might have tried tofind out how different the fieldworker was from them and they might have tried topresent themselves as adifferent Other. They wanted to know me toconfirm the extent towhich Iwas similar tothem and the extent towhich they were the same asI. Inthis context, toreveal mypersonal tomy informants seemed tobe asword ineither hand. If Iwere naive about women's bodily experiences, how could they trust mysensitivity and tell their stories strategy toswitch theposition ofthe tothem. When they asked mesome questions, Iasked them back the same questions inaway that would problematize their views and question them asifwewere playing language games. For example, when they asked mewhy Idid not get married, Iasked them why they thought Ihad toget married. Why did they think Ihad aheartbreaking experience? What did they get through marriage? What did married women think about unmarried women's lives? Rather than listening tomy story, they focused onthemselves and talked about their stories even though some women wondered why Iasked these questions for which everybody knew clear answers. Some women felt that speaking out their ideas about the issues was awkward. This kind ofswitching their concerns about meback tothem created atremendous effect ofcontrolling informants and maintaining the power ofaninterviewer. Atthe same time, this effect haunted me with ademoralizing and sorry feeling about whether Iwas manipulating myinformants for my own sake. Mypresence generated alot ofdifferent effects on women's responses tomyquestions and research topics. Many women told methat they were glad tohave achance totalk about their private and informal experiences inquasi-formal 20settings. Many women had considered their private experiences ofengaging insexuality, pregnancy and contraception tobeinformal, trivial and feminine even though these events were the most critical events intheir lives. Women were neither using thecritical language about their situations nor resentful about presenting their lives. Instead, their narratives were full ofrationalization, vitality, anger, and agency\" with respect totheir lives, revealing ways ofcontesting Korean socio-cultural forces, such asthe in-law family, husbands, motherhood, education, thestate and medicine, with the aim ofmaking sense of their experience. However, myinformants' interpretative structure for their lives was closely related tothe power relations oftheir position. Ishared many experiences with these women as aKorean woman and atthe same time, Ilooked attheir lives from myown feminist standpoint, questioning their status ofsubjectivity which was deeply integrated to their families. Myexperience offieldwork raises the very critical point ofwhat isaculturally-specific feminist agenda independent from feminist issues that are discussed inWestern societies. How does aculture acquire legitimacy *The agency inthis dissertation means the Ong's notion of social agency interms of'how social effects are registered' inshifting fields ofpowers notion originates from Foucauldian view ofsubjects asmaterially constituted bypowerrelations and always part of them (1980: 98) and combined Strathern's reformulation that the question ofagency goes beyond theindependent actions are tobe? Through interviews Ifound out that some women considered group meetings and sometimes personal interviews as akind oftherapeutic ritual through which their private, trivial, uncertain, undefinable, individual and unspoken bodily experiences could betransformed into social and political experiences. This was entirely possible because I was aKorean woman who was regarded by myinformants as having emotional experiences similar totheirs oratleast a cultural understanding oftheir experiences. With respect to this point, there were two different reactions. One group considered metobe akind ofspokesperson for their problems and for complaints about women's reproductive health policy and hospital treatment for female patients. They were pleased that they had achance tounderstand their personal experience asbeing valuable enough tobeimportant politically and socially. Tosome women, myposition asan unmarried woman gave them anuncomfortable feeling that my status itself criticized women who remained athome. My presence asanunmarried female fieldworker itself influenced informants' way ofunderstanding myquestions and their way ofnarrating their stories. Inthis sense, the process ofcollecting data and doing fieldwork is, I 22believe, the theoretical andpolitical practice ofthe fieldworker. Reading and organizing the data into ethnography isan anthropologist's power/knowledge practice. The Korean women whom Iinterviewed speak inmydissertation, but Imake them speak inmy own way aconstructed context (Spivak: Myway ofwriting experiences isintended to create aneffect ofdismantling natural truth ofwhat has passed for the making ofthe women's experience. Inthis sense, myway ofwriting ethnography is my own knowledge/power practice; that is, acreation of aspace in which aKorean woman anthropology student could formulate her critique ofKorean culture and beheard. Inthis, my discourse/practice explore how the institutions ofbiopower such asthe state and medicine localize their power inwomen's bodies by making the \"modern\" female gender, and how women construct their experiences of\"the modern\" amidst clashes of\"new\" and \"old\" institutional relations ofpower, such asthe Korean family system oriented toward in-laws versus the nuclear family-centered apartment complex and individual migration and factory life asworkers :Inaddition, other 23issues treated here are \"naturalness\" offemale gender performance and women's education assymbolic capital for the \"modern; \"pregnancy as afamily business versus ofprenatal care and the state's campaigns ofcontraception. The discourse of \"hyundaicho \"k\" (the modern) has been one ofthe most commonly- used languages ineveryday settings inKorea since thestate's modernization projects inthe early 1960s. In Korean society, the state has initiated and organized modernization projects, including industrialization, creating all kinds ofdesires and images of\"the modern.\" asanoperational inevery daylife (Baudrillard 1987) orasanew mode ofperception which developed as a result ofthe emergence of amodern, urban capitalism (Benjamin 1972 [inCallinicos 1989 :150]), rather than referring toacertain ofnation/state (1991: 14 17). Harvey also deal with modernity ascertain characteristics in Comparison topost-modernity (1989). 24Foucault, inparticular, identified of ofwomen's bodies through medicine asone ofthecritical effects of a modernization project. Ilook upon Western medicine as a hegemonic combination ofscience and technology, which are the most critical forms ofmodern power, and asan infrastructure for thestate's biopower practices. Inthe following, Part II, which is myethnography, I describe the way inwhich the Korean modernization process works toorganize women's experience oftheir \"modern\" gender inNamyang, acity inSeoul's I present the lives oftwo groups ofwomen toshow how women's class position contests the creation ofdiscourse onfemale gender. One group ismiddle-class women and the other, working-class women. Chapter 2deals with middle-class women's experience of\"the modern\" through the new space of collective housing --apartment complexes --which represent therationalization, standardization, and homogenization of urban middle-class culture. Ialso describe how the urban middle-class life style inhomogenous spatial structures contributes tomaintaining and creating the discourse of women as asubject of\"sameness.\" Inchapter 3,Idescribe the way inwhich middle-class women's bodies become a 25cultural and medical subject and how institutional powers such asthecultural ideology ofwomen's \"proper\" conduct, the in-law family, the traditional medico-religious belief ofpregnancy, modern education and medical knowledge and hospitals clash over the social relations ofwomen's marriage, sexuality and pregnancy. Inchapter 4,Idiscuss working-class women's experience ofKorean modernization through their spatial migration from the rural community tothe factory and tothe urban poor district. Ialso describe their way ofachieving the status ofadult woman and how the hegemony ofWestern medicine isincorporated into taking care oftheir reproductive bodies. Ifocus ontheir class differences from the ofcontraception. The policy was apolicy ofKorean modernization based on medical institutions asaninfrastructure. Idescribe the state's way ofdeploying modern reproductive practices and raise the feminist question astowhether ornot the practice ofwomen's control over their reproductive bodies erodes the power structure ofgender relations inwomen's lives. Ialso ask howitaffects naturalizing about the concept offemale sex and *Irigaray has always insisted that the proper isphallocentric, that woman can only bedefined, essentialized, from the point ofman (Whitford 1991: 135). 26Part II. The Making ofModern Female Gender: Space, Class, and Women's Body (The) making ofthe English working class isa study inanactive process, which owes asmuch to agency astoconditioning. The working class did not rise like the sun atanappointed time. Itwas present atits own making. (E.P. Thompson 1966: 9) Language creates power bymaterializing images, meanings, and desires through associations with particular words. The discourse of\"hyundaijek\" (the modern) or\"hyundaisik\" (the modern way) inKorea carries the desire toachieve something different and better from the past. The discourse associates the modern with rationality, efficiency, wealth, urbanity, and big size, and since the 1960s these have been closely associated with Western styles. \"The modern,\" which literally means the contemporary inKorean, isvisually represented school children's drawings and inthe Korean government's posters advertizing economic development placed next tohighrise apartment complexes and highrise factory chimneys. These constructs symbolize modernities, representing two different sides ofwell-known Korean economic growth. The apartment complexes are the newly emerged living space for the Jungsancheung (middle-class) which isseen asthe beneficiary ofmodernization tocontribution tonational development bytheir 28education, hard work, etc. Onthe other hand, the factories are the production space ofthe working class whose labor is regarded asthe material base ofthe economic development. Atthe same time, however, their living conditions are neglected, being perceived as akind ofby-product, backward and undeserving ofthe benefits ofmodernization. Inthe following Idescribe the way asanoperational Idescribe lives oftwo groups ofwomen and examine the way inwhich the boundaries ofthe social relations oftheir class experience are constructed. One isthe group ofmiddle-class women, and the other one isworking class. Inthe following chapter, Ideal with the idea ofspatial and temporal experience ascritical references inconstituting Korean women's historically specific class position. Imet these women through two childcare organizations: One was akindergarten for preschool children run bythe YMCA, and the other was a nursery for working mothers (especially married factory workers) run bythe Association ofWomen Workers. Idescribe and show the way inwhich the experience ofthe \"modern\" has been constructed bythese two groups ofwomen and how their class positions have constituted their experience ofbeing WOT\u00bale \u00ban. 29Chapter akind ofliving Kim 1978) Conspicuous inSeoul aswell asinmany cities in contemporary Korea are the complexes ofhighrise apartments. Apartments have been built since the end ofthe 1960s to accommodate arapidly-increasing population triggered by urbanization and industrialization, and have become one of the most characteristic aspects ofurban scenery inKorea. Apartments asliving space were not sopopular atfirst among Korean people, who did not have the experience of living incollective housing. However, inorder tomake apartments into convenient and efficient living spaces, the government aswell asprivate construction companies have designed and created anew living environment surrounded by \"modern\" urban facilities including transportation, schools, shopping centers, and cultural resources. Since luxurious and spacious apartment complexes were built inthe middle of the 1970s and early 1980s inthe South ofthe Han river in Seoul (Kangnam), the residents incomplexes ofhighrise apartment have been called jungsancheung, categorized as rich and well-educated people living inthe modern style of 30housing. The jungsancheung isanew term created bysocial science scholars inthe late 1970s, and has been popularized and disseminated bythe mass media since the 1980s, referring tothe newly emerged middle-class group, regarded as aproduct ofthe Korean industrialization ofthe last three decades. Jungsancheung isanambiguous concept which connotes economically affluent and well-educated and is distinguished from sumin (populace). Jungsancheung's literal meaning group\" defined interms ofowning Some people itmeans aneconomically well-to-do group, but for some itmeans asocio-cultural leading group or a politically influential opinion-making group.' An anthropologist, Ok-Pye Moon (1992: v), describes the jungsancheung asneither aristocracy nor upper class, but rather asocial strata who enjoy stable economic status, good jobs, andrelative autonomy. However, ineveryday 'Regarding jungsancheung there have been many debates since the mid-1980s byscholars and journalists. The main issue was focused onthe political role and political consciousness of jungsancheung inbuilding Korean democracy. That was, how much doesthis socalled middle-class want tochange Korean society. (Sang-Jin Han, Wan-Sang Han 1987) The definition ofjungsancheung varies according toscholars but KDI (Korean Development ofInstitute) published The Survey, Analysis monthly income should behigher, uptothree times than the average urban household income; (3) higher education than middle school graduate; (4) having ajob among self-employed, employer, orsalaried worker. This survey estimated the size ofthis population tobe 36% of urban residents. (1/9/1991, Seoul Daily News) 31discourses many people shift their self position ofclass as jungsancheung orsumin depending onthesituation. For example, when they talk towealthier and higher status people, they describe themselves inpolitical terms as sumin, implying that they are less privileged and less powerful than the people towhom they speak. But when they understand jungsancheung as agroup ofopinion-making public they identify themselves asjungsancheung. Therefore, some random national surveys show that more than 65% ofthose surveyed think themselves asjungsancheung. Inreality I think the term works as akind ofsocio-psychological category orsocio-political rhetoric for many people. In everyday life itconnotes the power ofbeing better-off than average. Instead ofexploring economic apartment complexes. Inaddition, Idescribe what constitutes women's sense ofwhere they belong. The lives ofjungsancheung are stereotypically portrayed aspeople who work incompanies oras professionals and live with awife and usually two children inapartment complexes. These portrayals permeate mass media including popular novels, all kinds ofserial dramas on television, and films. The apartments use Western-style designs inbedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms with doors. At the same time the apartment complexes symbolically represent 32modernity through therationalization ofspatial economy and efficient management ofcollective consumptions such as housing, electric, gas, heating, parking lots and shopping centers. The construction companies advocate the Western style arrangement ofapartment space for the economizing of movement and protection ofprivacy inthe family. People say that itismuch more convenient tolive inanapartment because you can use hot water whenever you want, and because itismuch safer than anindividual home since ithas only one front door for entrance. Therefore you can lock the door when you goout and the apartment guard will watch your apartment while you are gone. Privacy ispointed out as another convenience; people say that nobody bothers them as long asthe entrance door isclosed and people stay inside. Inreality, everybody complains about neighbors' curiosities about everyone's life. Women especially prefer apartments toindependent homes because itiseasier tomanage the house chores, which are shared bymanaging companies. Capitalistic competition among commercial businesses located inthe apartment complexes have created all kinds ofgoods and services toplease clients who become habituated tothem. For example, shopping centers inapartment complexes sell prepared groceries and ready-made food tosave women's labor athome and deliver goods inresponse calls. The general shortage ofhousing inthe metropolitan 33area ofSeoul has combined with the apartment image of modernity, Westernity, efficiency, convenience and anonymity topromote the popularity ofapartments. Throughout the 1980s, people's preference inhousing has been changed to apartments and the price ofapartments has become more expensive than the same size ofindividual homes (Boosung Kim 1992 :4). Inthe late 1980s thepopularity ofapartments for living space aswell asfor investment reached its peak, and finally the government intervened tostabilize the prices and ownership ofapartments. Today with the newly coined word of\"apartment culture,\" the apartment represents alife style rather than aliving space. B.Jungsancheung (middle-class) women inNamyang for this study Namyang, which isaneighboring satellite city toEast Seoul, has been redeveloping as abedroom community. When I conducted myfield research from August 1990 toJuly 1991, large apartment complexes were being constructed according to'The development ofNew City' bythe Ministry of Construction. These apartments would befilled with middle class people who would move from their current residence in Seoul. Atthe time of myfieldwork, Namyang was amixed city, with traditional residential areas populated with individual homes, apartments and factories that were built during the urbanization atthe end ofthe '70s and '80s. 34Inorder tomeet middle-class women Icontacted the Namyang YMCA, which had organized and run awomen's meeting called Deungdai (Lighthouse) since May 1990. Deungdai, that iscomposed of 50small groups, isaself-governing housewives' group concerned with the improvement of consumption patterns inconcert with the environmental movement. Each group has five toten members who live near each other and meet once aweek tobuy organic agricultural products from rural producers, mediated bythe Namyang YMCA. The meetings are guided by aYMCA staff person once amonth. The members ofDeungdai consist ofmothers whose children attend akindergarten\" and anEnglish class forelementary school children, and women who participate ineducational programs such as\"Housewives Academy' atthe YMCA. Iattended nine meetings ofDeungdai and met approximately seventy married women. Interestingly out of the nine meetings, eight groups ofwomen lived incollective housing complexes even though each complex was differentiated inrank bythesize anditslocation.\" The *This kindergarten isfor the preschool children, five- to seven-years-old, run bythe Namyang YMCA. More than half ofthe education of children in this program consisted of sports education. Many mothers prefer this program toother kindergartens, because the YMCA was supposed tobebetter than their neighborhood small kindergarten runprivately. Itcost 49,000 won amonth ($650) without adding other material andpractice expenses. *Thecollective housing, usually called apart (apartment), isclassified into three types. These included: (1) Gocheung apart (highrise apartment), consisting ofmore than Unlike Seoul, Namyang lacks these Gocheung aparts; (2)Jugong apart (built by Korean Housing Cooperation), composed of 5story 35class position ofwomen inDeungdai, the Namyang YMCA secretary and tomiddle-lower class when husbands' occupation and household income are counted. It can also bedetermined through the size and location of their sq.) insize; (3)Villa isthe new style ofcollective housing, relatively inexpensive to buy and lessprofitable for investment compared tohighrise apartments. Villa complex iscomposed of 3story apartments and each isabout 24-30 pyong InSeoul there isagreater variety ofvilla luxurious and spacious. Theresidents ofthedifferent types ofapartments inNamyang vary by class and age. The YMCA secretary classifies roughly that women who lived in Jugong apartment might beinmiddle-low (18 pyong), and women in Wooseng highrise apartment (40-50 areupper-middle and upperclass there isanagefactor; ingeneral women who live inJugong are younger (late twenties and earlythirties) and women inWooseng are older (intheir forties). *Some people commented that themiddle-class inNamyang are the people who were pushed out from Seoul ;it means the Jungsancheung inNamyang are not the same Class ofJungsancheung in Seoul because they cannot afford housing inSeoul and, ingeneral are less educated than the Jungsancheung inSeoul. However, Ido not take this kind ofSeoul-oriented comment seriously because it usually meant the Jungsancheung inSeoul considers to be as acertain exclusive upper and upper-middle class. *Thenational survey conducted byKDI (Korean Development ofInstitute) shows that 34.6% ofthe urban population belong to jungsancheung and 71% ofthis population have their own houses. (January 9,1991, Chosun Ilbo) 36according totheir house orapartment ownership. Married women who have their own houses defined their status as middle-class and had the feeling ofeconomic headway. All my informants lived intheir own apartments. Kim Haeyoung who was acollege graduate said tomeinher small group meeting, \"We donot have many economic problems even though we donot have big money. The organic agricultural goods delivered bythe YMCA are alittle expensive compared tothe goods ingrocery markets. Weare neither sopoor that wehave tobuy cheaper goods just from daily markets, nor affluent that wecan afford imported foods from big super-markets inbig shopping centers and department stores everyday.\" Myinformants described their position asmiddle-class and ashaving more social consciousness and responsibility than other middle-class women, for example inSeoul. Some women told methat they bought and ate Korean foods and used environmentally sensitive goods for national and social interests rather than their own economic interest. Some women wondered whether what they were doing was socially useful except for individual benefits from eating healthy food while richer people were not changing their behaviors because there were nosocial sanctions for eating foreign food. Inaddition, the government did not control the rapid increase offoreign agriculture goods inthe Korean market. 37However, the general impression was that they were participating inthis meeting because oftheinstitutional authority ofthe YMCA. C.The new asocial network which myinformants formed bytheir various affiliations with the YMCA and other groups inthe physical vicinity oftheir residence. Through examining the way inwhich women understand their involvement inthe YMCA meetings and with other women, I will elucidate who these women are and what constitutes their lives. Ibegin with adescription of atypical YMCA meeting. InOctober 1990, Ivisited asmall group of Deungdai. All the women were living in aYernip complex called, Mido Villa, which was composed ofseveral three story Yernip apartments. The meeting was held inan apartment with two bedrooms, aliving room, akitchen and a bathroom. That isthe typical structure ofanapartment of 24or27pyong. There were seven women ranging inage from late twenties tomid-thirties. The meeting was ritualized, starting with lighting candles.\" First, everybody sathand-in-hand, had ashort *When Ivisited other groups, the same ritual procedure was observed. Itwas taught by aYMCA staff person when the meeting wasfirst organized. There is abook about organizing the meetings including lighting candles, singing songs, and the way ofpresiding at ameeting. Each member iscalled acandle. 38meditation time, and sang several folk songs together. Next, awoman recited the resolutions ofDeungdai including community spirits and environmental concerns. The meeting proceeded intwo parts; thefirst part was devoted tothe discussion ofthe on-going agenda ofnot using imported foreign agricultural goods. The second part focused onthe exchange oftheir feelings about the book they had all read. Most ofthe women actively participated inthe discussion and atthe end one or two ofthe loudest voices resolved the meeting byinscribing them as asocial body; stating that 'we' are Korean and housewives. Although some women did not agree with this kind ofimposition, the representation ofthe so-called correct orrighteous isthe norm agents.\" example, some women talked about thedifficulties ofthe policy ofnot eating or using imported goods. Many women agreed with the difficulties and one woman complained that the imported \"Haejong Cho (1992) mentioned that Korean people donot want togive their opinions about whether thepresented idea isright or wrong inpublic. Korean people discuss these things only in informal gatherings usually with drinks after the formal meeting (in Korean twipuli). Thus, inKorean Culture anafter-meeting is the real meeting inwhich different opinions, criticisms, and individual dissent are found. Only byparticipating inthe informal meeting can people get thereal sense ofwhat isdiscussed and what isthe real issue presentation. But attendance atthis kind ofmeeting islimited bygender, age, etc. Many people in Korea, China, and sometimes Japan, when they were asked some questions about social issues, repeated similar answers manufactured by the formal authority, derived from the same COIntext. 39glassware, tapa, was sogood, pretty, and cheap that there was nohousehold without atleast apiece oftapa glassware. Some women asked who could guarantee the safety ofKorean agricultural products, because Korean farmers were told to use lots ofagricultural chemicals toproduce clean products for urban residents. And then one women who had been brought upinthe countryside and migrated tothe metropolitan area began tocriticize, stating that urban dwellers despised agricultural goods produced inKorea and preferred imported U.S. grapefruits and Sunkists oranges despite the trade imbalance between Korea and the United States ofAmerica. Some other women supported her bysaying that Korean food produced inour land was better for Korean people's bodies than imported goods which hadall kinds of preservatives. They added, \"in terms ofsocial concerns we are different from rich people living inthe Kangnam area and preferring only expensive foreign foods toshow off their wealth. All that these rich people wear and eat is from America, Western Europe, orJapan.\" The idea that Korean food isbetter for Korean bodies refers not tothe physical well-being ofindividual bodies but rather tothe body politics; thepolitically and morally correct, patriotic national body, culturally authentic body. The discourse about the appropriateness between Korean and non-Korean appeared again inthe second part ofthe discussion during which they discussed abook about 40children's family education written by aforeign author but translated inKorean. All the women were very interested in children's education and actively discussed, complaining that this kind ofbook demanded alot ofparents. They were frustrated because they could not practice recommendations such as\"treat children asindependent persons,\" \"respect children's pride and their questions and promote their curiosity\", etc. Some women said that this kind ofidea was too Western. All the women agreed, saying that treating a child as aperson isnot proper inthe Korean social Context. All the mothers agreed that the mother's presence in the family isnecessary and ismost critical for the proper development ofchildren's emotions; itisonly the mother who can educate children inKorean society. One woman asked the YMCA staff member whether there were some behavioral differences between working mothers' children and full-time housewives' children. The YMCA staff member answered that based onher own observation about children inher kindergarten, emotional instability and distractedness were more easily found among children whose mothers had full-time jobs. She added that some people think that love ofchildren isamatter ofquality not quantity, but children need a certain quantity oflove. Song Meeja, amember ofthe meeting who quit her teaching job injunior middle school because ofher newborn 41baby, supported this teacher's idea and said that the mother wasabsolutely needed forchildren aged from one tothree\". Then another woman who had afive-year old boy insisted that the mother's role was very important for the stable development ofpreschool children's emotions. Other woman said that children inprimary school could not survive and study well inschool without mothers' help. And another woman said that mothers' care for children inhigh school was absolutely needed because ofthe entrance exam for college. Therefore, the women concluded that the mother should beathome for children until they enter college. Not only traditional Korean culture but also modern social institutions, particularly the education system include mothers for their operations, reinforcing mothers' existing role. However, many women pointed out that the issue was how tobring upand educate children athome now even though they knew that the role ofthe mother isabsolutely important for children's well-being. They talked about their frustration with the technique ofmothering insituations like the following; adaughter seemed tolike her father too much and was jealous ofher mother; amother could not help with achild's homework; achild took after his father's behavior and treated his mother like his sister, etc. Some *Inthe Korean way ofagecounting, ababy isone-year old as soon 42women said that they were living inanage inwhich some professional knowledge such aschild psychology was needed tomanage afamily. Inthat sense, many women regarded their participation inthis meeting as astrategy toaccommodate themselves tothe changing society ortoget some new information about everyday life from neighbors. Afew women considered their participation inthe meeting as akind ofpolitical activity. However, most women regarded their group asaninformal neighbor meeting, enjoying the gatherings held after the formal meetings. At the end ofthe formal meeting, the hostess served some food such ascakes, fruits, and coffee. Some hostesses served so much food itwas like adinner party. Because the meeting was held at adifferent member's house every week, women saw and compared their living space with others' and exchanged information about newly bought household items, the management ofhusbands' and children's affairs such astonic food for husbands andgifts ormoney for children's teachers inprimary school, etc. They asked and exchanged things related totheir role asmanagers and caretakers inthe family rather than about themselves. When Iasked some women about other members intheir group, many women could not tell meother members' names, education background, orage. They usually addressed each other asthe mother ofher child, for example, \"Eun-Shil's mother.\" Iattended eight such meetings. Some meetings were 43tightly organized and others were looser gatherings. This kind ofmeeting with some formality did not seem strange to many women because they had already participated inmany 'neighbor meetings' encouraged bythe government or churches. The most frequent and dominant topic for the meetings was the importance ofthe mother's role as caretaker inthe family.\" Inaddition, the most enjoyable side ofthis meeting towomen was gathering and seeing other women's living spaces and being treated asvisitors. Through the exchange ofwords they learned what issocially and culturally correct and the right practices ofwifehood and motherhood inthe rapidly changing modern city. But atthe same time, they experienced what really constituted neighbors' living rooms and kitchens beyond what they had formally been told. Through these performances they were engaging inshaping and being shaped bythe technique of caretaking and mothering and constructed the new female gender ofiungsancheung inNamyang. *For many women these meetings were just aneighborly gathering topurchase everyday goods such ashot-pepper, salt, barley tea, apples, pears and grapes, and Cabbages, eggs, seaweed and soontogether via the YMCA. Unless there were the YMCA staff oroutside visitors like me, they might omit the ritualistic procedure oftheir meeting. Formality, appearance, orsocialcorrectness isvery important especially to nam (outsiders or others) distinguished from uri (we orus) inwhich weknow each other well sothat we donot observe such aroutine formality. Especially women's relations are considered asinformal rather than formal. However, this relationship isakind offormality mediated mobilized byaninstitution such ofwomen who are living inthe orsimilar size apartments because apartments are built insame orsimilar size units. This means that the apartments asliving space control thesocio economic status ofresidents. Inaddition, the residents in anapartment are similar because oftheir economic affordability. The same size and design ofspatial arrangements and very similar interior structure make people feel they are the same orsimilar. Inaddition, their personal conditions such asthe duration oftheir marriages, the number ofchildren, and the job of afull-time housewife with abreadwinner husband, also are similar. The modernization ofthelife style symbolized by collective housing with nearly identical apartments and residents ofsimilar economic status and age, shows the strong tendency toward standardization and homogenization of thelife style ofthe middle-class inurban Korea. In addition, people who live inapartment complexes have many meetings such asthe monthly neighboring meetings, building meetings ofapartment residents, and mothers' associations inchildren's schools. These meetings, including deungdai, reinforce the homogenization oftheir life style by imitating, assimilating, and competing with each other through visiting and exchanging information about real estate, buying cars, furniture and utensils, the way of managing housekeeping affairs, and ofpleasing and nurturing 45husbands and children. However, this process of homogenization isnot uni-directional but generates competition, conflict, and resistance. ofmiddle-class female gender: Industrious,restless, and family-bounded agency Ihad in-depth individual interviews with twenty-four women attheir homes after the group interviews. When I asked their names and wrote down their telephone numbers, all the mothers gave their names assomebody's mother instead oftheir own name. Many women feel uncomfortable when they are addressed bytheir own name inpersonal relations. This partly comes from their gender position that amarried woman isnot anindependent self, represented by her own name but atthe same time comes from Korean cultural conventions inwhich people are addressed astheir social position orsocial role byaddressers. However, Iused their own name when Icalled them for appointments. Kim Inwha, thirty-five years old with two children (seven-year-old son and five-year-old daughter), was my first in-depth interviewee. When Ivisited her house, she was listening toanEnglish cassette tape. Instead of turning off the tape, she letitplay for awhile and turned itoff when Iarrived ather home. She was not the only one; most of myinformants inDeungdai were taking English conversation classes atthe YMCA orother foreign language institutes. Speaking English isbecoming acomponent of 46urban middle-class culture. Some women said that they were studying English tocatch upwith the current society rather than for fun; many English words and some phrases are commonly used ineveryday conversation. They also said that they would have many chances tomake trips toforeign countries because Korean society isgetting more internationalized. Others worried that their children would ignore mothers who did not know some English, which is taught inschools. Thus, inorder tobecompetent mothers and refined wives incontemporary Korean society, they were busy attending not only English class but also many meetings and lectures tolearn skills such aspottery, driving, housewives' academy, music (playing theguitar, piano or singing classic songs), computer, exercise (bowling, jogging, orswimming) and atseveral social meetings such as Deungdai, Guiding Committee ofJuvenile Delinquency, Mothers' Association inchildren's school orsmall group activities inchurches. Oftwenty-four women, only four women said that they were not participating inany other particular activities except gathering and chatting with friends. All the children were taking extra lessons such as painting, piano orviolin, and home tutoring except three children who were just attending kindergarten. Women can go out ofthe apartment only when their husbands and children are out because their main job remains housekeeping and care 47offamily members. Therefore, these women were busy in managing all their activities while children and husbands did not demand their presence. Kim Inwha went out almost every day during the time when her husband was atwork and children inkindergarten toattend housewives's academy\", a circle for reading books, Deungdai the Mothers' Association. Kim Inwha had been amember ofDeungdai for eight months since its inception. She volunteered tobe aleader ofthis meeting inorder tofind some change inher life because the job oftaking care ofchildren and housekeeping made her feel locked-in athome, causing stress, anxiety, migraine, and nausea. Inaddition, she said, \"Ineeded some social networks and supporting groups to learn and exchange information about daily life. Because myhusband and Imigrated from Chunju, wedid not have many relatives and school friends inthe metropolitan area except for two alumni meetings ayear andvisiting kin inChunju\".\" Many women like Kim Inwha came upwith the meeting tosolve their personal and emotional stress and meet friends. Many \"This is akind ofeducational program for housewives organized bythe YWCA. This program includes several fields in which women's role isneeded. The whole agenda istostrengthen and Consolidate women's role asawife and mother inachanging social COIntext. \"Chunju is aprovincial city, five orsix hours away by express bus ortrain from Namyang. 48women defined the meeting as\"sound and healthy\" with members who were worthy ofassociation. Thus, many husbands liked orrecommended that their wives attend this meeting because the members' husbands had similar social status. Kim Inwha 'sgroup, for example, was economically and socially homogenous because their husbands were working inaresearch institute, newspaper company, private companies, oras engineers. Ineffect, the very social nature ofthis kind of meeting, encourages women tobecompetitive with other women, but atthe same time, forces them tobesimilar or homogenous, makes them aware oftheir way oflife and helps them construct their lives indistinct and institutionalized ways. For example, inone group there was one woman whose apartment was rented. She voluntarily attended the meeting but soon stopped appearing, although she paid the monthly fee for the meeting, picking uporganic agricultural goods. When other members asked why she did not participate inthe meeting she said that she was busy. But other members understood that she did not appear because she could not stand other women's showing off their economic superiority. Lee Kyunghye inthe same meeting said, \"Some women try not todemonstrate the economic differences, butitnaturally comes out when people exchange everyday life information. All meetings end upasgatherings ofonly people with similar living standards.\" Kim Inwha, who was very motivated todomeaningful work 49with other women and initiated the meeting byassigning books toread and set upplans toaccomplish, realized that other women did not like her role as aleader. She said, \" When Iexpressed myopinion, Isensed the atmosphere getting cool and other people kept silent, just looking atme.\" Some women said that they hate mothers who are self-righteous even though they may impart useful information. Tothem, participating inDeungdai isnot aformal activity, but just awomen's gathering. Some members said that they did not understand some women who are aggressive and try tobehave in asuperior way. That did not seem tothem tobefeminine. Yum Sukhee and Suh Wharan explained that there was always a strong competitive psychology among women, making them feel bad after meetings. Kim Inwha concluded, \"interpersonal conflicts orcompetitions among women are the main and active reason why the women's group isnot working so smoothly.\" Most of myinformants think that all women are naturally similar, bysaying \"as far as weare women.\" These women, whose prestige and status depend totally ontheir husbands' wealth and social status rather than their own conditions, would not recognize differences among women. Women's own characteristics such aseducation, beauty, or family background were not asubject for showing off orenvy asmuch asthose oftheir husbands or of their children. Women are not represented asthemselves. Several informants 50inthe same context worried about whether their daughters would besmart and independent enough tolive alone, which isnot anormal orhappy life for women. For them women are biological beings and atthe same time members ofasocial entity. They see nodiscrepancy between sex and gender. The only mechanism which creates differences among women is status derived from marriage, which isnot imbedded inwomen themselves but derived from men. E.Contesting practices of\"good wife and wise mother\" Myinformants arerelatively average ofiungsancheung.\" The agedistribution of myinformants isinTable 2.1. Wives are usually three or five years younger than husbands and the age range of differences between man and wife extended toten years except for three couples ofthe same age. The two women of same-aged couples said that they tried tolook young with make-up and hair styles because many people said that their husbands looked younger than they did. Women are said toget old earlier than men, sowomen feel they must make extra efforts not tolose their youthful attraction tothe same age husbands. Inaddition, the age difference enhances *The average age ofthe urban jungsancheung householder isforty-three years old and average year ofschool is13.6 years (high school graduate means 12-years school, technical college 14 year, college 16-year) .71.1% ofall urban jungsancheung households have their ofthem live in11to30pyong house (1/9/1991, Chosun Ilbo). 51husbands' social superiority towomen. Younger women respect their older husbands and their marriages will bestable. Ideally men should beolder, get abetter education, and come from aricher family than their wives. Age isone of the most critical indexes increating social hierarchy in Korean culture. Table 2.1.

She graduated from aprovincial college. Her husband graduated from the same college and got aM.A. degree after marriage. They made alove marriage atthe age oftwenty-seven: they were urged byhis mother tomarry before her death even though her son was not ready toberesponsible for afamily. Thus, Kim Inwha became ateacher for awhile tosupport her husband's university education for amaster degree. Myinformants started their married life intheir late twenties asshown inTable 2.2. Marriage here means the cohabitation of aman and woman initiated through the social ritual ofthe wedding ceremony.\" Fourteen out oftwenty *Regarding the importance ofthe marriage ceremony, see Chapter 4. 52four women said that they contracted love marriages (yo'nae kyo\" lhon) and ten said they had arranged marriages (chungmae kyo\" lhon). The love marriage, however, does not mean the voluntary union oftwo adult individuals for love. Rather it refers tothe way ofmeeting the spouse because love marriage for middle-class women still needs parents' permission. Insome cases women had ahard time getting parents' recognition and needed anegotiation period until parents accepted their dating partners aschildren-in-law. Most love marriages gothrough more orless serious rituals ofnegotiation todemonstrate the power offamily rights over the person concerned. Kim Sooyern's parents opposed her marriage first because her husband graduated from a provincial college. Kim Sooyern said that shepersisted in marrying him because she was upset that her family seemed to think more about theprestige ofher husband's college and their own reputation than about her happiness. She thought she was marrying upbecause she was only ahigh school graduate and did not consider herself pretty. Finally, Kim Sooyern's parents accepted the marriage, saying that the best man for their daughter was the man who loved her. In some cases where the men's parents opposed wife-to-be, couples adopted astrategy ofgetting pregnant finally accepted. who impregnates awoman isexpected toshow responsibility for her bygetting married, even though inreality abortions are frequently performed and 53many couples split up. The cultural logic ofthis practice isthat avessel (the traditional metaphor of awoman's body) isbroken by aman's sexual intercourse; therefore, the broken body (sexually experienced woman) should bekept bythe man who broke it. Table 2.2. The women's age atmarriage |age 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Il Iwomen l 2 5 5 4 5 1 l 24 Middle-class women's age atmarriage isrelated to their education level shown inTable 2.3. and their work experience after graduation (see education and age of working class women's cohabitation inchapter 4). Out of twenty-four informants, only three women were working outside households after marriage. However, most ofthem had jobs before their marriage; two women were middle school teachers; one was anurse; two did secretarial work and five did clerical work inprivate companies; two were public service personnel; one did cosmetic sales and one ran a dress-making shop. The rest ofthem were athome, helping their mothers and waiting for marriage. Except for two school teachers and one-part time instructor incolleges, all the women quit their jobs immediately before their marriage. After marriage, many of myinformants entered their husbands' family and preformed their role asdaughter in-law. They cooked, washed clothes, and cleaned house for their in-law family including husbands' parents and 54siblings, and sometimes grandparents. Then, one ortwo years later they began tolive separately from their in-law families. Many husbands did not want their wives tohave a full-time job but tostay athome. Yum Sukhee, who was thirty-two years old and school graduate, \"At marriage myhusband wanted metostay tobe wise mother.\" And lived what hewanted for six years but Irealized a'good wife and wise mother' isnot awoman who stays athome today. Men are, these days, ambivalent toward their wives; they want women who take care ofthe family in the traditional way and atthe same time help him by making extra money.\" One school teacher, whostill had afull-time jobafter marriage, had agreed with her husband towork until they had ababy, but she did not quit her work after she had given birth toason, because her family could not besupported only byher husband's income and she felt some responsibility for her students. Inaddition, she also sensed that her husband might not really want her toquit the job, contrary tohis words. Today, awife's role does not appear tobebound within the home, but clear requirements for performing the role are lacking. For the newly institutionalizing middle-class inahighly mobile society like Korea, inorder tomaintain and way oflife, wives' informal networking social 55resources isimportant apart from asecure source of husbands' income. For that reason wives' education associal capital isalso emphasized. Table 2.3. The educational background ofmiddle-class couples manVwife middle sch. high school |college graduate middle sch high sch. 1 2 college 2 5 10 1 graduate 3 The most critical index marking middle-class status is the level ofeducation and secondly, occupation determined bythe education. Education has been the most visible and central criterion tocategorize the population used by statistical and social surveys. Concerning questions such as why are you moving toSeoul orKangnam (South Seoul), orwhy did you migrate tothe United States ofAmerica, orwhy have you done such and such, Korean people usually answer that we did itfor the children's education. Education isthe most important symbolic capital onwhich people can rely inthis knowledge andcertificate demanding industrial, modern, and changing society. Education works asthe ultimate income source, aswell as amechanism for transcending class boundaries and promoting socio-economic status during the last several decades inKorean society asKorean capitalism 56hasdeveloped.\" However, the manner ofusing education asa symbolic capital isalso differently constructed bygender. Interms ofwomen's level ofeducation, many women said that they were high-school graduates, technical college graduates orcollege dropouts.\" Women used tosaythat they *Many statistics show acorrelation between educational level and class. As Korean capitalism has developed since independence from Japanese colonialism and the Korean war, the most important channel ofrecruiting elites for government, business, cultural and ideological sectors has been through the institution ofeducation, and gradually anew class formation has began to emerge. Inorder to get higher education, all people need topass entrance examinations for colleges. Therefore, education isbelieved tobethefairest channel toimprove, promote, and mobilize people's socio economic and class position. *Compared toother ismuch lower but the data iscloser tothe national average (see footnote 9). These studies focus on women in apartment complexes inthe South ofSeoul (Kangnam) .Seventy five percent ofsurveyed women inMoon's studies graduated from colleges and graduate schools. These studies aredifferent from mystudy onmiddle-class women insituating middle-class women's agency inKorean society. The Moon's article istoexamine the boundary and theactivities offull-time housewives's social and familial role in the context ofthe maintenance and the reproduction ofthe Korean society. Moon's article isarguing that these jungsancheung women are actively contributing to the Korean economic development byperforming their role divided bythe sexualdivision oflabor inKorean society. Eunhee Kim Yi's article also emphasizes the women's positive role inthe family for the husband's work which should beunderstood asthe moral commitment tothelarger collectivity inKorean society where collectivity comes before individuals. These studies, Ithink, give middle-class women the agency by assuming that women's active role inhousehold iscontributing tonational development and the family, advocating housewives role which isdifferent from but equivalent tomen's socialrole. These studies focus onthe intention and aims ofwomen's roles rather than the role construction and its effects on women's subjectivity. Intransforming women's \"experiences\" into the evidence of ananthropologist's argument, itis neglected that how women's narratives were established and how 57tell who graduated from what level ofschools bylooking at their face orway oftalking. However, Kim Inwha said that itwas because it was akind oftaboo toask and atthe same time college certificates did not reflect the performance ofthe housewifely role. Inpersonal interviews, some of my informants told methat they feigned higher education before other people inorder not tobeignored. These women have the idea that women's education does not have tohave material powers outside the home but isakind ofsocial and cultural resource compared tomen for whom education should begood, substantial, and necessary. Many people believed that inKorean society, women atleast could change their lives through marriage even though they failed toget higher education. However, men's education could not beneglected because itaffected men's entire life and their whole family. Thus, many women confessed that they were more relaxed about their daughters' education compared tosons' even though they treated their children equally. However, women whose education isnot ashigh astheir middle-class neighbors suffer inconstructing and performing their female agency. Women's education isnot asocial and institutional and inwhat ways women's experiences were constituted (cf. Jaggar 1983 :377-389 1992). Korean power inconstructing new forms offemale gender inmodernization settings. Many women feel that now is atime when women should have their own personal time forself-realization, participating insocial and cultural activities which are not necessarily related to making money. Thus, many women feel sorry orcontemptuous for husbands orworking mothers who are working tomake money without enjoying \"munhwa (the cultural).\"\" Many of myinformants, particulary high school graduates who were not confident about themselves asmothers and wives in arapidly changing urban area in1990, attributed their incompetence totheir lack ofeducation. They said that contemporary society could not beunderstood without knowledge. Here, \"knowledge\" means institutionally certified knowledge, sothat some college graduate women did not recognize high school graduate women's efforts toattend lectures and classes as areal education; that was, akind *Aprofessor's short column inanewspaper (The Korean Times 11/4/1992) carried the story of agarment factory girl who was aneighteen-year-old, middle school graduate, and attending anight high school after her work. But thepoint ofthis article was that she was spending alarge part ofher income learning how toplay the piano. Thearticle said that she thought playing the piano looked good and someday she wanted toplay Mozart. She did not gototheaters around her factory because movies were not good enough to see andtheaters were dirty. She did not like the popular songs that her friends liked because these songs were \"culturally\" low. She liked \"the cultural.\" \"The cultural, \"which were frequently mentioned in every day life in Korea, were understood asthe image of somewhat distant, foreign and Western from the reality ofeveryday life. Inthis context, playing Mozart isconsidered more \"cultural\" than singing orlistening toKorean popular songs. 59ofcultural activity. For many women, the standards which Korean society requires ofindividuals are changing in highly competitive settings. Thus, they were confused about how toeducate their children, how tounderstand their husbands, how tomake love better, and how toincrease the family wealth, but itwas difficult for them totell these anxieties toother women. They knew other women were also vulnerable and not socandid about their problems, but this did not help them toconsole themselves about their own incompetence. That was the reason some women welcomed the chance totell their stories and thought of meas akind of psychologist orcounsellor. These middle-class women were ready togotoinstitutions tosolve their own problems. Cho Sukhyun, who graduated from middle school and married a college- graduate, son of arich family, said, \"Iwas told togotoabeauty pageant when Iwas young. Iwas introduced to and hecourted me. Ihad in mybeauty although myfamily was poor. When Ientered myin-law family after marriage, all his siblings and their spouses were college graduates but I did not feel any problems because myhusband was nice and loved mevery much and Iperformed my responsibility bytaking care of mygrandparents-in-law and parents-in-law. I,now Iguess, might have been overwhelmed byall these people, soIdid these things without any complaints. When weseparated from thein 60law family and mygrandfather-in-law gave us alarge ofmoney, Iinvested that money inreal estate and earned agreat fortune. And Ithought acaring husband and money would beeverything for awoman. However, gradually Ibegan tolose confidence when Imet the wives of myhusband's friends and other mothers as mychildren entered kindergarten. Ifelt I had noeducation. When myhusband introduced other Iwas ahigh school graduate. As mychildren began toask about some English and Chinese characters and Imet some situations that needed mysignature inChinese, Ifaced great difficulties. Inow pretend that Igraduated school. Now Ithink awoman's level ofeducation affects therelationship between husband and wife even though myhusband understands and helps me alot.\" The other woman, Kim Sooyern, who graduated from high school, said that the most regretful thing inherlife was not having gone toeven abad college. She had the feeling from other college-graduate mothers that they were better at educating children and making arelationship with their husbands and she felt that she could not catch up. When she put her level ofeducation onher son's application form for the YMCA, she worried that her status asonly ahigh school graduate might negatively affect teachers' perception ofher son. Onthe other hand, college graduates like Song Meeja 61and Park Meejeon were relatively comfortable about themselves inperforming their roles bysaying that the level ofeducation for housewives was not assignificant but women got along with similar education even inDeungdai. A college-graduate commented that women who were busy attending lectures orsocial activities were usually high school graduates inher apartment complex. Several women, who graduated from colleges inSeoul and whose reference groups were often their friends living inSeoul, were concerned about their children's education and wanted to move toKangnam (the South ofHan River inSeoul) toget a better education for them. To myinformants inNamyang, Kangnam signified the real jungsancheung oraffluent area with good schools and well-educated residents but atthe same time Kangnam was analien city with morally corrupt and extravagant real estate riches. Many of mymiddle-class informants inNamyang actually did not dream ofmoving to the Kangnam because they did not think iteconomically affordable. Inthe most affluent group ofDeungdai there were five women who were intheir late thirties and two intheir early forties, living inthe most recently built highrise spacious apartments. These mothers were all college graduates and considered themselves asaffluent people associating with the wives ofdoctors, lawyers, and business men inNamyang. They understood the psychology and anxiety ofmarried women 62interms ofwomen's age and their family life cycle. Two women were busy with their own social activities such as taking photographs and voluntary counselling inacivil organization while two women said that they were happy at home and proud ofbeing born aswomen. These two women said that they never dreamed ofbeing born asmen who had to struggle inthe outside world and felt sorry for women whose fate was sostrong that they had towork outside for family and themselves. Awoman inthe middle position between out going and indoor-keeping summarized women's lives asthe following: \"No matter what weare spending our time outside or inside home now, weall have been going through similar lives. Uptothe early thirties after marriage women are very busy with setting upthe family, giving birth, and meeting the demands ofyoung children; from the mid thirties women begin toknow the value and enjoyment of ahousewife asthe family isgetting socially and economically settled down. The husbands are busy in establishing their careers and the children are in school sowomen can have their own time. Atthe same time some anxieties come up, somany women come out of the house tohave social activities orfun; women in their forties lose their interest inspending money or running around for fun orhobby and begin tofeel life isinvain. Nowadays you cannot reach any women onthe 63telephone inthe daytime. Every woman isbusy and trying tocatch ontime and toforget their age.\" The most interesting point ofthese women's narratives about themselves and other women's lives was directed tothe generality and homogeneity ofbeing awoman despite the differences ofwomen's education, socio-economic status, and life stage. Their references for theuniversality ofwomen come from other women who are neighbors, friends, family members and sometimes socially known female celebrities. No matter what awoman is, the assumption isthat her essence isperforming her role ofwife and mother: awoman should be feminine because aman and awoman areoriginally different. Actually many women showed hatred towards working mothers and some women recalled their mothers ormothers-in-law who had worked outside, stating that they were not feminine or motherly enough, and were aggressive, making their husbands dispirited. Next, myquestion iswhat divides women's world soclearly and sharply from men's world, what part of women's experiences constitutes women's commonality, and what kind ofsocial and cultural forces select certain experiences asthe most significant inperceiving their authentic gender. F.Womanhood: Ultimately bounded within married reproductive bodies All of myinformants saw marriage asthe most 64important, critical rite ofpassage intheir lives, remarking that awoman's real life starts after marriage particularly after giving birth toachild: depending on whom awoman marries, her life becomes different. Middle class informants never questioned the necessity ofmarriage. Unmarried women after honki (nubility ormarriageable age) were considered immature, strange and slightly abnormal, or were thought tohave some physical oremotional problems in getting married. Thus, one of myinformants said tomethat they discussed why Iwas not married and thought Imight have aserious unrealized love. One ofthe most common comments onmarriage was that marriage gave women mental stability. Inaddition, some informants said that they matured and got healthy after marriage, while they were always dependent onparents and brothers and physically weak with frequent headaches before marriage. Ofcourse atthe same time many women complained about their weakness and ill-health interms ofchild birth after marriage; however, the discourse ofgaining healthy bodies and astable mentality iscommonly mentioned not only bywomen themselves but bydoctors and male elders. When unmarried nubile women gotoclinics forunspecific symptoms, male doctors usually donot take their physical complaints seriously, telling them tomarry and then all symptoms will disappear. When Iasked women why they got married, they laughed at myabsurd question and said that 65they wanted tolive a\"normal life.\" Some women remain single butitisnot seen asnormal. Thus, asingle woman can becelebrity, but people believe she might beleft miserable and disregarded inher old age. That's the reason, people think, some celebrated single women got married in their old age. Marriage isdirectly related topregnancy. All the married women who Iinterviewed said that married women should have achild. This implies that giving birth to children isnot elective but obligatory for married women. Myinformants said that there were nomarried couples who planned not tohave babies. However, myinformants did not plan their pregnancies atmarriage, either, except Kim Inwha who was amiddle school teacher when she married. Most of them got pregnant immediately and had so-called honeymoon babies. Women usually fixed marriage dates inthe middle of their menstruation period toavoid menstruation before and after marriage ceremony. That tallied with ovulation period. Many women did not know about contraception and were expected tobesexually inexperienced, naive, and ignorant. Even women who did not want tohave babies immediately and knew about contraception, could not discuss contraception before marriage lest their husbands become suspicious oftheir sexual experience. Sexual matters were inmen's control atmarriage and the opening and development ofwomen's sexuality were left tohusband. And these men 66usually did not care about contraception atmarriage. No middle-class informants mentioned abortions before marriage (although they may not have been telling the truth) even though inseveral cases marriage ceremonies were performed in arush because ofpregnancies (socalled sokdowipan meaning 'speed violation'). Some women who had honeymoon babies were afraid that Imight think they had premarital relations, and clarified this. Thus, for middle-class married women who lived with their husbands after marriage, pregnancies were expected and considered tobenatural events. Inaddition, there were very strong cultural, social, and psychological pressures for women tobear children. This pressure has todowith the idea that women are not physically able tohave babies except during acertain age around the mid-twenties; therefore, they should finish having babies nolater than age thirty, whereas men's ability toimpregnate has nolimit ofage. Women who married intheir late twenties orat thirty mentioned that they married solate that they wanted tohave ababy assoon aspossible. The pressure, conflicts, and supports from in-laws and natal families for middle class women are interestingly manifested inthe organization oftheir experience ofeveryday life, which isdifferent from and contrasts with working class women (see chapter 674).\" Amother-in-law who wanted tohave agrandson frequently asked there any news?\" Awoman said that thefirst four months of married life felt like four years until shefinally became pregnant. Amother-in-law, who encouraged herdaughter-in law tobear ason, said, \"Do not worry, relax because Iand your sister-in-law dreamed ofpepper (the symbol ofpenis in Korea) for you.\" Another mother-in-law forced awoman toget anabortion because she itwas atraditional omen ofmisfortune. Inaddition, mothers-in-law, who were ofin-law families, were participating inmyinformants' pregnancies invarious ways because the reproduction ofsons' and daughters-in-law belonged tothe family; thus, some mothers in-law bought Chinese tonic for fetuses; some urged their sons not tohave vasectomies; some pressured couples tohave more children, pressured their sons' girl friends orwives toabort their pregnancies for breakup ordivorce. Thus, once amarried woman got pregnant, her reproductive body became abattlefield ofidentities as wife, daughter-in-law, and mother. Many women experienced the process ofpregnancy and giving birth as Kim Inwha wanted toget late because her future husband was a student atthat time, sothey could not economically afford married life. However her future mother-in-law, who had cancer, wanted them toget married before she died. 68biological, cultural, and social rite ofachieving womanhood. One woman said, \"since Igot pregnant and knew the pain ofgiving birth toalife, Ihave felt sorry for unmarried women's confidence, cheerfulness, and naivete because oftheir immaturity.\" The hegemonic discourse of being areal woman through pregnancy orgiving birth represents the ultimate difference between men and women, confirming the anatomical differences. Men and women are divided andstrictly bounded from the beginning bybiology. There isastrong implication underlying myinformants' discourses that nomatter what kind oflives and problems they and other women have, women are basically the same and cannot help escaping women's destiny aslong as'we' are women. Here again sex and gender become identical and cultural and social womanhood was reduced tobiology. The legitimate, clear, intelligible, empirical common matrix originates from the fact that all women get married, pregnant, and finally become mothers. This female biological fact points out the sameness of womanhood. Because ofthis sameness women suffer from conflicts, frustrations, and uncertainties when they encounter other women's differences. Inthe following chapter, Iexplore why the discourse ofwomen's bodies constructs the idea ofsameness between gender and sex, reducing the female gender tofemale biology and denying the differences among women. 69Chapter 3.Making Women's Reproduction aSickness\": The Medicalization ofPregnancy and Childbirth [But] for woman herself, she isalways positioned within the corporeal significance ofher material embodiment. She isplaced, or'naturalized, \"within the endless mutations offemininity's masquerades. These symbolic representational demands plot the real dimensions through which her life islived, understood, and hence truly fathomed inits actual significance. Inthis chapter Idiscuss the way inwhich Korean middle-class women's pregnancies are socially organized and experienced asthe factual truth ofbeing awoman. Awoman who performs therite ofpassage tofemale adulthood, (i.e. goes through the marriage ceremony) begins tolive with her husband and gets pregnant immediately. Korean women, particularly unmarried women, are forced todisplay \"proper\" bodily conduct. The cultural idea ofchosinhada or tancho'nghan momkachim (\"proper conduct\") discursively disciplines and social and physical boundaries ofwomen's bodies interms oftheir movements, location and exposure toknowledge. Ultimately ideological and bodily practices ofsexuality are the which mediates between illness and disease (Frankenberg 1980, 1986: Young 1982). concept of 'sickness' isdifferent from the apoliticalimplication ofKleinman's explanatory model ofclinical anddisease (1980: 72-73). 70\"innocent\" femininity, women consciously orunconsciously resist even being informed about sexuality and thedetails oftheir reproductive physiology before marriage. Many unmarried women refuse even tolook atpictures showing women's sexual and reproductive organs and child birth inpublic, making comments like, \"Ahyul chingku' ro'wo' (Oh yugh and repulsive.) \"Not only unmarried women prevent themselves from being exposed tosexual and reproductive knowledge, but married people (so-called \"adults\") also protect unmarried women from being contaminated byadult affairs. Sometimes unmarried women wanted to know what happened tomarried friends' bodies onthefirst night of their marriage, but these friends, after coming back from their honeymoon, told their unmarried friends: \"You will get toknow all about itwhen you get You could not understand iteven ifItold you.\" Anumber ofwomen read women's magazines and books but some women told methat they came tounderstand what they read only after marriage. Unmarried women who had sexual and reproductive experiences before marriage did not regard their experience as legitimate sothey could not talk about ittoother people. Those experiences and the related problems were not discussed until their sexual/reproductive behavior was legitimized within theinstitution ofmarriage. The discursive practices that emerge from Korean cultural ideology about unmarried women's chastity and 71sexual innocence keep women from knowing their sexual and reproductive organs; such practices also construct \"well brought-up\" middle-class women's conduct and consciousness about their bodies. Instead ofacquiring knowledge about their reproductive functions inadvance ofmarriage, itisa virtue for women tosay that they donot know anything. They usually say that Iwill get toknow these things after marriage. Inthis case, marriage for awoman means that she receives the social permission, the right, and the obligation tohave sex with her husband and toget pregnant. Many unmarried women expect that they will know \"it (implying mainly sexuality related things)\" naturally. They assume that their husbands know more about sexuality and women's bodies than women. This idea comes from the cultural assumption that men's sexual desire isinnate, sothe men have experienced \"yocha (women; orsleeping with women)\" before the marriage ceremony. However, some ofmyinformants found that their husbands did not know any more about sex and women's bodies than they themselves did after marriage. The women, who expected their husbands would guide and take care oftheir sexual relations and contraception, come to depend onmedical doctors, popular books and women's magazines tosolve their problems. Inthis chapter, Idescribe the way inwhich women's pregnancies are institutionalized and how the hegemony of Western medicine onwomen's bodies invades the existing 72social relations ofpregnant women inthe Korean family. I also delineate the ways inwhich pregnant women themselves experience their gender position inobstetrical settings where women are treated asananatomical category ofhuman being. Bydoing so, Iexplore the way inwhich women locate their factual and bodily experiences ofreproduction in constructing their ideas ofwhat itistobe awoman. That is, Iaddress how women's biology and the ideas about female gender are constituted inKorean middle-class women's lives. A.Married Bodies: From Cultural Surveillance onUnmarried Women's Sexuality toSocial Pressure onMarried Women's Pregnancy (1) Innocent and modest maiden Atmarriage, women's youth and innocence are highly valued asthe most important virtues for abride-to-be. Itis believed inKorea that men and women should get married at honki (the marriageable age, which for women istheir early tomid-twenties and for men, intheir late twenties) in order tosettle down and have ababy. Honki istaken seriously especially for women mainly because itisassumed that women's physical ability tobear healthy children isat peak capacity intheir twenties but young women's virtues of innocence and modesty are also considered important because women's innocence isproportionate toage. Itissaid that less-informed women \"less informed\" means isnot clear but implies an 73innocence about men and the sphere ofmen that isrelated to sexuality, public activities and worldly affairs. Awoman out ofhonki isconsidered tohave OhInsook, who had an arranged marriage atthe age oftwenty-two, was told byher husband after marriage that heliked her atthefirst meeting because she looked sosunchinhada (innocent). The virtue ofinnocence was presented asvery important by the women Iinterviewed. Many of myinformants said that their husbands liked them because they were good women who displayed the virtue ofsunchinhada and had good hearts. Most ofmyinformants had married intheir mid-twenties and some intheir late twenties except for two women who had married atthe age ofthirty. Most became pregnant immediately after marriage. These women began their stories byemphasizing how innocent they were when they married. They focused inparticular ontheir lack ofknowledge about women's reproductive physiology. Most ofmyinformants, except for two who had been registered nurses, told methat they did not know anything except the \"fact\" that women got pregnant ifthey slept with men. Some women who said that they had had knowledge ofwomen's physiology, (i.e., understood the function ofmenstruation, the ovulation cycle, the location ofthe womb and the vagina before marriage), had derived their knowledge from ahome economics class inhigh school, novels, women's magazines, friends, or 74older sisters. However, one former registered nurse, Na Hyunmee, commented concerning these women's narrations that she did not believe that the knowledge that many women gleaned from ahigh school class could beoperational when women got married. She added that the information and knowledge were not practical andrealistic enough for unmarried women tounderstand the effects ofsexual relations upon women's bodies. Consciously orunconsciously women felt that even knowing much about the working ofwomen's bodies would violate the cultural demand for unmarried women's innocence. Many people, especially men, look unfavourably upon women who have much sexual orreproductive knowledge bythinking ofthem as\"experienced,\" which means \"polluted.\" Women, especially unmarried women, are not supposed tohave knowledge ofsexuality and reproduction. Inaddition, unmarried women are not expected togoto OB &GYN clinics because itisbelieved that only women who have had sexual relations with men have business going to OB &GYN clinics. Only one informant inmyresearch mentioned that she had been toan OB &GYN clinic before marriage. Her mother had taken her tothe clinic totreat her menstrual irregularity and weak health. Usually inKorea when unmarried daughters have the problem ofmenstrual irregularity orhave severe premenstrual pain, mothers goto aChinese herb clinic and buy some herbal medicine for their daughters. 75Ineveryday discourse, awoman's body, \"mom,\" usually refers toasexually-specified female body, i.e. awoman's sexuality. The cultural gaze onwomen's bodies focuses on the management and control ofwomen's sexualized bodies. One of myinformants, Kim Hyunsuk, said that when her husband kissed her during dating inthe mid-1970s she thought she had tomarry him. Another woman insisted that she and her future husband did not even hold hands during dating until they decided toget married. Therefore, atanideological level, when awoman had sexual relations aman, Itisstill an effective discourse inbinding relationships between men and women even though premarital sexuality isbecoming avisible practice inKorean society inthe early 1990s. Even mymarried women informants still considered being sunchinhada (innocent) avery important female virtue. The women presented themselves asiftheir bodies did not belong tothem and they did not have any sexual orreproductive knowledge. KaYunhee, who got pregnant before the marriage ceremony, said that itwas her husband who sensed the change ofher body and found out that she was pregnant even before she realized itherself. Park Moonwhan, like several other women, said, \"Istill donot know much about \"that kind of stuff\" Igave birth totwo children.\" Even Chun Kyoungok, school teacher who married in1987 and 76regarded herself asanequal with her husband, said, \"my husband was at mypregnancy but hetried Chun Kyoungok had anarranged marriage and her husband and she did not discuss any contraception orreproductive plans before marriage. Apart from the couples who had arranged-marriages, however, even many couples who had married for love did not discuss sexuality orcontraception during dating orbefore marriage. Kim Hyunsuk said; \"my husband and Isaw each other for awhile and married without talking orthinking much about love orfondness. Later Ilearned that many men and women had [sexual] relations during their dating period.\" Most of myinformants recalled how sunchinhada they were; they had not known what happened between men and women when dating before marriage. These women assumed that their husbands would know more about women's bodies but were surprised torealize that their husbands did not know more than they did, and some husbands knew less than the women. Although many women worried and confronted problems after marriage, women's naivete wasstill recommended asthe highest virtue for women before marriage. The fact that women had experienced premarital sex or apregnancy and knew 77about \"that stuff\" was considered shameful.\" Some women who had sexual relations before marriage felt strong cultural and social forces that regulated and stigmatized their experiences bypushing them into arushed marriage ceremony. Song Meeja got married inthe fourth month ofher pregnancy. She explained her situation inthe following way: Ialways \"love' and when Iwas ajunior incollege. Ihad knowledge about the ovulation cycle and was careful about the menstrual cycle but did not use any contraceptives and got pregnant. Atfirst, Ihad not thought about pregnancy but felt something strange about mybody and went toan OB &GYN clinic for apregnancy test. The doctor, who misinterpreted theresult ofthe test, told methat I was not pregnant. Iwas relieved and forgot about my body. Ifthe doctor did not make anerror indiagnosis, *One mother inher early forties said exact function ofitbut feeling that Iwas not what Ihad been. But my twelve-year-old daughter asked mewhy she had not had menarche yet, worrying whether she might not have ababy.\" This mother, Choi Soonyoung, wondered whether her daughter knew what she was talking about, implying that she was such anaive and innocent girl. *Theliteral meaning ofsokdoweeban isspeed violation when driving. Itis akind ofslang referring topregnancies before marriage ceremony, the metaphoric meaning that they gotoo fast. 78Imight have had anabortion immediately and would not have had ahard life like this. Imissed myperiod for two months and Iwent toabig hospital and found out that Iwas inthe Ithought it and Ihad Imight through my life ifIaborted thefirst pregnancy. SoIdecided to marry myboy friend. Mymiddle-class informants did not talk about sexual relations and abortions before marriage asmuch asworking class mothers did (see chapter 4). Some class differences in the passage through life as avirgin are noticeable when comparing middle-class women inapartment complexes and working-class women in apoor district. The middle-class women were more protected from going out with men freely than working-class women because the middle-class women attended schools, worked inoffices from nine tofive and lived with their families until they married (see working class women's situation inchapter 4). Therefore, middle class women have agreater chance ofadhering toand practicing the ideology ofwomen's \"proper bodily the middle-class women's life stories asanindicator ofgreater conservativeness in dating and premarital sexual activity than working-class women. Instead, Iunderstand the women's aspart ofthe discourse ofmiddle femininity, whether these stories were factual ornot. Inaddition, many married women extended the discourse ofmodest conduct toapply totheir married state. KaYunhee, who had achild and used avaginal pill spermicide (nowon), which had been the most widely advertised commercial contraceptives for the 1980s inKorea, said, \"Istill donot know exactly where mywomb and period is.\" The cultural paradigm of\"innocent and asexual\" unmarried women and virtuous middle-class wives inKorean society positions KaYunhee and other middle-class women's way ofnarrating their experiences. Here, what Iamconcerned with isnot the matter ofthe truth oftheir stories, but the effect ofculturally regulated narratives of\"proper\" female conduct upon the social relations that pertain towomen's bodies. That is, I wish toexplore what happens when these women have gone through sexual and reproductive experiences before and after the marriage ceremony. Iwill also discuss how the women understand and deal with their female anatomic specificity while they arestill innocent and uninformed about their bodies. In the following, Iaddress the women's way of understanding theinstitutional powers deployed with respect totheir sexualized and reproductive bodies after marriage. These powers are mediated through the women's prior bodies which are culturally regulated \"young,\" \"innocent, \"and at 80the same time \"vulnerable\" and \"fertile\" maiden bodies. (2) Pregnant bellies: Married bodies and sexed bodies Anunmarried woman's pregnancy issocially and culturally unacceptable and even unthinkable. The social stigma and the outlawing ofpremarital pregnancy are reflected in aKorean maxim used inabsurd situations: \"alas !you behave like apregnant maiden who has even something tosay!\" Pregnancy outside marriage isdirectly associated with illegitimate bodily conduct. Therefore, women's pregnancies are culturally and socially recognized only when founded within marriage, which legitimizes women's sexpractices. Three of mymiddle-class informants who had premarital pregnancies went through their wedding ceremonies before their pregnancies were visible toother people. Thus, the marriage ceremony for analready pregnant woman was intended tofend off the gaze that rendered awoman's sexed body illegitimate. The marriage ceremony lets the man who impregnated the woman secure her pregnant body. Recently many people say that the society ischanging tothe extent that couples can have premarital sexual relations ifthey conduct their marriage ceremony before the belly becomes visible toother people. Getting pregnant for married women isconsidered normal andnatural. Most ofmyinformants conceived ababy during their honeymoon. Among myinformants only one person, Kim 81Inwha, said that she used acontraceptive during the honeymoon trip. Yum Sukhee's husband did not expect tohave ababy right after marriage and said that his wife seemed to marry him toget pregnant asher belly was getting bigger with nausea and morning sickness. However, Yum Sukhee, like many other women, accepted her enlarging belly asexpected and natural for amarried woman without feeling either shame orexcitement. NaHyunmee, the former registered nurse who married atthe age ofthirty, also said that she accepted her pregnancy asnatural; she wanted tohave ababy assoon aspossible because ofher old age. Most ofthe women expected getting pregnant and being amother as agiven identity orarole attached totheinstitution ofmarriage. Pregnancy isthe bodily ritual that elevates their status to adulthood and makes them enter into the real women's world onanequal footing with other matrons. Lee Kisuk said that she loved the feeling ofherfirst pregnancy and felt excited tohave ababy inher body. Atthe same time she felt satisfied that she had done asother women had done. To these women, the institutionalized self-as-married-woman was the most important identity inorganizing their lives. Thus, regardless oftheir experiential selves, assoon asthey pregnant, they began topractice theinstitutional behaviors ofexpectant mothers. OhInsook, for example, was preparing cloth diapers for her fetus bybuying white cloth, sewing it byhand carefully and boiling ittosterilize the diapers 82and make them whiter. This image ofmarried women isradically different from the image that the married women had intheir maiden days. Most of myinformants, before marriage, wondered why pregnant women did not stay athome. They felt that pregnant women did not have any sense ofshame and honor inshowing their swollen bellies inpublic. Here, when unmarried women mentioned the sense ofshame and honor, they were not concerned directly with the body shape ofpregnancy but with sex which marks the borderline between innocent maidens and adult women. Park Meejeon felt ashamed infront ofher father, brothers and other older male relatives when she became pregnant thefirst time and wondered how other women dealt with other people's (especially men's) eyes upon their swollen bellies. Kim Hyunsuk said, \"at finding out that I was pregnant, Iwas full ofjoy but inanother sense Ifelt embarrassed bythe evidence that Ihad a(sexual) relation with aman.\" These women's embarrassment and shame came from the interrelationship between marriage, sexuality and pregnancy for women: their innocent and asexual bodies had been transformed into married and sexual bodies and sexuality was verified tosociety through their pregnancies. The married women's bodies, which were supposed tobe unsexed before marriage, were now considered tobesexed and belonging toreal yocha (women). Many ofthe women recalled their conflicted feelings atbeing amarried woman during 83their first pregnancy; onthe one hand, they felt the security and achievement ofadult status, but onthe other, they felt embarrassment attheir status ofhaving sex. However, the institution ofmarriage shaped women's experience ofpregnancy asamatter ofnatural fact and as a social progression intheir life cycle, leaving their innocent maiden sentiment behind. Nam Jungsoon said that after marriage she came tounderstand married women because she also had togoout with apregnant body. However she did not feel ashamed ofitbecause pregnancy was not an especially strange event but part ofon-going, everyday life for amarried woman. Not only did marriage legitimize women's sex, but also pregnancy provided evidence that the marriage was socially institutionalized. Marriage, sexuality and reproduction are intertwined with each other asorganic components ofthe institution ofmarriage for women in Korea. Myinformants took their institutional selves for granted and did not find adiscrepancy and contradiction between their experiential bodies and their social selves. Very few women mentioned feelings ofconflict with respect totheir bodies inmarriage, sexuality, and reproduction. Only one school teacher, Chun Kyoungok, who had anunwanted pregnancy, said that she could not accept the changes inher body, such asswelling breasts, severe vomiting, nausea, and the intolerance ofany strong smell. She regretted having 84the baby with ahusband whom she did not actually know well. Compared with awoman who stayed athome asa housewife, awoman who was working inthe public sphere experienced strong and critical social and cultural distinctions between anunmarried woman's body and amarried woman's body. The working women felt radically and qualitatively different treatment after marriage. Now her body was expected tobemarried, sexed and pregnant. For a full-time housewife, pregnancy was expected and secured in marriage, despite the gaze upon her loss ofinnocence. However, the woman who was inthe public sphere experienced astrong cultural regimentation and control ofwoman's body, reacting with afeeling ofshame, perplexity and understanding who was ateacher inamiddle school inaprovincial city at the time ofher marriage in1983, said Iwas ashamed and afraid ofgetting pregnant atthat time and could not imagine that Icould gotoschool with mypregnant belly. Right after Icame back to school from aone-week vacation for myhoneymoon, Iwas very conscious ofmybodily conduct and always wondered howgirls, other male colleagues, and myboss, avice principal of myschool, looked atmefrom behind. second-grade girls inmiddle school, itwas abig event that anunmarried attitudes toward mehad 85changed before andafter mymarriage. They admired and loved their unmarried female teachers, who symbolized a sort ofchastity, purity, and disinterested compassion for students, but after marriage the image descended into that of akind ofprivate individual who was sexually contaminated and diverted attention toprivate affairs, focusing onher husband and children. Married women are considered tobeoccupied with their family concerns rather than with social and public interests. When Idecided upon mymarriage, Icould nottell my students, worrying that Iwould hurt them. But students always knew everything inadvance. After marriage I felt that thegirls were looking at mybelly and Iwas afraid ofwhat they were talking about with each other behind myback. Already-married female teachers were not the subject ofthis kind ofgaze, but the change in status ofunmarried female teachers tothe married state was the subject oftheir surveillance. Iwas also very conscious ofwhether ornot some changes body bevisible. month, any more asIbecome accustomed tothe identity ofmarried woman through associating with married female teachers. Another school teacher inSeoul, Chun Kyoungok, was very nervous when she realized that she was carrying a honeymoon baby. Shefelt ashamed, imagining that other 86people thought ofher asstupid and careless about her body. She also became disturbed about the possibility that other people might think she got pregnant before the marriage ceremony. Her boss, avice principal, remarked that she had better plan the pregnancy after she adjusted herself toher new work environment. Itwas herfirst teaching job. Pregnant women who worked inpublic settings strongly sensed the silent investigative gaze about their private lives. These women felt that their individualities disappeared but the identity ofmarried women were transacted inall situations after they married. Female bodies visible inpublic should properly beunmarried since many Korean people think that itisgood for women towork before marriage just asan\"experience.\" The proper location ofmarried women issupposed tobeathome. Some upper middle-class informants living inGocheung Usung Apart commented that married women could work outside todevelop their own interests after their children grow up. Choi Unkyung said, \"Ihave pity for pregnant women working in banks orschools. How much money could they make by neglecting all their housework, carrying abelly like a mountain inapublic place?\" Married women, particularly pregnant women atwork, were considered tobeculturally improper and socially misplaced. Song Meeja, who was pregnant as ajunior incollege, said that she got nervous about her body and wore acorset 87and binder tohide her belly asher belly started toget bigger. Two of myinformants who were teachers said that they were always thinking about whether they had toquit their job ornot because they could not begood atboth housework and work. They identified themselves as amarried woman, wife and mother and their concerns about their position were deeply embedded inthe family, although they imagined that people blamed them not only for neglecting the role ofwife and mother but also the role ofteacher. The social forces which pushed married and pregnant women into a domestic sphere practiced discursively tomake women look at themselves not asindividuals but asthe representation of the social body within marriage. Therefore, some women -- who wanted toretain their individuality while they trafficked between private and public spheres and carried pregnant bodies --encountered unwelcome gazes upon their pregnant bellies inthe public sphere. These women felt embarrassed, ashamed, and improper. \" *Pregnancy andchild birth constrain women's participation in the public sphere. Ingeneral, women's participation inpublic sphere isnot considered for Kyung-Mi Joo's article, 'A of from the Profession: ACase Study onMedical Doctors (1992: 175) describes the strong pressure for female interns and residents not toget pregnant during their training period. These women's pregnancies were seen asbeing selfish behavior. However, when these women wanted tobeemployed inhospitals asspecialists, the female doctors who were married and mothers, with one or two children, were preferred (Joo does not describe the reason butithappens as arule. ). Therefore, Joo said that female doctors need some gutsMyinformants, who were shaped bythe cultural discourse of\"proper modest women,\" entered into marriage, during which their bodies were entitled tohave the function ofsexuality and reproduction. They accepted their pregnancies asthe natural and necessary part oftheir identity asmarried women. Inthe following section, Ishow how ideas about modernization prevalent ineveryday life and the hegemony ofWestern medicine indealing scientifically with human bodies have constructed the definition of \"healthy\" and \"normal\" babies and have institutionalized women's pregnancies and childbirth, putting pregnancies into the sick role inneed ofmedical care. B.Medicalizing Pregnancies: From Liminality toSick bodies and fertile bodies: From Mothers-in-law tomedical control Conflicts and frequent interactions with in-law families were commonly reported bymiddle-class women. These aspects ofthe women's everyday lives differed conspicuously from the lives ofYaksan working mothers. Kim Inwha 's mother-in-law put pressure onher tohave ababy. Meanwhile, she used several contraceptives for thirteen months because she had tokeep her job inorder tomake aliving and to support her husband's graduate studies. The mother-in-law tomarry and get pregnant, ignoring others' criticism inthe second orthird year ofresidency. 89became suspicious that she might beinfertile, which she indicated byasking what was the matter with her when other women who had gotten married later than she had already given birth. Kim Inwha decided toget pregnant as afilial duty toher parents-in-law and hence stopped using condoms. Then, she got symptoms ofvomiting and nausea, and went to an OB &GYN clinic toconfirm her pregnancy. Butitturned out tobe aspurious pregnancy. After marriage (marriage literally means \"entering into in-law families\") women felt uncomfortable about their position and their continuous negotiations with mothers-in law with respect tohousework responsibility, sharing concerns about their husbands and their children's education, etc. This kind ofconflict became more intense when the women entered into the in-law family and lived with them. Recently, young Korean women have preferred not to marry thefirst son, who issupposed totake care ofhis parents. Many middle-class women simply donot wish tolive with parents-in-law and take over all housekeeping work in the in-law family. Ingeneral, when anewly-married daughter-in-law enters into anin-law family tolive with them, amother-in-law shifts all housekeeping work ontothe daughter-in-law, except insome cases where daughters-in-law are full-time workers outside. Therefore, myinformants who had lived with their in-law families recalled with resentment the excessive housework and its effects upon 90their pregnancies and babies. Kim Youngmee said, Assoon asIgot married, Ientered into myhusband's family. There were parents-in-law, myhusband's unmarried four sisters and one brother. The house was anexpanded and improved one inJapanese colonial style, with coal briquettes for heating. Ihad to change 12coal briquettes aday inwinter. Every morning Ihad tomake several lunch boxes for the four sisters-in-law and one brother-in-law, wash their clothes, clean upthe house. Mymother-in-law gave all the housekeeping work tome. Ontop ofthat, the status ofdaughter-in-law made mesonervous and drove meinto depression. Thus, not only physical labor but also psychological stress influenced the growth ofthe fetus inme, tothe point that adoctor asked mewhether I had ahard job working outside when Iwent tothe doctor for prenatal check-ups. The doctor said that he could sense the fetus had \"hardened\" because the fetus was under the same pressure that Iwas under. He recommended that Itake some rest. Around that time, my weight was 39kg. Another informant stated that she had been given injections for smooth delivery; since the third month ofher pregnancy, the fetus had been \"hardened\" like astone. She said that she gave birth toapremature baby of2.2 kg, a circumstance that was caused byher hard life inthe in-law 91family. Those women who had just gotten pregnant felt bad at discovering that the mothers-in-law, who wished somuch for babies, did not treat their daughters-in-law's pregnancies as abody condition that required special care and help. Kim Youngmee said, Igot strong implicit and explicit pressures tobear a child from the in-law family. Igot pregnant three or four months after mymarriage. But Ifelt asifithad taken three orfour years because mymother-in-law was soanxious tohear that Iwas pregnant. She sounded out whether Iwas pregnant invarious ways, soIbecame very nervous, longing for she really wanted tohave agrandchild. However, mymother-in changed when Igot pregnant. She treated mypregnancy assonormal, did not help with any housework, and seemed tofeel atease with me. In contrast, she was alittle bit constrained before my pregnancy. Assoon as awoman was married, she was pressured to get pregnant right after marriage toshow herfertility. The woman was greeted with: \"No good news has come yet?\" or\"You look like you have good news, right?\" from both families, acquaintances, and friends. However, the daughter-in-law realized that all they wished for was the baby for her husband's family and their concern was not for her physical discomfort, weariness orwell-being. Many women felt that 92in-law family members were not concerned with their health and anxieties. OhInsook described the contradictory attitudes ofmothers-in-law who showed strong preoccupation with pregnancy but did not help with housework and treated the sufferings oftheir daughters-in-law aspain that an adult woman deserved. OhInsook said, Myhusband was the youngest inhis family, but welived (actually served: mosida) his parents. Myparents in-law said they would take care ofusfor 6 months toteach metheir family tradition. Even though six months passed, they did not let usset up anew household. Iserved them for four years. Ireally wanted tomove out of house will, that wewill not inherit his property. Atthat time, Idid not really care about inheritance and property; Isimply wanted tolive with our own family (urisikgu). But myhusband, who is always agood son tohis parents, said tometowait for alittle time, adding that being nice isgood for everybody. Hedid not want tohurt his old father's feelings. Mymother-in-law was sometimes very nice and bought abig carp sothat she could feed meits soup *[]:byauthor 93when she heard about myfirst pregnancy. That soup is supposed tobegood for morning sickness. However, she did not doany physical work, sowhen Igot pregnant with mysecond child, Ifainted from the overwork involved indoing housework and loss ofappetite because ofmorning sickness. Myhusband told metomake oxtail soup and eatitfor nourishment but how could I make itbymyself and eat itinthe in-law family. My natal father was angry, telling metocome home but I could not goto was 2.5 kg atbirth. Iworry that mysecond child might have abad personality because of mynervousness and malnutrition during pregnancy. When awoman entered the in-law family, she experienced many conflicts and frustration, especially with mothers-in law, who cared first about their sons and thought oftheir daughters-in-law asthe sons' dependents. For amiddle-class agent inthelineality ofthe family, sothe mothers-in-law's concerns about offspring are exerted directly upon daughters-in-law. The conflicts and tensions between thepatrilineal system and newly married women are represented asconflicts between women (the wives oftheir sons) and women (mothers-in-law) instead ofbetween women and male ofthe family. Atthe same time, 94through thelife ofthe in-law family, the women experienced and embodied the socially inferior status ofwomen and the necessity for married women tobear ason. That isthe reason, many women said, why they cried when they gave birth todaughters inhospitals. They said that instinctively they felt that their daughters would have the same destiny as they had had (see the following section 4inthis chapter). Many women also mentioned that they did not understand their mothers-in-law's attachment toand control over their sons until they had had sons and reared them. Under astrong patriarchal family system, women gradually internalized and began topractice the existing hierarchy ofthe gender system within the family (see the following section 4). The narratives offered bywomen who felt anger toward their mothers-in-law because they did not pay much attention to their pregnant bodies are specific tothe middle-class in urban areas in1990. The working-class women's stories, in which their husbands are the only available caregivers during their pregnancies, display adifferent pictures of family relations (see chapter 4). Today, family life inKorea isbecoming centered onthe nuclear family, composed ofwife, husband and children. Many women said that itwas acomfortable and efficient way to live with their families ofprocreation asurisikgu (our family). KaYunhee did not want tovisit her in-law family, saying that seeing them created more problems and conflicts. 95Living inthe same house isimportant indefining the boundary ofurisikgu. For many people, urisikgu meant a family living together. Thus, many of myinformants did not consider their in-law family astheir urisikgu ifthey lived separately. These women's wish tolive with only their families was sostrong that one informant said that she quit her work because she could not stand living with her mother in-law, who was living with them just totake care ofher baby, ather husband's request. She therefore, the mother-in-law moved tothe first son's house. The conflict between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law is one ofthe classic and much discussed family problems in Korea. Itiscommonly said inKorea that women donot like anything attached tothe prefix of\"in-law\" nomatter what itis.AChinese doctor, Dr. Lee, said that hesaw many women who had hwa pyo'ng (fire disease) *Dr. Lee medicine which iseffective inclearing thecirculation system for these visiting women. Concerning the conflicts between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, hecommented that the more money mothers-in-law had, the happier relations daughters-in-law had with mothers-in law. Dr. Lees' comment isbased who might inanurban are usually intheir forties orfifties. Ifhetakes daughters-in-law's position, the situation may bereversed. Concerning fire disease, Kleinman explained Chinese huo-ch'i asasomatic illness inthe Western medical category isalmost the same asKleinman's even though Dr. Lee mentioned that Chinese medicine was acompletelydifferent system from the Western medicine. However, hewas quite confused about this issue, often explaining the Chinese medicine with the Western medical terminology and category. 96with mothers-in-law. Cho Sukhyun also said that she had astill-born baby and amiscarriage due tohard work and tension from herin law family. Her grandfather-in-law, who let his second son see another woman tohave ason, told Cho Sukhyun atthe bride's first greeting ofthe elders-in-law after the marriage ceremony that the most critical role of adaughter in-law was togive birth to Ihad pregnancy. Iworked too much during mypregnancy because Ilived with my in-law family, including myhusband's grandparents, parents and his siblings inthe countryside. Around the due date, Itold mygrandmother-in-law that Iwas feeling labor but the grandmother said that such light labor was far from the pain ofchildbirth. Iendured the pain because Ihad never experienced child birth while she had done sobefore. Finally, Icould not stand itand rushed tothe clinics. Myhusband and I went tothree clinics because doctors were hesitant to let meintheir clinics. Adoctor told usthat the baby inmybody had already given upits milk cord and died. Iwas carrying adead baby for over aweek. After the still birth, Iwished togoto mynatal family myparents-in-law never take arest. Iask foritas 97woman who was incharge ofall the meals and housekeeping? The elders-in-law did not pay much attention tomeasifthestill birth were myfault and Ihad lost their offspring. Idid not have enough care after thestill birth. Mysecond pregnancy but instead ofconsoling me mygrandmother-in-law told methat daughters-in-law inother families gave birth easily, saying that she had fun ather friends' feasts for thefirst birthday oftheir grandchildren. My grandfather-in-law, bought Chinese herb tonic tonourish mybody. Pregnancy inKorea, asinmost traditional societies, has been agreat concern for the in-law family and has been considered aritual state (Kitzinger 1978 :66; Turner 1967) through which married women become incorporated into their husbands' family and would thus bean(ancestral) spirit in that family after death. Pregnancy isthe substantial link between the woman and the in-law family. Therefore, even the woman's natal family islooking forward tohearing about her pregnancy, which can substantiate and authorize their daughter's marriage. When women first got pregnant, they would bein aliminal state because the pregnant woman was in\"in-between\" the in-law family and her natal family, and nolonger avirgin but not yet afully-proven adult woman, a mother. Inthis context, elder women inthe in-law family regarded their daughter-in-law's pregnancy asakind of 98bodily ritual through which she was incorporated into their social body. The elders also tried tocontrol and discipline the newly-recruited woman intheir own way, mixing their empirical experiences with the medico-religious system of women's reproduction. However, through the national campaign ofmodernization --particularly the family planning policy that has emphasized stopping fertility --Western medicine has become hegemonic indealing with women's reproduction. Inaddition, this hegemonic Western medicine combined with urbanization and migration that dislocate migrants from the community or extended families, has resulted inthe medico-religious system for the care ofwomen's bodies being replaced by institutionalized Western medical practices. Thus, the pregnant woman's body, which has been intheritual state of liminality taken care ofbyelders, isput into the sick role, thereby eroding the cultural authority ofolder generations inWestern medical hospitals. Not only during pregnancy but also atchildbirth, the women experienced conflicts with mothers-in-law. Atthe same time, Western medicine-oriented care for women's bodies has diminished mothers-in-law's involvement inprenatal care and childbirth because Western medical doctors donot attend tomothers-in law's experiences. (see more inthe following section 3). Most of myinformants took care oftheir pregnant bodies by depending upon Western medicine, such as OB &GYN hospitals, 99and reading books and magazines written byWestern medical practitioners. Consultation with and information from the older generation including mothers ormothers-in-law were getting less significant. (2)Prenatal care: Pregnancy asasickness Many people regard awoman's pregnancy as process but the woman's pregnant body isbecoming institutionalized inthe Western medical clinics or hospitals. Currently the pregnancy isthe subject ofmedical measurements ofnormality/abnormality rather than being dealt with bythe medico-religious system, except with some practices oftaekyo up\"right\" and \"virtuous\" mind offetus. Inorder toeducate their fetuses, expectant mothers control their thinking, seeing, eating, and acting, and discipline their bodily conducts during pregnancy. However, recently women are informed about taekyo not bythe elder women inthe family but by commercial pregnancy manuals, and the purpose and the content oftaekyo are also changing from emphasis onthe constitution ofmoral nature for fetus tothe formation of \"normal body\" bycontrolling women's behaviors which cause deformity such asalcohol, smoking, drug, coffee, and soon. The biological state ofpregnancy itself does not lead towomen's bodies being put inthe sick role but the pregnancy as asickness reflects the contested social and 100political relations ofwomen's bodies. Song Meeja, who was a college student and had apremarital pregnancy, could not go tothe clinic for prenatal care because she was ashamed of sokdowiban (speed violation: slang meaning premarital pregnancy) combined with financial difficulties. Inthis section, Idescribe the ways inwhich women's pregnant bodies, medicine, socio-cultural ideas about female gender and cultural practices regarding women's reproduction are intertwined inconstructing urban middle-class women's concept ofprenatal care. OhInsook wanted todoher best for her baby when she found out she was pregnant. First, she wanted the medical care that other women provided for their babies. Like Oh Insook, many middle-class women wanted todothe best for their fetuses but they did not know what was the best except the standards that other people had set. Most ofmy informants said that they wanted tohave only afew children; therefore, they worried about how tohave \"healthy\" and \"normal\" babies. The most frequent discourse about their fetuses regarded \"healthiness\" and \"normality.\" Ofall the things amother could do, the medical care was believed tobethe most obvious, standardized, and visible measurement ofthe state of\"health\" and \"normality.\" Therefore, assoon asthe middle-class women got pregnant, they sought the help of aWestern medical OB &GYN specialist soastoconfirm their pregnancies and tobeable 101togive birth toahealthy baby. Inaddition, they read books and magazine articles onpregnancy, which were handed down from mothers todaughters inatraditional society. [see chapter 4inwhich Yaksan working mothers depended for their advice about their pregnancy upon kin, friends, and neighbors but not onbooks. I Asmore than half of mymiddle-class informants did, Cho Sukhyun went to afemale OB &GYN once every month after her pregnancy was confirmed. She said that her clinic did not have anultrasound machine but she had heard the sound ofher baby's heart beating. Most ofthe women mentioned that they got regular prenatal care; some since the pregnancy was confirmed; some after the sixth month; some every week during the last two months. Nomiddle-class woman in myresearch visited OB &GYNs less than two times for prenatal care. Depending onwhether they went tobig hospitals orlocal OB &GYN clinics, services women received for prenatal care differed but mostly women were interested inand counted onmeasurements such asultrasound, fetus the chromosomal abnormalities inthe fetus.\" The prenatal care automatically meant medical check ups, particularly associated with hospital orclinic \"Regarding prenatal care, thenational survey shows that 97.6% offirst births inthe urban area and 95.5% inthe rural area received prenatal care, but thedata donot indicate the frequency ofprenatal care. The survey also shows that the more education women had, the more prenatal care women got. (KIPH 1989 :150) 102specific services based onnew high-technology measurements and internal examinations. Few women mentioned their routine tests, such asweight measurement, position ofthe fetus, haemoglobin counts, other test ofblood, and urine test for sugar protein. Women's main concerns focused onthe 'normality\" or'health' offetuses: therefore, the most sophisticated technology tocheck the state ofthe fetus was enthusiastically embraced. So, ultrasound was the most conspicuously, frequently, and positively mentioned while vaginal examination was mentioned with much discomfort. When women visited clinics, they always wanted toknow whether the clinics had the ultrasound.\" Most women trusted the standardized results ofmedical technologies more than doctors' vaginal examination orphysical check-ups toknow the \"normality\" offetuses. Many thought that the state of\"health\" and \"normality\" had tobesomething visible through numbers orpictures. Therefore, even local clinics were expected tohave ultrasound equipment tomeet patients' expectations. Amidwife in apoor district complained that even \"poor\" women wanted totake ultrasound pictures when they visited the midwife's clinic. During my fieldwork, several newspapers carried reports complaining *Some OB &GYNs said that these days most OB &GYNs inlocal clinics had ultrasound machines because patients donot trust doctors not equipped with theultrasound. However, many doctors intheir forties orfifties were not formally trained toread thepicture ofultrasound, therefore, sometimes they misread thepicture even though they participated inuniversity hospitals workshops onultrasound. 103that the ultrasound insome clinics was just akind of demonstration machine topatients. One newspaper reported that the ultrasound inseveral Heath Centers inSeoul was dealt with bynurses, sothat anurse did not even find out about the death of afetus :She just told apregnant woman tocome back for next month (Hankyerai, 6/19/91). Nine women out oftwenty four attended general hospitals orbig OB &GYN specialized hospitals for prenatal care, and fifteen women got prenatal check-ups from the local OB &GYN clinics. The big hospitals were preferred because general hospitals have been thought toprovide good quality medical services, with sophisticated high-technology facilities, famous doctors, and aclean hygienic environment. Inaddition, the medical services were well administered and packaged, sowomen who did not know what was best for them could get services without difficulties. However, atthe experiential level, many women felt uncomfortable and humiliated even though they were seeking medical services for their fetuses. Particularly they thought that their vagina examination was uncomfortable and irritating, adding that some women miscarried because ofan internal examination attheearly period ofpregnancy.\" The \u00b0Medical doctors actually have different opinions about vagina examinations. Some female doctors said that there are tendencies not toexamine women's vaginas because check-ups forfetuses can be done using various equipment. However, one midwife in aworking class district said that many babies were born with eye diseases 104most dominant feeling that women had onvaginal examination was shame. Women's irritation, shame and shyness about the internal examination was related tothe cultural idea of women's sexual and reproductive organs. The women were caught inacontradictory feeling atthe OB &GYN clinics, which derived from cultural imperatives that women's sexual and reproductive organs are associated with the \"dirty,\" \"filthy\" and\"secretive\" and the norm that women's bodies should bepresented asclean, innocent, and modest. Therefore, itmade women feel embarrassment, shame, and vulnerability toshow the women's reproductive organs to other people for examination and treatment, violating the because women had infections intheir vaginas but doctors did not examine their vaginas. These women told her that women complained about itching during their visits for prenatal care, but doctors did not inspect their vaginas. One male university hospital doctor told methat heusually did internal examinations atthe secondvisit and before the estimated date ofchild birth. Hesaid, \"it is important for Korean women's inthe early period oftheir pregnancies tocheck for anygynecological problems because usually Korean women have never visited the gynecologicalclinics before getting pregnant. All the medical doctors did not agree that the internal examination could lead tomiscarriage. \"During fieldwork, When her, her daughter, three and half years old, wasjust taken from thebaby-sitter who was her in-law aunt inher early sixties living nearby. Myfriend, aprofessor in auniversity, said that her daughter began todespise other girls and pretended she was a boy, refusing towear askirt and wanting toattend children's martial class. When three ofus (myfriend, her husband and myself) were talking, the daughter suddenly ran tous and touched her mother's groin, frowning and saying that her and hermother's jamji (vulva) was dirty and smelly. However, she said that herfather's gochu (pepper) was all right, imitating old grannies' behavior of picking upthe gochu andputting into her mouth. Ithappened inaninstant. Myfriend worried that she behaved like her aunt with whom the daughter stayed all day long. 105sanctuary ofwomen's bodies. Italso made women feel that they were exposing 'it (women mentioned their genitals as \"lower part\" or\"it\" ),'neglecting all aspects of themselves and becoming nothing but apregnant womb in OB & GYN clinics. Thus, many women wanted tosee female doctors rather than male doctors. Chun Kyoungok looked for afemale doctor toconfirm her pregnancy because she wanted toask adoctor ofthe same sex about the change ofher body. However, she realized that the doctor was very cool and impersonal, treating her just as a patient inaprofessional way. After her pregnancy was confirmed, she moved to amale OB &GYN towhom she was introduced byher acquaintance. Like Chun Kyoungok, many women were disappointed that female doctors were not as sensitive tofemale problems asthey had expected. They found out that male and female doctors were almost the same intreating patients but some mothers said that women doctors were less kind and less competent than male doctors. After alternative visits tomale and female doctors, many women were not soconcerned with their modesty inchoosing a doctor. They found out that the issue was not the sex ofthe doctor but his orher competence. Women totally depended on doctors tofind out what was good for women inhospitals; therefore, doctors' competence was the most important factor that they had toconsider. However, the women's way ofnegotiating modesty and 106privacy with respect totheir bodies inmedical settings was somewhat different depending ontheir economic status, educational level and age. Ingeneral, the more affluent, the more educated, and the older the women were, the less bothered they were bybeing objectified inmedical settings. The mothers inGocheung Usung Apart (who were intheir early forties and were among the most well-educated and affluent of myinformants) mentioned that they regarded doctors as just professionals; thus, these women did not put much personal feelings into their relations with doctors. They felt comfortable just bybeing anobject with doctors because they went tothe hospital just toknow about their bodies. These women said that doctors were looking atcases, not female naked bodies; thus, they actually did not mind whether doctors were female ormale. These women were buying medical knowledge from medical professionals and their femininity had nothing todowith the sex ofphysicians.\" They thought they were nothing but apatient. However, they added that itwas actually their husbands who minded the sex ofdoctors because their husbands did not like their wives toshow their naked bodies --especially \"that\" part --to other men, even todoctors. \"People had different feelings when they were inmedicalsettings; some people were overwhelmed bythe authority and the expensive price ofmedical knowledge. Onthe other hand, some people thought ofdoctors especially inlocal clinics asakind of merchant ofmedical knowledge. One woman asked anurse inaclinic how many customers visited recently and the nurse corrected bypointing out that they were not customers butpatients. 107However, some women were strongly sensitive about their presence aswomen inmedical settings. KaYunhee, ahigh school graduate who had worked in adressmaking shop, said that she really minded seeing amale OB &GYN, adding that her husband also did not let her see amale doctor. Once when she went tothe clinic, her female doctor went on vacation and amale doctor was filling her place soshe came back without anexamination. KaYunhee thought that itwas disgusting for men tosee women's \"there.\" She had heard that one male OB &GYN doctor drank liquor every day to forget the sickening feeling ofwhat hesaw during his work day. KaYunhee thought that men and women were the same in terms ofdoctors' competence, but men and women were different intheir feeling toward patients oftheir own gender; neither doctors could objectify awoman as asimple patient, nor could patients look at adoctor asjust a professional. KaYunhee stated, therefore, that women doctors understood female problems in amore sensitive way. Lee Kisuk, ahigh school graduate who had worked in a foreign company and got monthly prenatal check-ups, said that regardless ofwhether doctors were male orfemale, she felt uncomfortable with aphysical examination ofher vagina. Thus, she quit the regular visit tothe clinic for the last two months before childbirth. She thought that the touching examination was not necessary and she could feel a physical abnormality inher body byherself ifshe had a 108real problem. Onthe other hand, she trusted medical technologies which could tell how the baby was inher womb. Another high school graduate, Suh Wharan, who worked in a company, had the same idea asLee Kisuk but she did not stop visiting doctors and took regular prenatal check-ups. These expectant mothers were worried about whether they were capable ofgiving birth to ahealthy baby without medical help because they were not confident that they were doing the \"right\" things for their fetuses. Therefore, they clung tohospitals. According tothe negotiable power that women had, however, women's attitudes toward medical doctors were different. The more they were aware ofmedical power asa knowledge profession, the more women objectified their bodies aspatients separated from their femininity. Apart from women's bodily experiences ofbeing objects, women inmedical settings experienced institutional forces that made them feel helpless objects orcases because they got pregnant but did not know about their bodies. Pregnant women visited OB &GYN clinics orhospitals with alot of questions. However, these women's meetings with OB &GYN specialists were usually not satisfactory. They were poorly informed not only about the development oftheir babies but also about the results ofthe tests they had taken. Seeing the rushed medical personnel and other pregnant women waiting their turns, they came tothink that they should not bother doctors bytaking their time. Furthermore, they were 109overwhelmed bymedical personnel's air ofauthority; these medical people were armed with knowledge about human bodies, sothat the women felt they were asking \"naive and stupid\" questions, proving how ignorant they were. Doctors scribbled inEnglish\" about what they asked andreported theresult oftests the women took inEnglish. The doctors' attitude totally depersonalized the women and treated female bodies assimply acarrier of afetus. They went through a psychologically-uncomfortable process; then, the doctor finally told them, or\"take more rest,\" or\"be careful, donot hold heavy stuff.\" Pregnant women were not expecting something wrong butfelt that they were treated lightly and their pregnant bodies were not taken seriously. When aninformant asked the meaning ofthe ultrasound record that she had taken, a doctor said with anirritated voice that this baby did not have adeformity; ithad two hands, two ears, etc. Instead ofrelief, shefelt embarrassed and stupid asifher ignorance offended the doctor. Not all women put upwith their discomfort inmedical settings. Some women stopped visiting doctors because they were disappointed with doctors' services; orthey felt humiliation atbeing treated asthings; orsome atthe vaginal examination. Like Lee Kisook, some *InKorean medical schools, texts and references are in English. Therefore, medical doctors use English for patients' records and prescriptions topharmacists. 110women simply stopped seeing doctors after afewvisits until they were ready for childbirth, thinking that the doctor was not doing anything for them and the abnormality could be sensed bytheir bodies. Inanother way, they tried toseek scientific information about pregnancies bythemselves at home rather than depending onknowledge from elder women relatives, friends, oracquaintances. Infact, most ofthe women read books, particularly commercial books called \"encyclopedia about pregnancy, child birth, and child rearing.\" The middle-class women relied heavily onthese books which had been published under the names offamous physicians. Actually, the publishing companies wrote the books and borrowed the famous physicians' names. Regarding these books, Dr. Han, like many OB &GYN specialists, criticized the books for not being scientific but including lots oftraditional superstitious beliefs about pregnancies. She insisted that many women's complaints about prenatal care inhospitals derived from the women's incorrect knowledge, which was written inthese books. Even though these books were clothed insocalled \"modern\" practices, such asrecommending hospital-oriented Western medical care, she said, the content ofthese books actually combined alot ofmedico-religious ideas about pregnancy, such aslimiting women's movement and emphasizing taboos onfood and certain emotions. Kim Inwha said, Idid not gototheclinic until the eighth month ofmy was ateacher. I Instead, Idid prenatal care bymyself, depending upon abook about pregnancy and childbirth. Iobserved the food taboo that the book described, avoiding pungent food, badly shaped food, and strangely shaped fish. During the last two months before delivery Iattended prenatal care every week but adoctor did not say anything was wrong. Atchildbirth, though, the same doctor told methat Ineeded ac-section because the position ofthe fetus was abnormal. Icould not help avoiding ahospital delivery but Idonot think doctors know everything. These books usually collected all kinds ofinformation about pregnancy. Therefore, they are full ofcontradictions and aneclectic array ofWestern, Chinese and folk medicines. However, whether women dropped out ofprenatal care ornot, they read the books seriously and implemented the advice given inthe books. Kim Inwha was doubtful about her doctor's medical practices. Cho Sukhyun also was very angry when she had astill birth because she had visited a female OB &GYN every month during her pregnancy. However, these women, like many other women, had never complained to doctors orclinics and talked with other women inpublic about their disappointment atprenatal medical services, or 112their feeling ofdiscomfort. They went toother clinics or gave upgoing todoctors, relying instead onself-care based onpopular books, including traditional medico-religious taboos. The knowledge ofwomen's bodies ismonopolized by medical institutions and this type ofcommercial books. Therefore, the medical institutions and those information channels have determined what isgood for women and fetuses. The women's counter discourse against hospitals was to mobilize the cultural practices of\"proper\" female conduct orthe cultural notion of\"naturalness\" ofhuman bodily function including pregnancy. The cultural discourse of \"proper\" conduct removed women's pregnancies from the hegemony ofWestern OB &GYN practices and the discourse of \"naturalness\" caused lots ofconfusion inrelation to \"scientific\" medical technology. Along with astrong belief inthescientific efficacy ofWestern medical knowledge and technologies, the discourse ofthe \"natural\" with respect tohealth isalso prevalent in Korean society, creating some scepticism about the intervention ofmedical technology onhuman bodies. Many people believed that the natural was best for the bodies, meaning that the less artificial the intervention was, the better itwas for the body. Nam Jungsoon was not comfortable with medicine orhospitals even though she trusted Western medical knowledge and its efficacy intaking care ofher pregnancy. She said, 113Iwas scared oftaking being touched symbol ofmedical instruments inKorea] .Therefore, Idid not get prenatal care until the estimated date of birth was approaching. Even atthe time of myfirst pregnancy in1985 most women got regular prenatal care from OB &GYN clinics but Ihad some resistance feelings against hospitals. Thus, Ibought books about pregnancy and child rearing and cared for mypregnant body according towhat the book said. However, Ialways wanted toask doctors whether Iwas doing the right things for mybaby. This kind ofcultural orpsychological resistance toward Western medical intervention inbodies with feelings ofawe toward medical authority was always emergent and was also found inpeople's attitudes toward thepractices of sterilization and vasectomy (see chapter 5). Many people in Korea had apsychological resistance against taking medicine, having operations, and subjecting their bodies to medical equipment simply because, people said, this was not natural.\" Fear usually also came from the combination of *This idea of\"naturalness\" can beinterpreted inmany ways. The most common meaning, which isprevalent ineveryday discourse, leaving things asthey have been and isinopposition totampering with the existing state. This idea isdeeply related tofolk andtraditional concepts of\"health and harmony.\" aChinese doctor explained naturalness inthe following way: The body is aself-sufficient whole inwhich theparts of ahuman body are organically integrated sothat anintervention in apart ofthe body disrupts its harmony and hurts the capacity of 114ideas about naturalness with anxieties about malpractice. Park Moonwhan said that during her pregnancy she got regular prenatal care but she did not want totake the ultrasound or the amniotic fluid test because she feared that itmight hurt her fetus and lead tomiscarriage. Another mother, Lee Sunja said, Apart from the embarrassment and discomfort, Idid not want tohave aninternal examination during my pregnancy. Ihad heard from one ofmychurch friends that the internal examination caused more problems than ithelped. For example, one ofmyfriends felt terrible pain after visiting an OB &GYN clinic for atest of cervical cancer and found out inanother clinic that she had gotten inflamed because thetest had injured her vagina. Thus, Itook care of mypregnancy bymyself until the last month before child birth. Inorder tobe agood and adequate mother of afew children, all the middle-class mothers strived todotheir best for their fetuses bymobilizing medical and medico religious resources because noone was sure ofhow togive birth toa\"healthy\" and \"normal\" baby. However, whether these middle-class women stopped seeing medical doctors or not, these women's way ofdealing with their pregnant bodies manifested how Western medicine had achieved hegemony over self-healing and self-accommodation. Therefore, Chinese medicine works tohelp therestoration ofthe equilibrium ofwholeness. 115women's reproduction. Traditional medico-religious practices concerning women's pregnancies emerged sporadically as cultural practices embedded ineveryday life settings, but the Western medical care was institutionally presented as the legitimate and \"correct\" modern practice ofpregnancy. The items ofgovernment surveys about prenatal care also deal with only Western medical tests such as, blood, urine, haemoglobin, weight, venereal disease, hepatitis, and ultrasound (KIPH:165). Sancho'nkwanri (prenatal care) meant amedical check-up inWestern medical institutions. Since the 1960s, there have been strong social forces ininstitutionalizing women's pregnancies assickness. First, the successful national family planing policy emphasis on afew but precious children has constituted a kind ofreproductive norm. The policy has been accompanied by aforceful deployment ofstandardized biomedical scores about healthy babies for almost three decades through government and civil channels. The family planning policy described inchapter 5has been executed bydepending onthe Western medical system. Western medicine has been the main infrastructure ofbureaucratic health policy and the main institution for national health. Through these processes of emphasizing Western medicine, the hospital became the symbol ofthe only legitimate and authorized institution that could manage the concept ofhealth. Thus, toproduce ahealthy baby, women became the object ofmedical attention 116voluntarily and involuntarily, transforming themselves into patients inthe same way asanyone who wasill orsuffered from adisease.\" Secondly, through the legitimated channel oftelevision and newspapers, ahigh-technology-oriented medical knowledge with respect toreproductive and fetal health was introduced bycreating and regulating people's need. Western medicine's monopoly onthe knowledge ofthe human body was commercialized inthe name ofscience and technology without any criticism, encouraging and normalizing the dependence of human bodies ontechnological imperatives. Onthe other hand, some Chinese medicine was introduced as ahome-remedy orself- therapy, focusing onfood intake and bodily conduct. When Idid myfieldwork from 1989 to1990, two television shows onhealth were broadcast every morning ontwo television stations out ofthree. Usually, the guests, who were medical doctors inuniversity hospitals, explained common but new, \"modern\" health problems ordiseases, in accordance with requests byviewers and introduced new technologies for the management ofthese problems, including high-tech fetal tests and therapies, osteoporosis, invitro *Inaddition, there was astrong modernization discourse concerning bio-politics among former family planning experts. During myfieldwork some health policy professionals were preparingtopropose acompulsory prenatal care policy andbirth-certificate system authorized bymedical personnel asthe next national programfor reproductive health. Because the family planning policy has achieved its goal ofreducing the number ofchildren in afamily,their organization needed anew program suitable to anew age. 117fertilization, etc. Many women got their information through these channels. Auniversity OB &GYN doctor, Dr. Lee, said that once ahealth problem had been aired by acertain doctor, the next day the hospital atwhich the doctor was working was packed with patients complaining about the health problems onthe show. Therefore, hesaid that the departments ofpublic relations inhospitals were competing with each other toput their doctors onthe program. Among myinformants very few women mentioned their subjective experiences during their pregnancies. Their concerns mainly focused on\"correct\" behavior orthe best care toproduce a \"healthy inmedical institutions. Inthis kind ofcontext, not only pregnant women themselves but also their female elders and husbands became powerless, subject tohospitals, because they did not have any means toknow about what was going oninwomen's bodies. (3) Hospital delivery: The lonely and chilly experience ofchildbirth Childbirth isasocial and cultural act. Many women understand the birth of achild asthe consummation ofthe marriage institution rather than the product oftwo individuals' sexual union. Through childbirth, the ultimate gender position ofwomen isachieved; i.e. motherhood. Child 118birth defines the woman's identity in anew way, affecting the interrelationship not only ofhusband and wife but of the members ofthe kinship and descent groups with which both are aligned. Some people think that thebirth process isbiological, sothat women's bodies accommodate naturally tothe requirements ofchildbirth. However, the physiological processes ofchildbirth operate within a cultural context which constitutes and shapes the social relations that affect childbirth. Inthis section, I describe middle-class women's experience ofchildbirth in medical institutions and explore the ways inwhich women situate their gender position through interacting with medical practitioners and interpreting reproduction. In addition, Idiscuss medical practitioners' modes of understanding their female patient. All the middle-class women that Iinterviewed gave birth totheir children at OB &GYN clinics orhospitals, where they were attended bydoctors. Before the due date, the women prepared togotothe hospital for labor by cleaning upthe house and cooking food that husbands and other family members would eat inthe women's absence. Oh Insook, who lived with her in-law family when she had her first child birth, said, Onthe day that mylabor started, mymother-in-law did not seem totake itseriously even though Itold her I was feeling cramps and oozing amniotic fluid. My 119mother-in-law treated itasinsignificant and went out for lunch with mysister-in-law. Even inthe morning of that day, Icooked lunch for myhusband and his friends. Ifelt something heavy inthe lower part ofmy body and leaked something from \"there.\" Icooked dinner for the family, boiled dish towels, and cleaned the kitchen toprepare for myabsence ofseveral days. And then, Iwent toahospital for labor and stayed with other laboring women inthe maternity ward because a doctor sent away mymother-in-law and husband bysaying that itwould take time sofamily attendants had better gohome. The mother-in-law went home, taking my husband. Icried inthe :Iwas solonely and scared mother-in-law came back inthe morning. Iwent through along and painful labor bymyself. Inorder togive birth, women usually went tothe same hospitals orclinic where they had received their prenatal care but many middle-class women had chosen general hospitals forchildbirth because many women thought that big hospitals were safer for delivery with their high-tech facilities incase ofemergency. Dr. Han, who was an OB & GYN specialist inone ofthe biggest and most expensive OB & GYN hospitals inSeoul and acolumnist onwomen's health in anewspaper, said, \"All deliveries are basically dangerous because childbirth isbasically uncertain and unpredictable. 120Therefore, even awoman who has received prenatal care until the last month can have risks atchildbirth.\" All the doctors whom Iinterviewed, whether they were female or male, orworked in auniversity hospital or acommunity hospital, said that childbirth isnot adisease but an absolutely critical stage during which doctors are needed. Given this powerful and prevalent medical discourse combined with women's worries about delivering a\"healthy and normal\" baby, many women had the idea that the bigger the hospital was, thebetter andsafer forbirthing.\" Women prefer general orbig OB &GYN hospitals tolocal OB &GYN clinics forchildbirth. Women who had given birth inbig hospitals and local clinic said that they were disappointed with the clinic with its poor facilities and services. Lee Kisook said, For mysecond child, Iwent toalocal clinic for prenatal care and delivery because Ithought the local clinic might give more personal care topatients. However, Ifound later that the general hospital was *The national survey shows that 92.9% ofthe last births since 1983 were delivered inmedical institutions (including general hospitals, private clinics, midwifery clinics and the government maternal and child health center) inurban areas and 73.3% inrural areas (KIPH 1989:172). Giving has been highly recommended bygovernment healthprofessionals as apolicy of family health and the Korean government built maternal and child health centers inrural areas inthe early 1980s toprovide maternal and child health services. These institutions have mainly served astheplace forchildbirth, with midwifery nurses orpublic health doctors inattendance. 121better because they knew what was needed for women and provided services inadvance before Irealized Iwanted them and requested them. Onthe other hand, the local clinic did not provide any services unless Irequested them. Ithought the local clinic would bemore sensitive topost-partum care right after delivery but Iwas wrong. However, Dr. Han complained that many women who had never gotten prenatal care from her hospital came there to give birth without having any previous records there because the delivery fee was the same asinlocal clinics and her hospital had more sophisticated facilities. She said that the hospital did not welcome the women whose delivery was covered bymedical insurance because the hospital did not get any economic benefits from those deliveries ifthey were normal. Several OB &GYN doctors including Dr. Han stated that the price for delivery was notrealistic. Itwas so cheap because the government fixed the price toencourage pregnant women togive birth inmedical institutions as a kind ofbackup policy for family planning and maternal health policy. The fixed price was the reason that local clinics refused child deliveries. One private clinician in Seoul closed his delivery services because hecould not maintain the maternity ward, equipment and personal necessities for childbirth bycollecting the insurance price. Hesaid that the finance was just balanced when 122thirty cases ofchildbirth amonth were delivered inhis clinic, but the cases were decreasing with less than thirty cases ofdelivery amonth due tothe success ofthe family planning policy. Inaddition, nurses avoided bloody obstetric work inprivate clinics. The private doctor still provided abortions and prenatal care which were not covered bymedical insurance. Many women still gave birth totheir children inlocal clinics but there was atrend toward private clinicians avoiding complicated services covered by medical insurance. This kind ofdoctor's reaction for economic reasons countered the government's policy on medical insurance, which had been the only control mechanism onthepractices ofthe Korean medical profession since the late 1970s. Dr. Han criticized the government policy of ensuring that women were treated cheaply inhospitals by fixing the low price ofchildbirth. The high rate of caesarean sections inbig hospitals, she said, was akind of doctor's defense mechanism indealing with women whose pregnancy histories were unknown tothese doctors. Hyun Sunghee said that going toan OB &GYN hospital was shameful but staying atthe hospital forchildbirth was worse. She was lying onthe bed inanobstetric ward ina university hospital. The next morning, ahead doctor came in with young interns and residents. Heinterrogated her while touching, showing and pointing ather lower part tothe other medical staff. She felt terrible, realizing that it 123was not her pain but only her laboring body asan experimental case that was the doctors' concern. Another woman said that she was suffering from ahard labor and an intern came and put his fingers into her vagina tocheck the opening ofher womb without saying anything. She said, \"He did not even seem towash his hands. Idid not say anything tohim even though Iworried about infection. Ijust felt ashamed ofbeing awoman and thought Iwas being treated like apuppy.\" The women who had achildbirth ingeneral hospitals thought that the quality ofmedical services would begood inbig hospitals but the bigger and more organized hospitals were, the more impersonal andobject-like treatment the women would get. Atthe same time, they always added that itseemed tobeinevitable because the large places were dealing with somany patients. The big hospitals are usually associated with the power of\"modern scientific\" medicine; they represent specialization, efficiency, impersonality, and expensive medical services. Ontop ofthat, all the procedures for receiving commoditized medical services are compartmentalized, from waiting inthe waiting room for one's turn, registration, laboratory tests, physical examinations, payments, etc. People move from one place to another tobuy acommodity ofmedical themselves tobe acase inbig hospitals and realized that they were controlled bymany rules which left scant room for their spontaneity. Nam Jungsoon said, Igave birth tomyfirst child in ageneral hospital because ofthe safety and better delivery care. The nurse and doctor were kind, soIwanted togotothat hospital again, but general hospitals donot allow children tocome uptothe wards. Idonot know why, maybe hospitals think that children might get infected ormake noise and bother other patients. Icould not take myson tothe maternity ward. Mynatal meatchildbirth and myhusband was atwork; therefore, Idid not have anyone who could take care of myson during myhospitalization. Thus, Ichose alocal clinic for mysecond birth. Ihad already known that *The doctors' jokes patients represent aCritical ofabortion isconsidered the main source ofincome, commented that women's pregnant bellies just appear tobe adifferent price to them depending onthe month ofpregnancy. of amedical iscontrolled and is codified consolidated, doctors' comment onpatients ascommodity becomes a part ofeveryday discourse. Some patients complained that localpediatric clinics orinternal medicine clinics did not want toseepatients with complication, butjust referred them tobighospitals because they are just counting patients according tocosteffectiveness. Inthe same context, local OB &GYN clinics avoid delivering babies because deliveries take along time and demand doctors' labor but are cheap, being covered bymedical insurance. 125the local clinic was not asgood asthe general hospital interms offacilities and services even though the rules were much looser than general hospitals. Sometimes, this kind oflooseness was convenient for married women. But the services were so unorganized. When Ifelt that the baby was coming out atnight, adoctor was not even available because he was not inthe clinic atnight. There was anurse available but Icried out for areal doctor. Many women did not mention directly about the difference ofmedical fees between local clinics and \"big\" hospitals. Because ofthe high-tech oriented medical services, however, another ofthe women's clear associations with big hospitals had todowith money. Even though the quasi-national system ofuniversal medical insurance started in1991, many people still thought that the medical fee was expensive, particulary in\"big\" hospitals.\" Atchildbirth, except for normal delivery, many cases inthe obstetric ward were not covered bymedical insurance. hospital \"Since theintroduction ofuniversal medical insurance system in1991, the medical institutions are divided into three categories ofprimary, secondary andtertiary sectors. There are noorganicinter-referral systems yet, but when patients visit the secondary orthe tertiary hospitals without the recommendation from the primary clinics, they pay more. However, many people are not concerned about this and goto\"big\" hospitals. 126have heard that local clinics did not provide circumcision. Igot aquickening injection assoon asI got tothe hospital fifteen days after the due date, and Idrank acup ofcastor oil, which mymother-in-law had brought for metoopen Igot another injection topromote birth the next morning. Anintern told methat my womb had burst because ofthe quickening injection. And mymother-in-law and husband wanted metoget ac-section and asked the doctors for it. The hospital wanted ustoprepay the money for the operation. While waiting for myhusband tobring money for the deposit, my womb suddenly opened fully. Igave birth toason but hedid not get circumcized because itshould have been done within 24hours after birth, but wemissed it. The hospital environment overwhelmed women and their families with its power ofknowledge ofhuman bodies, its impersonal organization, and its expensive medical fees, which they could not figure out even though they saw itemized bills. Assoon aswomen got tothe hospital for birth, they changed their clothes and lay on abed toget aquickening injection. From that moment, they became patients who had to obey the hospital staff. These women inlabor experienced fear and worries astowhether they could give birth toa normal baby. Atthe same time, they were in apanic, 127wondering whether they could survive after birth; they felt that they might bedead. Itwas usually mothers-in-law who expressed resistance against the dominant and impersonal hospital organization. OhInsook's mother-in-law fed her raw eggs continuously toget the baby out ofher body smoothly and massaged her belly, praying toShamsin halmoni (three legendary goddesses who are believed togovern childbirth). The rubbing lessened her pain and she asked her mother-in-law tocontinue but the nurse came and said toher mother-in-law tostop because it slowed the process ofdilation. This mother-in-law was angry atthe hospital because she thought this kind oftraditional care was not harmful to awoman inlabor atall. Right delivery, the mother-in-law wanted totake daughter-in law's placenta; she insisted that there was arumor that hospitals sold all the women's placenta topharmaceutical or athome finally gave ittoher. Mothers-in-law's resistance could befound in some cases ofc-section, aswell. OhSuch's mother-in-law was angry when her daughter-in-law needed ac-section because of the incorrect position ofbaby and said, Ac-section isnot necessary. Ifitisneeded, that's because the doctors donot want totake the pains taking work and they want tomake more money, aswell. Inthe 128old days even amidwife was enough tohandle acase like hers without any complication. But these days, younger women think the more money they spend, the better and healthier ababy they will have. However, the daughter-in-law said, \"What else could Ido except have ac-section when adoctor told methat hecould not guarantee asafe delivery byvagina?\" Many mothers-in law hated c-sections whose cost was high and was not covered bymedical insurance. Daughters-in-law, who were caregivers tonew-born babies and husbands, also took alonger time to recover their health following c-sections. Inaddition, Oh Whaja's mother-in-law was angry with the bureaucratized and such medical system which did not take seriously her empirical knowledge and wisdom, orher role asafamily elder. She felt powerless inhandling her grandchild's birth, feeling that the doctors treated her asanignorant old woman. Mothers-in-law inthis kind ofsituation blamed their daughters-in-law first, but \"scientific\" medicine discouraged them from being involved inchildbirth. Chun Kyoungok's mother-in-law was not happy either, asshe indicated bysaying that natural delivery was good for both ababy and amother when she heard that her daughter-in-law had ahard labor. But she accepted the doctor's recommendation for ac-section when the doctor showed her Chun Kyoungok's pelvic x-ray picture; the doctor explained that her pelvic was smaller than that ofthe average Korean 129woman and the baby's head was bigger that that ofother babies. Here, the reason for c-section was scientific and medical, not apersonal orempirical issue. One third of myinformants gave birth bycaesarean section.\" The women had ac-section, mainly because ofthe abnormal position oftheir babies and the woman's small pelvis. Inaddition, most ofthe women believed and were told bydoctors that once they gave birth to achild byc section, the next birth had tobedone byc-section. Dr.Suh from auniversity hospital said that this was not always true, adding that his wife gave birth asecond time by normal delivery although she had ac-section for herfirst birth. Kim Inwha had ac-section because adoctor told her that she had a20percent chance of anormal delivery, commenting that the ultrasound record showed that the position ofthe baby was wrong. The doctor said toKim Inwha that the decision astowhether tohave ac-section ornot was uptoher; the same doctor had told her that everything was fine when she had aninternal pelvic exam several days before her admission for delivery. Actually when doctors recommended ac-section and provided some reasons, women became desperate and accepted the operation almost 100 *This ishigher than the national average. The national survey shows that 13.4% ofthelast birth ofwomen inurban 175) However, when Iworked as aresearcher in ahospital in Seoul, the data in1986 showed that more than 30% ofall births in that hospital were done byc-section. 130percent ofthe time. When Kim Inwha decided tohave ac section, therefore, itwas not her own decision because the decision had already been made bythe doctors; doctors' opinions and decisions about women's bodies came absolute power inthe childbirth settings. Aswomen inlabor came tobepowerless and depended on the medical staff inhospitals, they wanted tobegood patients whom doctors and nurses liked. Instead of criticizing the impersonal atmosphere ofmedical settings, many women said how cooperative and good apatient they had been. Being atolerant and considerate patient isthe demonstration of how cultivated and considerate and therefore virtuously feminine the woman is. Nam Jungsoon said, Isaw many screaming mothers inthe delivery room and sensed that doctors did not like those women even though the doctors did not directly complain tothem. Some women who cried out soimpatiently and loudly actually affected the doctors' practices. Ithink that kind ofpatients' attitude irritated the doctors' temper. Idid not scream much even though Ihad ahard labor with abig baby, who weighed asmuch as3.9kg. Nurses were very kind tomebecause Iwas sopatient and did not demand much. OhInsook also said how tolerant she was, putting up with apain that made her faint, feeling asifthe air was 131yellow. OhInsook stated, \"Idid not scream much, soa doctor and the nurses said that Iwould have ason because I was avery good patient.\" The medical staff controlled women's compliance byinfantalizing them, asifitwere up tothe medical people togive ortake the son whom most of the women wanted tohave. When the women went tohospitals orclinics, they tried todotheir best not tobother the doctors ornurses, orsometimes tried toplease them by following their rules and depending onthem. Medical staff usually ignored and did not respond to women's complaints. Lee Kisook said, \"Atfirst when Igot to aclinic with myamniotic waters breaking, anurse put her whole hand into my womb and tried totake out the baby. I felt deadly pain and screamed, but the nurse did not care about myscream. Iwas crying loudly and finally adoctor came and managed it.\" Nowomen heard anapology from medical professionals for what they did topatients. When female patients questioned whether something was medically wrong, doctors sometimes answered them with technical terms in English, which the woman could not understand, ordoctors gave them meaningless oreven misleading information. Kim Hyunjoo, who carefully studied reproductive physiology and the reproductive organs during her pregnancy, was lying on the delivery table inauniversity hospital, and asked, \"How much has dilated?\" Noanswers were given even though there were several interns and residents around the delivery 132table. She asked itagain. Then adoctor answered, \"it is four twenty.\" She said that she was not asking about the time but about her dilation and one doctor with anirritated voice said, \"We are watching it. Donot worry. Itisour job, not yours.\" Instead ofanswering women's questions about obstetric procedures orthe status oftheir bodies, doctors definitively and authoritatively asserted that they knew what was going oninthe women's bodies. They implied that itwas useless toinform the women because it was doctors, anyway, who handled and managed the situation. Many doctors cited the Korean maxim that \"knowledge isdisease (ignorance isbliss), \"teasing the women with know somuch, what isthe use ofdoctors?\" Kim Hyunjoo was angry, embarrassed and frustrated but she kept silent after hearing adoctor's irritated voice. Its effect reaffirmed the doctors' power and her powerlessness, and atthe same time made her worry about whether these doctors hated her and would not care for her well. The doctors' cool response raised her anxiety and made her put herself inthe doctors' control byshowing more dependence onthem. Obstetricians were perplexed and irritated bypatients who were inquisitive and did notfit the stereotype ofthe good patient. Dr. Yang recalled, \"When Iwas aresident inauniversity hospital, we(doctors and nurses) exchanged whispers about assertive patients inthe maternity ward, such as\"avoid soand so. She isa 133troublemaker.\" Many women mentioned that they witnessed some women's complaints being intentionally neglected inthe maternity ward bynurses and doctors. Itwas asifthey were being made anexample toother female patients toshow how they could betreated ifthey were labelled \"troublemakers.\" When the women were admitted into obstetric wards, they encountered medical professionals' ideas about appropriate attitudes and behaviors for female patients. Awoman told me that her doctor, who was avery kind single man and held her hand like afamily member, said that she should not scream ifpossible. She recalled how sweet the doctor was in advising her how tobehave. Asthis scene showed, the doctor who was incharge ofwomen's childbirth and bodily pain got the special position regardless ofhis age and marital status, being adominant partner indefining apatient's role. Patients who suffered from pain were inneed of medical help because oftheir condition and were ready tobe subordinated toand tamed bymedical providers. Thus, the doctor already had hegemony over the body inpain bythe mere fact that thepatient came hegemony isthe essential idea ofGramsci's political theory todiscuss the mechanism of maintenance and transformation of bourgeois society; inshort, how acertain historical stance ofcapitalist society canexist, how thebourgeois power domination is organized into aconcrete historical reality and the society can move into the next stage. Power domination inGramsci isexercised through two dimensions; one ispracticed through coercion bythestate apparatus; the other one isembodied and performed bythe\"intellectual and moral leadership\" through education, religion, 134medicine, family ideology, etc., which iscalled civil society by Gramsci. Hegemony refers tothe latter. For Gramsci the state, which isconcretely represented astheultimate historical form of hegemony (the unity ofmoment ofsuperstructure andinfrastructure, moment offorce and consent, and economic-political and ethicopolitical moment) isthe instrument for adapting civil society to the economic structure based onconsent. Consent inhegemonic domination isrevealed as aform ofactive acceptance of the dominant ideology constructed inthe economic base ofthe ruling group. Therefore, \"the hegemonic domination isnot limited to matters ofdirect political control bythe state but seeks todescribe amore general predominance which includes aparticular way ofseeing the world and ourselves and others are not justintellectual but political facts, expressed over arange frominstitutions torelationships andconsciousness. Itisanintegral form ofclass rule which exists only inpolitical and economicinstitutions and relationships but also inactive forms of experience andconsciousness predominant practice andconsciousness (Williams 1976, 1983 :145) .\" Inorder tounderstand how the body isincorporated into the hegemony ofWestern medicine inKorea, Iuse the concept of Gramsci's hegemony inthe that basis ofconviction (consent) can bereduced neither tointerests nor tothe forlorn attempt toseparate truth from ideology, but can beapproached by seeing historically how effects oftruth are produced within ahistorical reality. Iunderstand the existence ofcorporeality of the body isthe basis ofmedical institutions and the hegemony of acertain medical system inasociety istheresult ofpolitical economic corporeality. Inmedical 1988). However, most ofthese works understand the hegemony as institutional domination, emphasizing the social legitimation and thefunctional integration of Western medicine toexisting social structures. However, Frankenberg understands medicine as aninstitution ofcivil society; that is, Inaddition, social contradictions such asthe role oforganic intellectuals for the revolutionary change of asocial system (1988). Ifound asimilarity between myapplication ofhegemony and Taussig's argument about terror Hedeals with terror as aphysiological state aswell as asocial one whose special features 135addition, when the asymmetrical relation between doctor and patient was activated inanactual setting, itmobilized and combined with other power relations embedded ineveryday cultural practice. Thus, when awoman inlabor came tothe hospital, she brought with her existing social and cultural views ofwomen inmedical need and entered into the power boundary ofmale-gendered medical profession. The different power positions ofthe doctor and female patient inlabor reflected the way inwhich women inthe maternity ward were treated. The dominant position of doctors was achieved through the exclusive institutionalization oftheir medical knowledge and their male gender domination ofthe medical profession; itmeans not only that male doctors are dominant inthe medical profession but also the socio-cultural nature ofthe medical profession and knowledge are constructed in amasculine way. Inthe same context, the female doctor isalso engendered male atwork.\" Therefore, the hegemonic position ofthe doctor, combined with strong patriarchal relations in allow ittoserve asthe mediator par excellence ofcolonial hegemony (1987:5). Iunderstand that the medical and political hegemony over the body and the creation ofthe certain form of asubjectivity about the body arepossible bythe fact that the body iscorporeal and vulnerable topain. *KoSunok talked about doctors inthis way: \"Iamcomfortable with female doctors inasking about female problems asthey are the same sex but Iwant tosee male doctors inthe case ofchild birth oroperation. This might be abias but female doctors seem tomake more mistakes than male doctors because women are usually weaker than men. 136medicine, work synergically totreat women asprivate and informal beings who donot have anindependent social personhood and become like infants. Inthis context, the woman issupposed tobe a\"good has tobequiet, isbeing done to help her, quick torespond toinstructions and able to comprehend and remember what she istold without requiring tohave the information repeated. She has tobepassive. Actually, itispassivity which the medical setting enforces onthe women astheir \"appropriate role.\" Through this passive role the women's beings were inscribed as a \"thing\" or a\"case\" during their experience ofgiving birth. Many women inthe delivery room were lying silently, listening todoctors' talk about them. Comments might include: \"Hey, Dr. Lee. How many have you pulled out today?\" Or,referring tosome woman; \"look can produce ababy easily.\" Many women recalled how much they hated nurses who were chatting and giggling with each other nearby, ignoring the women's pain inlabor. Kim Youngmee's mother-in-law fought with anurse who fell asleep next toher daughter-in-law, who was screaming for help. Women complained about nurses more than about doctors. Women thought that nurses were women like themselves and as lower-status professionals they should bekinder, more humane, and more sensitive towards female patients. The most common feeling inlying-in wards for almost 137all the informants was that the room was chilly. Many women said that they could vividly remember how cold theobstetric ward was and how overwhelmed they were attheir first childbirth, wondering whether they could put ontheir shoes again and goback totheir own homes. Kim Inwha said that it was socold that she had her husband bring clothes and put onseveral layers ofclothing towarm herself. Itwas so cold that herleft leg became paralyzed. Inthe maternity ward, some women encouraged each other, exchanging information, because ingeneral hospitals, medical staff never gave attention orvoluntarily helped the women. The women had toask for help. However, the women inmaternity wards were trapped bybeing inneed ofhelp but atthe same time wanting tobe agood patient who did not bother the medical staff. Amidst strangers, awoman felt that she suffered somuch ingiving birth and inbeing treated asa sub-human inthe hospital for noreason other than that she was born awoman. They said that atchildbirth they realized why people were sorry togive birth todaughters. People were sorry not just for the sex ofgirls but for thelife that girls would gothrough. Another dominant feeling that the women had inthe obstetric ward was loneliness. Family members, particulary their husbands, were powerless during the hospital delivery. InKorea, husbands were excluded from the procedure of prenatal care and child birth. Getting pregnant and giving 138birth are considered women's business including mothers-in law and natal mothers. Lee Eunyoung, who wanted her husband tostay with her during her labor inalocal clinic, asked a nurse whether she could take her husband to abirthing room. The nurse was shocked and said toher, How could you think such athing without shame? Doyou want toshow your naked and delivering body toyour husband? What ashameless and disgusting idea you have l Idonot understand persons like you who want toshow dirty and animal-like behavior totheir husbands. This nurse's reaction derived from the idea that male and female worlds are different and should bekept separate. The pregnant woman's body isinacategory ofphenomena which are exclusively feminine. Traditionally the order ofthe universe orthe world isclearly divided and separated between the feminine and the masculine, and some ideas or behaviors which cross into the space ofseparation cause \"chaos\" and \"pollution.\" or \"abnormal.\" When Iasked Dr. Yang why the hospital did not allow husbands tobeinthe delivery room, she said that there were nostrict rules about it. However, she said that doctors might benervous treating women inlabor ifthe husbands were around. Dr. Yang said that doctors ingeneral hated having pregnant women's \"significant other\" around 139them during medical practices. She said, Doctors have anidea that the more objectified patients are, the more confident they are inhandling patients. There is aso-called VIP syndrome for doctors. That is, doctors easily make amistake with patients who are referred through the courtesy ofsuperior hospital staff. The doctors try todomore for these patients, sothey become too nervous and too sensitive totake care oftheir problems and their feelings atthe same time. Bydoing so, they might lose their attentiveness and make some mistakes. Therefore, the more weexclude our feelings from patients, the better medical services this process ofexclusion of women's experience ofillness from the dominant medical discourse with the concept ofreification - -aconcept originating with Georg Lukacs (1971 [1922]) :inWestern society the commodity mode of production dominates the social order and creates asituation in which human beings and their experiences are constructed asdehistoricized objects -in -themselves inthe capitalist social formation. Lukacs describes that thecapitalist system breaks the processes ofproduction anddistribution down into smaller and more manageable units inthe name ofgreater efficiency through the forces of amarket system inwhich the labor of human beings becomes simply one more commodity. Therefore men become, intheirrelations to society and to each other, nothing more than commodities orthings. Taussig's point does not lie inthe difference oftheir ofadoctor and apatient, oramedical doctor's of exactly what Taussig means byreification since he does not distinguish this concept from forms ofobjectification which seem tobeinevitable, namely the symbolic processes through 140Dr. Yang's explanation tells alot about why doctors hate patients' questions, through which patients want to have avoice ashuman beings. Allowing patients avoice confuses doctors and transgresses their separate worlds, invading anauthority that isbuilt bykeeping distance from the ordinary world. Inthe same context, the husband's involvement canpotentially cause confusion inthe doctors' power byintroducing ofnon-patient and male-gendered person. Dr. Lee, anOB-GYN inauniversity hospital, explained more about the structural problem that led tothe exclusion offamily members from childbirth. Hesaid that the most economical, efficient management ofthe Korean medical reality entailed seeing asmany patients asquickly as possible within alimited time period. Husbands orother family members could not participate inchildbirth mainly which people objectify themselves inparticular events, material things, and social relations, and which help constitute thecultural construction ofreality inevery society.\" Young argues that Taussig's analysis ofhow Western medicine mystifies sickness isboth convincing and important, but his own epistemological claims areproblematic. That is,that all knowledge ofsociety and sickness issocially determined and that anthropologists cannotlegitimately claim access todemystified facts. What they can claim is tocritically examine the social conditions of knowledge production. Thus, Young argues that the term reification implies theanthropologist's self-consciousness, sothat inthis ofreification isacceptable for ofpatients' discourse inclinical settings insofar asIunderstand the reification which means the total transformation ofthe world into asphere where relations among rational orconscious beingsaltogether cease and only relations among things areleft. 141for economic reasons; when husbands and family members attended the childbirth, the hospital had totake care of these visitors' demands and protect other women's privacy by not letting them see other women inchildbirth. Dr. Lee strongly conveyed thecultural idea ofprivatized women's bodies inafamily against other men orother families. On the other hand, Dr. Han said that itwas not asimple issue tolet husbands inthe delivery room because ofthe possibility ofinfection and other hygienic problems. In addition, Dr. Han mentioned that her hospital had attempted toallow men toattend the birth but because ofcultural customs women themselves did not want the husbands tosee their birthing, and many men wanted tostay away from delivery.\" Most ofthe women felt they needed their husbands emotionally but nowoman expected her husband tobe able tohelp her inthe ward, with the exception ofone woman who had given birth toherfirst child inthe United States. Instead, some women told methat they did not want their husbands tosee the scene ofchildbirth, adding that they might benervous and uncomfortable inthe husbands' presence. *One immigrant Korean woman, who worked asadry cleaner and had been inthe U.S. for three years, told methat she could not understand how her white American brother-in-law could want her to see atelevision program ofchild birth. She commented, how could she watch itwith aman? 142(4) The birthing who was sotolerant ofher painful labor, finally gave birth to ason. She said, \"Iwas relieved that Ihad ason. But mydelight, first Ilooked athim carefully tocheck whether hehad ten fingers and ten toes inthe normal way.\" Some women mentioned that they wanted toknow whether the baby was normal (which means no physical impairment) *ornot, but more women mentioned that their first concern was whether the baby was ason or a daughter. Most ofthe women wished togive birth to ason during their first pregnancy. Then they would befree from worry about the sex ofthe second baby orwould stop having more babies. Sung Meekyung, who was pregnant during the interview, said that women (including herself) who wanted to have only one child had togive birth to ason. Otherwise they had tohave the second baby. She stated, \"Iknow itis ashame but tostop further pregnancies and tobefree from the pressure ofthe in-law family and the husband's unspoken wish, Imust deliver ason.\" Most ofthe women did not want tohave more than two children; therefore, giving birth toa son was amatter ofdesperation for many women. Women made tremendous efforts tobear sons by *Women usually think ofnormality interms ofphysical impairment. Dr. Lee said that women wanted tohave perfect babies without any malformation orimpairment. Therefore, when they know they have any problems ofmalformation oforgans orphysical appearance, they want toabort the babies rather than treat them. 143practicing diet control, controlling the date ofcoitus, and taking medicine for conceiving aboy. And many women got abortions when they realized that their fetuses were girls after atest ofthe amniotic fluid, orafter reading ultra sound pictures. Inaddition, many women sensed the sex of their fetuses themselves byobserving the severity oftheir morning sickness, the shape oftheir swollen bellies, their cravings ofappetite for certain foods such asfruit or meat, orbytheir dreams during pregnancies. Based onthese cultural beliefs, some women identified the sex oftheir fetuses and attimes aborted female babies. Park Moonwhan described her situation asfollows: Ifirst gave birth toadaughter, which disappointed me because myhusband tohave ason. Iwanted to have ason, too. When mother told methat my husband Ichecked mytemperature, took medicine imported from Japan for the conception ofa boy and paid lots ofattention tofood intake: Imade myhusband drink milk alot and When Ifelt that the fetus was agirl, Iaborted my second pregnancy. When Iwas inmythird pregnancy, I was sonervous about bearing another girl. Ialso felt like aborting mythird pregnancy because mydreams of mybelly seemed topredict itwas agirl. 144Isuffered from worrying about the sex of myfetus throughout myentire third pregnancy. Finally, Igave birth toason and many people said tomethat the samshin halmuni (three birth goddesses) were touched by myefforts and gave me ason. Like Park Moonwhan, some women described their experience ofaborting female fetuses orconsidering an abortion after the test ofamniotic fluid orafter consulting with Chinese doctors. Kim Soonja worried about the sex offetus and considered aborting her second pregnancy. Atthat time, her neighbor dreamed that apig entered her house. This friend said that the dream was for her and the pig meant that she would give birth toason. In order tohave this dream, she would have tobuy it. Thus, she paid 100 won (15 cents) for the dream and shefelt sure ofgiving birth to ason. Finally she had ason. After giving birth tosons, these women's efforts were constructed as akind ofachievement ortriumph. Depending onwhether women gave birth toason or a daughter, the attitudes ofhospital staff, including doctors and nurses, were different. When itwas ason, they laughed loudly, shouting that itwas agochu (pepper) with congratulations. But inthe case of adaughter, they just mentioned that itwas agirl orsometimes greeted the women with congratulations without laughing orshouting. OB &GYN doctors told methat they felt sorry for women who gave 145birth todaughters because some women cried and others seemed tobedisappointed. Many women who gave birth tosons mentioned that their family members, such ashusbands and mothers-in-law, gave medical staff gifts with gratitude. But women who gave birth todaughters did not mention gifts for doctors ornurses. Park Moonwhan said, When Igave birth tomyson (who was mysecond child), myhusband was sohappy that heran into the delivery room and kissed meand gave some presents tothe nurses, i.e. juices and stockings. His kiss became very famous inthe hospital and nurses teased me alot. Ido not know how much Icried for being sohappy that I gave birth to ason. Iwished tohave ason Iwas really Kim Soonja was angry atwomen like Park Moonwhan. She described being sad atherfirst birth not because she gave birth to adaughter but because ofthe atmosphere ofthe maternity ward, where women who had sons were treated like winners orpeople ofachievement and women who produced daughters were treated asinvisible, asiftheir labor were ofnouse orwasteful. According toher, inamaternity ward, groups ofwomen with sons ordaughters were clearly distinguished bythe look ontheir face and the surrounding people's greetings and laughing. Suh Okyung's natal mother, who had consoled her daughter, sighed that the women having sons were insensitive tothe women who had 146given birth todaughters inthe ward. Therefore, some women said that the environment made them cry for their daughters. One informant who gave birth to asecond daughter said that she was soupset because shefelt that she was crippled in not giving birth tothe son that all the other women had. However, many women explained that there was a different reason for crying atthebirth ofdaughters. That is, they cried because they felt sorry for their daughters, who would have togothrough all the sufferings ofwomen -- particularly the pain ofchildbirth, which the mothers had just experienced. They insisted that they cried over the woman's fate that these daughters would live with; getting pregnant and going through pain atchildbirth were regarded asthe most essential parts ofthis fate. When Iasked them why they did not think that their daughters might choose not toget pregnant, they replied that that was not \"normal\" or \"absurd.\" Most ofthe women regarded women's pregnancy as part ofthe fate ofbeing born awoman. Atthe same time, aspart ofthe One ofthe common discourses women themselves was, \"women have somany therefore, pain atlabor toother sufferings.\" When Iasked them what kind ofsin women committed, they left their statements vague. Yet the idea that \"women committed many sins\" was commonly expressed. Inparticular, the comment about women's sin 147became embodied when the women explained that childbirth pain was thecost ofthesin.\" When medicine ispracticed in aspecific cultural setting, the and delivery ofmedical services ismanipulated byhegemonic cultural practices; atthe same time, this hegemony reinforces and restructures existing practices. Interms ofson preference, OB &GYN doctors are deeply involved inproducing and reproducing people's need for thebirth of ason. Not only are methods prescribed to conceive amale fetus, but male fetuses are selected through testing the amniotic fluid and reading ultra-sound pictures. (Dr. Lee commented that the reading technique ofthe ultrasound record for the sex ofthe fetus iswell developed inKorea because ofsocial needs.) Inaddition, the way in which medical staff treat patients reinforces son preference. The maternity ward, where women who give birth tosons were welcomed and congratulated and women who gave birth todaughters cried and were depressed, inscribed the birth of ason asthe norm and reaffirmed the social value *The discourse offemale sin embodied through pain inlabor isvery common inwomen's narratives about their Idonot focus onexploring the genealogy ofthis discourse, but this concept ofsin was absent intraditional Korean cosmology until Western Christianity was introduced inthe 18th or19th century. The idea ofthe female sinful body isdifferent from the Korean traditional idea ofthe polluted female body. Here, pollution has been described as'matter out ofplace' (M.Douglas, Purity and Danger 1970) connoting theliminal position ofpregnancy. women's discourse ofsin here seemed torelate to theinfluence ofWestern Christianity inwhich moral corruption of the isendowed afemale body (Mieke Bal 1985). 148of ason. When birth to ason or adaughter ingroup meetings, aleader of a meeting, Kim Soonja, said, \"Fortunately all the members in this group have atleast one son, sowecan talk about it freely.\" Inanother group meeting, Cho Kyunghee, who had two daughters, said that she did not feel any need tohave a son. Then Park Moonwhan teased her, saying \"You can not say that because you donot know how different your life would beifyou had ason.\" Another woman said that women who had only daughters were defensive about their position, persisting insaying they were fine without ason. Kim Kyunghee felt avery subtle but clear message when she attended this kind ofmeeting and talked about children; other women felt sorry for her because she lacked something necessary for women. Attimes, some women felt superior to her. When women had adaughter astheir first born, they felt sorry but thought that they had another chance. However, when they gave birth totwo daughters, they felt strong spoken and unspoken pressures from the in-law family and from husbands. Kim Kyunghee said, When mysecond child was adaughter, mymother-in-law did not show any excitement atthe birth of my daughter, commenting \"anyhow you should have another pregnancy for ason, soon.\" Myfather-in-law never 149came tothe my mother-in-law conveyed hisdissatisfaction and his desire for aboy for the next pregnancy. As Iwas discharged from the hospital, Iwas sent tomynatal family immediately and stayed there for one month. When Kim Hyunsuk gave birth toasecond daughter and wanted tostop having more children, her father-in-law displayed his anger ather bytelling her husband tohave a son even outside marriage. Therefore, she was determined to have ason and worried about the sex ofthe fetus during her whole pregnancy. Finally she gave birth toason and her mother-in-law, who was sick, left her bed immediately and went tothe hospital tosee her grandson. Her father-in-law handed over mountainous land inhis village toher husband. Kim Hyunsuk's husband used totell her that hedid not mind having only daughters but atthebirth of ason, hewas incredibly happy, running into the newborn ward toconfirm that the baby had areal gochu (pepper). Another woman's father-in-law bowed toher natal parents when she gave birth to ason. Lee Kisuk said, Idid not think giving birth to ason was one of my duties as adaughter-in-law. But later Ifound that I would get introuble ifIgave birth toonly daughters. Myfather-in-law came tothe hospital and gave me a coral ring as apresent one dayafter Igave birth to his grandson. 150Some husbands's way oftreating their wives atthe birth of ason was very different from their treatment of the women atthebirth of adaughter. Their happiness was so obvious that many women were shocked, being somewhat scared atwhat would happen ifthey did not have sons. These women said that they felt their husbands might see other women later unless they had ason. Like Park Moonwhan's husband, Kim Soonja's husband did not show any excitement after his first born was adaughter, but atthebirth ofason, he gave presents todoctors and nurses, moved her from the ward toaprivate room, and comforted her bysaying that he appreciated what she had done. When women did not give birth to ason, who was the heir inthepatrilineal family, they felt that they were not meeting their role incontinuing the family line. Ofthe many things women had todointhe family, giving birth toa son was regarded asthe most traditional and authentic role ofthe woman. When OhInsook had aboy, she said, Icould not imagine how myfather-in-law would have treated meifIdid not give birth to ason as myfirst child. Onhearing Ihad home adayafter awelcoming house. For aweek after that 151Iwas being treated more as areal human-being than I had ever been since Iwas born. Iwas being served and cared for very well. Iwas soglad that Iwas born a woman sent tomychinieong (natal family) totake post-partum care, being free from all obligations inthe in-law family. Even women whose mothers had cherished the traditional values ofmaternal sacrifice and devotion and who had always considered themselves different from their mothers were not different interms ofson preference. They attributed their belief inthe necessity of ason tothe Korean cultural setting inwhich sons and daughters-in-law were morally, socially and economically responsible for parents. Daughters are supposed totake care oftheir parents-in-law first when both sets ofparents are inneed. Thus, some women decided tohave ason even intheir old age. KoSunok, who was forty-three years old in1990, identified herself asan upper-class woman inNamyang. She said, Ihave three daughters and one son. Igave birth to three daughters consecutively and was going toget sterilized. However, Ichanged mymind and made all kinds ofefforts ason. When Isaw mymother's family with only daughters, mygrand-parents were not comfortable intheir daughters' house, always being aware oftheir son-in-law. Inaddition, myaunts did not help their parents when they visited their natal 152family, while they were devoted totheir parents-in-law physically and economically. The world has been changing but Ithought ason isabsolutely necessary for old age, not just because ofeconomic reasons but for psychological and social reasons. Finally Igave birth toason atthe age of34. After that not feel tired orfrustrated. Giving birth toason compensates forall things. One son isworth more than tendaughters.\" Park Soomee, who was afriend of KoSunok, had three and noson. She said, Iwanted tohave ason because Ifelt guilty for not producing the successor for myin-law family and sorry for myfather-in-law. Inaddition, Ihad some feelings ofrivalry about why Icould asmost other women the amniotic fluid during mypregnancy inorder toknow the sex of the fetus. But finally Igot that pregnancy aborted without testing for the sex because Ithought that having only daughters might beGod's will. Myhusband's family and Iare Christian. Myfather-in-law and my husband told methat they felt really fine with daughters. KoSunok replied toPark Soomee that women who donot have a remark 153son console themselves bysaying that they are satisfied with their daughters, but that was merely away ofself soothing. KoSunok concluded, \"ason isabsolutely necessary inour society.\" somany stories about women being desperate tohave ason. One rich dentist in Namyang recently had ason even though his wife was 43years old. The husband threatened his wife that otherwise he wanted tosee other woman tohave ason. Atwenty-seven year-old IfIhad given birth to ason onmyfirst pregnancy, I could have gotten sterilized and continued mygraduate studies. But Igave birth to adaughter, soIhad to get again son; therefore myparents-in-law expect metogive birth toason despite their not mentioning their wish clearly. Ialso decided that I,asamarried woman, had better have ason instead ofgoing back to mygraduate studies. The women who had ason after having daughters, like Ko Sunok, Kim Hyunsuk and Park Moonwhan, showed conspicuously different attitudes towards sons and fully enjoyed the cultural value ascribed tosons. Park Moonwhan said, All mysons's behaviors amuse me alot. Ispend somany hours aday just watching his behavior, which isso lovely. IfIdid not have ason, Iwould live without confidence inlife, with suspicions about myhusband's 154fidelity, etc. Ireally appreciate having ason. My son, who isfive years old, imitates his father's authoritative behaviors, ignoring myand hissister's opinions. Idonot myhusband's authoritative attitudes, but Ilike and love tosee myson's cute authoritarian gestures. That behavior gives methe feeling ofreassurance and trust ofhim. These attitudes ofson preference tended toreproduce existing gender relations from the moment ofbirth, securing theidentity ofwomen inmarriage.\" Women who had sons said that afemale baby was easier todeliver than amale baby because male baby's bones have already been firmly constructed. For these women, the social difference ofmale and female was sensed bodily from the beginning ofthebirth and the fundamental difference ofmale and female was experienced inrearing them. Therefore, women who gave birth todaughters felt that their daughters' female fate was determined bythebirth. Here, the female anatomy and the social construction offemale gender are intermingled with each other inwomen's experiences and merged into acategory ofwomen. One mother complained that she was rearing her daughters ina\"modern\" way, emphasizing independence and sexual equality, but her daughter might have the same fate ashers because the mothers who were rearing sons took care *The sex ratio ofchildren who were supposed toenter elementary schools in1993 was 100 (m) :91.8 (f)(1/1/93 Korea Times). 155oftheir sons inthetraditional way.

Many ofmy informants complained about their ill-health, stating that their health status deteriorated because sanhuzori (post partum care) was neglected. Many women mentioned that sanhuzori isabsolutely needed for Korean women. InKorea, a story iswidely told that immediately after childbirth American women take ashower --usually, acold shower which issaid tobefor the dramatic effects. The story isquoted todemonstrate the authenticity and difference ofKorean women's bodily constitution compared with Western women. The implication ofthe anecdote isthat Korean cultural practices forpost-delivery are appropriate for and relevant toKorean women.\" Many women stated that they did not \"When women mentioned about sanhuzori, itdid not mean medical care inhospitals. They did notassociate their concept of Sanhuzori with their visits todoctors after childbirth. But in a Survey bythe government under the item ofsanhukwanri asking why you visited medical institutions medical institutions) after childbirth.,it was (meant only Western 52.3% ofwomen responded that they visited medical institutions; answer categories were that 156believe the effect ofsanhuzori but itwas verified empirically. OhInsook, who took apost-delivery rest with her natal family, said, As Iamgetting into mythirties, Ifeel weak and achy over all parts ofmybody. All these aches, Ithink, are caused by myill-care after childbirth. Igave birth to mytwo children natal mother insisted tomethat Ishould keep mybody warm, wearing socks and long sleeve shirts toprevent wind from entering mybody. Inaddition, Ishould not take myhair for weeks. Even though she heated myroom and let mesweat topurify mybody after delivery. After childbirth women should cover themselves with athick quilt over their bodies andlet themselves perspire.\" However, Iamnot aperson who iscalm and patient. The weather was sohot that Itook acold water shower and washed Iexposed mybody tothe cold (Neung)\". This was aterrible mistake because cold istaboo for first, doctors requested thevisit when they were discharged from the maternity wards (36.5%); second, taking out the stitches (9.0%); third, bad physical condition (5.0%); etc. (1.8%) most effective way ofmanaging athome Culture. When people catch a cold orhave fever, itissaid that itisgood toget sleep and to perspire profusely and then, you will feel good. *Sich (1983) described Neung asaKorean folk disease. 157women inpost-delivery. Even onthefirst day after birth, Iwas barefoot, walking along the hospital hall way while some old women looked at meinsurprise and told metowear socks. Idid not pay attention tothis advice which seemed to me to betraditional and a little bit superstitious. Ihave heard that American women take acold water shower right after delivery but Ihave never heard that they have neung problems. Then, what isthe relevance ofthis advice mybody with ahot towel. But when Ihad a daughter, she did not. That was another reason why I took ashower. Right after the shower, Ifelt alittle dizzy but good. But now, three orfours years later, I begin tofeel drifting inmyknees and congestion in my heart. Sometimes Ifeel asharp racking pain inmy chest when Ibreath. Iwent arest. Iwent to aChinese medical doctor toconsult with him about these symptoms, and hetold methat they were caused by negligence inpost-partum care. The doctor said that all the joints ofour bodies are swollen when women are pregnant. After birth, therefore, women should be careful tomake all joints return totheir own original position. Ifwomen donot have enough post-partum care, they always feel sick and weak. The only way tocure 158these symptoms istoget good post-partum care by giving birth Ifpossible, to have another baby good which will cure myillness offeeling cold and having myknees drift and sore joints. But my husband got avasectomy. Idonot have any alternatives. Itruly came tounderstand through my body what our older women mean bykeeping your body War in. Many families have traditionally sent their daughters in-law totheir chinjung (natal families) when the estimated date ofchild birth approached and let women have sanhuzori intheir natal homes. The reason was that daughters-in-law were not entitled tobefree from housekeeping work intheir in-law families and could not take arest torestore their physical well-being after childbirth. Not only atchild birth but also during serious illness, women were sometimes sent totheir natal families because daughters-in-law's sick role was not accepted orwas not taken seriously intheir husbands' families.\" Daughters-in-law themselves did not *This isvery similar awoman inJapan. Shedescribes (1980: 80); \"rather than unbearable sense ofobligation incurred bybeing dependent onher husband's family, most young middle-class women, even today, opt to return totheir ownparents ifthey become more than mildly ill. It isonly with their own mothers that they can escape normal socialrestrictions sufficiently torelax and recover. The same istrueafter for own mother for amonth ortwo; even when one is part of anuclear family, this is the custom. . ..At the 159feel comfortable with being sick intheir in-law families; they wanted togototheir own natal families tobecured. Many of myinformants said that the traditional custom of going totheir natal families after child-birth was \"wise\" and \"good.\" Here, the underlying logic isthat women who cannot provide the role ofcaretaker are aburden totheir in-law families, disrupting the social relations ofthe family until these women themselves have daughters-in-law. Many women said that their husbands' illness was their responsibility but they did not think their illness was their husbands' orfamily's responsibility. Women felt sorry and guilty when they were sick. Women wanted tobecared for bytheir natal mothers when they gave birth tochildren because they felt that the sick role aspect ofchildbirth was not welcomed inin-law families as M. Lock described with respect toJapanese women's illness (1980: 79-80). Depending onthe social relations ofwomen, the sick role isdifferently regarded. Married daughters' illness in their natal families istaken seriously and the daughter is expected tobefree from all family obligations, but daughters-in-law's illness inthe same family istreated as considerately and seriously asthe illness ofmarried daughters. For married women, their natal family (chinjung) still means the place which provides rest and comfort interpersonal and personal levels, therefore, responses tothe occurrence ofillness may vary, depending onwhether thepatient is male orfemale.\" 160because daughters who have married-out are culturally expected tovisit and take arest while daughters-in-law are expected toprovide all the services for these visiting sisters-in-law. Daughters-in-law cannot beexempted from their obligations inthe in-law family. This isone reason why many women insisted that the son isabsolutely needed in old age; taking care ofthe parent isanobligation for daughter-in-law but amatter ofthe heart for adaughter, rather than social responsibility. Therefore, there are some conflicts between married daughters and daughters-in-law when married daughters gotothe natal families totake a rest. Myinformants said that itwas comfortable and nice to bewith their own family, cared for bytheir mothers and sisters-in-law even though they understood their sisters-in law's unwillingness. Many of myinformants complained about how their mothers-in-law were unfair intheir differential treatment oftheir daughters and daughters-in-law who were inthe same situation. But the mothers-in-law were concerned only about their daughters' health and ignored ortreated their daughters-in-law's health lightly. OhInsook was sent toher natal family totake arest after birth but she did not listen toher mother's advice because she thought she was \"modern\" enough tobedifferent from the older generation ofwomen. However, many women could not receive post-partum care because there was noone who could fill their role ofhousekeepers/caretakers in 161their nuclear family. Even though middle-class women had natal mothers' ormothers-in-law's help for atleast several days, many of myinformants could not stay away from their roles for much longer. Lee Kisuk said, When Igave birth to myson, myparents-in-law took me totheir house and gave megood care. After having the second child, Idid not receive good care because my husband and Iwere staying in acity away from both my natal and in-law families. Myrecent poor condition, I think, isattributable tothe lack ofpost-partum care after the second birth. Now, Ican understand what older women mean by\"wind\" ontheir knees. Iknow many women have said that women become healthy after child birth ifthey got good post-partum care. Factors that also made itdifficult toobserve traditional post-partum care practices included spatial separation from the natal and in-law families because of urbanization and migration which made itdifficult tofind helpers except during two orthree days ofhospitalization for childbirth. Getting post-partum care was particularly difficult for women who gave priority tohousekeeping and taking care oftheir husbands and children. The most frequent comment made bythose women who did not have enough post-partum care was similar towhat KaYunhee said, \"I could not stay inbed aperson who istolerant ofmess and myhusband's clumsy 162housework.\" Therefore, many women complained that their ill health which was caused byneglect ofpost-partum care, was attributable tothe performance oftheir gender role inthe family. They said that women should ideally take atleast a one-month's rest torestore their bodies after childbirth but inreality few women could afford that kind ofpost partum care. As OhInsook described it, women's feelings ofill health related tochildbirth are the bodily, experiential and empirical consequence ofbeing born awoman. The women in myresearch understood childbirth asthe most critical turning point intheir lives. One of myinformants told me that she felt sorry for unmarried women who had not had a baby because they did not understand what women's sufferings were like. The factual and bodily experience ofchildbirth inscribed inwomen what being awoman meant. The bodily feeling ofpain andill-health and the social relation of being amother were empirical and factual nomatter what stories women are told about them. The married woman's sick role inSanhuzori represents the social relations ofwomen inthe family inKorean culture, and their ill bodies tell oftheir gender-specific experience. However, compared with the sick role in pregnancy and childbirth, the women's sick role after delivery isnot tangible andinstitutionalized inhegemonic Western medicine; rather, itisexperiential and cultural. 163The most common terms that women use toexplain their symptoms and the etiology ofill-health after childbirth feelings (drift: poong). That is, ifthe body were exposed toorput in contact with cold things through washing the hair, not wearing socks, ortouching cold water for house chores, the cold wind would enter into the body and make your bones and joints cold. For bodies damaged bychild birth, women usually took Chinese medicine torecover. As OhInsook mentioned, Chinese doctors recommended that women who damaged their health have another baby torestore their health tomake sure they got good post-partum care. Song Meeja said, Myhealth has been damaged byfour abortions and one childbirth. Ifelt weak with aches all over mybody. I have heard from many women that mysymptoms were caused by alack ofpost-partum care. However, myhealth would get better ifIhad another baby and get good post partum care this time. Idecided togive birth again and toshow mycommitment marriage. Ithought Iachieved these two goals by having mysecond baby. Women's understanding oftheir health problems after child birth shows the way inwhich Western medicine, Chinese medicine and folk medicine have contestatory effects on female bodies and how medical hegemony isorganized and 164articulated with cultural practices. Most of myinformants depended onWestern medical knowledge and professionals for pregnancy care and birth, but they referred their bodies after child birth toChinese medicine ortraditional empirical therapies. Women subjected their fetuses toWestern medical technology inorder to produce normal healthy babies. Onthe other hand, inorder tomaintain and restore their health, they subjected their bodies toChinese ortraditional practices. The way inwhich women perceived and mobilized Western medicine and Chinese and traditional folk therapies inmanaging their post delivery bodies isaligned with the social relations of discourse concerning Western medicine, Chinese medicine and folk therapies inKorea. That is, Western medicine is represented as\"scientific, \"\"objective\" and \"effective\" through the metaphors ofproduction, operation, fixation and visibility; onthe other hand, Chinese medicine and folk therapies are associated with theinvisibility ofits \"subjective\" and \"promotional\" efficacy through bodily experience. Here, the question iswhy the care offetuses and children ispredicated upon Western and modern practices and the care ofmother's bodies after childbirth belongs to the traditional practices. Why have Korean cultural practices ofpost-partum care survived while many cultural practices for fetuses have come tobeconsidered ineffective orattimes superstitious? 1.65Western medicine does not have any measures forpost partum care ofwomen. Western medical OB &GYNs said that there were noparticular diseases orsymptoms after delivery except for some transitional physiological problems such as articular relaxity orsome arthralgia and myalgia. Western medicine does not deal with these problems seriously because women's bodies adjust their pregnant physiology tothestate ofnon-pregnancy naturally and gradually. Dr. Yang explained that when women felt these physiological symptoms they immediately sensed them inthe way that old women talked about drift (the sensation ofentering the wind tothe body). Dr. Yang also said that she felt the sensation inthe same way when she gave birth toher second child because she had heard about those feelings before she experienced them. Her mother advised her not even tobrush her teeth and wash her face toprevent her from getting aninternal cold. However, Dr. Yang explained that people's complaints were ideological and the sanhupoong (\"drift\" sensation after childbirth) was akind ofpsychosomatic symptom for housewives. She said, \"we doctors donot have any language todescribe and explain the physical symptoms that many married women complain about, attributing their ill-health tothe lack ofappropriate post-partum care.\" However, Chinese medicine, which has not paid much attention to prenatal care and childbirth, has emphasized post-partum care. Inaddition, Chinese medicine has ofcaring forpost-delivery bodies, sanhuzori (post-partum AChinese doctor, Dr. Lee, said that the sanhuzori isthe most important remedy in maintaining and restoring married women's health after childbirth. The idea ofwomen's damaged health as aresult ofthe care isvery related tothe hegemony ofmedical discourses and the way inwhich medical practices articulate with Korean culture. What references do women mobilize tounderstand their experiences ofbodily transformation from pregnancy tosanhupoong (post-delivery illnesses) and how dowomen select certain resources for prenatal care, delivery, and post-partum care? What makes them turn sometimes toscientific medicine and sometimes to Korean folk health measures? Bygoing through pregnancy, women's bodies becomes the locus atwhich scientific and traditional health practices experience ofthe Korean projects. Concurrently, Iexamine the achievement offemale adulthood inindustrialized urban settings. The previous section dealt with middle-class women's experience ofmodernity amidst the spatial rationality ofapartment complexes, which entitled a standardization and homogenization oftheir life style. This chapter deals with working-class women's experience of modernity, amidst their spatial dislocation from village to urban factories; ittraces the way inwhich they achieve a status women\" through Inorder tointerview women inalow-income group, I first sought tomeet with several women inthe Namyang Health Center onthe assumption that women who were using the government health services came from low-income groups. Ithen visited their homes with their permission. However, these visits were logistically difficult because the women's residential areas were dispersed all over Namyang city orin nearby villages. Inaddition, some were suspicious that I might beaffiliated with agovernment agency. The brevity of our acquaintance inthe health center created difficulties inestablishing rapport. Before Ivisited the working-class women, Iusually 168made appointments for interviews bytelephone asIdid for the interviews with the middle-class women. However, the working-class women were relatively inhospitable to my telephone calls even though they had previously told meto call them up. Once Icalled awoman who had told meshe had had six abortions. Itold the woman who answered the phone that Iwould like totalk toKim Soonja ssi (Miss orMrs. Soonja Kim). loudly and said teasingly, \"Don't make ajoke.\" Iwas embarrassed but insisted that I would like tospeak toKim Soonja ssi. For almost two or three minutes, she yelled inamusement atme, saying, \"Stop making melaugh. Who isthis? ('s mother) 2\"Itold quickly, \"I amthe person whom you met atthe Namyang Health Center several days ago.\" She seemed to beconfused for alittle while and then became very cool. Then, she said, \"I amsorry. Ihave never heard myfull name onthe not tocall myfull name inthis way. So Ithought some of myfriends were making fun of mejust for fun.\" And she refused tobeinterviewed because she said that she did not have anything particular tosay tome. This approach, inwhich Itreated women asindividuals, independent from their living context, did not work. It embarrassed them, leading them toact shy and reserved. They were not accustomed toidentifying themselves as individuals, independent from their familial role ofwife 169and mother. Many women were confused bybeing formally addressed onthe telephone with the use ofssiafter their names. They are familiar with being addressed assomeone's mother orsomeone's wife after marriage. When they worked in factories and companies, they were addressed simply asMiss Kim orMiss Lee. Addressing them with ssi made them feel funny and embarrassed. Thus, Ialtered the way Imet working-class women. inwhich their agency asmothers and wives would beacknowledged in their own everyday life settings. The secretary ofNamyang YMCA told methat there were several nurseries for low-income families and Iwas introduced tothe personnel of anursery run bythe Association ofNamyang Woman Workers. Idid not intend to make astructured comparison ofmiddle-class and working class women's experience ofexposure to\"the modern.\" However, Ithought that the kindergarten, run bythe Namyang YMCA, and the nursery, run bythe Association ofNamyang Woman Workers, would provide agood context inwhich tosee how working-class experiences ofeveryday life practices motherhood intersected toembody female gender inKorean society. A. APoor district where aman can live without awife but cannot live without apair ofrain boots Thefirst time the cab driver looked back atme, ready tocomplain, and asked where Iwas going. I road. know, this isthedirtiest and poorest area inNamyang. This isthe area where men can live without awife but not without a pair ofrain boots. What kind ofbusiness doyou have here? \"Igot out ofthe cab and thestreet tothe nursery. The streets, orrather alleys, ofthis area were muddy andfilled with black water from abriquette factory because the day before Ivisited the nursery ithad rained. When Iwalked along several alleys, Icould seeslate roofed brick buildings behind cement walls, and could smell garbage, briquettes, sewage, human wastes, and some chemicals. (Later Irealized the low buildings Ipassed were factories.) When Igot tothe nursery, Icould see a colorful wall-painting ofchildren playing, and smelled a strong stench ofurine. The nursery had one big room for children with atiny seesaw and aslide, akitchen, asmall room for the Association ofNamyang Women Workers, and another room which was rented to afamily. The toilet was located outside sothat children used thetoilet training nightchair inthe nursery room. Nursery teachers cleaned up the waste bythrowing itinto asewage drain inthe front 171yard. There were fifteen children, whose ages ranged from three tosix. The nursery --which was built in1989 bythe Association ofNamyang Women Workers with theassistance of German church (EZE) funds --took care ofchildren whose mothers were full-time workers atfactories oremployees in small businesses. The exceptions were two cases: amother who was working with asewing machine athome and amother who had just given birth toanadditional baby without any helpers. These mothers' workplaces were mainly small factories with less than fifty employees, orinsome cases, even less than ten. Usually the work conditions ofthese factories were terrible, with noise, dust, heat, and abad smell. Thus, only married woman, whose skills were not very marketable but who needed money, would take jobs there. Big, clean factories prefer unmarried young women (cf: Ong 1987; Kim 1990) :the unmarried women were considered more productive and easier tomanage compared tomarried women, whose primary concerns are family, children, and housekeeping. These mothers wanted tofind ajob near their homes, sothat they could meet their wifely and maternal obligations and leave work easily ifanemergency came upat home. Therefore, the married women's workplaces were located within walking distance; but the conditions were terrible. One ofthe nursery children's mothers, Meesuk's mother, 172who had worked inanaudio facilities factory, said that the workshop was sofull ofdust that she could see dust to almost adepth of acentimetre onher hair and shoulders in the afternoon. She quit that factory job because she could not stand the dust and noise. Juntae's mother, whose workshop produced kitchen sinks, said: Myfactory building, which was built onanillegal site, was soshabby that itwas too hot insummer and even inspring. There was almost noroof except for a very thin tarred insweat. Inaddition, weused sothat its smell paralyzed our noses. Werubbed wood with sandpaper and the whole room was full ofdust. Sometimes, some middle-aged women played with this dust bytouching younger men's \"lower part\" (genital area), marking them with their dusted hands totease the young. Like other Korean workers, these mothers worked even on Saturday; thus, the nursery was also open until 5:30 PMon Saturday. Most ofthese mothers were working because their husband's income was not sufficient tosupport their family. Jina's mother, ahigh school graduate, was staying at home as afull-time housewife and said that she was different from the women inthe community. She said that she had worked as asecretary for apolitical party office and had dated reporters andpolitical aspirants and came from a 173middle-class family. She described the Yaksan area inthis way: Myhusband did not make money, sowemoved into this area. This is avery poor neighborhood and all the women around here are working atfactories. Mydaughter wondered why Idid not work inafactory like her friends' mothers around here. Myself, Ican't. Ihave never thought about working atthe factory nomatter what situation Iamin. Icannot work at afactory to make money but Imight at afactory ifIcould work asanactivist.\" When Ifirst moved inhere, I found out that the women inthis neighborhood were ignorant and did not have the concept ofhygiene. They were watching their children play inthe dirty water mixed with chemical dyes overflowing from the drain. I cannot associate with any neighbors closely even though Ihave lived here for two years. Jina's mother proudly said that she did not have any close neighbor friends. For most women inpoor areas, neighbor relations were the most important resource for *Since thelate '70s and the '80s many college students and college graduates had gone tofactories and worked asworkers toraise workers' class consciousness and tohelp them organize labor unions. This woman, who rented aroom from the Association of Namyang Women Workers, saw many college-graduate labor activists and identified herself with these activists rather than with other working mothers inthis area. She came totheoffice tosmoke since many women activists came and smoked here. She said that she could not smoke athome because her husband regarded women's smoking as bad and immoral. 174socio-economic survival (cf. :Cho and Cho 1991). Jina's mother's ideas about the poor community reflected the general view ofpoor people inKorean society. Especially middle-class women regard married factory women aspoor, ignorant and ugly. Jina's mother's distinction from other neighbor women came from her education, work background and her feminine capital ofbeauty, which had allowed her to associate with socio-economically promising men. She always dressed well and put onmake-up, although she said that her husband wanted her tobehave like his children's mother, not like ayoung beauty. Other neighbors commented that she was poor but never helped her husband bymaking supplementary money and she lacked amaternal instinct. Imet forty working mothers, including fifteen nursery children's mothers inthe Yaksan area (see Table 4.1.). I chose twenty ofthese women for the purpose ofcollecting their life stories. When Iasked the working women for interviews thefirst time, they always said that they did not have time totalk with me. They had tobehome before their husbands arrived tocook and take care oftheir children. They added that even onweekends they did not have free time tomeet mefor laundry work and cleaning house. However, Iwas working as avolunteer teacher inthe nursery and they had tomeet meevery evening when they came totake back their children. So we came totalk about their children's cute doings and problems. After talking with me 175and seeing myrelationship with their children inthe nursery, they began toask about me: Why had Icome tothe nursery and what Iwant toknow about them? Gradually, they invited metostop bytheir houses after dinner. When I asked them about their married life and childbirth, and their experiences offactory work, they thought that the questions were easy and personal. They enjoyed their memories ofdating men, ofthe early days oftheir donggo (cohabitation), and their pregnancies and contraception. However, they were curious about whether this kind of trivial personal information would contribute tomy dissertation. Table 4.1. The age distribution ofthe working-class couples age24 25 26 2728 29 30 31 32 33 3435 36 3738 3940 41 42 43 F 1 3 2 2 2 7 5 5 6 2 1 1 2 1 M- 1 2 1 7 27 3 4 3 1. 4 1 1 1 1(F\u00bawife, TMThusband Tri\u00ba F-40, M-39, one woman was a widow.) Myinformants who had one ortwo children lived ina room with atiny attached kitchen, whose rent was around 70,000 won (about $100). Adeposit was required of500,000 won ($700). Several families inthis area shared houses that were built tocontain several households. The inside ofthe house inthis area was usually dark and cool, soeven in summer they used the Korean style ofheating, inwhich the underfloor was heated with abriquette tomake the floor of 176their rooms dry and warm atnight. They took out the briquettes inthe day time because they made their small space steam. When people were intheir houses, they opened the door, sothat outsiders could see the inside. This open space living style, inwhich their everyday life was visible and audible tooutsiders, was different from the closed space ofmiddle-class apartment houses which were guarded by janitors. The front door was always locked inmiddle-class apartment houses. The open and interpenetrating housing in working-class districts did not guarantee safety from thieves; however, some studies inthe early 1980s found out that this kind ofliving environment for rural migrants created areciprocal and communal ethos that was similar to the rural community (E.S.Kim 1983). The women in1991 said that even soy bean paste and hot pepper paste orclothes that had been washed were stolen and some women had almost been raped and tied upbythieves. Yaksan was anarea not well served bythe urban infrastructure, which was apparent inthe unpaved muddy alleys. Itwas said that people could not walk onthestreet with normal shoes onrainy days. This was notliterally true, but the phrase expressed the underdevelopment and backwardness ofthis area compared tothe other part ofthe city. Recently, toaccommodate the increasing population in Seoul's metropolitan area, the central government decided to redevelop the Yaksan area into aresidential district for 177middle-class people. However, noaction had yet been during myfieldwork Thus, when Idid myfieldwork inthe Yaksan district, poor people's housing and small factories were crowded together and the housing inthe Yaksan area was considered cheap, bad and dirty. Korean society had been successfully industrialized asthe result ofworkers' hard labor, but workers were looked down upon as the poor, ignorant masses orasangry, violent protesters, asthe television news sometimes showed. Thus, the image of the \"muddy,\" \"dirty,\" road ofYaksan encapsulated the image ofthe worker's poor living conditions, low social status and oil, dust-stained body, anditsignified the exclusion ofworkers from the urban neatness and conveniences brought about byKorean development and modernization. B.Migrant factory women and the Korean modernization Myfirst question, when Iinterviewed the working women attheir homes, was when they had come toSeoul's metropolitan area. These working women usually did not tell memuch about the early period oftheir factory lives after they had left their hometown. Even though Iasked specifically about their factory lives before marriage, many women did not describe their experiences indetail. Usually they began their stories from the time they were dating their future husbands. Many women thought that their meaningful lives began after they met their future husbands 178and lived with them. Juntae's mother began her story as follows: Igraduated from atthe factory. I came tothis factory because the company allowed workers toattend the school atnight. One and ahalf years factory because ofanemia and Iquit. Istayed atmysister's house for two years, taking care ofher kids and helping her with housework. Then, Iwas employed by asmall electronics factory and lived inthe factory dormitory. Iwas quite popular with male workers and dated several men simultaneously. Iwas fond oftalking and going about with men. Myhusband was one ofthose guys but Iwas not much Iended upliving with him because heappealed tomymaternal instincts; give more attention tothe weak. Heloved me somuch and was very jealous ofother Iwas Ibegan tolive with him atthe age oftwenty one. Itwas much better and fun living together than living alone and atthe same time itgave melots of security. Rural migrant girls who had worked infactories had been the main, critical labor force inachieving rapid 179economic growth since Korea had launched its industrialization effort. Female workers were the most important inthe labor intensive-manufacturing industries from the 1970s tothe mid-1980s. They produced most of Korea's export goods, facilitating export-oriented high economic growth (S.K.Kim 1990: S.K.Cho 1989). Between 1966 and 1985, female participation inthe manufacturing labor force increased from 33.6% to42.3%. The growing number of women involved inmanufacturing has been anintegral component ofKorea's industrial accomplishment. By1985, female workers comprised more than half the work force in electronics (51.5%), textiles (65.2%), and garment (77.8%) and rubber footwear manufacturing (63.6%).\" Almost all the women inYaksan had the same experience ofmigrating, working infactories, and entering marriage through donggo (co-habitation). All the women, except for twomothers,\" were born inrural areas andmigrated to metropolitan industrial zones intheir teens, from the mid '70s tothe early '80s. They had experienced Korean modernization and industrialization through working in *Industrialization wasintensified beginning with the second economic development plan (1967-1971). Along with this, migration and urbanization occurred. After the mid-1980s, female workers from the manufacturing sector began todrain the tertiary service sectors (S.K. Cho :1989). Femaleparticipation inthe total labor force increased gradually in 1960 to 39.9% inthe 1970s and 64.7% in1989. The came from the Ministry ofLabor in1985.rapid manyinto work from data *One was born inand graduated from high school inNamyangcity and the other woman inSeoul. 180factories.\" With theexception ofavery few who migrated with their families, most ofthese women migrated alone through their personal orfamilial networks and began their city life asfactory workers inelectronics, textile, glass, and sewing factories, orsometimes worked asbus conductors orservice workers. Most of myinformants recalled their early impression offactories bynoting how hard their work had been, how sleepy they had been atwork, and how naive they had been in doing extra work without complaints and without any rewards when their supervisors orsenior workers asked forit. Many women also recalled how fast the conveyer belts had moved and how busy and competitive they had been inachieving assigned jobs. One former garment-factory worker described thefirst scene that she had seen inher published notes: Thefirst day that Iwent tothe factory, the sewing machine, which was operating very fast, was so impressive. Inawink ofaneye the needle of asewing machine stitched afemale worker's finger while she was pushing clothes tothe machine. Iwas shocked but other workers did not pay much attention toit. She handled the machine sothat itwould stitch backwards and *Itissaid that there are two peak ages atwhich women findtheir first jobs infactories, immediately after junior high school (aged 15and 16) and after high school (aged 18and 19). Kim's (1990:114) study shows that among her informants, 42% (284 women) took their first job atages 15to16, and 35% (234 women) tooktheir first job atages 18to19. 181picked her finger out. Then she applied sewing machine oil toher wounded finger, bandaged itwith ascrap of cloth modernization and industrialization, and encapsulated the dream offuture prosperity. Migrant female workers were told over and over that they were warriors onthe industrial front. Asis frequent inKorea, the project ofindustrializing the nation was metaphorized as awar against the old Korea, which had been stained bypoverty.* Exposed toideological and physical regulations for increasing production, female workers were usually urged tofeel that production was more urgent and socially important than anything else, including their individual well-being. Therefore, they could not interfere with the operation ofthe system ofproduction by being absent because oftheir personal problems. One ofthe most common expressions Iheard from myinformants was; \"I was sorry for the line leaders and mycolleagues because I was sick and Icould not gotowork. Iwas afraid that their work would beintrouble because of myabsence.\" Productive pressure inthe factory structured female workers' moral *Metaphors ofwar were easily understood and accepted assignifying the urgency and importance of atask inthe Koreancultural context. The Korean people's emotions toward war seemed to berelated particularly tothe experience ofthe Korean war and to the dominance ofmilitary culture under regime abetter and awealthier Korea, factory women became the subject ofphysical and ideological control byaggressive capitalist productivity. Atthe same time, their gender was incorporated into the productive sector, through the transformation ofthe women's cultural virtues ofpassivity, tolerance and willingness toobey authority into awork morality for women. The work ethos resulted inlow pay, long working hours, and the idea ofthe factory first before the individual (cf: S.K. Kim 1991). Unmarried women workers went towork although they were sick oreven had had abortions. Line leaders knew what had happened towomen butstill wanted them toappear that Ihad anabortion, Icalled up my garment company the next day and said that Iwas sick. Aline leader told metocome ifitwas not soterribly serious. Myabsence would interfere with the assigned target ofproduction inhis line. And Iwent towork just after Ihad taken medicine. Ifelt very ill and almost fainted atwork. Other workers knew that Ihad had anabortion; they had sympathy for meintheir minds but did not acknowledge itverbally. Everybody assumed that we had to come towork unless wewere in a critical situation. When Irealized that Iwas inmy third month ofanother pregnancy, Icalled the that make itthat 183day. Atthat time Iwent through awedding ceremony and was formally married. The manager threatened meby saying that Ishould leave the factory ifIdid not come towork. Idid not make itand quit the factory. The experiences offorced control and production discipline atfactory were rationalized with anideology concerning the national historical necessity for and urgency ofindustrialization. Atthe same time, itcarried the discourse ofmodernity, economic wealth and development by constructing workers' desire for getting out ofpoverty. In order toachieve this, primary emphasis was given on \"collective\" interests such asfactories, nation, state, and government. The good ofthe collective body was socially constructed asbeing good for family and individuals' interests. Until the mid-1980s, thespirit ofhamyontoenda ofthe Samauel Movement (New Village Movement). The catch-phrase was prominently displayed inevery work setting, creating a kind ofnational ideology that enforced development and modernization under anexport-oriented economy. The government campaign emphasized that Korea had ahuge labor force but few material resources; therefore, Koreans' survival depended onthe export ofmanufactured goods setting. Thus, the Samauel Movement inindustrial settings was implanted to organize workers psychologically for production. The Samauel Movement, which was begun inthe early 1970s bythe Korean government, was the most visible and well-executed modernization project nation-wide. Through this movement's campaign, all Korean people were exposed to thepolitical and emotional discourse ofmodernization and social change. The Samauel Movement, which constructed Korean people's mindset as\"productivity,\" emphasized that hard work and individual sacrifice was needed torealize national development. Inorder toachieve this aim, the government mobilized whole social institutions such as educational institutes, industrial companies, the governmental administrative apparatus, and civic organizations inthe 1970s and the early 1980s. The movement focusing onchange emphasized the difference between modernizing, industrializing, practical Korea and impoverished, irrational, superstitious, ostentatious old Korea. The achievements ofthis modernization project were powerfully demonstrated through such visible changes in rural areas aswidened roads and achange inroofs from thatch toslate. Productivity inurban factories was visible indisplays ofbig assembly and huge loads ofproducts for export onships. Inaddition, aneffort was made to (working and ostentatious traditional customs. The government's discourse ofmodernization embodied in the Samauel Movement constructed anew structure offeeling (Williams 1977: 128-135) that underpinned productivity and development. Many women and men whom Iinterviewed inYaksan dreamed ofmaking money incities and having freedom from obligations; thus, they wanted tocome tourban areas. Through nation-wide modernization campaigns based on industrialization, factories inurban areas meant economic opportunity tothem. Asmodernization implied, many people believed that the further things moved from the rural and traditional, the more developed, modern and better they Were . C.The Lack ofsymbolic capital for \"the modern\" :Low education working-class women 1.Women's low education and the inscription ofpoverty The women identified themselves ashaving money.\" However, the phrase \"no learning\" (low formal education) was mentioned more frequently as a way ofrepresenting their position inKorean society. The discourse oflow education referred totheir poor family background, which did notprovide higher educational opportunities for them andatthe same time, explained their present position ofbeing working- class wives. 186The narratives that most dramatically expressed the way inwhich their impoverished background had been inscribed in their lives was their memory ofdropping out ofschool. Many women said that their families could not pay the tuition fees even for middle school. When these working women met me, mymost impressive andattractive aspect was that Iwas carrying out mydoctoral studies. They said, \"how wonderful (gongbu manihaeso elmana chonya) l\"The image ofextensive studying, operational power for creating desires ofthe \"modern,\" conveyed afree, independent, better life that was separated from their everyday life experience. They mentioned how frustrated and resentful they had been oftheir poor parents, and how many nights they had cried, pulling their bedclothes over their heads. Haesoon's mother said, Instead ofgoing toschool, Iwas supposed tostay at home and help while myfriends were still inschool. Ifelt soashamed and Icould not stand the situation. Thus, Iwent uptoSeoul and became abus conductor because someone told methat this job would allow metomake more money than going to afactory. Mylife chalmot manada (meeting the wrong parents or having poor parents) was another comment made frequently as ameans ofexplaining their present position. When Iasked 187the women what their lives had been like intheir home villages, they just made categorical comments, such as\"we were very poor soIhad togotoafactory.\" Or, \"nobody in myfamily concerned myself.\" Inlimiting their number ofchildren and practicing contraception, they emphasized the parental role of providing good care and making ahigh educational level possible for children. One ofthetraits that distinguished these young mothers from their own mothers was their own consciousness ofbeing socio-economically equipped for motherhood. Many women remembered their parents' suffering because oftoo many children and their deprived feelings at not getting adequate care because oftoo many siblings. They also remembered their unequal treatment compared with their brothers. Girls were required tohelp with housework. Meejin's mother said, Inthe old days couples had many children. Myparents had six and myhusband's parents also had six children. Not only because ofpoverty but also because they had too many children, wecould not get enough care and support from our parents. Ialways thought that Iwould not live like mymother. Myhusband thought inthe same way. Ofseventeen women who mentioned the number oftheir siblings, five women had seven siblings; one woman had six; ten women had five; five women had four; two women had 188three. (In order tosee the difference, see their number of children inchapter 5,Table 5.8.) Ingeneral, girls who had dropped out ofschool had high aspirations for more education. Big factories -- especially garment factories which employed large numbers of female workers --ran night schools sothat they could recruit prospective workers byproviding them with the opportunity toget thecertificate ofgraduation for middle school orhigh school. Juntae's mother's story, which I introduced earlier, exemplified this point. Some women said that they used tocarry middle school English and math texts for awhile, wishing togotonight high school ortotake a qualification examination sothat they could enter high school again. Around factory districts there were informal night schools called yahak, run byvolunteer college students. However, asEunyoung's mother said, many female workers did not attend this kind ofschool because these yahak focused onraising worker's class consciousness; on the other hand, the workers wanted totake aregular school curriculum topass qualifying exams for ahigh school diploma. Inreality, very few workers were able torealize their aim ofgetting ahigh school diploma and entering college inorder toget out oftheir position ofkongsuni (a derogatory generic term todenote female factory workers: Kong means factory and suni isacommonly used girl's name.) Among myinformants, Hyunsuk's mother was awoman who 189realized this dream but she met aman who wanted tolive with workers; however, she came back toaworking-class community and worked asayahak teacher. During my fieldwork, she was working asaninsurance saleswoman. Hyunsuk's mother's story showed that itwasdifficult for female workers tochange their status without others' help and awoman's position inthe social order was determined inrelation tomen. Hyunsuk's mother said that she hated being inthe discarded position ofkongsuni (factory girl) and dreamed ofgetting out ofit. Finally, she had achance toescape from it, but when she came back tothe position ofKongsuni with her labor activist boy friend, she did not view herself as akongsuni. She wished tobe woman) She might not have come back toafactory ifshe had not met her college-graduate, activist husband. Hyunsuk's mother was not typical ofworking mothers but toillustrate the situation ofanunmarried female worker, Iprovide the following vignette: Hyunsuk's mother's family was poor; hence, she could not pay the tuition fee for high school. She worked in asmall furniture factory inSengnam (near Seoul) after she finished middle school. One day she got off abus infront of auniversity inSeoul and entered, sitting inside abuilding for ten minutes, looking atstudents. 190Since that day, she had gone tothe library ofthat university with amath text for middle-school students and some novels. She said, \"Iwas not doing anything but enjoying the atmosphere, which seemed tobelofty and foreign. When Iwas there, Ifelt Iwas one ofthe college students.\" She met acollege man who was curious about her because she stayed inthe library until the closing time everyday. Hewas astudent who was preparing for the national exam inforeign affairs. When herealized she was afactory worker who just spent time there, hebought her dinner several times and recommended that she study toget ahigh school certificate. She did not know how to doitand was worried about quitting her job. One day hebrought her acertificate which hehad paid for sothat she could enrol inahigh school course. When she told her parents that she would quit factory work tostudy for a high school diploma, her parents opposed her decision, wanting her tomake money for her family. However, she quit the factory and began tostudy. Finally she passed the exam and entered acollege. Her friend --this college student --paid thefirst semester ofcollege though college, Ihad alot ofproblems, including financial difficulties. Idid not know what other students had learned from their regular high school education and I 191did not know any cultural orliterary work. Students got together according totheir high school networks. I did not have networks. Iwas very lonely and Iwas quite scared ofbeing left out.\" She dropped out of college after one year ofattendance because she could not pay for tuition and began towork in agarment factory as acutter. She said, \"Ithought heloved me sohewas helping me. Iliked him somuch and appreciated his help. But now Ithink that hemight have just had sympathy for me. Iwas sonaive. Nothing happened between us. IfIslept with him, the situation might have been different. Who knows? After hepassed the national exam for foreign affairs, hegot married and worked inthe Ministry ofForeign Affairs. Hesent methe wedding invitation but Idid not attend his wedding. That's all.\" She met her husband inastudent demonstration onthestreet. She was passing bybut he was running away from policemen who were chasing him. She rescued him byholding onto his arm ashis girlfriend. Hetold her that hewas looking for ajob in Hewas astudent activist who was enrolled inthe department ofelectronic engineering at one ofthe most prestigious universities inSeoul. She volunteered tofind ajob for him. She was not interested inthe labor movement, but she began toget involved initbyteaching woman workers atnight 192school asshe become more involved with him. Her husband always told her that itwas she who seduced him. But she said that she might have had adifferent and more comfortable life ifshe had not met her husband. When Iasked Hyunsuk's mother whether she had taken advantage ofher female gender toget help from thefirst man and toget married tothe male college graduate, she asked howitwould bepossible with her face. However, she said that the man's help to awoman was natural, aswas his favor orsympathy for her. Actually, several women told me that their future husbands had given them some money during the time they dated and they accepted itand thought that this kind offavor was natural between men and women. Hyunsuk's mother identified herself as acollege drop-out and also linked herself most ofthe time with her husband's status ofcollege graduate after marriage. 2.Education and the modern performance offemale gender For myinformants, low education marked the most regrettable aspect ofthe poverty oftheir youth. Most of the working-class women said that their most heart-felt resentful and shameful feeling came from their lack of learning, not from poverty itself. They regretted their lack ofeducation and felt that their life would have been different ifthey had been more educated. For them, low 193education signified their poor and backward origins, their current class position, and the life ofsuffering towhich they were condemned astheresult ofbeing born women. Many families sacrificed their daughters for their sons; sons were sent tohigher-level schools and daughters were encouraged towork infactories inorder tosend their brothers toschool ortosave money for their own marriage. Table 4.2. The educational background ofworking-class couples m\\f ele(mentary) middle high college total (year) (1-6) (7-9) (10-12) (13-16) ele l 2 junior 2 high 1 1F4 1 O *Inthe category ofcollege, Iincluded two-year night colleges and technical colleges. Ialso included those who had dropped out ofcollege nomatter how many years they had been incollege. Iput people injunior-middle school and high school even though they did not complete the course.: i : 7 Since education was powerful discourse inconstructing the modern and developed Koreans, the women's low education was understood toeffect their gender performances: that is, the way inwhich they carried out their maternal and wifely roles inmodern urban settings. Youngmee's mother, who finished only six years ofelementary school, felt ashamed ofherself and was afraid when she was asked towrite anything down atwork. She worried that her low level of education would berevealed and would shame her. She said: 194The thing Imost resent inmylife longer (mot paeiwo\" tola). Iamnowthirty one years old but still Icould have achance tolearn. Iamvery toraise a child. Ibeat mydaughter often when she does not obey me. Idonot have school learning, soIdonot manage mykids' problems inother \"learned\" ways. Iknow Iam wrong. sorry for mydaughter, who becomes passive. Iamafraid that mykids might ask meabout their studies after they enter the elementary school. Youngmee's mother worried that she was not qualified to perform the role ofgood and confident mother because ofher lack offormal education. The industrialized urban environment constantly asked what level ofeducation women had finished and demanded women's involvement inbringing up children. Many working-class women had agood understanding of the symbolic meaning ofwomen's education; women's education was important not only toget good office jobs but also to manage married life well. Women's education was often understood asthe index ofwomen's social and biological competence for motherhood; educated women were expected to bring uptheir children inthe \"modern and learned\" way. 195Moreover, educated, smart were togive birth tochildren who were assmart asthey were. InKorea, itis commonly said that achild's brain originates from the maternal line while the body structure takes after the father's lineage. Therefore, many families considered women's smartness and intelligence when they arranged marriage, thinking ofthe offspring. Actually, men's concerns about their offspring were frequently expressed during dating asHaesoon's mother and Youngmee's mother said. Haesoon's husband said that heliked her because he would have asmart child like her. Youngmee's husband said that heproposed toher average-height children. Iasked people why woman's education was important, regardless oftheir class and gender position, the answers focused onthe value ofeducation associal capital for the fulfilment ofthe wifely and maternal role. However, itwas commonly said that awoman's level of education should bethe same, orslightly less than the man's, because the wife's role was toassist and understand her husband inboth the public and private spheres. She would accomplish this bymobilizing her social and cultural resources. Many people believed that smart women gave birth tosmart children and brought them upinasmart way. Interestingly, many men and women did not give much credit 196tothe economic value of awoman's education, thinking it was not adependable commodity. When Ipointed out this value, some people even denied its economic relevance. Here, awoman's education was regarded as acertificate that would enable her tomeet abetter man and marry into awell off family; itwas aprecondition for biologically-qualified femininity; itmeant she could perform wifely and maternal roles well. Therefore, women's education, which was asocio-economic and class-bounded product inKorean culture, was becoming aform ofgendered symbolic capital; itwas aqualification for the new way of practicing femininity and motherhood. However, the social and cultural value ofworking-class women's formal education was situated within class boundaries framed particularly bytheir husbands' socio economic condition. Women's formal education did not always work associal capital for social mobility; its efficacy depended upon acertain context. Only properly-situated woman's education worked as social capital. For example, the value of ahigh-school graduate worked differently in middle-class and working-class families, because, in general, the way inwhich women's education worked depended upon class and the social position ofhusbands. Education was not social capital initself but became social capital 197combined with class and gender positions. Amiddle-school graduate woman's labor activist, Sukjin's mother, explained how the value ofeducation as social capital changed with the passage ofKorean modernization. She said, When Iwas afactory worker inthe late 1970s, very few high school graduates worked infactories. Most were elementary school graduates and even junior middle school graduates were few. But female workers' hakbul (level ofeducation) ishigh. Most ofthe unmarried women workers are high-school graduates. Those workers who work inelectronics factories receive ahigh income (ranging from 300,000 to400,000 won [$450-5501) and spend their money onclothes, shoes, and cosmetics, playing tennis, swimming, and learning how toplay the piano. Unmarried female workers' way ofthinking about themselves are different from ours inthe late 1970s or the early 80s. Recently, factory girls have thought they are asort ofjungsancheung (middle-class) and are quite indifferent tothe labor movement. This activist wascritical ofyoung factory workers, saying that they had afalse consciousness oftheir class position and rosy dreams ofbeing full-time housewives. The unmarried workers had accepted amanufactured image oftheir future inwhich awife gave her husband agood standing atthe front door with ababy inher 198arms. However, this activist said, \"Sooner orlater, the young girls will get married and give birth toachild, and will realize what kind oflife they will lead.\" She took the class position asthe most critical condition todefine people's lives and did not give the constructive power to the level ofwomen's education within aclass boundary. Ingeneral, itwas normal that awoman had less education than her husband, but there were several couples whose wives had more education than their husbands, asTable 4.2. shows. Women's education initself was not sufficient assymbolic capital unless itwas combined with several other factors, such asbeauty orfamily background. Many middle-class women also were high-school graduates but their lives differed from the working-class high- school graduates. Most ofthe working-class mothers said that once women became factory workers and married tomale workers, it did not make abig difference whether the women had finished high school ormiddle school; after marriage, women's fate depended upon men's ability tomake aliving. This activist's comment was true inthe sense that awomen's individual character became integrated into the family role and individual woman socially manifested herself through the social relations ofher position of amother and wife. However, women's education as apower ofmodernity created discursive practices towomen's lives, conflicting with and intruding into existing power relations. Some 199working mothers said that the high-school-graduate factory women might besmarter than they were and might manage their lives differently from what they had done. Sungsuk's mother, who had graduated from high school and Haesoon's mother, who was ahigh school drop-out, said that they were naive and would not lead the same lives ifthey could start again. Sungsuk's mother who had recently begun towork asan insurance saleswoman, said: IfIwere not ahigh school graduate, Iwould not have been eligible toapply for this job. Depending ontheir education level, women are different. When Iwas inthe job-training workshop, Ifound that the women there did not chat much and did not gossip about other women. I realized that many ofthese saleswomen were college graduates and seemed tocome from adifferent class, not like the Yaksan neighborhood. Igot ajob toget out ofmystressful marriage. Myhusband enjoys gambling and comes home late. Maybe hehates tosee me, because Ibecame fat after childbirth. Ithink heis dating another woman who might beslim and pretty. I have tried todo mybest toget his attention, but he iswandering around outside. Ithink hedoes not love me, sohedoes not care much about the home. Recently, Ihave been thinking about the old people's saying that songchunginun soliplu'l mo'ko'yahanda (apine caterpillar should eat pine leaves: birds of afeather 200flock together). The old people inmyfamily used to say tomethat marriage had tobearranged between people who came from similar family backgrounds and similar educational levels. Imarried arural man who only graduated from middle school and whose family was very poor. Iamanopen-minded person, while myhusband sticks tothe old feudal way ofthinking. Hebelieves that the woman should beathome without raising her voice and men can dowhatever they want todoand can come home atany time. Sungsuk's mother was inserious conflict with her husband when Iinterviewed her. She diagnosed their cause of conflict asher lack ofwhat her husband called femininity: awoman should besubmissive, pretty and slim. She angrily added that she had been that kind ofwoman, but once awoman had given birth tochildren and had started todohousework, itwas impossible tomaintain that kind ofbody. Her analysis was that her husband's behavior atfirst came from his inferiority complex but later hejust wanted toavoid his social and economic responsibility for three children and awife. Hetold her that hehated her having ajob but she thought that hemight secretly beglad inhis mind that she could make aliving. Haesoon's mother who dropped out ofhigh school, said: Ofcourse, the educational differences between husband and wife create lots oftrouble and the wife 201always has totake care that her husband's pride isnot hurt. Myhusband only finished elementary school. He feels bad when Iknow something hedoes not know. Then Ipretend that Iaminsensitive and donot notice that Ihave hurt his feelings. Iamvery hyundaisik (modern), soIthink that wife and husband are equal. However, myhusband isquite traditional and thinks the wife should besubordinate toher husband. Thus, ifI say something hedoes not understand, orifIteach him the meaning ofEnglish vocabulary words shown on television, hehates it, saying \"oh, you are alearned person. All right, soyou are saying that you are better than Iam, etc.\" However, myhusband likes showing off toother people that his wife has learned much, even though hehas not. These women whose educational level ishigher than that oftheir husbands said that they were careful not tohurt the husbands' pride. However, they knew how their education worked to affect their relationship with their husbands. In this context, female workers' higher education affected traditional gender relations. The conflicts and new construction ofgender politics inworking-class families began tobeseen. Whereas awoman's education --which represented a woman's individual resource independent from her family role --created some tension with her husband, having ajob 202outside the home created asimilar pattern ofstrife with respect to aworking-class family's gender politics. Women said that they were very careful about the way they presented their jobs because men thought women became independent and assertive when they were making money. Women's social capital, such aseducation oranoccupation was not expected tobeset towork independently, but was supposed tobedomesticated and gendered ascultural capital for the family, Or, itwas asupplementary income source for the household. Many women believed that intheir hearts their husbands liked their wives' economic activity because itwas asource ofsupplementary income for family, but in order todemonstrate the authority ofthe household head and topractice their power tocontrol their wives, the husbands opposed their wives' employment. Many wives took their husbands' resentment seriously and convinced them toallow them towork byexplaining their plan for the family economy. Onthe other hand, these women understood their husbands' resentment aspolitical and rhetorical actions, aspects ofgender politics. Atthe same time, Sungsuk's mother and Haesoon's mother tosome degree manifested their expectation that their husbands would deploy \"modern masculinity,\" which, these women thought, came from institutional education. Women also regarded men's education aseconomic capital aswell as cultural capital. Youngsoo's mother said, 203Men should have higher educational levels inorder to take care oftheir family. Idonot mean only by getting good jobs tomake aliving but totake care of family members in acultivated way. Myhusband only finished elementary school. Idid not learn much either. Ifinished middle school because myfamily was poor and myschooling ability was not good enough togo tohigh school. Iamdisgusted at myhusband's use of abusive language and other behavior, such asbeating me and the children, which, Ithink, reflects his background ofnolearning. How can Iand mychildren respect this kind ofman? Many women inthis working-class district represented their present low-class position asbeing critically related totheir lack ofeducation, which inturn was the material result oftheir poor family background. Korean society had traditionally recognized scholarship and education asthe means for social mobility. Institutionalized formal education had been one ofthe most critical forms ofcapital since the beginning ofthe modernization effort, sometimes education had been the sole means for social mobility. In addition, itwas said that Korean economic growth had been made possible byKorean people's zeal for higher education. Within this social and cultural environment, inwhich education was considered tobethe only channel for providing all the information and knowledge that would make 204the \"modern\" desirable, the poorly educated working-class woman became frustrated inthe course ofattempting to manage and practice competent femininity, particularly motherhood. D.Donggo (co-habituation): Donggo as amarriage strategy for working-class Imentioned inthe previous chapters, the marriage ceremony istaken more seriously than legal registration of marriage inestablishing marital relations inKorea. Marriage sometimes simply means amarriage rite, through which aman and awoman are transformed into social adults. Wedding rites are regarded asthe transformative mechanism through which men and women achieve not only the status of adulthood but more fundamentally the character ofsocially and morally integrated beings (Kendall 1993 :unpublished manuscript). Unmarried men and women, onthe other hand, are treated associally immature and irresponsible. For unmarried female workers, marriage was the most critical concern. However, their social and economic condition forced them toenter marriage differently than the social norms ordain. Young female workers who were dislocated from their own natal family life and their communities began married life without family recognition and ceremonies. Therefore, the construction oftheir way ofachieving social adulthood and engaging inin-law family relations was different from the patterns described for middle-class women inchapter 2. 205Young female migrants were perplexed bythe hard, long labor they endured inurban factories, but atthe same time they enjoyed their own independence and the fact that they were making money bythemselves. The social and economic conditions ofworking and living infactories, separate from their families and their own community, gave the migrant women afeeling ofliberation from traditional norms and from the web ofobligatory family relations for unmarried women inrural areas. Myinformants inYaksan had lived infactory dormitories atfirst. Inspite ofthe tough work conditions, they met friends oftheir age and shared their frustrations with women who came from similar backgrounds. Gradually they became absorbed inthe urban consumer culture through the purchase ofcosmetics and accessories and through going topubs, cafes, and discotheques, and dating men. Some women had sent their money totheir parents inthe rural area but most ofmyinformants spent their income on living expenses and saved some oftheir income for their future marriage. Ofeighteen women who mentioned the way in which their income was spent, eight women had helped their families financially bysending home some oftheir income, paying for the living expenses ofbrothers orsisters who were students, orgiving all their income toparents when they lived intheparent's home except for some oftheir pocket money. Ten women had spent their income onbuying 206clothes and keeping uptheir appearances, saving little for the future. The most critical concerns for the young factory women were their appearance, dating, men, and marriage. Ingeneral, women considered their factory work a transient stage tomarriage. Young women workers were willing totolerate low wages and poor working conditions because they anticipated spending only ashort time inthe factory before getting married. They would then leave the labor force. They expected that their marriage would improve their lives and took itfor granted that they would be supported bytheir husbands. Thus, dating and marriage were the two most important topics that young women workers discussed among themselves. One labor organizer said that this expectation ofmarriage inhibited women workers' involvement inlabor unions and inother collective strategies toimprove their working and living conditions. Very few women workers expected towork after they got married. Inthe same context, one ex-labor activist said, \"Many unmarried women workers have fantasies about marriage. Aworker whom Imet recently wants tobe apiano teacher at home as apart-time jobafter marriage while taking care of housework and kids. Therefore, she isnow taking piano lessons torealize her dream.\" This activist said that the mass media gave many female workers false consciousness. She concluded that itwas animpossible reality for female workers toachieve inthe recent Korean context. However, 207marriage, whether rosy orplain, was anticipated astherite ofpassage byfactory female workers. Most ofthe working mothers left their work intheir early and mid twenties.\" Most ofmyinformants left factories when they met their future husbands and particularly when they became pregnant. Inmany cases, the female workers who began todate became pregnant easily because they generally did not have any knowledge about contraception orthe physiology ofwomen's bodies. Their best sources for information were their male partners or friends, whose knowledge and information usually were as poor asthe women's. All myinformants said that they did not know how tomake love and how toprevent pregnancies. Most oftheir discourses onsexual experience conveyed the idea that they were not sexually active anditwas the men who had wanted sex. They solicited myagreement about the idea that men were biologically different from women: men had excessive, uncontrollable lust and were sexually aggressive. Many women projected animage ofthemselves as victims who had given inorwere willing togive their bodies tomen; therefore, the men had tohave responsibility for pregnancies. Most ofthem added that they had never *Female factory workers areexpected toleave factories when they are Mira asecretary for anorganization offemale workers, wanted tofind afactory job but she had been rejected from all thefactories towhich she applied. Management was suspicious ofher because she was atwenty-eight year old unmarried woman and wanted todofactory work, supposing that she is aprofessional labor activist. 208heard sexuality: Once ayear Education\" class was offered inthe factory where Iworked. Awoman from the YMCA came and lectured onsex and pregnancy. The main theme ofher talk was :\"do not trust men, and donot sleep with them nomatter what they tell you.\" She did not mention birth control orcontraception methods. She did not consider thepossibility that women workers would be sexually active and preached that they should wait until they were married tohave sexual experiences. Another sex education program was offered atthe Catholic Women's center. But the program also stressed that women should abstain from sex until after marriage. Culturally, unmarried women were supposed tobeasexual and virginal; thus, there were noformal channels for unmarried women toobtain knowledge and information about contraception. Most ofthem did not realize their pregnancies until they were inthe fourth orfifth month. After they found out about their pregnancies, many couples decided toengage indonggo (living together), ortohave an abortion. Abortion was the main contraceptive method for unmarried female workers. 209Theliteral meaning ofdonggo isliving together without having awedding ritual orregistering the marriage. InKorea where social recognition ismore important than two people's institutional union inmarriage, donggo usually connotes sexual engagement without social legitimacy, implying immoral orlicentious relations between men and women. However, many working-class women inthe Yaksan area said, \"donggo isnot ofmarriage. For us,itisthe same asmarriage because wewill have the marriage ceremony with our children's fathers some day, anyhow.\" Myworking-class mothers started their donggo atanearlier age than the average honki (marriageable age) inKorea because they started their social life intheir mid- orlate teens. Many women said that they understood their colleague's engagement indonggo even though some women worried that donggo did not guarantee men's fidelity and responsibility. Ingeneral, donggo was accepted asakind ofmarriage inwhich the marriage ceremony was delayed because offinancial reasons. Once acouple entered into donggo, awoman usually began to manage their whole income and the housekeeping. Indonggo, the same institutionalized sexual division oflabor was practiced asinmarriage. Out offorty informants, twenty four women mentioned that they started their marriage in donggo. Their ages when beginning donggo with their present husbands is shown inTable 4.3. 210Table 4.3. Working-class women's age atdonggo |age 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 total L\u00bauise:2 7 2 1 1. 1 14 When myinformants recalled their time ofdonggo, they said that emotion combined with social and economic reasons made them want tolive together. However, inreality pregnancy was the most critical and important stimulus for formalizing their relations into amarriage. Here, I introduce several women's descriptions oftheir entry into donggo and their understanding ofdonggo intheir lives. Sungsuk's mother (age: 28, husband's age :31, with two daughters and one son) When Imet myhusband, Iwas working for two years in the production section ofapharmaceutical company. I was proud ofbeing employed inthat company night work orovertime work, a400% bonus, lots ofleisure time, good meals, special food for Christmas and bok (dog day: thehottest summer day), agroup birthday party, and nowork onnational days. Ihad seen myhusband in aCatholic prayer house. Hewas a welder. One day wetook the same bus. Hewas sleeping, leaning against me. Ishould have gotten offfirst, but Icould not have helped awakening him. Hewoke upat 211his stop and suggested Igotohis place. Ithought he Frankly, Iliked him because heseemed to beserious andintelligent. Iaccompanied him. His house was in aremote area ofthe Pupyung city (the city next toNamyang) but Idid not realize hewas living alone in arented room until Igot there. We were sitting inhis room without saying anything until 10 PMwhile hewas drinking liquor. Iwas waiting for him tospeak but hedid not say anything. Finally I asked him where Icould catch abus, and hesaid, \"no bus service inthe morning. However, weended upsleeping together because heforced meto make love tohim. Idid not say anything tohim the next morning and Icame home. Iwas alittle shocked by the fact that Ihad with aman and Ihad lost my virginity. Iwas twenty-two years old Idid not tomake love. Ibegan toworry about getting pregnant soIbought acontraceptive pill from the drug store and took ittomenstruate. Ihad heard about this from one of myhigh school friends who was engaging indonggo with aman. She said that she took contraceptive pills toresume menstruation when she became pregnant. Itwas quite well known tousthat sometimes contraceptive pills can work toabort the 212conception ifthey are taken right after pregnancy. When Icame back home, Idecided not tothink about itany more. Ithought Icould marry another man even though Ihad slept with this man. Even atthat time [1985], itwas not abig deal unless others knew it. Three days later hecalled meand left amessage to come over Iwould gobut Iloved toleave my family. Next day, wewent tomyfather and told him we would live together. Myfather was furious and said to menot tocome home any more. Isaid tomyfather that Iwould never come back home. Iwas very depressed in my home because Ihad totake care oflots ofhousework since mymother was avendor and there were many younger brothers and sisters inmyfamily. Idid not expect tolive with him forever but Iwished toget out of mynatal family. Idid not have any preparation for living with aman. Ibought contraceptive pills from a drug store and took them everyday for thefirst two months. However, the side effects were terrible; Ifelt fatigue, sickness, loss ofappetite, and nausea. I stopped taking pills and two months later Igot pregnant. Then, Iquit the factory. Idid not want but Iamnot sure even today. Myhusband seemed to have the same idea. After Igave birth tothefirst daughter, myhusband once told okay. heneither menor He added that hehad decided tolive with mebecause of his guilty feeling that hehad touched mybody (ko'nturida). Iwas surprised athearing this, but I said tohim that itwas all right because Ihad the same idea about him. But Iwas hurt and felt resentful. Still, Ithink that Ihad the wrong idea that hewas in love with me. Itwas regrettable but what else could I doexcept stay with him. Idid not have any place to go. Ten months after giving birth tothefirst daughter, wehad awedding ceremony. Idonot think anything inour relationship has changed after the ceremony. Youngsoo's mother (age: 24, husband's age: 30, with one son and one daughter) Icame toSeoul atthe age of 17and worked for two years inagarment factory. When Iwas 18, Imet my husband, who was awelder worker, bychance in abeer pub. Iwas with myfemale friends and hewas with his friends and wejoined each other. After that meeting, I began todate him and hegave mesome pocket-money for 214clothes and snacks every month when hegot his monthly salary. Ithought itwas natural that anolder man should give some money toayounger woman. Even though Idid not have any friends who received pocket-money from their boy friends, Ithought itwas natural. Ihad heard that men were dangerous and women had tobe careful, etc. However, Idid not feel danger from him because hewas much older than Iwas, soIthought he was safe. Icalled him \"oppa (older brother)\", Igave birth Henever calls me\"Youngsoo's asother hewanted ustosleep together, living factory dormitory. Ihad ofpregnancy had noinformation about contraception. Later, Iwas simply curious astowhy I did not get pregnant when Irealized that one of my friends, who had met another guy atthat pub, had gotten pregnant and had had anabortion. Finally, one \"This term isused between relations. Itusually shows avery clear powerrelationship between the addressor and the addressed. Many men in many occasions use this term when they address women, includingtheir wives, daughters orother women younger than themselves. 215year later, Igot pregnant and Iwas afraid totell him about it. Thus, Imet his friend and told him that I had gotten pregnant. When myhusband found out about my pregnancy, hefirst told metohave anabortion heshould beresponsible for pregnancy. Finally, hetold metomove into his place and toquit the factory. Webegan todonggo not only because ofthe pregnancy but also because Iliked him and Iwas tired ofworking in afactory. Wehave not had the wedding ceremony until now. For me, living together isthe same asgetting married.\" Eunyoung's mother (age: 32, husband's age with one son and one daughter) Icame toSeoul atthe age of 18and had worked ina garment factory atfirst. After one and ahalf years, I *Youngsoo's father's story Idid not have any plan tolive with Youngsoo's mother. Ithought I,asaman, could sleep around with many women. Even atthat time Iwas involved with another woman and Youngsoo's mother was very young and cried when she became pregnant. Iconsoled her andtried toconvince her toget anabortion but she refused and told methat she would give birth even though Idid not care for her. What could Ido? Aman, anyhow, should beresponsible forhis seeds, soItold her wecould live together. Ihad never thought about marriage in respect to acertain woman. All men should get married some day. The wife will be awoman who takes care ofmyhome and mychildren. She was very quiet and submissive when she was young but after donggo she turned out tobestubborn and tocontrol meinher own way. This isthe reason Isometimes treat her in abad way to change her way oftreating me. 216quit that job because working at asewing machine hurt myback and hip. And then, Ientered aglass factory where myfuture husband was working. Ihad known him for three years as afriend. Wewent tonightclubs, Western-style restaurants, and pubs with other friends. time hewas living in adormitory and Iwas living inaroom rented monthly. Hewas about tostart military service but hewas not sent toaregular military camp; instead, his duty was working ina district office only inthe daytime. Therefore, heleft the factory dormitory but hedid not have any place to stay atnight and hedid not have any savings. Itold him hecould come over to myplace. Iwas alittle worried about howitwould look inother's eyes, but I did not think much about pregnancy orsex-related problems. However, Igot pregnant very soon after our donggo, and Ihiditfrom the company and friends. The first time, Idid not know that Iwas pregnant but I felt strange when Idid not have myperiod. Right after myfriends sensed mypregnancy, Iquit the factory lest the rumor should spread. Ithought donggo was immoral and felt ashamed. Myhusband liked mypregnancy but we could not have awedding ceremony atthat time because his older brother inthe home village was single. We waited for our turn, but for many reasons wehave not been able tohave our ceremony performed. Webehaved as 217if wehad had the wedding ceremony. When Idecided engage indonggo with myhusband, itwas amarriage to Myhusband same factory, which manufactured audio facilities. Itwas anewly built, small factory that employed about 100 workers. Iwas living inthe dormitory, located inthe basement ofthe factory. There, male and female sections were separated but wecould see each other onthe stairway. Assoon as so naive atthat time, and Idid additional projects which were not related tomyreal job. Iwas sotired that I quit the factory and found anew job inanother factory. Myhusband and Islept together after seeing each other for two months and began todonggo when I was nineteen. Myhusband and Idid not have any money and rented avery cheap room in avillage next to Namyang city. There, weonly slept and ate our meals in our factories. Soon, Igot pregnant. All myknowledge about pregnancy and women's physiology was that awoman might get pregnant when aman and awoman slept together. Idid not have any idea about contraception and Idid not know any methods ofcontraception. Iwas 218already fourth month ofthe pregnancy. Wewere very poor and Iwas afraid that myparents would be upset about our donggo. Thus, wedecided toget an abortion. After the abortion, myhusband began touse condoms which one of mysenior-colleague workers recommended for meas agood contraceptive method. However, Igot pregnant again and quit the factory when Iwas inthefifth month, because the factory employed only unmarried women. Idid not tell anyone that Iwas living with aman, soIwas uncomfortable when mybelly began getting bigger. For me, itwas much better living together rather than living as asingle. Idid not care about how others saw our donggo. Idid not think that the wedding ceremony was asimportant asmany other women thought. However, Iwished towear the wedding veil sometime in the future when wecould afford the wedding ceremony. I had heard from old people that awoman's soul after death would bewandering unless she wore the wedding veil once inher life. Idonot think donggo isa marriage. with meand hewas avery good person. That wasall. However, living together with a child, whether the couple has gone through the wedding ceremony ornot, isthe same asmarriage. When wethrew Atthat meeting, myfather-in-law proposed tomyoldest brother who was the head of mynatal family that wehave a wedding ceremony. Myfather-in-law immediately fixed the wedding date and notified uswithout any discussion with us. Mybrother, since hewas the person who was responsible for thebride's family, felt his pride had been wounded but hecould not say anything. My husband's family did not offer support for our wedding atall, sowehad tospend all our savings forit. My brother, who was aspoor aswewere, spent ayear of his farming income: approximately one million won ($ 1,500) tosend some wedding gifts tomyhusband's parents. Mybrother, asthe head of myfamily, could not avoid his duty inorder tosave face for to atme. Myhusband Iwere very at my husband's family and Ihave not visited myin-law family except once since mymarriage. Whether the women had wedding ceremonies ornot, these women's donggo worked out asequivalent toamarriage, particulary after the couples had children. Many couples married legally byputting the women's names intheir husbands' family registration when they registered thebirth 220oftheir children. Sometimes (as with Youngmee's father, who secretly registered his marriage bycounterfeiting Youngmee mother's seal without her permission) husbands registered the marriage when they thought their marriage certificate was needed for such eventualities asmedical insurance. Many women were happy when they donggoed with their boy friends. However, asEunyoung's mother and Juntae's mother mentioned, the most difficult thing during their donggo was that they could not inform their families and friends of their donggo. The marriage ceremony was atransformative rite toinform other people oftheir changed status without personal explanations. However, for donggo couples who have that kind ofsocial mechanism available, the only channel for informing other people oftheir married status was a bodily expression: specifically pregnancy and the pregnancy's product --children. The families ofmany women were upset orembarrassed about their daughters' donggo with men without amarriage ceremony even though these families were not able toconduct the ceremony for the daughters. The families' embarrassment and worries focused upon whether other families knew about their daughters' donggo ornot. That was the reason that Juntae's mother's family could not resist the proposal from the husband's family tohave a wedding ceremony performed, despite their financial difficulties. They thought their daughter had already conducted herself in away that was socially incorrect, so 221they had toshow their sincerity and support when the husband's family wanted tocorrect the improper behavior. The family ofsome women opposed the donggo union even after their daughters had gotten pregnant. Youngmee's mother's natal mother was very upset about her daughter's donggo with apoor man. The natal mother came over toher house and urged her tohave anabortion and toreturn home. However, Youngmee's mother thought that she had already given her body toher husband and had gotten pregnant; therefore, she had tolive with him. The natal mother accepted this marriage after they had the wedding ceremony. Many women, who were engaged indonggo, wished tohave awedding ceremony which would socialize and institutionalize their union even though they had already married legally and had children. Some women actually saw the donggo asnot socially legitimate ormorally correct even though myinformants said that they did not feel any difference between their donggo union and aceremonial marriage. Therefore, when the child was more than five-year old orso, some couples gave uphaving aceremony because they thought itwas too late. These couples told other people that they had gotten married for convenience; then, other people understood that they had gone through ceremonial marriage. Some Yaksan women expressed worry and doubt about the danger ofdonggo, believing that the men might change their minds and might leave without taking any 222responsibility for the women ifthey did not have wedding ceremonies. However, atthe same time, more people agreed that donggo was all right because they could not afford the marriage ceremony and their decision tolive together totally depended onthe discretion oftwo people. In Juntae's mother's story, the couple were mad atthe husband's father because they thought their wedding had nothing todowith the father; the whole expense ofthe ceremony had been covered bythe couple. However, the father brought upthe idea ofthe traditional marriage ceremony to the woman's family. Juntae's mother thought that the proposal could beignored but her natal family tried tosave face inorder tosecure their daughter's position inthein law family. That this couple had not visited the husband's family for four years since the event showed that the family inYaksan was quite independent from family networks compared with the middle-class families. Compared with middle-class women, comments about in-law families were not mentioned frequently. Actually when many women were thinking about leaving their factory work, which they had considered transitional, they were willingly engaged into donggo as away of retrieving agency; through donggo women constructed their lives asindependent from their natal families, achieving the status ofsocial adults. 223E.The experience ofwomanhood and motherhood: Pregnancyand childbirth\" (1) Dating and pregnancies After middle-class women had marked their entry into marriage through wedding ceremonies, their pregnancies were socially expected and awaited even though many women were personally not ready tobecome pregnant. Incontrast, many working-class women's pregnancies did not occur within the social relations ofwomen's changed status; that is, through marriage. However, the working-class mothers understood getting pregnant as asocial act, ashift insocial relations ofthe women while dating and donggo were personal decisions. Through pregnancy, therefore, the women's gender position changed. When Iasked Yaksan mothers their ideas about virginity, they teased mebysaying \"who cared about virginity nowadays?\" Some women commented that itwas impossible tobe avirgin before marriage these days. One working-class husband joked that hewas sure that nowadays Korean virgins could only befound among girls under age five. More than half of myYaksan informants said that they had had sexual experiences before they met their husbands even though some husbands never believed that their wives *Inthis section, Idescribe theclass-related aspects of reproductive care that could befound among working-class women; I have already dealt with women's experience with the cultural and medical practices ofreproduction inchapter 4. 224had had love affairs except with them. Myinformants' dating period was notparticularly long before they had sexual relations with their future husbands. Women usually thought that men were bynature sexually more active and had a stronger sexual instinct than women while women had afear about it. Many women did not clearly distinguished dating and mating intheir mind. When women dated men, they assumed, even vaguely orunconsciously, that there was a possibility ofsleeping together because men's sexual instinct and aggression were part ofmen's nature. Meejin's mother said, \"Idecided toengage indonggo with myhusband because Iadmired his capacity for control, which was beyond anything that could befound inanaverage man. Hedid not force love for two weeks after Ileft afactory dormitory. Ihave never told this story toother people because weknew that nobody would believe mystory.\" Women mentioned men's biology rather than love or emotion when they explained their early experience of sexuality during dating. Therefore, the women situated their position indonggo and pregnancy without amarriage ceremony within the context ofthe tension between men's instinctual sexual aggression and women's sexual naivete. Inaddition, combining with the popular folklore ofthe lack ofvirginity among young factory women, they presented themselves as 225victimized bymen. However, their narratives of victimization did not have anundertone ofresentments or oppression but was full ofrationalizations for their past and present situations. Their stories and rationales retrieved working-class women's agency amidst contravening cultural discourses about \"proper\" unmarried women and the socially correct way ofengaging with men through ceremonies and familial arrangements. Many women vaguely worried about pregnancies when they dated; most ofthem said that they did not know exactly how toget pregnant. Many Yaksan mothers said that they did not know that contraceptives were available indrug stores. Although some women had information about contraception, the young factory women were afraid ofusing contraceptives because they might beconsidered sexually-experienced women ifthey worried about contraception. Sometimes the women heard incomplete orwrong information about contraception. Youngmee's mother, for example, had heard about the IUD from her friends inafactory but she did not have any idea what itlooked like, how toget itorhow touseit. Actually, women did not have anidea ofhow touse contraceptives because they did not separate sexuality from reproduction. Youngsoo's mother said that she did not worry about pregnancy but she began toworry about herinfertility after she had been seeing her future husband for one year. (Note that her donggo story was introduced earlier inthis 226section). She said, Inever thought about pregnancy and contraception. I slept over at myfuture husband's place three orfour times amonth for more than ayear. One day, after I heard of myfriend's pregnancy and abortion, Iworried about myself --whether Iwas pregnant, butinfertility seemed tobe amore serious problem than getting pregnant for women. Youngsoo's mother did not know about the physiology of women's bodies but her idea was that itwas acommitted relationship ifawoman and aman began tosleep together. Therefore, pregnancy was also included inthat relationship. Among earlier donggo stories, Juntae's mother mentioned that donggo was not amarriage until the woman got pregnant. This might have been true for some female factory workers but in reality most ofthe women engaged indonggo became pregnant. These factory women did not separate sexuality from reproduction since the general discourse ofKorean culture did not distinguish sexuality and reproduction. Unmarried women, asIargued with respect tomiddle class women inchapter 4,were the an\"innocent and asexual proper maiden.\" Hyunsuk's mother said that people did not think that unmarried women could have sexual feelings; women's sexuality emerged after marriage orafter giving birth toat least one baby. Haesoon's mother, who had asexual 227experience before she met her future husband, said that people assumed that unmarried women who had sexual relations were abnormal because they knew too much about \"that kind of stuff\" (sexuality). Therefore, these women had an unidentifiable and complex fear about pregnancy after they had had sex with men. What they could dowas use contraception after sexual relation. One female pharmacist (who had worked in afactory zone before she had abusiness inthe inner city ofNamyang) said that most ofher clients inthat factory zone were teenage female workers who came to buy tongkyo\" ngche (drugs tomake the uterus contract: akind ofabortifacient) toavoid pregnancy after they had had sex. Inthis context, women did not find out about their pregnancies until they sensed bodily changes, such as regular morning sickness ornausea. Hyunsuk's mother did not realize she was pregnant until her future husbands' friends told him that she seemed tobepregnant, which they concluded when they noted her craving for sour foods like lemon. Many women knew that menstruation stopped when women got pregnant but they rarely noticed the cessation of menstruation as asign oftheir pregnancy because many factory girls suffered from menstrual irregularity. In addition, they were not meticulous about keeping trace of the date oftheir menstrual period. Thus, when women realized they were pregnant, they were usually inthe fourth orthefifth month. Meejin's mother said, 228Thefirst time Iwas pregnant, Idid not realize it until Imiscarried and blood gushed out from my\"lower part. \"Iwas taken toahospital and adoctor told me that Ihad miscarried. Even for the second pregnancy I did not sense ituntil myneighbor woman recommended that Isee an OB &GYN problem tobleed [which is afolk treatment for che] . (2) Pregnancy and prenatal care Asthe donggo stories showed, pregnancy pushed the woman tothe turning point insituating her inrelation to her partner. Many women were surprised and felt embarrassed and ashamed when they found out about their pregnancies. Hyunsuk's mother said that she could not imagine that such a short contact could impregnate her. However, their pregnancies did not create conflicts orraise such questions aswhether they should stay atthe factory orlive with their future husbands, even though some stayed atthe factory for awhile inorder tosave money for donggo. Most *Che isakind doctors treat people's complaints ofche aspoor digestion orstomach upset, but Korean people believe that che isadisease entity. There are some che specialists who are called \"aperson who isdropping che.\" Chinese medicine also deals with this symptom as adisease category. 229women had chosen the relationship with their future husbands insofar asthe men accepted that the pregnancies were their responsibility. Atthat point, they began tolive together and entered into akind ofmarried state. The pregnancy was thought tohappen towomen's bodies but to result from the men's deed; therefore, the men had tobe responsible forit. Meejin's mother said, \"When Irealized I was pregnant, Idid not think itwas agood time but my future husband seemed tobehappy, maybe because hecame to besure that Ibelonged tohim.\" The fact that women became pregnant changed the nature of aman and awoman's relationship. Jina's mother described itmore not have any idea ofmarrying myhusband. Heloved me very much, but Irejected hedecided to \"have\" mebyforcing metomake love tohim. Even not mytype, heforced metomake love tohim because physiologically men are stronger than women with respect tosexual instincts. SoIbecame pregnant and decided tostay with him.\" Usually pregnant women continued towork until their pregnancies were visible toother people. Thus, the women quit factory work intheir fourth orfifth month totake care oftheir pregnant bodies. With respect tothe direct reason for leaving work, some women said that they quit the job because they had lower-back pain, fatigue and aheavy feeling inthe body. However, some women said that they were 230afraid ofhaving their pregnancy became apparent toother workers. Many women mentioned inparticular the feeling of nausea oractual vomiting asthe main reason for quitting the job. Women's vomiting isthe cultural language of pregnancy inKorean culture. Instead ofmentioning pregnancy directly, the cultural media such asmovies and television dramas used awoman's vomiting tosignify sexual relations, which inturn implied pregnancies. Juntae's mother quit her factory job inher fifth month ofher second pregnancy [the first pregnancy had been aborted] because she was afraid that her growing belly was apparent. She was working ina factory inwhich only unmarried women were employed. Sometimes, future husbands themselves did not allow the women towork outside the home right after beginning donggo orfinding out about apregnancy.\" Myworking-class informants did not have regular prenatal care asoften asmany of mymiddle-class informants did. Most ofthem visited OB &GYN clinics two times during the pregnancy; once for confirmation ofthe pregnancy atthe first stage, and the other for acheck-up ofthe fetus's *Some men think that wives should beat home. Even after marriage, their wives working outside hurts their pride. Youngmee's mother said that her husband had strong pride, sohemade her quit her job when they decided todonggo. Youngmee's father had strong ideas about sexual division oflabor; therefore, holding and carrying babies was not men's work. When they went out tovisitrelatives orfriends, hewas but hegave her the baby before houses. Very rarely heprepared his meals; usually hedid not eat unless his wife prepared meals for him. 231position and tolearn the due date forchildbirth. The pregnancy test was thefirst experience ofvisiting OB &GYN clinics for most ofthe women, except for some women who earlier had had abortions. Kiyoung's mother wondered why pregnant women needed tovisit clinics often when pregnancy was natural for all women. She said that two times should be enough, adding that frequent visits were not good for the fetus. She visited aclinic for thefirst time toget an injection ofRinger solution (in Korea all IVs are referred toasRinger) and said, \"My morning sickness was sosevere that Icould not eat meals for two months. Inorder tobe injected with atonic Ringer (IV), the nurse wanted meto have apregnancy test but Irefused, saying that Iknow Iam pregnant. IfIhad taken atest, theclinic would have charged forit.\" Some exceptional cases, such asMinkee's mother, visited an OB &GYN clinic several times during pregnancy. Minkee's mother had finally become pregnant after eagerly awaiting the baby during aseven-year donggo. Therefore, she was worried about whether ornot the pregnancy was in trouble. Inorder togive birth safely toanormal baby, she used all the services that the clinic recommended, including ultrasound and fetus monitoring. Most ofthe working-class women obtained information about the care oftheir reproductive bodies from neighbors, friends and relatives, through word ofmouth. Juntae's 232mother visited an OB &GYN clinic twice during her pregnancy like most other women did. She said that she did not like going toan OB &GYN clinic; itmade her feel uncomfortable and timid. Therefore, she did notvisit the clinic until the last month because she did not experience anyparticular problems during pregnancy. During the last month, she visited amidwifery clinic because neighbors told her that the midwifery clinic was the same as adoctor's clinic and the midwife was known around Yaksan as akind, caring unmarried woman inher early forties. Because many women did notvisit OB &GYN clinics regularly, they did not say much about the doctors's gender even though they tried first tofind female doctors. Juntae's mother said that she wanted afemale doctor but she did not know how tofind one, soshe just saw afemale name on aclinic sign and entered. The name turned out tobelong toamale doctor, but she did not experience any difficulties. Minkee's mother preferred amale doctor toa female doctor because male doctors seemed toher tobemore trustworthy and competent inmedical knowledge. She said that female doctors did not pay much attention inreading the results oflab tests and ultrasound. Her mother-in-law told her not togotofemale doctors, worrying how female doctors, who had long red manicured nails, did internal examinations and delivered ababy. Many women thought that female doctors did not act inaprofessional way toward 233patients, because they paid more attention totheir own private lives and totrivial feminine things because they also had totake care oftheir families too. Atthe same time attesting totheir feelings, however, many women liked Dr. Yang's medical care, saying that she was sensitive and careful not tohurt women's feelings because she was a married woman and had been through two childbirths. Inunderstanding and perceiving theposition offemale professionals, women appropriated female professionals' medical expertise within their own experiential boundaries. As Idescribed the middle-class women's discourse of homogenizing and universalizing all women's experiences in respect towomen's marriage and motherhood inchapter 2,the women's lives. However, the working-class women's totalizing discourse ofall women as a category was relatively weak because their class position kept them at asocial and cultural distance from women in other classes, compared tothe middle-class women whose class position was often the standpoint ofall other groups inthe society. (3) Childbirth Many women visited the clinic tofind out the date of childbirth intheir last month ofpregnancy, and all the women gave birth totheir children inmedical institutions. 234Only two women, Minkee's mother and anursery teacher, gave birth in ahospital inwhich Dr. Yang worked asan OB &GYN specialist. The hospital was built for apoor neighborhood near Namyang bysome physicians who were social activists. Five women gave birth totheir last children in amidwifery clinic; and others delivered children inlocal private OB & GYN clinics close tothe Yaksan area. Some women went to rural areas for childbirth, returning towhere their natal parents were living. Ingeneral, working-class women's experience ofmedical doctors and medical institutions were similar tothe middle class women's encounters which Idescribed inchapter 3. However, because ofworking-class women's limited access to medical resources and their lack ofprevious experience with the use ofmodern medical institutions, they were more psychologically and culturally disengaged from modern medical institutions than middle-class women; thus, their experience offeeling embarrassed and humiliated inbig hospitals was accentuated. Both Haesoon's mother and Hyunsuk's mother left the hospitals, claiming that they would beback soon, because they were scared ofand uncomfortable with medical practitioners' treatment ofthem. Hyunsuk's mother said, Idid not have soIwanted good care atchildbirth. Iwent tothe inan ward when Iheard 235women's screams and moans. Icould hear and dimly see other women because the room was divided into two parts by aglass screen; one was for women inchildbirth and the other part for women inlabor. Adoctor who seemed tobe aresident rubbed mybelly with some kind of jelly and connected metoamachine with two needles, which drew black lines onpaper. One line was straight and the other one was zigzag. Hospital staff walked back and forth and when they saw myrecord, they said toeach other that itwas strange. They whispered and left. Iasked one ofthe staff what the problem was. They said, \"Nothing.\" Ifelt very bad. The doctor asked me tohave another test but Itold him that Iwould come back the next day. Hesaid tomethat labor would come within 24hours. But Iinsisted that Iwould be back later. Idid not goback tothe doctor. Instead, myolder sister took metoanold midwife near my sister's house. The midwife told methat itwould take ten days more for childbirth. Ten days later, Iwent to the midwife. She told meto come back in aweek. I began toworry and Iwent tothe hospital again. The doctor, who recognized me, was mad atmeand asked why Ihad disappeared, telling methat Ihad better goto another clinic ifIdid not trust them. Idid not say anything and Iwaited myturn for diagnosis. Atthat time Iheard that women's pubic would beshaved at 236delivery. Iwas shocked and scared. Ileft the hospital and went tothe midwife. [Several days later, she gave birth toadaughter inthe clinic. I Haesoon's mother visited ageneral hospital inNamyang tofind out the date ofdelivery. But she did not have labor onthe date that the doctor told her tocome tothe hospital for childbirth. She came tothe hospital one week after the appointed date. The doctor was mad ather, asking why she did not appear onthe date that hehad told her tocome. She said: Itold the doctor that Ihad not been inlabor, soI waited for labor. The doctor told methat Ineeded an induced delivery, soIshould have come back with my stuff for hospitalization. Iasked him what the induced delivery meant. Heyelled at methat hedid not have time tochat with meand told metodoitquickly ifI cared about the baby. Ileft the hospital and stopped by aclinic near myarea and Itook all the tests that Ihad already taken inthat hospital. The doctor inthe local clinic told metowait for two days and tocome back again. Iwent home and jumped upand down in my room tohasten the procedure. The water bag broke the next morning. Ihad heard from many women that the water bag had before Iwent totheclinic 237for thedelivery.\" doctor appeared at10:30. Hesaid that all the water had come out, sothat Imight have ac section. Icould not think about anything because the pain was sosevere. However, when Iheard the the cost of ac-section. [Finally she had anormal delivery. ] As apatient, the woman had already cooperated with the hegemony ofmedicine inhospital settings. Inaddition, the working-class women had already been dis-empowered bythe modern institution ofmedical knowledge because oftheir class position before they went tothe hospitals. For the women, thehospital represented the embodiment ofmodernity through its power oftechnological andscientific knowledge, which they lacked. Inthis context, doctors showed irritation and impatience atthe women's questions, misunderstandings and silent disobedience. The women did not understand what was going oninside their bodies because doctors did not explain ittothem. Doctors forced women to obey their orders without any resistance, threatening to *Few middle-class women whose water bags were broken were nervous and rushed into hospitals, but most of myworking-class informants' water bags were broken before they went toclinics forchildbirth. Some of myworking-class women did not even realizethat their water bags were broken when they found awatery andsticky discharge because they could not sense the pain ofthelabor. 238mobilize cultural and medical powers against them. The doctors' condemnations ofthe women included: \"unless you trust baby's safety\" or \"ifyou donot like what Iamdoing you can leave this hospital. And Idonot mind that your baby's life isin danger.\" Or\"what you are doing now will kill your baby.\" These doctors' statements drew onthe cultural discourse of correct maternal conduct, implying that good mothers should begood patients. Women felt that they had todepend on medical doctors for childbirth but atthe same time they thought that the doctors created fears that were unbearable. Therefore, they wanted toavoid the hospital situation or tried tofind alternative medical resources that were more inkeeping with their psychological, cultural and economic situation. Several women went to amidwifery clinic for childbirth even though they had notvisited theclinic previously. Juntae's mother delivered her son atamidwifery clinic near her house inYaksan. Juntae's mother said: One myneighbors told methat amidwife, was very good inchildbirth, and she took care ofdelivered women who have just delivered and newborn babies for one week through home-visits. She gave the women the same medical services astheprivate OB &GYN clinics did. Inaddition, the medical fee was much cheaper. My due date was delayed, soshe gave metwo injections to 23.9promote thebirth tonic. midwifery clinic for anight and two days. Amidwife, Ms. Park, emphasized that she was providing the same services that the pregnant women received in OB & GYN clinics. Both Ms. Park and her patients understood that this midwifery clinic was asubstitute for OB &GYN clinics but Ms. Park provided more personal, intensive care to individual women. Ms. Park was critical ofthe fact that the women tried tocompare her services with medical doctors's services with respect tothe medical technology that she used. Most ofthe Yaksan women's information about childbirth came byword ofmouth and this information contested Western medicine, folk medicine, and Chinese medicine, but their reference ofdesirable and correct medical practices focused onhigh technology-oriented hospital medicine. Therefore, many women located Ms. Park's medical service within this referential context; many women asked Ms. Park why she did not have anultrasound machine in her clinic. The women wanted to know whether ornot their fetuses were \"deformed, \"bywhich the women meant physically crippled asmass media reported that the ultrasound could tell the deformity offetuses. Ms. Park said that people did not understand the boundaries of amidwife's services. Ms. Park complained that the midwifery job was difficult because she had to 240demonstrate how good and useful her services were towomen patients, along with invisible, unspoken competition from OB &GYN doctors who did not give recognition tomidwife's clinical independence. OB &GYNs basically did not care about the midwifery business because the number ofmidwives was small and mainly composed ofolder women intheir late fifties andsixties. Not many young midwife/nurses opened their clinics as afull-time job. The young midwife/nurses usually worked inbig hospitals. The women who gave birth inmidwifery clinics had received recommendation from neighbors who had delivered their babies there. Some women went tothe midwifery clinic toask about their fears, such as adelayed due date or needing tohave ac-section. Inhospital settings, doctors wanted women tobehospitalized toinduce labor when the due date had been past for more than aweek. But midwives usually told women towait for the labor. Therefore, some women, like Hyunsuk's mother, were confused and went back and forth from the hospital tothe midwifery clinic. Anold midwife said that the hospitals and media created many fears and worries for women and therefore women did not take pregnancies asnormal bodily processes. The women became nervous when labor did not come onthe due date but the midwife said that she simply told them towait. Some doctors commented that insome cases waiting might beall right but midwives had tobesupervised by OB &GYNspecialists. More 241women came tothe midwife toask whether ornot they could have normal deliveries through the vagina after they had heard from doctors that they needed tohave c-sections. Several women inthe Yaksan district who had doctors' recommendations ofc-sections came tothe midwife and tried tohave vaginal deliveries. Meesuk's mother wanted tohave a vaginal delivery even though the doctor had told her that she had tohave ac-section. Finally, she had the c-section after she had lost alot ofblood. When Meesuk's mother gave birth toher daughter byc-section, her mother-in-law got mad ather, saying how could she have spent somuch money that her son had earned with his hard labor. Haesoon's mother, too, had worried about the cost of ac-section during her labor. Inwha 'smother said that mothers-in-law hated their daughters-in-law's c-sections the baby agirl, the mother-in-law's mistreatment ofher daughter-in-law became harsher. Amidwife, Ms. Park, tried tohelp women have normal deliveries when women came toher with worries about the doctors' recommendations of ac-section. She said that in many cases normal deliveries would not beproblematic. Many working-class women were overwhelmed bymedical doctors in hospitals, but atthe same time many women stated that they did not trust medical doctors; they said that they did not know the doctors' expertise but they felt that the doctors did not always pick uptheir problems correctly. Therefore, 242many women wanted toreceive asecond check-up from the midwife who, they felt, was neither institutional nor professional but more personal. However, the midwife criticized women themselves for their non-disciplined and ignorant way oftaking care oftheir pregnant bodies. She said: Pregnant women and their husbands treated their pregnancies asdiseases; most ofthem did not do exercise. And some women lay down for almost ten months toprotect their babies inside their bodies, sometimes after they had quit their jobs. The women think that pregnancy isnatural because all women become pregnant and become mothers. However, many women think that pregnancy isvery special for them and different from anordinary state and many husbands experience their wives' pregnancy inthat way, too. Many women said that the best time for them --when their husbands had been nice and caring --was the period oftheir pregnancies. Therefore, babies grow bigger and women have ahard time having anormal delivery. The midwife actually presented low technology-oriented birth with the emphasis onthe women's control and discipline about their own pregnant bodies; she emphasized the modern agency ofwomen prior todepending on institutional expertise. However, the women usually had two extreme ideas about pregnancy; pregnancy was anatural 243process sothat babies would come out incourse oftime, but atthe same time more dependence onmedical technology would bebetter and safer towomen's bodies. One natal mother asked for Ms. Park togive her daughter aquickening injection for the promotion ofbirth, showing her doubt about why the mid-wife let her daughter suffer from the terrible pain ofnatural labor. Many women complained that Ms. Park injected some women with atonic Ringer but they were not injected with atonic after childbirth. Because of women's demands, therefore, Ms. Park was using the quickening injection frequently and giving the injection of tonic Ringer toall women after childbirth inher clinic. Another reason why many women came toMs. Park's clinic derived from women's social condition; that is, the women did not have anyone who could provide post-delivery care for them. The women inYaksan said that they chose MsLee's clinic for delivery because she visited thepatients for one week for post-delivery care. She bathed the newborn babies and examined women's vaginas and treated the swollen part. Inmany cases, husbands helped their wives after childbirth but they had togotowork and the wives felt sorry for their husbands when they saw they were doing housework. Therefore, some women were sent totheir natal families to give birth to achild. Youngsoo's father sent his wife to her natal family inthe rural area for child delivery for one month while hestayed inNamyang. 244Not only Ms. Park but other midwives aswell asked husbands tocome inand help with their wives' childbirth. When Hyunsuk's mother gave birth to adaughter, her natal mother and her husband attended. When she screamed loudly, her mother was embarrassed infront ofher son-in-law and told her tolower her voice, commenting that she was not the only one who was giving birth; all women had gone through the same process. She kicked her mother and her husband slapped her face sothat she would not clench her teeth. Because the midwife had told him to dothat sothat she would not hurt her teeth. Some women said that they felt ashamed when they were with their husbands even though they felt safe with natal mothers ormothers-in-law. Midwives told methat they tried tolet husbands know about women's pain and hard labor. However, many husbands would not come inand insome cases women did not want their husbands to attend childbirth. One woman said that she hated exposing her emotions toother people soshe decided not toscream in front ofher mother-in-law and her husband. However, she screamed and moaned and felt more relaxed personally even though shefelt ashamed whenever she recalled the scene of her childbirth. Some husbands, who had astrong idea that pregnancy and childbirth were women's business, felt shy to accompany their wives for childbirth. Minkee's mother took a neighbor-friend toattend her childbirth. She said that her husband felt shy about attending the childbirth and was 245drunk and sleeping athome while she gave birth to ason. Her neighbor-friend called her husband totell him that he had ason. Hewas very pleased itwas ason and said that he knew itwould be ason although there was not abig fuss at son-birth asthe middle-class women's families showed. Son-preference, however, was not asconspicuously practiced among the working-class women. One woman in Yaksan, who eventually gave birth toason, wanted toknow her baby's sex when she took anultrasound examination before childbirth. Adoctor refused totell her the baby's sex, soshe asked tosee the record ofthe ultrasound; then, the doctor asked her how she could read itifhegave itto her. She thought that the ultrasound picture just showed the baby's gochu ingraphic way because many women mentioned that the ultrasound could identify ababy's sex. Like many middle-class women, working-class women also cried when they gave birth todaughters. When Hyunsuk's mother gave birth toadaughter, Hyunsook, the midwife and her natal mother showed great disappointments. The child grandmother commented toher newborn granddaughter, \"Oh, poor thing !Why did you leave your gochu (pepper: penis) in your mom's womb?\" The mother that itwas good tohave adaughter asthefirst child because she could help with her mother's housework. Hyunsuk's mother cried because she felt sorry for her daughter, who would eventually have togothrough the pain 246ofchildbirth. Inwha 'smother, who was alabor activist before marriage, said that she was exhausted right after delivery but she wanted tosee whether ornot the baby had agochu. When she could not find itshe was sodisappointed. However, these two mothers did not want tohave anadditional child because they thought they could not afford tohave more than one child. Youngmee's mother, who had two children, said that she would not have had the second baby ifshe had had a boy asthefirst child. The working-class mothers also had a strong emotional and cultural orientation ofson preference but many couples said that they did not have the financial and social capacity tohave anadditional child. Many couples's desire tolimit oreconomize the family size and their weak interactions families seemed inthe working-class (see chapter 5for information). Many women expected severe pain atchildbirth because asthey approached their last month ofpregnancy, everybody mentioned pain inchildbirth. Juntae's mother said that she expected horrible pain because many women had told her how terrible the pain was. When the pain came, she thought it might not bethe same pain that other women mentioned, expecting that there might be aworse one. Hyunsuk's mother was also terrified bythe expectation ofpain. She said: 247Ihad heard many times about the pain inchildbirth. My midwife told mewhen Imoaned; \"You did not expect this pain when you made love and had pleasure. This pain is owing tothat pleasure. The world isequal. Ifwomen had this amount ofpain from diseases, they would kill themselves.\" Ithought this saying had some truth. If wehad had fun, weshould pay foritwith pain. When Iasked Hyunsuk's mother how men paid for that pleasure, she said that they made money tosupport the family. Amidwife, Ms. Park, commented that the less love women had for babies, the more pain they had inchildbirth. Many women had vivid memories oftheir birthing experiences which constituted their way ofconstructing their gender inKorean culture. Idescribed inchapter 4how doctors inhospitals practice male-gendered powers over women through the medical profession, mobilizing the cultural practices ofdifferences between men and women and inscribing their gender position asreproductive beings. On the other hand, the \"morales\" ofmidwives, who were all women and their jobitself professionally female-gendered (versus male-gendered medicine) legitimized the sameness of becoming women asmothers, focusing onuniversal female experiences ofchildbirth derived from the essential differences between men and women. Amidst cultural comments about women's birthing and their bodily pain and women's bodily fact ofchildbirth, the women inchildbirth 248constructed and understood the truth ofsocial relations of the female gender; that is, becoming mothers meant realizing and experiencing women's biological and anatomical truth; this process was also understood assinful, painful and a source ofpride, which constituted their agency inKorean culture. 249Chapter 5.Contraception: The Rationalization ofthe Modern Family and the Quality Control ofMotherhood Class differences inthe nineteen century were important inbirth control, but they should not blind ustothe basic similarity inwomen's experience. ...[And] what evidence there isofthe subjective experience ofwomen intheir birth-control attempts also suggests that the desire for spaced motherhood and smaller families existed inevery class. .. . . . .[The] individual theory and ofbirth control stems from abiological female condition that ismore basic even than class. (Linda Gordon 1977 :70) Social reality islived social relations, our most important political construction, aworld-changingfiction. The international women's movements have constructed \"women's experience,\" aswell asuncovered and discovered this crucial collective object. The experience is afiction and fact ofthe most crucial,political kind. (Donna Haraway 1985 [1991: 149]. A Manifesto Cyborgs) Women's reproductive practices have always been socially and culturally constituted. Thus, women's bodies have not been controlled bywomen themselves; rather the meanings oftheir bodies have been historical andpolitical contexts (Gordon 1977, MacKinnon 1987; Pechesky 1990). However, asthe feminist literature and ethnographies show, women have always wanted control over their reproduction and have demonstrated this desire by mobilizing available methods intheir societies (Gordon 1977:26 -46; Devereux point ofview, women's efforts tocontrol and transcend the reproductive process that imprisons women within their biological functions (Gordon 1977:46) has 250always been a\"women's liberation\" issue. Inthis chapter, I explore the gender relations that affect Korean women's contraceptive practices. During myfieldwork in1990, these practices were strongly shaped bythestate's policy of family planning, although Korean women might not have been aware ofits influence. Idiscuss the meaning ofthe way in which Korean women understood their contraceptive practices within the contexts ofthe state, family, and women's reproduction and sexuality. Incontrast toWestern societies inwhich birth control has been part ofanagenda ofthe social movement toachieve women's reproductive rights and individual freedoms, Korean society had never developed a political orsocial discourse with respect tocontrol over women's reproduction until the government implemented a family planning policy for population control in1962. Even with the advent ofthis policy, Korean women were not the subject oftheir reproductive control. Instead, women's bodies were treated asanintegral part ofthe national population and the family. The control over Korean women's reproduction was inscribed asanobject and aninstrumental variable for the welfare and development ofKorean population aswell as of afamily bylimiting the family size. For the last three decades, birth control has not been discursively differentiated in afeminist sense from population control (family planning) inKorea. Gordon uses the term assubject actors tocontrol their biological anatomy and tocreate the conditions oftheir lives insuch away as tosave their own interests (Gordon 1977: xiv). Onthe other hand, population control isaimed atcontrolling women's reproduction based onthe Neo-Malthusian assumption that overpopulation poverty (Gordon 1977 :76).\" toWestern feminist's understanding ofthe birth control movement women's reproductive rights orthe freedom bestowed upon awoman's individual body has been the result ofwomen's political efforts, Korean women's demographic choice --ofhaving few children --has nothing todowith the social discourses concerning reproductive freedom and reproductive control over women's own bodies. Rather, itisthe effect ofthe state politics ofbio-power which has placed women's sexual and reproductive conduct within the purview ofnational policy and power practices. The population policy has *Gordon differentiated the concepts ofbirth control, population control and contraception asfollows: \"Birth control means any kind ofaction taken toprevent having Children, including not only abortion and infanticide but alsoperiodic oreven sustained sexual abstinence beused torefer footnote*) . . . .politically, population Control has almost nothing incommon with birth control. The former applies norms ofideal family size without respect for cultural, Social, orpolitical self-determination. The latter has been precisely acampaign forself-determination. thelast few decades \"population synonymous (Gordon xiv-xv, footnote:-) .\" 252provided contraceptive information and services aswomen's reproductive capability was incorporated into national bio politics which aimed ataproject ofmodernization and economic development. Atthe same time, theeffect ofthe bio-politics has constructed a\"modern\" way ofgender relations for Korean women with respect toreproduction and sexuality, bypenetrating themedico-political discourse of reproductive control into everyday life practices and by eroding orreinforcing existing social relations ofgender. Ilook at Korean women's family planning practices within the standpoint ofbirth control that Gordon advocates. The state's discourse about family planning has reoriented Korean women's reproductive practices for the last three decades. Inorder todiscuss the way inwhich Korean women have accepted thestate's campaign of contraceptive practices and the way inwhich women construct their agency sothat they transcend their biological condition, Idiscursively address inthis chapter three dimensions ofwomen's bodies (cf. Scheper-Hughes and Lock: 1987) that are affected bythe family planning program: Korean women as asocial body whose fertility istreated as acritical variable for user asanindividual, experiential woman's body; politics that emerge 253from gender relations. Inthefirst section, Idiscuss the political technology ofshaping women's \"modernized\" bodies with contraception and the construction ofpeople's desire tohave fewer children. Inthe second section, Idescribe thebirth control experience ofmiddle-class women and working-class women during myfieldwork period from 1989 to 1990 and its implication for women's lives. A.The State Control onWomen's Fertility and the Political Discourse ofModernity (1) Population decrease and the \"modern\" reproductive norm Since the 1960s Korea had been well-known ashaving one ofthe most effective population control programs inthe World. The population control program known asthe family planning policy isconsidered tohave played animportant role inlowering the nation's population growth rate during thelast three decades. During this period from 1960 to 1989, the population growth rate declined drastically from 3.0 percent per annum to1.0 percent, and the total fertility rate declined from 6.0 per woman to1.6 during the period of1960 through 1987 asTable 5.1. shows (KIPH 1989). Table 5.1. Changes inFertility rate, 1960-1987 \\ 1960 1971 1974 1976 1982 1984 1987 | TFR 6.0 4.7 3.6 3.2 2.7 2.1 1.6 | (Source TKIHSATISSIO II) Ingeneral, atwo- child family has come tobeseen as normal and is, infact, the average norm for married couples 254inrecent Korean society. Inastatistical sense, itistrue that over 90percent in1988 were afirst or second birth (KIHSA 1990:16). Nowadays, when Korean women are asked \"How many children doyou have?\", women who have more than two children hesitate toanswer immediately. Instead ofgiving adirect answer, they say, \"I amstill primitive, orold-fashioned\". Women who have three ormore children are considered not tohave taken care oftheir reproduction orare assumed tohave tomore ason.\" Thus, people show asort of compassion orsurprise toward women who are taking care of three ormore children, although they donot regard them as pre-modern orignorant offuture planning. Rather, women comment, \"How are they able toraise those children inthe world oftoday?\" The underlying message ofthis comment concerns theparent's economic and social burden intaking care ofthese children and their education expenses. Under socio-economic and ideological imperatives inindustrialized urban settings, having one ortwo children for amarried couple isgetting tobeestablished as ageneral reproductive norm in\"modern\" Korea. *Recently some magazines and newspapers dealt witharticles about akind offad inwhich women intheir late among upper-middle classes inSeoul gave birth totheir third child. Here, the issue was that these women inupper middle class were economically comfortable and found fresh pleasure inmothering. 255(2) Economic development and family planning policy The family planning (FP) program was thefirst social andpolitical discourse concerning reproductive control over women's bodies inKorea. The introduction of\"modern\" contraception for the control ofwomen's fertility inKorea was initiated and encouraged bythe government asan integral part ofeconomic development plans in1962. The term \"modern\" which appeared inthe government FPliterature meant contraception, tothe pill, IUD orsterilization (Bang 1964; Yang etal. 1966). At the same time, \"modern\" methods delivered the image of contraceptives that were related toscientific and medical technology. Before the intervention bythe government, there had been some sporadic campaigns ofbirth control by missionaries, the Korean mothers' organization and Christian social service centers but there were nowide campaigns nor was birth control practiced (Bang 1986: 497). The introduction of FPpolicy toKorea was related to international concerns about overpopulation and poverty in the Third World. After World War IImany international organizations recommended population control programs for reducing thebirth rate inunderdeveloped countries as a tool ineconomic development; birth control was also recommended for poor people within the developed capitalist countries asaweapon against poverty (Gordon 1977: 392). These efforts reflected agrowing concern, based onneo 256Malthusian assumptions that overpopulation caused poverty; the concern was that population control could prevent poverty. The Korean government accepted population control asaneconomic strategy in1962 when itlaunched an ambitious five-year-plan ofeconomic development with the expectation ofachieving anannual growth rate of7.1%, in contrast tothe average Korean annual economic growth rate during 1954-1960 ofabout 4.6%.\". Advised byinternational development agencies and economists who regarded population growth inthe less industrialized world as aserious threat 1977) *,Korean economic planners thought that about a3%population increase rate would be amajor handicap inattaining the goal ofeconomic achievement. According toone baseline study conducted in1962, anaverage family size was 6.7 children inWondang township and 7.4 inKimpo township. The ideal number ofKorea: Monthly Statistical Review, 16:25, April 1962, P.19and Korean Journal ofthe Korean National Commission for UNESCO, 3:16, 1963 *Population control organizations and the nation-state's policy ofpopulation are more concerned with limiting the size of Third World populations than with assisting women bymeeting theirindividual fertility needs (Hartmann 1987). Inthe same context,Judith Justice mentioned that the information used inhealth planning represents the value ofthe foreign planners rather than the Culture ofthe local recipients. Therefore, theclient ofthe donor agencies isactually the bureaucracy, not the women (orvillagers) whom programs aredirected (Justice 1986: 152). InKorea,itwas the state who was aclient ofinternational populationOrganizations and combined with local Western medical 3sons and 1to and 11.7% inKimpo (Bang 1963). Itwas the Korean women's fertility that was considered a hinderance innational development and taken as a controllable variable for the national project of modernization. Thus, the national project ofimplementing population policy that favored the economic plan was concerned with how tocontrol women's fertility and terminate women's reproductive function after having a \"proper\" number ofchildren. [Inorder tounderstand the international support ofpopulation control, see Table 5.3] . The family planning policy for the control over women's fertility was undertaken as anational policy inFebruary 1962, and the government began establishing 189 family planning clinics, each having two full-time family planning workers (nurses and midwives) inhealth centers inrural and urban areas (Bang 1988: 502). Asthe government chose health centers asthe means ofcontrolling the population, the entire activity ofpublic health provision inthe local health center was organized toexecute family planning work. The state has implemented strong ideological campaigns and provided free contraceptive services for women. The visible side ofthis policy has been the provision of contraceptive services through assigning FPhealth workers toevery health center and mobilizing private OB &GYN 258clinicians toinsert IUDs and provide sterilization for women who took FPcoupons from health centers. These clinicians were reimbursed for their services later from the government. However, discursive campaigns forestablishing a small-family ideology were deployed through all kinds of informational channels. The bio-politics offertility control claimed that having many children impeded improving thequality ofpeople's lives inafamily aswell asinthe nation. The ideological imperative the image and desire of asmall-family asthe \"modern,\" \"happy,\" new life style inanindustrializing society. Inthefirst stages during the 1960s, when the nation's fertility was quite high, the policy focused onthe creation of adesire for asmall family, which was associated with the image of a\"happy and wealthy\" family, --animage brought about by\"modern\" contraceptives. Inthe '60s, the government began tosupply the \"effective, modern\" contraceptive devices (particularly IUDs) nation-wide. The slogans and catchy-phrase were widely distributed and attached tothe wall inpublic places everywhere tomotivate and educate people about thebenefits ofasmall family. The most popular slogans were: \"Give birth tofewer children and bring them upwell\"; \"Make our family wealthy bypracticing family planning\"; \"Do not suffer from many births but bring upfew children\"; \"Giving birth tochildren without planning brings you poverty forever\"; \"Let's have three children with 259three-year-intervals, and stop pregnancies bythe age of 35 years \";\"Well brought-up, few children, good for parents and good for children. Inthese catchy-phrases ofthe 1960s, the number of children was directly transformed into aneconomic cost, advancing the proposition that having children should be accompanied by asense ofparental responsibility for their nurture and education. That was aquite different idea about children from the traditional Korean concept inwhich all children were born with their own bread and having many children meant good fortune and prosperity for afamily. In FPdiscourses, children become consumers offamily wealth and dependents upon parents. Therefore, not having children is amatter ofplanning and rational decision-making for both parents and children. This was the way inwhich women's practices ofcontraception interconnected with and were submerged into afamily and national body inthe 1960s and inthe early 1970s. Since the mid-1970s, family planning policy was more institutionally and socially highlighted asthe national economic development plan was spread nation wide and forcefully executed. As aconsequence, the FPpolicy was also carried out in amore aggressive and coercive way so that women would use \"effective\" contraceptives; the government began tointroduce various social support measures (incentives and disincentive policies for family 260planning users). For example, since 1976, income tax exemptions have been available for those with uptotwo children. Those who undergo sterilization after having one ortwo children have priority inthe allotment ofpublic housing and inapplying for newly built apartments, and various loans. Benefits offree medical services are available only for two children per family; monetary incentives are given tolow-income FPacceptors (KIHSA 1990: 12). The government loosened legal sanctions abortion and provided anabortion service (so-called government established asubsidiary provision ofthe Mother and Child Health Law by which awoman gets anabortion when the pregnancy creates medical, psychological and social problems for the woman, although abortion has been constitutionally illegal since 1953. Inaddition, toachieve the planned goal ofhigh FP acceptance rate, strong administrative interventions were carried out. The overall implementation ofthe FPpolicy was overseen bythe Ministry ofHealth and Social Affairs, but its implementation was deeply integrated into the work of the whole Ministry ofDomestic Affairs atthe local level. Therefore, the government mobilized the whole public health system aswell asthe domestic affairs administrative system tomeet the predetermined target oflowering thebirth rate. 261The government also organized mothers' clubs inevery village for monitoring and checking women's contraceptive practices (cf: Justice 1983). People got the impression that the public health service inthe national modernization program was almost equivalent toFPservices. [To understand the status ofthe family planning program innational health and its budget, see Table 5.2.and 5.3. ] Table 5.2.Total National Budget, National Health and Family Planning Budgets ofRepublic ofKorea, 1962-1981 year planning budget tohealth budget (re-quoted from Bang 1988: 505). Table 5.3. The percentage offoreign sources oftotal FPexpenditures |year 1962 1967 1971 1976 1979 1982 1983 | |x of * ||2..5 11.4 40.5 24.8 10.3 6.3 3.3 | (*:foreign source/domestic source aspercentage oftotal family planning expenditure. quoted from Bang 1988: 506) Especially inrural areas where the modernization project called the \"New Village Movement\" was strongly and aggressively conducted inthe 1970s, the issue of controlling women's reproduction was atthe core ofpublic 262health activity forvillagers and one ofthe major jobs for the local administration, requiring comprehensive political and social concern. During this period, people identified the government's health sub-centers orhealth centers with FPpromotion agencies. Ifhealth workers showed upintheir villages, people thought that they came torecruit more cases for sterilization. Inaddition, the ideological campaign was strengthened byincluding population education inprimary, middle, and high school textbooks. The government also put population education and family planning into the governmental and vocational training centers and other civil institutions. Above all, mass communication networks and mass media have played animportant role indisseminating a\"modern\" and \"economical\" image for small families byputting two children-families forall couples into all kinds ofserial drama productions. Special programs are also made for the heightening awareness ofthe population explosion, etc. These kinds ofcultural and ideological deployments were done atthe government's request but atthe same time all media organizations inthe 1970s compulsorily participated inthestate policy. This campaign ofestablishing asmall family ideology, furthermore, encircled people's everyday lives with the family planning catchy-phrases put onstamps, cigarette packs, theater tickets, bankbooks, housing lottery tickets, etc. Slogans were placed onpublic transportation, 263such asbuses, subways, and taxis, and \"population towers\" were established, allowing people towatch the number of people increase day byday. Through these mechanisms, the ideology ofthe small family became established and has been shaped asanappropriate and modern family form. The catchy-phrases inthe 1970s directly mentioned stopping women's fertility after two children. The emphasis ofthe FPmethod also switched, implementing permanent contraception: sterilization.* The slogans asfollows; \"stop is ason \"afamily planning program started one-day earlier, stability; \"one isworth The way ofexecuting FPpolicy was directly connected tothe way political power was practiced in1970s.\" Korean *Thegovernment introduced the IUD(Lippe's Loop) inmid-1964. Bang said inhis article that the first generation offamily planning advocates inKorea (including him and his colleagues) hadcarried out some projects toincrease the retention rate ofIUDs because women frequently removed the IUD. FPadvocates who were male medical doctors never explored the women's complaints from the women's side; rather, their concern was toadvocate theefficacy ofthis method. astory that heobtained from awoman during hisfieldtrip; awoman told him that she would never remove the IUD because retaining itwas better than having anabortionafter removing it. Bang used this story topoint out the efficacy ofthe IUD inspite ofwomen's discomfort. Hedid notattend tothe women's discomfort but used this story many times todemonstratethe efficacy ofthe IUD. All the literature related to FPdealt with contraceptive methods from the efficacy point of view. Therefore, the government shifted the focal policy from IUD tooralpills andsterilization inthe early 1970s because thelatter was more effective and had less side-effects than the IUD; thepill wasincluded in1968 and thesterilization (tubectomy) was included in 1974 inthe family planning program. 264society. The military autocratic regime undertook the modernization programs forcapitalist development without permitting any dissent. Therefore, atthe local level, the practice offamily planning policy was executed coercively, using atop-down approach, asinother development programs. Atthefirst stage ofthe policy, Confucian ideology with its taboo onany discussion ofwomen's reproduction and sexuality and its idea ofhappiness being associated with many children served toresist the implementation ofthe family planning policy (Lee, M.K.35). Some ofthe older generation, who thought one son was not enough for the succession oftheir family, resisted because they had experienced many infant deaths and accidents intheir life time. However, these complaints were not strong enough to prevent their daughters-in-law from accepting birth control; the society and economy was changing and the rate ofchild survival had drastically increased. The older generation's wish for many children did not attain legitimacy against the newly-emerging young couples' wish for a\"rationalized and modern\" small family supported bythe state. The female health workers who were the state agents for FPpromotion contacted daughters-in-law directly and persuaded the women touse contraception. Young married women's interest in having small families and the health workers' job offinding assigned numbers ofcontraceptive cases were easily meshed. From the 1980s onward, the FPcampaign changed to 265emphasize the benefits women would enjoy byterminating their reproductive function early, asthe government began toadvocate thestate's role ofproviding for people's welfare. Atthe same time, FPpolicy became mainly concerned with sterilization. The slogans changed todisplaying the benefits ofone-child families. From 1984, publicized slogans included: \"Even two are too many\"; \"Have lots of happiness and love with one child\"; \"Family planning brings you ahappier family\"; \"Ahealthier happier babies short-cut tofamily planning with sterilization and vasectomy.\" The one-child family inthe 1980s was represented ashaving associated with happiness, love, health and youth. The main technology for realizing this imagined happy family was sterilization. Family planning discourse inthe mid-1980s no longer emphasized its economic rationality oflimiting a family size asithad during the 1960s. Rather, inthe early 1980s, itkeyed itself tomass consumerism. Political discourse reflected the advent ofthe welfare state and the social outcome ofeconomic growth. InFPdiscourse through the 1960s tothe mid-1980s, it was the family whose reproduction orfertility was controlled. Women's reproductive bodies inthe medico political discourse of FPwere located within their family ofprocreation. Therefore, itwas manifested that decisions for family, but not the decision for women themselves 266controlled women's reproduction. The locus of awoman's control over her reproductive function was inmarriage which bestowed upon her the role ofchildbearer, childrearer and family manager. Family planning was aprogram only for women who had their own family ofprocreation. The contraception infamily planning was not women's practices ofseparating reproduction from sexuality, but thereproductive practices for controlling the quality oftheir role performances for family inmodernizing society. Korean women, whose bodies became anintegrated part of the family after marriage welcomed the family planning methods which afforded them control over their reproductive capability. Women always felt the economic and maternal burden ofraising children. When Idid myfieldwork inrural Korea in1984, many old women spoke oftheir sufferings as they endured successive pregnancies andchild-births. They considered this pain the consequence ofbeing born women. For them, they said, successive pregnancies and the suffering they entered provided theclearest evidence that men and women were different and explained why men had easier lives than women from the beginning. The government FPservices were particulary helpful for women inlow-income groups and rural areas, who did not have thefinancial means orsufficient information toobtain contraception. Even in urban areas asIdescribe following sections, working-class mothers depended primarily onpublic health 267centers for contraceptive services. The early success ofKorean FPpolicy was heavily reliant upon the provision ofcontraceptive services, which were arranged through thestate's administrative power and practiced bymedical doctors, rather than being dependent on the empowerment ofwomen tocontrol their bodies by themselves (see Table 5.4. ).Inthis sense, Idescribed Korean FPas amedico-political program. However, the critical factor ofthe FPsuccess derived from the socio economic changes brought about byrapid Korean industrialization and urbanization inthe 1970s and the 1980s along with strongly penetrative ideological and cultural discourses onthe \"rational and modern\" family, which were manufactured bythestate and byinstitutions of modernization. Control over women's reproductive bodies was executed as apolitical program ofmodernization; the method was toutilize married women's reproduction as asocial indicator that measured development. Therefore, FPpolicy focused oneffectively lowering women's reproductivity, neglecting the health implications ofcontraceptive methods and the liberation aspects offreeing women from the biological conditions oftheir pregnancies and the social conditions ofmotherhood that women experienced. 268Table 5.4.

Itisnot alanguage for men orunmarried women but rather avocabulary for all married couples. However, it should benoted that indealing with contraception, there are many contradictory assumptions and cultural practices that influence female and male reproduction and sexuality. Inthis section, Idescribe middle-class women's way of practicing contraception and discuss the meaning ofthese practices asthey exert control over women's bodies. Three of mymiddle-class informants said that they had sexual relations with their future husbands before marriage, but only one woman used acontraceptive: nowon, foam tablet, which had been the most-widely advertised commercial contraceptive inwomen's magazines and weekly popular 269magazines during the 1980s inKorea. Nowon, thepill and the condom were the only available contraceptives inKorean drug stores. The other two women depended onthe rhythm method, but all three women failed and became pregnant before they had wedding ceremonies. They said that they did not discuss contraception with their future husbands although they were worried about getting pregnant. The only alternative that they knew was anabortion. Unmarried women's abortion rate isactually high inKorea.\" the middle-class and working class stated that contraception for them mainly meant the termination ofanother childbirth. Kim Youngmee said that it was sonatural for married women toget pregnant that women usually gave birth totwo children without thinking about contraception. But after two, they wanted tocontrol their reproduction because they did not want another child. Nam Jungsoon also said that she had never thought contraception about until she gave birth totwo children. Most ofthe women said that they hated abig family with many siblings and did not want tolive like their mothers, whose lives had *One government health research institute conducted asurvey about abortions which were provided inall the OB &GYNclinics andhospitals in amedium-size city for five months from June to October 1990 and found that one third ofall the abortions during that period were done for unmarried women (KIHSA 1990: 45). 270been burdened with childbearing and childrearing. Their mothers had not had time for themselves orfor giving their children adequate care. Almost all ofmyinformants began toconsider contraception seriously after giving birth tothe desired number ofchildren, and/or after having anabortion. Some women used contraception orgot abortions tocontrol the interval between childbirth but for most ofthe women, contraception was mainly amethod for stopping additional childbirth. Therefore, the piim became acritical issue for married women mostly after they had the desired number of children intheir late twenties. AsTable 3.1.showed in chapter 3,oftwenty four middle-class women, seven women had one child; fifteen women had two children; one woman had three children and one woman had four children. Among these women, with the exception ofonly two women who were considering having one more child, all the other women decided tostop their reproductive function. Indeciding the desired number ofchildren, women mentioned that two factors were critical; one had to dowith the recent social trend ofhaving one ortwo children; another had todowith their economic capacity toeducate and bring upchildren. Hyun Sunghee said, Nowadays, having two children iscompletely established as common sense for married couples. Ifeel pity for women who have more than two children. Now, not only I 271but also other people immediately associate afamily with four members: two parents and two children. Tomany women, afamily meant four people. Even women who had more than two children had the same picture of afamily inrecent urban Korea. This image of afamily with four people was widely portrayed inadvertizing pictures and television dramas, inwhich abeautiful young couple and two children (usually one daughter and one son) were in acar, at adining table orin aliving room in amodern Western style apartment. This image powerfully penetrated into women's everyday life, shaping adiscourse inwhich the small-size family was associated with happiness inamodern, affluent environment where the family was independent from all the traditional social relations ofthe extend family; the image of a\"modern\" nuclear family which was sanitized from the cultural burden ofold Korean traditions. This is the image that the government has propagated for three decades inthe context ofthe national modernization project. Actually, for most orall of mymiddle-class informants, these images materialized within the living space ofanapartment that had adinning table with four chairs; aliving room; two rooms for children and one room for parents. Besides their economic capacity for two children, some women said that they gave birth totwo children because the first child needed aplaymate and only siblings would be a 272trustworthy friend inthe future. Many people believed that only the familial tie could ensure trust and support. In that sense, having many siblings was good for achild but a family with more than two children placed too much ofan economic burden onparents. Many women mentioned and were aware ofthe influence of social pressures from the trend toward smaller families but they denied the influence ontheir contraceptive decisions. Park Moonwhan said, Ilike children soIwanted tohave many children, but wecould not economically afford them. Myhusband and I decided tohave two children because atthat time in the early 80s, most people had two children. Having only two children was akind ofsocial norm although we were not directly forced tofollow it. Most ofmymiddle-class informants knew about the government family planning policy as aprogram tolower population increases; they also heard about many incentive programs for the FPacceptors. However, they said that they had never cared about the incentives. Through many channels the discourse about the world population explosion, the population density ofthe Korean peninsula, and the housing and population problems inSeoul's metropolitan area had shaped women's idea that having few children was common sense and asocial norm. Many women did not say clearly what they thought thesocially andpolitically correct 273reproductive practices were but they were aware ofthe social pressures that pushed families into having fewer children. Some women who had four children described themselves asselfish and socially irresponsible. Most of all the middle-class women mentioned the social forces that compelled them tolimit the number ofchildren, but they controlled their reproduction for their own interests. Here, thepolitical discipline that affected women's reproductive practices merged into the people's need forrationalizing their family planning decision. Without feeling resistance, people did have small families asifitwere anorm or natural for acouple. Inthis context, many women commented that ifsomeone had theability tonurture many children well, they could have many children; that was not the state's business but had todowith someone's personal need and their responsibility. Atthe same time, there were many one-child families among middle-class couples. KaYunhee, who had only one son, said, Icame from afamily with eight children. Having many children --even thinking about them --makes mesick. Myhusband also hated people who had many children without bringing them upwell. Hedespised people who had sexual relations without thinking about the responsibility ofchildbearing. From the beginning we decided tohave one child regardless ofthe sex ofthe 274child. Incontrast to KaYunhee's narrative, almost all one child families had sons. However, one interesting finding in myfieldwork was that insix cases out ofseven one-child couples, itwas the husband who wanted tohave only one child. Thus, four husbands got avasectomy tostop having more children even without discussing itwith their wives, although the wives had heard many times that the husband wanted tohave only one child. These men had avasectomy when they went todrill inthe reserve army; anincentive was offered that exempted them from ten days ofdrill in that year. This drill, which iscompulsory for Korean men under thirty-four years old, isonly the channel through which men are socially and formally encouraged tohave a vasectomy and informed about its simplicity ofoperation, harmlessness onmen's bodies and effectiveness for contraception. Many men did have avasectomy through this channel. The wives actually regretted their husbands' vasectomies. Some women got pregnant against their husbands' wish of having achild. Lee Sunja said, After wehad thefirst baby, myhusband did not mention having another baby. Heactually wanted tohave only one child because hehated his big family with many siblings. But Ithought amarried couple should have at least two children. The economic factor isvery 275important indeciding the number ofchildren but I think wecan take care ofand educate two children. Song Meeja, whose husband did not want tohave another child, gave birth tothe second child. She thought that her husband needed afeeling that hewas incharge of afamily, and having another child might begood for him, giving him more responsibility for the family. Inaddition, another child would be aplaymate toher son. After giving birth to her second child, she thought she was right. Housewives show some uncertainty with regard tohaving one child but having few children iswidely accepted. The issue ishow todoitand who istoberesponsible for the contraception. Table 5.5.

However, many women had used several methods such asrhythm, IUDs, foam tablets, condoms and abortions. Idescribe the way inwhich the women 276practiced and understood their birth control methods as follows: Table 5.6. Contraceptive practices for middle-class couples method\\ no. of women no. and sex ofchildren sterilization 8 ss, sci, sci, ds, ds, dd, dd, dds vasectomy 8 s, s, s, s, ss, sci, ds, sd loop (IUD) 3 s, d,ddds oral pill foam tablet condom 3 ss, sci\", ss rhythm 2 sd, d withdrawal (s:son, d:daughter *:The husband was considering having a vasectomy.) The rhythm method and condoms Many women had tried the rhythm method and condoms for contraception, but unsuccessfully. Many women who depended onthese methods had anabortion toget rid ofanunwanted pregnancy. The couples who were using rhythm and condoms considered these contraceptives tobetransitional methods; some couples were thinking about vasectomy orsterilization but could not decide. Lee Kisuk, who had two sons said, Myhusband and Icould not decide whether tohave a daughter ortostop our reproduction. Wewould love to have adaughter but wecannot afford another child financially. Inaddition, Iamgetting old physically. 277Iamthirty-three years old. Idonot want tobe because Ihate artificial interventions in mybody and Iamafraid ofside-effects caused by sterilization such asgaining weight and losing strength. Ihave heard somany stories about sterilized women's suffering and discomfort. Myhusband isalso sceptical about avasectomy because hehas heard that inmany cases men felt the loss ofstamina. There were some failure stories aswell, that isthe vasectomy became untied and the wife got pregnant. Ican not force him to doitbecause hewould blame meif hehad side-effects. People usually combined the rhythm method and the condom. Inorder touse the rhythm method, women were supposed toknow the ovulation cycle. Many women said that they obtained the knowledge from home economics classes in high school orfrom books about pregnancies and childbearing. Kim Youngmee said, Myhusband does not like touse contraceptives soIdo not like to,either. Thus, wepracticed withdrawal and the rhythm method. Ilearned about the ovulation cycle at my home economics class inhigh school. However, we failed and Igot pregnant. Mymenstruation cycle is28 days is30days. That is 278the reason why Ifailed tosuccessfully use the rhythm method. Kim Youngmee had never discussed her ovulation rhythm with other women orwith medical practitioners. She believed, as many other women believed, that the rhythm method did not require any others' help because itwas anatural method. Nam Jungsoon, who deepened solely onthe rhythm method after she removed the IUD because ofits side-effects, said that she obtained the information about ovulation from a book about pregnancy and child rearing. The book said that all days are risky for pregnancy except the 8-9 days before and after menstruation. The most common understanding ofthe ovulation cycle was that only seven days before and after menstruation were asafe period for pregnancy. Cho Seungja, who had adaughter and did not want tohave more children, was also using the rhythm method. She said that sofaritwasall right because her husband and she did not have sexual relations often. The same comment was made byother women who depended onthe condom and the rhythm method --they did not have frequent sexual relations. Therefore, they did not feel like getting sterilized orurging their husbands tohave avasectomy. In addition, Cho Seungja said that she was shy even about buying condoms byherself. She had never discussed contraception with other women; she had only discussed it with her husband, who did not know much either. 279Many women had used IUDs, particularly before being sterilized. InKorea, people usually call itthe \"loop.\" The side-effects ofthe IUD were not formally known toKorean women (cf. Grant: 1992) even though many women complained about it. Bang stated the government's emphasis onthe IUD weakened inthe mid 1970s because ofthe side-effects (Bang 1988: 503). After Nam Jungsoon gave birth toher second child, she got an IUD from the Namyang Health Center. The IUD gave her terrible backpain and bleeding. The pain in\"there\" (vagina) was severe and pus oozed out with urine. She went toa hospital and hadittaken out. One year later, she attempted tohave itinagain because people said that the IUD changed from the \"T\" form tosomething which was smaller than the previous one. She did not have pain with the new one but it slipped out. After that, she depended solely onthe rhythm method. The symptom that Nam Jungsoon described was mentioned bymany people who had used the IUD. Many women told mestories about putting upwith theside-effects of the IUD for several years just toavoid pregnancies. Ka Yunhee had the most enduring case of IUD side-effects among myinformants. She said, One month after mychildbirth, Igot using the IUD for six 280years. Icould smell astrong odor on mypanties and I felt discomfort. Iwent to myfemale doctor and received treatment for one month. Mydoctor told me that the IUD did notfit myphysical constitution and recommended that Iget sterilized. Itold her that I was scared ofhaving the operation. Therefore, she recommended the imported loop which was smaller than the previous one. The imported one was 25,000 won (about $35asof1985). After treatment, Igot the loop again until myhusband had avasectomy in1990 because Iwas visiting mydoctor every two orthree months for treatment of IUD infections. Iput upwith pain and astrong bad odor because myhusband and I really did not want tohave more than one child. KaYunhee later told methat she endured this suffering because she did not terminate her reproduction. Regarding women's complaints about theside-effects of the IUD, many doctors told women that theside-effects were not inherent inthe IUD. Rather, the problems derived from the women's chejil (physical constitution). Depending on women's physical constitution, some had problems but some did not. KoSunok said, The loop fit mycheiil. Itook thepill for six months but ittook away myappetite. SoIlost weight and had anemia and freckles doctor when you have aloop. Mydoctor recommended that Iget the IUD bysaying that there were two kinds ofloops; one was made inthe U.S. and cost 35,000 won (around $50 in1982); the other one was made inKorea and cost $1,200 won (around $1.75). I thought that the expensive one wasbetter, soItold him that Iwanted tohave the American product. The doctor told methat the one made inthe U.S. was designed for American women and contained less harmful substances tothe human body; onthe other hand, the one made inKorea was designed for Korean women and was more durable. Herecommended the Korean product tosee whether itfitted meornot asanexperiment. Itfit me and Ihave changed itthree times, using Korean product since 1982. KoSunok was the only person who was using the IUD for along period oftime without any complaints. She explained that itdepended onhow much good advice and care the doctor provided. She said that she had met agood doctor who really cared about female patients from thepatients' perspective. The Catholic hospital that KoSunok hadvisited was the only hospital inNamyang that did not provide abortions and sterilization. The only contraceptives this hospitals offered were thepill and IUD. Two other IUD users were high school teachers who 282wanted tocontrol the interval between their childbirth; they both had failed toprevent pregnancy with the rhythm method and had had abortions. Both had the IUD recommended bydoctors after their abortions; they would use them until they planned toget pregnant. One woman became inflamed \"there\" and received treatment for itand one woman said that she did not feel any discomfort. Their IUDs were imports, but they did not know from where orthe brand name. For the women, all the contraceptives were identified by their generic methods not bytheir brand names orcompany I\u00bala Iles . Many women who had used the IUD suffered from discomfort and pain. However, they put upwith these problems because they did not want toget pregnancy. Atthe same time, however, they did not want toterminate their reproductive capability. Female sterilization (tubectomy).\" Inthe 1980s, sterilization was the most emphasized contraceptive practice bythe government anditwas widely \"Throughout this chapter, when Iuse\"sterilization,\" itmeans female sterilization asdistinguished from the \"vasectomy\" for malesterilization. All the Korean government statistics and family planning literature use the terms inthis way. Ithink the usageindicates the gender politics ofthe FPpolicy asitshows its maleorientation; the sterilization policy was targeted tocontrol women's fertility but not men's reproductivity. The subject of discourse ismale and its object isfemale. Therefore, the sex neutral sterilization has been transformed and \"genderized\" intoreferring only tofemale sterilization inthe Korean context. 283practiced bywomen (see Table 5.5.). The popularity of sterilization was related totheproliferative medico political discourse onterminating reproduction after having one ortwo children. Eight women were sterilized and of these, three women had already known about the free sterilization provided bythe government. They contacted the Namyang Health Center toreceive free sterilizations. At that time, all three women were pregnant but wanted tohave abortions along with sterilization. Two women, Kim Hyunsuk and Choi Soonyoung, were not eligible for some reasons for the family planning program and the other woman, Lee Sunja, did not like the clinic arranged bythe Health Center. Kim Hyunsuk had three children, and Choi Soonyoung was over thirty-four years old. The government free service was available only for women whose age was under thirty-four and who had one or two children. Another woman, Lee Sunja, who contacted the health center, said, Ihad never used other contraceptives except the rhythm method after Igave birth totwo sons. Igot pregnant but myhusband and Idid not want tohave another child. Iwanted tohave the abortion and atthe same time thesterilization operation toterminate my reproductive capacity. Ihad an operation in aprivate OB &GYN clinic, paying foritwith myown money because when that arranged Ifelt bad and Ileft the clinic. Idid not mind that Ilost the government incentive offree sterilization and abortion. Ifound aprivate clinic bymyself and paid for the operation with my own money. Idid not have other alternatives because myhusband never responded when Iworried aloud about unwanted pregnancies. He just said, \"alaso haera (it isatyour discretion).\" Actually many husbands wanted tohave only one ortwo children, but they were not concerned with contraception. The men's indifference about contraception was more conspicuous inworking-class couples, but regardless of class position, many men decided the number ofchildren in the family but they left contraception totheir wives' discretion. So, inmany cases, when women had abortions they did not discuss itwith husbands; husbands usually said to their wives that alaso haera (it was uptothe women), which meant that the husbands wanted them tohave abortions. Choi Soonyoung, who was forty-four years old during myfieldwork and was sterilized ather age ofthirty-six, experienced all kinds ofavailable contraceptives. Her story about choosing sterilization asafinal contraceptive alternative is typical for many women intheir forties inKorea. She said, Ihad used thepill, foam tablets, the condom and the 285IUD. Thepill gave menausea and made mevomit; the IUD cut into myflesh and was sopainful; the foam tablet and the condom could not beused effectively because my husband was not cooperative. Iwas not andstill amnot the person who could control sexual relations. My husband wanted tohave sexual relations when he came back home in adrunken state. Ihad anabortion five times. When Iwas thirty six, Ithought Icould not stand that situation any more. Six middle-class women intheir thirties went to private clinics forsterilization bythemselves. These six women paid 70,000 or80,000 won (about $100 inU.S.) tobe sterilized. However, the clinics that these women visited were government assigned clinics for FPservices. Almost all local OB &GYN clinics were assigned todosterilizations, sothe medical practitioners were reimbursed for the service fees when they operated for the women who brought the FP coupon from the health center. Six women did not bring the FPcoupons but the local clinics might charge the government for their sterilization. Many clinics had informal exchange relationships with the health center inwhich the clinics reported sterilization cases tothe health center and the health center met their planned goal ofsterilization and paid for the reported cases. Many sterilized women actually did not realize the relationship between the popular 286operations ofsterilization inclinics and the FPpolicy. Therefore, Kim Youngmee, who became pregnant after sterilization in1983, told methat the doctor might not have had good skills because the operation was inthe experimental stage. Some women told metheir experience ofbeing discouraged from having sterilization operation inbig \"expensive and famous\" OB &GYN hospitals and ofbeing recommended tohave sterilization procedures inlocal clinics. All six women were sterilized atlocal clinics. When they went totheclinics toget abortions and complained about becoming pregnant, thesterilization operation was recommended. Onthe other hand, doctors in big, famous hospitals recommended the IUD, the oral pill and finally thesterilization. Hyun Sunghee had anabortion in one ofthe biggest and most famous OB &GYN hospitals in Seoul after having asecond child. She wanted tobe sterilized atthe same time but adoctor did not recommend it, saying that she was only thirty years old and had only one son. Heasked her what she would doifthe son had an accident orsomething. Nurses also told her that 60% of sterilization cases suffered from side-effects, and having anabortion andsterilization atthe same time definitely hurt the woman's health. She refused toput inan IUD and to take apill. Several months later she became pregnant as Hyun Sunghee had always thought that the contraception was 287men's responsibility and depended onher husband's condom which failed. This time she went to alocal OB &GYN toget anabortion. Adoctor inthat clinic recommended sterilization with the Hesaid that itmight be better for her tobesterilized tobefree from pregnancy, adding that vasectomy hurt active men's social life and physical strength. Hyun thought that ifeither her husband orshe had tobesterilized, itwas she who should doit because she was the person who stayed athome and her husband was abreadwinner. According toDr. Han, sterilization was not abig concern inher hospital; its focus was onmore sophisticated and high- technology medical care, such asinfertility treatment, gynecological operations, genetic screening and other high-tech medical procedures. Sterilization was not a high priority inthe big OB &GYN hospitals, which had not contracted with the government tocarry out the family planning policy. Dr. Han and Dr. Lee said, \"The sterilization operation isvery simple. Insome sense, itis simpler than the abortions.\" The OB &GYN doctors inbig hospitals regarded sterilization asagovernment program or public health issue but not asthe business ofthe specialized OB &GYN hospitals. These hospitals, Dr. Lee said, were more concerned with gynecological problems than obstetric problems, such asroutine prenatal care, delivery and contraception. 288OB &GYN doctors performed many sterilizations inthe '70s and through the mid '80s while there were incentives for doctors, but recently the population eligible for sterilization had decreased and not all clinics and hospitals were connected tothe government FPprogram. Many local OB &GYNs still received the incentive payments but few big hospitals did. Therefore, thehospitals known as\"FP hospitals,\" which specifically dealt with sterilization alone, operated vans torecruit sterilization cases from all over the city inwhich they were located and even toother cities. Some doctors said that these hospitals' andclinics' recommendation that women besterilized were related tothe incentives they received from the government. When people were deciding tohave sterilization performed, what they feared most wasinfertility and the side-effects that affected women\" bodies. The termination of reproduction isdeeply related towomen's position in marriage and tothe gender politics ofKorean culture. I deal with this issue inthe following section, titled, \"The gender politics ofsterilization.\" The issue ofside-effects isfrequently mentioned bymany women but the complaints have never been taken seriously bythe government and medical institutions. According tothemedico-political discourse ofsterilization, sterilization does not create any health problems for women. Although many women were worried and scared about the 289side-effects ofsterilization, not many women ofthe middle class actually complained. Lee Sunja felt fever and the sensation of aheavy body right after hersterilization. Park Moonwhan had some back pain following sterilization. However, neither ofthem had any other problems that were caused bysterilization. Hyun Sunghee said that she was physically ill with stiff neck and muscle pain inher arms and legs after sterilization. But she did not think these symptoms were caused bysterilization but byher frequent pregnancies; she became pregnant five times infive years including the two times she gave birth and the three times she had anabortion. She said that ittook three years to recover her health after sterilization. These women accepted themedico-political discourse that sterilization did not hurt women's physical health but frequent pregnancies and abortions hurt women's health. The most fearful side of abortion was the damage towomen's physical bodies. Among my middle-class informants, physical discomfort from sterilization was not soconspicuously mentioned, except by Kim Youngmee. Kim Youngmee said, Mysterilization operation was not successful. My husband and Idecided tohave sterilization because neither ofuswere good atusing contraceptives. But one and ahalf later, discomfort and lost my myhouse and adoctor referred byan OB &GYN intheuniversity hospital. Idonot know what that meant. The doctor said that this kind of case happened and asked mewhether Iwanted tokeep the baby ornot. Ofcourse, Idid not want any more children. Iwas hospitalized and had anabortion and sterilization again. The university doctor did not criticize the doctor who performed myfirst sterilization but Ithought itwas attributable tothe sterilization wasfirst becoming apopular contraceptive, sodoctors might not have had much experience inperforming sterilization operations. After Iwas sterilized, Irealized that sterilization was strongly recommended asacontraceptive bythe government health center. Kim Youngmee understood her problem asresulting from the technical aspect ofthe operation, not asbeing inherent in sterilization. Ingeneral, there was arumor that sterilization caused many bodily side-effects. Aninformal survey conducted ina poor district inInchon reported that 61.1% ofthe women surveyed (44 out of72women) suffered from theside effects ofsterilization, such asirregular menstruation, 291bleeding, menstrual pain, back pain, weight gain and weight loss. However, mymiddle-class informants did not mention these discomforts; they understood their bodily reaction in the way that medical doctors explained these discomforts to them. All the doctors whom Iinterviewed regarding theside effects ofsterilization said that sterilization did not cause any biological and medical problems tooccur in women's bodies. Dr. Lee said, \"female sterilization, which iscalled tubectomy asitispracticed inKorea, involves blocking the tubes byburning them electronically or applying rings tothe tubes and pressing them shut. It causes alittle pain for thefirst several days butitis not aproblem atall.\" The doctors mentioned that some problems might arise from malpractice, but the operation itself was very simple. Instead ofstressing the discomfort ofsterilization, some women mentioned about their feeling offreedom from pregnancies and their comfortable relations with their husbands inhaving sex. Choi Soonyoung said that she should have hadsterilization performed much earlier because she felt sofree and good not worrying about pregnancy when her husband demanded sexual relations. She wished she could tell other women tobesterilized sothat they could have freer andbetter relations with their husbands. Choi Soonyoung situated her sexuality separately from reproduction, but positioned itwithin the wifely role ofhaving sex with her 292husband. When women chose sterilization as acontraceptive method, their decision tostop fecundity was not a sufficient factor. The presence of ason was also very important. Kim Youngmee said: IfIhad only daughters, Iwould never get sterilized. Atleast women should leave some possibility for bearing ason although they donot want tohave more babies. Women cannot betotally relaxed inamarriage without giving birth toason. That isthe reason that women who have only daughters display apersonality that issomewhat unstable, aggressive, grabbing, and defensive. Sometimes they also have possessive and suspicious attitudes toward their husbands. Actually, itwas women who had already given birth to sons who usually hadsterilization performed. However, two women who had only two daughters were sterilized. These women wanted tostop worrying about getting pregnant and their husbands told them that they did not mind having only daughters. These two women said that children were a necessary component inmarried life but the relationship between man and wife was becoming more important. Other women, however, commented that these women were naive to take their husbands's words atface value and they would regret their sterilizations later. They added, \"Who knows what will happen inthe future? Their husbands should have 2.93had avasectomy ifthe husband did not mind having only daughters.\" Suh Okyoung said that she had asterilization operation because she loved her husband very much. She said that her husband might have some psychological damage by losing hisvirility (that is, men's reproductive ability) even though the vasectomy did not hurt his physical health. However, she was psychologically strong enough not tobe influenced byher loss ofreproductive function. Before sterilization, she always had worried about thepossibility ofpregnancy until her next menstruation. After sterilization, she felt free inmaking love and thought about sexuality alot but was frustrated byher husband's indifference tothe changed condition ofher body and her feeling ofbeing freed from pregnancy. Itwas only Suh Okyoung who began torelate sterilization tothe issue of sexual relations between husband and wife, dissociating it from the discourse ofreproduction and the number of children inthe family. However, asSuh Okyoung mentioned, her husband was not involved inher new discourse of sexuality being separate from reproduction. Thus, this form ofcontraception for the middle-class women wasstill situated within acustomary middle-class couples' the ofvasectomies the most interesting and 2.94surprising finding inmyresearch. Compared tothe national data (see Table 5.5.), many more men married to my informants actually had vasectomies (see Table 5.6. ).This iseven true incomparison with mydata onworking-class couples' contraceptive practices (see Table 5.9. ).Itis believed that men hate tohave avasectomy because the vasectomy damages thevirility that represents reproductive power aswell asmasculine Idescribe women's way ofunderstanding men's vasectomies and men's reproduction. Many women said that their husbands did not want to have many children. These men stated that the reason was the economic burden inbringing upchildren inthe expensive urban environment. Ingeneral, itwas husbands the number ofchildren but contraception was the wives's responsibility. Many women were afraid ofbeing sterilized and urged their husband tohave avasectomy. However, men would usually not have avasectomy. Many women told stories oftheir failure topersuade their husbands tohave a vasectomy. Thesterilization issue much related to gender politics inKorean culture inrespect tothe notion that the essence ofmasculinity isvirility and the essence offemininity isfertility. There that vasectomy hurts men's physical aswell aspsychological health and that men became \"socially\" impotent after having avasectomy. 295Therefore, when men had avasectomy, some women worried that their in-law families would blame them iftheir sons became who might beupset about her son's vasectomy. My mother-in-law came toknow after the operation, but she did not blame me. However, myhusband told methat it was painful, sohewould not have done itifheknew what itwould belike. Headded that hewould not said that ifthe vasectomy untied itself, My husband denied Ithink that myhusband feels that the vasectomy weakens aman's strength, asother men think. Like KaYunhee, Park Meejeon also asked her husband not totell his mother about his vasectomy, worrying that the mother-in-law would think she was selfish. Actually, some women were sterilized because their mothers-in-law forced their sons not tohave avasectomy, byasking how they could work outside the home tosupport the family just incase a vasectomy would weaken their manly performance; their daughters-in-law were athome. Na Hyunmee, whose mother toher husband, that her husband's vasectomy had not mattered toher mother-in-law, but her father-in-law mentioned that 296itwas bad for his grandson who would not beable tohave playmates. The women were aware that their husbands' reproduction was located inanin-law family that extended beyond their family ofprocreation and beyond the relationship between the women and their husbands. However, itwas NaHyunmee's husband who decided to have only one child and had avasectomy one month after she gave birth without telling her inadvance. Out ofeight husbands who had avasectomy, four men haditwithout telling their wives before they didit. The other four men had avasectomy because their wives suffered from ill-health byfrequent pregnancies and abortions. Some women felt bad about their husband's vasectomy. Yum Sukhee's husband had the vasectomy one month before she gave birth to ason. Yum said, \"Atthat time [1985] the catchy-phrase ofhaving only one child was very popular and myhusband was not so enthusiastic about children and wanted tohave only one child. However, itwas alittle shock to mebecause Ihad not given birth to yet. But hehad wecould not husband's vasectomy asherinfertility within her marriage. Cho Sukhyun described her feelings about the reproductive incapability produced byher husband's vasectomy which made her fearful about her position. She 297said, One day myhusband came back having had avasectomy while Iwas inthe sixth month of mysecond pregnancy. Hesaid that hefelt sorry that Ihad suffered somuch from two miscarriages, pregnancies and anabortion after marriage. Iwas soshocked, saying \"Why did not you wait until wehave second baby?\" Iworried what todoifIgave donot want tohave more children, Ithought weshould keep the potential for bearing achild. Another feeling ofsomething missing and sadness was described by OhInsook. She said, Hedid not talk tomeabout having avasectomy. Inthe evening, heentered home walking awkwardly. When I found out about his operation, Icried alot. Iwas so sad and displeased. Many mothers inthe YMCA told me that they felt the same feeling. Idid not want tohave more babies butstill Ifelt sad hesaid that hewas fine with it. However, hesaid that he would not let our son have avasectomy. After his vasectomy, Iexperienced him differently compared to before. Whenever Isaw myhusband's vasectomy scar, I feel bad and startled. Ofcourse, wefeel free when we 298make love without worrying about pregnancy. When the women mentioned their comfortable feeling inmaking love, they said that itwas good tohave sex without worrying about pregnancies. However, they said while sexuality was part ofmarriage, more important inmarriage was having achild. Without achild, itwould bevery difficult tomaintain the marriage. (3) The gender politics ofsterilization Most ofall, the middle-class women understood their contraception inrelation toreproductive practices. Therefore, their understanding ofsterilization and vasectomy was also situated within the gender relations of reproduction. Whether women had asterilization operation or not, women had thought about sterilization and considered it tobethe most effective and convenient contraceptive methods. Both the medico-political discourse of sterilization and women's understanding ofcontraception are not social practices that separate sexuality from reproduction, even though the effects ofthis discourse make this separation. The contraceptive discourse that applies to married women inKorea manifests itself atthe micro level inproviding good and adequate motherhood for few children and atthe macro level inlimiting family size for the society. Incontraceptive discourses, awoman's body is dominated byher reproductive organs and represented asan 2.99embodied agent for the economic rationalization ofthe family and the modernization ofthe national population. The sexuality that belonged toanindividual woman was considered aintegral part ofmarriage relations. Therefore, the decision about whether itwas the man or woman who would besterilized shows the gender politics ofman and woman's position inmarriage and family. The cultural logic of woman's femininity, defined through her reproductive function, and man's masculinity defined through his socio economic responsibility for family seem tobeoperating in thepractices ofcontraception. Kim Inwha said that she felt sorry for herself because ofher incapacity toget pregnant even though she did not want tohave more children. Her sexual relations with her husband became more relaxed asshe ceased worrying about pregnancies after sterilization, but atthe same time it deprived her ofsome excitement and she sometimes felt that her husband's free access toher sexuality lowered her value. And Park Moonwhan said that after sterilization her husband and she could make love without any worries about pregnancy. However, albeit not frequently, she felt asense offutility and sorrow that she had nowomanly function, which made her nervous. Some women who had feelings similar toKim Inwha 'sorPark Moonwhan's stated that they had the sterilization operation for their husbands but they felt sorry for their husbands because these men did not seem to 300appreciate their \"sacrifice\" and consideration. Some women thought that their husbands were selfish byconsidering only their own bodies and neglecting the wives' suffering in having abortions and childbirth. Onthe other hand, the women considered the family first, prior totheir own bodies. Therefore, when the women decided tobesterilized, they were taking the risks ofside-effects, such asback pain, liver spots onthe face because ofbad blood circulation, and obesity --all onhearsay. Atthe same time, they were giving uptheir reproductive function. These women understood contraception asthe extension ofthe reproductive role; contraception was practiced inthe sense but tocontrol their motherhood inthe qualitative sense. Attimes, women also understood their sterilization as adefensive method against their husbands' careless sexual desires. Itis important topoint out that nowomen actually stated that they had actively pursued contraception for their own need ordesires; rather, itwas for the benefit ofthe family. Inaddition, the women worried about the health and psychological damage that the vasectomy might cause. Most of the wives cared more about their husbands' health than their own health. Therefore, these women willingly were sterilized orfelt compelled tobesterilized for their husbands' and family's too about his health; hewas somewhat cowardly. The idea ofvasectomy bothered him. He wondered whether itwould hurt his physical strength. I did not want him toget introuble because ofthe vasectomy. However, mybody had already been damaged and hurt bytwo abortions. Ihad already been touched bythe knife. Ifthat was so, I'dbetter get sterilized, leaving myhusband's body untouched byany artificial intervention. Inaddition, itwould be my body again that the abortion would work onifwefailed inusing the contraception. And Iwassterilized. Even today Istill think that Idid the right thing. All thesterilized women inmystudy who had gone to OB &GYN clinics tohave abortions decided tohave the sterilization procedure. Some were actually considering having sterilization atthe same time when they went to clinics for anabortion, and some were not. But OB &GYN doctors recommended having together asHyun Sunghee explained earlier. Stories like Park Moonwhan's were told by many women. Park Moonwhan stated: Myhusband and Idiscussed who would besterilized. I was scared ofthe operation, so myhusband said to me that hewould doit. However, Ibecame pregnant while hewas would Ishould which made 302methink that I'd better besterilized because we do not both have tohave our bodies meddled with inhaving anoperation. Mybody had already been damaged by abortions soitwould bebetter for his body tobeleft healthy. Fortunately Idid not have any discomfort after sterilization. OhSukhee, who had two daughters, said that she could not let her husband get avasectomy because hewas so hesitant and afraid ofit. She said that she did not mind losing her reproductive function because she did not want to have more children. However, some women seriously cared about the issue of losing their reproductive function. Thus, they would not have asterilization operation. Song Meeja, who was amusic teacher inahigh school, said, Ihave never thought about atubectomy. Iamwell informed about thephysiological harmlessness of sterilization. However, the idea that Iwould not have reproductive function any more isuncomfortable tolive with. Ithought itwas unfair tosuffer from the result ofsexual relations. Isuffered enough from several abortions and twochildbirths. Therefore, itis, now, myhusband's turn tohave acontraceptive operation. Some women, particularly those whose husbands had had a vasectomy, argued that women must not besterilized because 303marriage isnot guaranteed tolast forever. KaYunhee said, \"Awoman should retain her reproductive function just in case ofdivorce. When awoman remarries, she could give birth to achild for the new in-law family. Ifshe is sterilized, she might not get the status ofwife from anew husband. Without achild, the woman cannot be areal member ofthe husband's family.\" Onthe other hand, some women thought male vasectomy was not good for marriage because men could have extra-marital relations without worrying about the evidence (meaning having babies outside marriage). These women also said that women's reproductive function should not beterminated because women could not know their future. Without reproductive function, women could not remarry after adivorce ortheir husbands' death. Dr. Han said that some women visited her hospital for therestoration of reproductive function after divorce orremarriage. However, some women refuted the notions bysaying that aman's vasectomy was good for amarriage because the husband could not make ababy outside marriage, sohecould not help coming back tohis own family. OhInsook's sister in-law urged her Thus, the husband diditbut hebegan tohave anextra-marital love affair right after his vasectomy. The wife was very upset and even saw apsychiatrist totreat her symptoms of depression. OhInsook said, however, that the husband finally returned tohis wife because itwas she who had his 304children. OhInsook said that no women could besure that their husbands might not have extra-marital relations; therefore, the husband should atleast have avasectomy for contraception lest hebeget achild outside the marriage. Many women actually regarded having children and their reproductive capability asanaspect ofwomen's power over the control oftheir married life. (4)Abortion as acontraceptive method Abortion isone ofthe major birth control methods that stops unwanted pregnancies. Areport said that 52.3% ofall the married women inKorea had experienced more than one abortion (KIPH 1989 :143). More than forty-seven percent of all the last pregnancies ofmarried women were unwanted pregnancies, and 78.9% ofthese pregnancies ended in abortions. Among them, 37% ofthese aborted pregnancies were theresults ofcontraceptive failure, and 57% ofthe pregnancies were unwanted but the women did not use any contraception (KIPH 1989 :149). Abortion has been basically illegal since 1953. However, bythe subsidiary law ofMother and Child Health, eugenic, ethical, and medical rationalization have been provided that justify abortions since 1973. Many women do not even know that anabortion isillegal inKorea. Asurvey reported that 51.8% of1,200 women answered that they did not know that anabortion was illegal inKorea (Shim 3051991: 208). Regardless ofthe law, abortion isperformed in almost all OB &GYN clinics and hospitals and regarded as the main income source ofthese institutions. Women have abortions mainly tocontrol unwanted pregnancies. Of 24middle-class women, 18women had had atleast one abortion. Ofsix women who did not experience anabortion, four women never used other contraceptive devices because their husbands had avasectomy right before orafter childbirth. The other two women were Suh Wharan, who depended on acondom, and Nam Jungsoon, who removed the IUD because ofinflammation and was using the rhythm method at the time ofthe interview with me. Suh Wharan said that she never used any contraceptives herself but she was confident about not getting pregnant because her husband was avery careful person. Onthe other hand, Nam Jungsoon worried about getting pregnant and asked her husband toget a vasectomy but hewould not doit. the number ofabortions is inproportion towomen's age unless they were sterilized. Almost all sterilizations accompanied anabortion. The major reason for the abortion was toremove unexpected pregnancies. Orsome women, like Park Moonwhan, had abortions because they thought the fetuses seemed tobe girls; Park Moonwhan said that after herfirst childbirth, her husband used condoms and sometimes she used nowon (the foam tablet). But she got pregnant, felt itwas adaughter 306and atthe same time thought itwas the second baby. Soshe had anabortion. Orsome women had abortions because they were afraid ofhaving \"abnormal\" babies who had been affected bythe drug that they took for acold, allergy, orother illness. Cho Sukhyun said, Iwant tohave two children. When myfirst child was twoyears old, myphysical condition changed because of some allergy. Itook lots ofmedicine forit, which I bought from the drug store. When Irealized that Iwas pregnant, Iwent toan OB &GYN doctor and asked whether Iwould give birth toanormal baby. The doctor told methat Imight have a99% chance ofhaving a deformed baby. All the women said that they did not want toget pregnant but their contraception had failed. Table 5.7.The middle-class women's abortions |stated no. ofabortion O 1 2 3 4 5 | |ao. of woman 6 8 4 3 2 1 n= 24| The available contraceptive methods for Korean women were bounded bythe methods that the FPprogram provided and the manner ofpracticing contraception was shaped bythe cultural practices ofgender and sexuality between men and women. Kim Hyunsuk said, Iwore the loop but itdid notfit mybody. I discharged blood, soIwent toan OB &GYN clinic and removed it. Thus, Idepended onthe rhythm method and 307the condom but Igot pregnant and had anabortion. To avoid another abortion, Itook thepill but itmade me nauseous and dizzy. Istopped taking italthough other people recommended putting upwith itfor more than a week and then Iwould beall right. Iput inthe IUD again but itslipped out and Igot pregnant again. Finally Iwas sterilized. Kim Hyunsuk used all the known contraceptives inKorea, within the rubric offamily planning: sterilization, IUD, thepill, the condom and the rhythm method. Among these methods, thepill was the least favored byKorean women; a lot ofwoman thought that thepill hurt the natural balance of awoman's body bydisrupting the natural flow of hormones. Sterilization was adopted asafinal solution to terminate their reproductive capacity; otherwise, women had an IUD put inordepended onthe rhythm method or acondom for contraception. Regarding the rhythm method, many women did not have the correct knowledge ofthe ovulation cycle, as Idescribed earlier, orfailed because ofmen's so-called biological instinct. Park Moonwhan marked her ovulation period onthe calendar toinform her husband that they should avoid the \"man and wife\" relation during that period but she said that men's biology could not betamed to observe the abstention from sex. Inaddition, there was no channel for consultation that would correct the side-effects ofthe IUD or thepill from the point ofview ofwomen's 308experience with them. Sothey just quit and became pregnant. Therefore, without sterilization, thepossibility of unwanted pregnancies was high because ofthe technical problems ofcontraceptives combined with the cultural practice ofsexuality. Myinformants' experience ofabortions as amajor method ofcontraception tells how contraceptive practices are related tothe position ofwomen inthe family and the gender politics ofsexuality. Choi Soonyoung said, Myhusband came back home inadrunken state and forced metomake love tohim. Even though Itold him that I was inthe period where Icould get pregnant, the man, who isalready turned ontodoit, usually never stops realizing his own desire. When men become excited sexually, they usually donot care about women. Inthis kind ofsituation, how could dependent on mywill. Awoman said toher husband that she would not have sexual relations when he came back home in adrunken state after midnight. She told methat she tried tocontrol her husband's drinking habit byusing sexuality. However, other women said that itwas not easy for them toresist orto reject their husbands' needs because they thought having sexual relations with their husbands was part ofthe wifely role. Therefore, the women were afraid that the husbands would see other women ifthey became sexually depressed or 309ifthey were rejected bytheir wives.\" The most common strategy toavoid relations for fear about pregnancies was that women told their husbands that they were having their periods. Butitdid not work as amethod for controlling unwanted pregnancies. Many women had anidea that men had an inherent instinct ofsexual lust which had tobesatisfied regularly. Atthe same time, the women's social \"innocence\" about sexual bodies led women tohave frequent abortions forbirth control. Before marriage, women were expected tobe \"innocent\" about sexuality and reproduction, but after marriage, particularly when they had had the number of wanted children, contraception was left aswomen's business. Many men decided the number ofchildren; however, regarding unwanted pregnancies these husbands just commented totheir wives that they should deal with itatthe wives' discretion. Even though they did not mention abortion, they meant that the wives should have anabortion. Through these processes, contraception became the wives' responsibility and the wives chose sterilization asthe final alternative. Therefore unless women were sterilized, they were always worried about unwanted pregnancies because ofhusband centered sexual relations and \"ineffective\" contraceptives, *Amidwife, Ms. Park, inYaksan recommended herpatients for avoiding sexual contacts for two months after childbirth because of medical reasons, emphasizing that their husbands' abstention was a part ofpaternal role. However, she said that the women were afraid that their husbands would see other women during that period. 310such asthe rhythm method orcondoms. Women put upwith also Contraceptive Practices Anold story inKorea hasitthat the poor family has many children, signifying that the husband and wife relationship isvery good inapoor family even though they are economically deprived. However, mystudy inYaksan, a working-class district, shows that poor families inKorea no longer have many children. Out oftwenty families, eleven *Recently, debate and adiscourse about \"sin\" and \"life\" on abortions are emerging in Korea. However, the discourses are oriented topro-life in the American sense. Women who have abortions are criticized asbeing without any consciousness and respect for\"life.\" InKorea, where theabortion debate ofpro-life vspro-choice has never been anissue, many groups are confused about the Western debate over abortions and the concept ofchildren and family inKorean culture. However, these groups have accepted thepro-life discourse as amorally andpolitically correct idea and have begun to practice pro-life-oriented anti-abortion discourse. For example, government institutes such asthe KoreanInstitute ofCriminology tried to make asubstantial law to regulate stating theprotection of\"fetus right\" (Panel discussion in1991 May) :Amale scholar who is aself-proclaimed feminist wrote that Korea is aheaven ofabortion, insisting Koreans need adebate over concept of\"life\" and introducing some Western philosopher's ideas' of\"life\" without analyzing and contextualizing theabortion afeminist weekly newspaper \"Yusung Shinmun\" wrote anarticle, introducing afemale over by progressive male actor criticized and blamed women's insensitivity tofetus life and women's irresponsibility in having repeated abortions (SBS 12/8/1992). Dr. Han, OB &GYNspecialist and Dr. PH, said that she was ideologically anantiabortionist but as aphysician, she hadpracticed abortions inherhospitals. Feminist groups have notparticipated inthe debate but many women began todescribe tothese discourses of\"sin\" or\"guilty feeling.\" one-child families and the not want tohave another child. Table 5.8. Number ofchildren for working-class couples No. ofchildren Iasked working-class women whether they had heard about the family planning policy, many women answered that they did not know what itwas about. The exception was one mother, Haesoon's mother, who said, \"Ithink ithas todo with knowing their economic and social places inspending money with respect tonational development.\" She thought it was anational campaign concerning thrift and industry. When Iasked whether the government campaign aimed atconvincing families tohave two children had influenced their reproductive behavior, Haesoon's mother was surprised like many other women, saying that having few children had nothing todowith the government. She argued that the number ofchildren totally relied onthe people's financial capacity tobring upchildren. She wondered who could have many children intoday's world. Regardless ofclass position, the women's efforts to control their reproduction was immense. Inthis section, I describe working-class women's experiences ofreproductive control. Ifocus on (1) thedifferent way inwhich their class position affects their access tocontraceptives, as 312contrasted tothe middle-class women, and (2)their way of looking attheir bodies, particularly with respect tomale and female sterilization. Itisnoteworthy that for working class people, the physical body isthe most critical capital for survival. Ingeneral, the size ofthe family among working-class people Istudied was smaller than inthe middle-class families. Women such asJuntae's mother said, Having only one child isnot good for the child because the child tends tobe aselfish and ego-centered person. However, myhusband and Iwere brought upin big families with many siblings. Wehated the family with many children who were not fully cared for; children did not get agood education oradequate emotional support. Ifwehad two children, that might begood for myson, but wecannot afford tobring up two children well. Weare fine with one son. Our decision tohave one child has nothing todowith the government business. Ihave never sensed that the government demands having few children. Why does the government intervene inthat kind ofpersonal affairs? Without intervention, people already donot have many children. Why should people suffer from many children? Everybody issmart and takes care ofthemselves too much tohave many children. When the women narrated their reasons and the benefits 3.13ofhaving few children, asJuntae's mother did, they used the exact expressions that the government had deployed in its campaigns advocating having few children inthe 1960s and the 1970s. Even though the women did not realize that their narratives were almost identical with institutional discourses onthe modernization and rationalization ofthe social system --including the control over their family size, they were the people who had been strongly regulated and regimented bythe state discourse ofmodernization. It was they who had been the executioners ofmodernization and capitalist development programs inKorea, through their deep involvement inurban factories aswell asinthe rural New Village Movement which Idescribed inchapter 5.Their way ofunderstanding the concept ofthe economic benefits of having few children and the control exercised over their reproduction are profoundly influenced bythestate's discourse of\"modernity\" and economic rationality. Many women said that itwas their husbands who wanted tohave only one child. Incontrast tothe common image of working-class men from rural areas who had traditionally placed avalue on abig family, the husbands inthe Yaksan area did not want totake responsibility for abig family. Through migration and working and living inindustrial settings, working-class people's way oflooking atthe 3.14family had changed.\" The economic imperative gave many men the desire tocontrol their family size; however, although husbands wanted tocontrol the size oftheir families, it was their wives' reproduction, not theirs, that they expected tocontrol. Many men wanted tohave only one child but did not want touse contraceptives. The difference in family size between middle-class and working-class which emerged in myresearch seemed tocorrelate with my informants' class differences; they rationalized family size inaccordance with ofbringing uptheir children. Therefore, working-class women, ascompared tomiddle-class women, rarely mentioned apreference for sons asan influence intheir reproductive practices. Actually more families who had only one daughter inYaksan wanted tostop having anadditional child. However, compared tothe middle-class men, the Yaksan men did not have vasectomies (see Table 9.9...). Only one man had avasectomy among the working-class couples; hewas a college drop-out and labor organizer. Hehad only one daughter, but hedid not want another child. Many activist oriented men did not want tohave many children but this man was particularly motivated tohave avasectomy because he \"Very few studies have been done about the formation ofthe working-class family inKorea, but there are some studies on working-class family structure and relations, class reproduction through family interms ofKorean capitalism (Yo' so'nghankuksahoe yo'nkuhoe 1990) families (Hankukachokhak yo'nkyhoe 1992). 315regretted his wife's abortion. Including this vasectomized man, all the working-class men were various types ofmanual workers. Although the Yaksan men did not want tohave more children, they felt they could not have the \"operation\" (vasectomy) because they were afraid that itwould undermine their physical strength and would hurt their health. For these men and their families, the men's physical strength and health were their critical survival capital. Table 5.9.

Therefore, neither sterilization for women nor vasectomy for men was welcomed. Even sterilized women who had not felt any side-effects said that they would not recommend sterilization for other women. Sterilization, ingeneral, was understood asharmful tothe human body, producing many side-effects. Oftwenty working mothers, five women were sterilized; Youngsoo's mother and 316Sunwha 'smother were operated upon atthe request oftheir husbands atchildbirth. Their husbands made their request because, they explained, their wives were not smart enough tocontrol their reproduction. However, once women were sterilized, they did not have tothink about itany more. The men inquestion wanted tostop having more children but felt they could not get avasectomy because itwould weaken their physical strength. Both husbands were working in a machine shop, as awelder and amechanic respectively. The wives felt embarrassed when they told meabout their sterilization but they said that they had accepted it because their husbands' physical strength was needed for the family. Eunyoung's mother was also sterilized after she had given birth tothe second child. When she had been thinking ofterminating her reproduction before she had anunwanted pregnancy, avan came from ahospital inSeoul one day and announced through amicrophones that the hospital was offering free sterilization. She volunteered and was taken tothe hospital forsterilization inthe morning and brought back home inthe afternoon. Another sterilized woman was Kiyoung's mother. Kiyoung's mother's story ofhersterilization and her repentant feeling about itspeaks poignantly ofthe way in which reproduction was situated inworking-class women's lives. She said, Idid not use any other contraceptives, except for 317several months ofhaving an IUD which Igot from the health center right after Igave birth tomyson. When Ihad an IUD put in, Ifelt terrible fatigue and my period became irregular. SoIhadittaken out. Then, I got pregnant. Idecided not tohave more children. At that time, many people around mehad terminated their reproductive function, being satisfied with only one child. Ithought that one child was enough for me, too. Therefore, Ihad thesterilization operation atage 26 without telling myhusband about it. Instead, Itold my husband that Igot anabortion because Idid abort my pregnancy together with thesterilization operation. Gradually, Kiyoung's mother came toregret having been sterilized. Her deep regret tells why many women were worried about sterilization. Kiyoung's mother stated, Now Ireally regret having been sterilized. Acouple should have atleast two children; itwould begood for the After Irealized my big mistake, Iwent tothe hospital for the reversal operation. The doctor said that itcost one million fifty hundred thousand won (around $2,000). Idid not care about the money because money comes and goes, but the doctor told methat the chance ofreversal would be only 20%. Iwas sterilized toohastily. Even women who were poorer than Iwas did not make such afrivolous decision. Ihad sterilization because ofeconomic 3.18reasons --because one child was more affordable and because ofthe influence ofthe social fad ofhaving one child. After the operation, myhusband found out and wefought many times about it. Iused totell my husband that hecould bring mehis baby born outside of our marriage and Iwould raise that baby ifhereally wanted tohave another child. Idonot know what I would doifhereally wanted tohave another baby. I made abig mistake with respect to myhusband. If my child were not ason, Iwould not have had sterilization. Ireally think that women who only have adaughter and were sterilized are narrow minded and stupid. Ithink how many children acouple have depends ontheir economic capability but women's reproductive capacity should not beterminated because nobody knows what happens inthe future and the economic situation could also improve. AsKiyoung's mother described, many women could not convince themselves tobesterilized after worrying about the uncertainty oftheir only child's survival toadulthood; ifanaccident happens tobeable togive birth toanother child. Orthey could have another baby when their economic situation was better off inthe future. Ifwomen could not give birth toanother child in those situations, they thought that their position in marriage would bejeopardized. One female labor activist, 3.19Suh Minja, who was working inthe Yaksan area, described herself as atypical Korean woman asfollows; Iused totell many working mothers tobesterilized to control their unwanted pregnancies. However, Icannot doitmyself since Igot married and had achild. My husband wanted tohave avasectomy because hedoes not want tohave more children but Iopposed his operation because our son isonly seven months old. about thepossibility ofaccidents boy. from books much afamily-oriented Iamafter Ihad ason. Ofeleven women who had achild, only three women were sterilized. Many mothers were notsterilized for the reasons mentioned even though they thought one child was enough for them. They did not want tohave another baby but they did not want toterminate their reproductive capacities either. Many women had the idea that without reproductive capacity women cannot keep their identity inmarriage. Sterilization iswell-known asthe most effective contraceptive tothese working-class mothers, but atthe same time itis known asthe most detrimental towomen's health. Fear about sterilization was soprevalent that many husbands actually did not let their wives get sterilized. Youngmee's husband did not want his wife toget sterilized because itwould make women sick and fat. Hedid not want to 320have avasectomy either; thus, Youngmee's mother, who was thirty-one years old, had four abortions. One OB &GYN specialist, Dr. Yang, who was working inageneral hospital inapoor district said: \"Medically speaking, sterilization does not affect awoman's body atall. Isaw several women who complained ofside-effects but Icould not find anybio organic problems. Ithought as Aninformal more than 60percent ofsterilized women were found tobesuffering from menstrual irregularity, bleeding, severe menstrual pain, back pain, weight gain and loss, was designed byDr. Yang with afeminist group to assess working-class women's complaints ofside-effects from sterilization (Minuhoe 1989). Itwas avery simple questionnaire and did not provide any interpretation of women's complaints, butitindicates that many women did not know ofthe possible side-effects before they were sterilized and they did not make written consents atthe sterilization operation. Atthe same time, 65.2% ofthe sterilized women inapoor district had been sterilized through the health centers and FP-assigned clinics. Kiyoung's mother, who wassterilized in aclinic arranged by the health center and did not receive any information about thepossibility ofside-effects, lost weight and easily became tired after sterilization. However, she added that her problems might becaused byhard work. She said, \"We, 321working mothers, work too much athome and outside. We mothers, are living byspirit and not byphysical strength.\" Amidwife, Ms. Park, who had aclinic inYaksan, attributed the women's complaints tothemalpractice that had occurred as aresult ofcollective operations in FPclinics and the lack ofindividual care after sterilization. Kiyoung's mother mentioned that itwas good that she did not fear pregnancy after sterilization. However, she often tried toavoid having sexual relations. Shefelt that she would become devalued ifshe accepted all her husbands' demands. Therefore, she sometimes refused her husband's desires tohave sexual relations. However, when she wanted tohave sex, she said that she manipulated him sothat he felt it was him who wanted it. Other sterilized women said that itwas good for them not toworry about pregnancy but itdid not change their sexual practices with their husbands. For them, sterilization isregarded as a reproductive practice but not as asexual practice dissociated from reproduction. Many women worried about the loss ofreproductive capacity because having achild isconsidered tobethe toher husband's reproving attitude toward her sterilization manifested the link between women's reproductive position inmarriage and their gender identity. When middle-class husbands had avasectomy without their 322wives' consent, nowomen got mad attheir husbands, as Kiyoung's father had atKiyoung's mother. Nomen apologized totheir wives for the male's loss ofreproductivity. Hyunsook's mother, who had anIUD, said, \"Ican never have a sterilization operation because Ihave heard that many men begin tosee other women intheir forties. What could Ido ifIgot sterilized and myhusband saw other woman and had a child with another woman? Iwould not want tobemistreated after Ilost myfertility.\" Hyunsook's mother said that her husband talked toher several times about not wanting another child. She said, \"So, Iurged him tohave a vasectomy bythreatening birth toa ifIgot pregnant nomatter what difficult economic condition wewere in.\" Getting pregnant presents fear and suffering for women, but atthe same time itis away ofdisplaying women's power within given social-cultural boundaries :power tohave their husbands' babies and toachieve family. the power husband's sexuality the number ofchildren for the welfare ofthe family. Therefore, many women preferred the IUD tosterilization inorder tokeep their reproductive function, even though many ofthem suffered from theside effects ofthe IUD. Hyunsook's mother, who understood her husband's reluctance tohave avasectomy but was afraid of 323getting pregnant after two abortions, got an IUD onthe recommendation ofmany neighbor friends. Hyunsook's mother had an IUD put inwhen shevisited the health center atthe time ofher daughter's immunization. She thought the IUD was soconvenient that she recommended tomany women tohave it inserted even though itwas painful. Middle-class women paid for IUDs from clinics and hospitals with their own money while many of myinformants inYaksan had the IUD inserted bynurses atthe Namyang Health Center. Some women learned about the IUD from their neighbors and some women came to know ofthe government free contraceptive services when they visited the health center toget free vaccinations for their children. Therefore, almost all the women knew about the free contraceptive services, offering IUDs andsterilization through the government health center. They understood that these services were asocial support program for low-income families toimprove family welfare bylimiting family size. Incontrast tomiddle-class women who said that they got the information through books ormedical doctors, the information about contraception for the working-class women mainly came from neighbor networks. These networks were a critical resource for economic and social survival in everyday life, asIdescribe inchapter 5.\" Before they \"Before these working mothers settled inYaksan asmarried women, they had learned contraceptive information sometimes from married female workers inthefactory after they had hadabortions. After the first abortion, Juntae's mother discussed itwith an older female worker and received the information about condoms. 324went tothe health center for the IUD, many women did not know what contraceptive methods touse after childbirth. Some women went todrug stores toask about Meejin's mother said, Iwent toadrug store and afemale pharmacist recommended the foam for me. Ibought thepill and took it.Itincreased myappetite and I gained somuch weight, Iquit. After that, myhusband used condoms but Ifelt too much pain. Itold my husband Idid not like it, and myhusband ejaculated myvagina. Myhusband disliked it. One day tothe city health center for mydaughter's immunization, ahealth worker recommended that Iuse a loop (IUD). Itold her that Iwas afraid ofputting something in my\"there.\" The health worker said that it would bevery easy and once Ihad itin, Idid not have toworry about pregnancy. When she inserted it, Ifelt something squeezed. The health worker told menot to have sex for one week. After having the IUD put in, I felt pain atrelations (sex) and became inflamed. Since then, Ialways feel pain, wet and messy \"there (around vagina)\" and wrenched during menstruation. Inaddition, when Iwas tired and nervous, Ifelt trouble there and became inflamed. Therefore, when Ihave relations with myhusband, myclose neighbor friends and asister immediately found out because Ihad terrible pain after 325that. One day after having sexual relations with my husband, Iwent to ahospital and adoctor gave mesome medicine and aninjection. Even though Ihad such terrible problems, Ihad the IUD for three years. The durability ofthe IUD that Ihad put inwas three years. After Istood itfor three years, Ihadit pulled out. Itwas amonth ago. After that, Ifelt I could fly. Myhusband worried about pulling itout because ofpregnancies. Many women had the same experience asMeejin's mother and put upwith the pain and discomfort ofhaving the IUD put inbecause ofits effectiveness and convenience. When I visited the Namyang health center, awoman came toconsult about her discomfort with an IUD that she had received from the health center. Ahealth worker told her togotothe OB &GYN doctors inthe clinic because there was nonurse to pull itout. The midwife/nurse who inserted the IUD was not aregular staff atthe health center, soshe was not available atthat time. There was noregular midwife/nurse inthe health center only visiting midwife/nurses. The health center's main concern was putting inthe IUD for the women, but individual care toalleviate the pain and discomfort after the insertion ofthe IUD was delegated to the women themselves. Amidwife/nurse, Ms. Park, who had aclinic inthe Yaksan area, said that she found that many women needed 326vaginal infection treatment before they got IUDs. She usually prescribed antibiotics when she inserted the IUD in poor women. She criticized the health center nurses and local OB &GYNs who put inthe IUD without aclinical examination and the treatment ofinfection. Ms. Park thought that the side-effects ofthe IUD and sterilization came from the lack ofindividual examination and care before and after the medical procedure. Atthe same time, Ms. Park blamed poor women for not being concerned with their bodies. She said that these women treated their bodies asifthey did not belong tothem; therefore, they did not see any medical practitioners even though they had pain and astrong bad odor. They believed that the IUD would bedurable for two years. Many doctors blamed women --particularly poor women, who did not medically care for their bodies --about their gynecological problems.\" Women's idea ofwomen that all the women had gynecological problems because oftheir reproductive organs, and totheir class-related situation. They had towork *This kind ofblame was extended not only toreproductive control but also applied toother chronic illnesses: for example, Minkee's mother had athyroid disease. However, she stopped attempting tocure itbecause itwas difficult for her tomake appointments with doctors during the day, when she was supposed to bedoing her job in afactory. She thought itwas straighteningitself out. isthe way that theillnesses ofworking mothers came tobechronic. 327during the day and were unable totake off for medical consultation. After four abortions, Youngmee's mother's neighbors recommended that she use an IUD asafinal alternative even though there was some possibility of discomfort, including back pain and afloating feeling within her womb. Itwas also possible that itwould slip out. The Namyang health center arranged for her toget an IUD from alocal clinic. The doctor told her not to dohard work and tohave acheck-up every six months. But she did notvisit the clinic because she did not feel any problems. Moreover, itwas not easy for her tovisit clinics inthe day time because she was working in afactory. Inaddition, many women thought that all the women who had given birth and had abortions had gynecological problems. They thought that all married women might get infections ordiscomfort \"there.\" Therefore, many women believed that these problems were chronic more orless for married women. Many women's tendency toendure the side-effects ofcontraceptives derived from their idea that contraceptives were harmful to human bodies but itwas economically and socially imperative tocontrol the size oftheir families. The side-effects of contraceptives were understood asthe cost ofcontrolling their reproduction. Inaddition, many women thought theside-effects and effectiveness ofcontraceptives depended onwomen's chejil (physical constitution). Youngin's mother had three 328pregnancies while she had anIUD. The doctor who aborted the pregnancies said that itwas rare but the IUD did not fit some women. Sungsuk's mother was using the rhythm method and she had two abortions. She hated getting pregnant but contraceptives such asthepill and the IUD did notfit her cheiil and adoctor told her that her womb was too weak to undergo sterilization. The idea ofcheiil isoriginated from the Chinese medical practices, meaning that the application ofthe medicine should bevaried according toindividuals' default for lay people. Atthe same time, itwas the dominant Western medicine's way ofselecting and incorporating the medical cultural tradition for thepractice ofWestern medicine in Korean cultural context. Abortions were frequently obtained byboth middle-class and working-class women and were regarded as acontraceptive method when couples did not want tohave more children. Many women had used (or were still using) the rhythm method, *Inexplaining the internal dynamic relations ofcultural process as acultural system, Raymond Williams differentiated the 'residual' and the 'emergent. 'The residual, byhis definition, means that what has been effectively formed inthepast, but itisstill active inthecultural process, not only and often not atall as anelement ofthe past, but as aneffective element ofthepresent. Thus, certain experiences, meanings, and values which cannot beexpressed orsubstantially verified interms foam tablets orhusbands\" withdrawal for their contraception. When they failed, they had abortions (see Table 5.10.). AsIhave explained, there were various reasons why women could not depend on\"effective\" contraceptives such asthe IUD andsterilization. Juntae's mother said that abortion was inevitable if women had unwanted pregnancies. Toavoid surgical abortions, some working mothers had used some medicine (anabortifacient) to resume their menstrual period but they realized itwas not effective. Table 5.10. Working-class women's abortions |stated no. ofabortion 0 1 2 3 4 5 no. of woman 8 4 3 2 1 2 n= 20 | Youngin's mother was thirty-four-year old and had two daughters. She had five abortions. Many women believed that some women's bodies too easily became pregnant. Youngin's mother said that she had that kind ofbody. She felt so ashamed ofhaving many abortions that she could not goto the same clinic because the nurses knew her and felt pity for her. Sometimes she had two abortions within four months. Not only Youngin's mother but also other women who had the same experience ofconsecutive abortions believed that right after anabortion, itwas very easy toget pregnant again because the womb became soclean that the conception happened easily and smoothly. OB &GYNs and midwives criticized these women bysaying that some women came back 330totheir clinics for another abortion because they did not use contraceptives, having the idea that they had just removed the pregnancy and could still befree from the need touse contraception. Youngin's mother suffered from physical and emotional trouble caused byabortions. She said, \"Ifelt pain inall parts of mybody. Particularly Ialways feel something coming out from \"there\" and have aburning feeling. When I come home, Ihave toimmediately take ashower first. Iknow someone told methat too but I amalways conscious ofsome feeling \"there.\" Like Youngin's mother, many women complained about theill-health they suffered asthe result ofabortions. Women who had several abortions inparticular described their bodies being as ruined bypregnancies and abortions. Youngmee's mother had four abortions because she was soshy about getting information about contraception even after marriage and described feeling the wind onher wrist and knee. She could not hold heavy things and could not stand upfor along time because she did not have strength inher legs; and her face become swollen when she was tired. She thought these problems partly derived from alack ofpost-abortion care. Youngmee's mother said, \"If the baby had been delivered, the woman would betaken care ofand might have aright to complain about the suffering ofpregnancy. aborted sohow itreflects her ignorance and mismanagement ofher body.\" Many husbands actually thought that unwanted pregnancies were women's fault. Women should have taken care ofcontraception. Myungho's mother who had three abortions bought condoms for her husband because she was afraid of getting pregnant again. But her husband threw them away, saying that hewould not have sex ifhehad towear a condom. She had afear ofgetting pregnant but she did not want toterminate her reproductivity. Youngmee's father did not want totalk about contraception and did not pay attention toher pregnancies; therefore, she had abortions byborrowing money from aneighbor friend without telling her husband. Sometimes these working-class mothers did not have money tohave abortions, although Dr. Han said that there was no woman who could not have anabortion because of money inKorea. Sungsuk's mother had three children but she said that she did not want tohave the third child, who was ason. Itwas ason, soher husband liked itand other people thought that she got pregnant tohave ason. However, she said that she could not abort her pregnancy because she did not have 100,000 won (around $130 in USdollars). She felt ashamed ofborrowing money for anabortion from other women, soshe postponed it. She was inher fifth month and inthat stage, the abortion cost around 400,000 or50,000 won (around $500 to$600); thus, she could not afford it. 332She described waking up, even inher eighth orninth month, muttering toherself that she would not give birth tothis baby. However, other people thought that she did not have an abortion because she was aCatholic orbecause she wanted to have ason. They felt sorry for her, wondering how she could take care ofthose three young three children. She said that she did not tell other people about her three abortions because she thought having anabortion represented women's ignorance andill-care oftheir bodies. Youngmee's mother also felt ashamed ofher four abortions because itseemed toher to show her lack of cleverness ofcontrolling her own body. These women had an idea that women had totake care oftheir bodies cleverly no matter what the situation was .The women's shame and blame tothemselves came from the cultural discourse ofsmart housewives who were good athousekeeping aswell asserving their husbands atnight. This cultural notion ofgender relations particulary onmale sexuality, which hold that men are sexually irresponsible because ofthe male sexual instinct; therefore, women, whose desire ismore passive, more controllable and bounded, should take care ofthe situation. After several abortions, women began toblame themselves for aninnocence and ignorance, that had been avirtue atone time. The women situated their innocence and ignorance, which resulted in thefailure ofcontraception, again within the discourse of 333their lack ofeducation and school learning, asImentioned about education for the new performance offemininity in chapter 5.Youngmee's mother said that she had never blamed her husband. She thought itwas her fault from her ignorance; thus, she wanted todie when she got pregnant. Not only Youngmee's mother but also Youngin's mother always worried when they had sex with their husbands. Youngin's mother complained toher husband that she could not gotoahospital for any more abortions because of shame. She wanted him tohave avasectomy but her husband promised tobecareful bypracticing the withdrawal method. Hefelt some responsibility and sorrow about her five abortions but hesaid hefelt shy about going toahospital for avasectomy. However, Youngin's thought hedid not because Youngmee's mother mentioned avasectomy toher husband, hesmiled and ignored the suggestion. Her mother-in-law told her not tolet him have avasectomy, because hewas quite small and might lose his physical strength. Compared tomiddle-class women, apreference for sons seemed toberelatively weak for working-class women. Sex selection practices, such asaborting female fetuses was not mentioned. The economic imperative and the burden ofhaving many children seemed toeliminate the discourse ofson preference and let them limit their family size toagreater extent than themiddle-class. However, having ason isstill 334important for women. Juntae's mother said that she felt pity for awoman who has many children. Two children seemed tobe good for afamily but she wassatisfied with ason, adding that ifshe had had adaughter, she would have had another child. Many women who did not have ason worried about whether ornot their husband wished for ason inhis heart despite the husband having said tothe wife that hedid not mind having only adaughter. However, compared with the middle-class families, more families inYaksan had only girls and atthe same time, wanted tostop having more children. Compared tomiddle-class contraceptive practices, the most conspicuous difference was fewer vasectomies among working-class men. Working-class men's fear ofvasectomy demonstrates the importance of aman's physical health in the working-class family, given that the household head's physical body isthe most critical capital for the family's survival. And itshows the political-economic transformation ofthe discourse onmasculinity inKorean culture along with industrialization. Masculinity, which had been represented through virility and men's production ofmany offspring in traditional society, had changed into aconcern for health and sustaining men's labor power inindustrial urban Korea. Interms ofcontraceptives, many women said that ithad tobeconvenient and easy tomanage because they were not good athandling contraceptives; itmeant that they wanted 335contraceptive methods which were impersonal inmanagement. This idea easily led them todepend upon medically intervened contraceptives such as IUD orsterilization, constructing the idea that itwas medical technology that created effective (here the meaning was transformed from the convenient) contraception. Atthe same time, the convenient contraceptives should comprise the dissociations from a couple's sexual acts because women knew they could not expect men's cooperation for contraception. Many women thought contraception aswomen's business, not counting on men's cooperation incontraception; since taking care ofthe family isthe housewife's role, using contraception for limiting family size and taking the family's welfare into consideration is awoman's maternal duty. Within themedico-political discourse over women's reproductive control, the women resorted toseveral reference points toexplain their social reality of rationalizing the size oftheir family and understanding their troubled reproductive bodies. Through selecting and reconstructing the contestation ofseveral institutional discourses (such asthe hegemony ofWestern medicine technology, their bio-cultural understanding ofwomen as areproductive agent, and Chinese medical discourse onthe individual specificity ofcheiil on contraceptive side-effects), the women transformed the medico-political discourse offamily planning into an 336Chapter 6.Concluding Remarks Modernization inKorea has transformed the physical structure ofKorean society and Korean people's experience ofeveryday life. Modernization (or development) has affected not only social and economic changes, but also, and perhaps more importantly, the transformation ofKorean people's way oflooking attheir reality. Ihave dealt with Korean modernization as adiscourse which both discursively and non-discursively has created the desires and images of the \"modern: \"This notion ofthe \"modern\" implied differences from the state ofthings, carrying the ideas ofrationalization, economization, newness and convenience, which are supposed tobelong to Western (economic) rationality and the Western notion ofthe \"scientific and technological.\" Korean women's way ofperforming their bodily practices has also been changed. The ideological andinstitutional imperatives ofbiopower practices put Korean women ina different space ofexperiential body politics, affecting women's relations tosocial institutions such asthe state, medicine and education, their in-law family, the authority ofmothers-in-law and the concept ofchildren and ofbodily normalcy. This dissertation isabout how the modern medico political powers have constituted Korean women's lives and 338constructed the modern subject offemale gender in \"modernizing\" Korean society. Since the modernization project was launched inKorea, there have been two grand discourses about the \"modern: \"one was economic development; the other was the modern power ofknowledge represented in science and technology, which were represented as biomedicine inpeople's everyday life experiences. Particularly, Korean women were appropriated for these modern discourses bythestate's medico-political policy of family planning, which combined astrategy ofeconomic development for population control and medical intervention for contraception. Inorder toexamine the way ofdeploying this biopower inKorean women's lives, Ihave discussed two groups ofwomen who were the product ofKorean modernization projects :one was agroup ofmiddle-class women who were the beneficiaries ofeconomic development and living inthe spatially standardized structure ofcollective housing, apartment complexes which were the product ofurbanization achieved through spatial \"modernization.\" The other group was working-class women who had been the labor backbone of economic development and were working-class wives whose lives were closely tied with factories. Ineveryday cultural practice inKorea, the discourse ofessentializing and homogenizing women through the specificity ofthe female body iscommonplace and frequently circulated. Inchapter 1,Ibegan toask how the idea of 339modernity (ormodernization) bred, redefined, and reconstituted the subject offemale gender, eroding the universalizing discourse offemale gender as areproductive body. Culturally, women's sex/gender relations are reduced tothe genital representation ofthe sexes. Korean cultural discourses defined women bythe corporeal, sensible, factual experiences ofreproductive bodies; therefore, women's bodies were perceived as\"natural\" evidence ofwomen's difference from men. InKorean culture, essentializing discourses about women were discursively and constantly practiced, forcing women toconduct themselves properly. The most frequent remarks such asyo'chaka (how come awoman. ...?) and yo'chanu' n(women ought to...)are 2,Idescribed the way inwhich the \"modern\" experience offemale gender was constructed among middle class women and the way inwhich their agency was constituted. The middle-class women were the subjects who were making the new middle-class \"apartment culture\" in which housewives were engineering and creating thelife style ofthe urban middle-class nuclear family. Their main intentionality was toreproduce the physical, social and cultural position oftheir family. The agency ofmiddle class women was deeply submerged within the family structure. Ialso showed that these women began tobe equipped with knowledge/power for taking care oftheir 340children and husbands \"correctly\". However, this female subject incontemporary Korea was \"restless,\" reflecting the contestations oftheir positions; they were caught upinthe traditional social relations as wives, mothers and daughters-in-law, but atthe same time, they pursued the new images ofmodern female gender. They wanted todefine urisikgu (our family) interms ofthe spatial and emotional boundary ofthe nuclear family, demarcated byanapartment unit, dissociated from their in law family, yetstill socio-economically and culturally related totheir in-law family. Atthe same time, inorder tobecompetent mothers and wives, women needed abody of knowledge (i.e.family health, psychology about children and husbands, and English) which would allow them tocarry out \"proper\" gender performances that the \"modernizing\" Korean society expected. Therefore, middle-class women pursued knowledge byparticipating inmany social institutions and reading popular books, but the modern power ofknowledge as adiscourse operated tocreate endless desires by discrediting their experiential and lay knowledge, and by making them rely increasingly onprofessional and institutional knowledge. However, the ultimate boundary offemale gender was confined bytheir physicality, namely their reproductive capacity. Women's reproductive capacity explained the essential and \"natural\" difference between men and women and 341made sense ofwomen's experiences ofmarriage, pregnancy, and motherhood. ofwomen's lives was understood asthe almost instinctual practices of the female sex based onwomen's biological unity. Therefore, the differences among women were continuously denied, reducing all women's life experiences tothese practices. Differences between women were understood asmerely the function ofhusbands' differences. Inthis context, this idea of\"sameness,\" provided the source ofconflicts, frustrations and uncertainties among women because women's differences were beyond their control. Chapter 3showed the ways inwhich women's experience oftheir reproductive bodies were incorporated into the most dominant modern power, the medical institution, and how these middle-class women became asubject ofmedical control. The middle-class women's status ofadulthood was achieved through marriage, and thepractice ofsexuality and reproduction were merged together into the social practice ofmarriage. Married women's bodies related directly to pregnancies and became asubject ofthe Western medical regime. Idiscussed how the cultural control ofwomen's sexuality and reproduction led married women todepend upon Western medicine. When the cultural hegemony ofWestern medicine took over women's pregnant bodies, the medical power of\"scientific\" knowledge eroded mothers-in-law's 342authority over daughters-in-law's pregnancies and medicalized women's maternal agency \"normal\" and \"healthy\" babies. Western medicine was notjust ahealing technology for women's bodies inpregnancy but also the reference point for looking atwomen's bodies ina\"modern,\" \"normal,\" \"correct\" way. Atthe same time, the masculinized profession ofmedicine took cultural control over women's reproductive bodies and contributed toinscribing women's reproductive experience, especially during pregnancy and childbirth, into something \"natural\" and \"truthful,\" i.e. of belonging exclusively tothe female sex/gender. Through the process ofmodernization, differentiated socio-economic classes were formed and people ineach class began tolive different experiences ofeveryday life. In chapter 4,Idescribed how the working-class women's way of experiencing modernization and the way ofpracticing their agency and subjectivity were differently constituted from that ofmiddle-class women's .Working-class women were related tomodernization through the productive function of their bodies atfactories --asthe female warriors ofthe industrial front. However, the \"normal\" orculturally \"proper\" position of awoman's body was not inthe productive function, but rather inthe physical and social reproductive function offamily. Therefore, marriage itself meant akind ofupward social mobility for unmarried female factory workers. Through marriage, their body changed its 343function from production toreproduction. Most working-class mothers achieved this married women's status through donggo (co-habitation) and giving birth tochildren. Incontrast to middle-class women's way ofgetting agency through marriage, education, and medical care, these working-class mothers practiced individuality inachieving their agency. Therefore, they entered donggo as akind ofagency to achieve the status offemale adulthood without family intervention; their relations with the in-law family were less obligated and instead ofusing institutional channels tosolve problems, they mobilized social relations, such as neighborhood networks asmain channels for resource mobilization. Infact, their class position did not allow them to register the effects oftheinstitutional powers that the modernizing Korean society demanded ofwomen as a \"desirable\" subject. Therefore, they began todiverge from the normative representation (ofbeing aproperly gendered female) which was characterized bymiddle-class women. This was the reason why they became \"restless\" inperforming their female gender role incontemporary Korean society: They were worrying that they might not begood and capable mothers because they were working tomake supplementary money for their families infactories rather than staying at home as amanager. Inaddition, they feared that they could not take care oftheir children orbear smart babies because 344they lacked the eduction which made women practice proper gender performances incontemporary Korea. They also lacked the money required tobuy \"good\" items for children that the Korean commercial market provided. The focus ofchapter 5centered onwhether ornot the intervention ofthe cultural idea ofwomen's \"sameness\" based onthe biological unity ofreproductive capacity. I had expected that the family planning policy had helped constitute abirth control discourse which sapped the strength ofthe prevailing phallocentric discourse that served touniversalize and homogenize all women. Chapter 5 discussed about how thestate's practices offamily planning policy deployed its power inorder tocontrol women's reproductive capacity and then how women \"played\" gender politics byusing contraception. Idescribed that the family planning discourse transformed women's fertility into economic sense and integrated itinto thecritical part ofthe modernization project. Korean women willingly accepted family planning practices andarticulated the economic rationality totheir bodies inorder toimprove the quality offamily life. The Korean family planning policy strongly deployed the new modern concept ofwives and mothers asplanners and managers for the establishment ofanefficient, small nuclear family. Thus, thepolitical discourse offamily planning worked as\u00ba $\u00ba- o 345the chief agent for promoting agender ideology that created women as amodern manager ofthe middle-class family. Family planning was effective inallowing women tobear fewer children and inreducing the economic burden of raising many children. However, itdid not work todismantle the cultural discourse offemale gender whose agency was bound bythe family, and was played out intheir role as wives and mothers. Thus, women transcended the biological burden ofreproduction through birth control methods, but socially andpolitically, women did not transcend their traditional role asreproducer ofthe family. Thus, Korean women's practices ofmodernity in reproductive control was mainly experienced byhaving fewer children for the family. The effects ofthestate's bio power practices (i.e. themedico-political policy offamily planning) resulted intherationalization ofthe family in aneconomic sense. The lived experience ofwomen's bodies wasstill seen asuniversalizing and homogenizing women's experiences. Therefore, the discourse ofmodernity and the control over women's biological condition ofreproduction did not transcend women's experience oftheir agency embedded inthe role ofwives and mothers, although their way ofperforming gender subjectivity was differently constituted according tothe class backgrounds ofthe women. Women's \"proper\" position wasstill inthe family. The middle-class women's narratives showed that the women's 346bodies were not represented socially asanindividual body, but rather asafamily body. However, both mymiddle-class and working-class informants described them aswives and mothers who were ridden with conflict and restlessness in modern urban Korea in1990. The practice ofmodern female gender was anintegral component ofthe exercise ofmodern knowledge/power. The women mentioned education asthe most critical capital for their performance ofmodern female gender. Onthe other hand, medicine was the most critical referential knowledge/power through which women would understand the normalcy oftheir bodies inthe maintenance and reproduction oftheir everyday life. Men's bodies were also represented as afamily body, but not tothe same extent. The modern idea ofeconomic productivity was articulated tomen's bodies and ittransformed the reproductive virility ofthe male body tocapability to work, thereby transcending their biology. The idea ofmen's bodies was also differently perceived according tohow their bodies were articulated with thepolitical economy oftheir class position. Thevirility ofworking-class men's bodies were transformed into productive capacity for labor because working-class men's physical bodies were thecritical capital for survival: Working-class husbands were more reluctant topractice vasectomy, fearing itmight hurt their health/labor capacity. Onthe other men who chose vasectomies wanted tojust limit thesocio 347economic burden that raising children represented. Throughout this dissertation, Ihave tried tomake women's experience ofthe \"modern\" visible byrevealing how theinstitutional powers shaped female gender asthe subject. Ialso described how the construction ofmiddle class and working-class women's agency was shaped bytheir class experiences and how these differences were revealed. Atthe same time, Itried toshow how the cultural discourses about \"sameness\" among women operated tomask the differentiation ofwomen's social positions. Both mymiddle-class and working-class women informants understood their identity asthe real and factual through their bodily experiences ofchildbearing and childbirth. This was the way inwhich the material basis ofthe female lived-experience was produced, the way inwhich women's agency was made possible, and the way inwhich medical hegemony over women's reproductive care was normalized. At the same time, this was the way that women's reproductive experience remained central above all other social relations ofpower, even class. 3.48Bibliography Abramovitz, Mimi 1988 Regulating The Lives ofWomen :Social Welfare Policy From Colonial Times ToThe Present.
