Pieces must not be subjected to extreme changes in temperature. Plates and serving dishes can be warmed before use in an oven at a temperature of no more than 100\u00baC. Pieces must not be placed directly on a hot stove element or flame. Tableware with a gold or platinum trim must not be used in a microwave. Fine bone china should not be used for cooking purposes. Always warm a teapot or coffeepot first by filling it with hot tap water prior to pouring in boiling water. Avoid standing on cold surfaces such as stainless steel sinks. Casual' tableware pieces taken from a freezer or refrigerator must be allowed to return to room temperature before being placed in an oven. Washing When washing by hand avoid the use of scouring pads or abrasive cleansers. Clean with a soft cloth. Most stains can be removed by soaking the item in warm water before washing. Very stubborn stains can be removed by soaking in a mild bleach solution for up to one hour. When leaving a teapot or coffee pot to dry, always stand the right way up. Metal marks, caused by minute deposits of metal from cutlery, can be removed with a silverware cleaner. All your china can be washed in a dishwasher at a maximum temperature of 65\u00baC using a recommended dishwasher detergent. Recommended dishwasher detergents are Finish Powerball All in 1 and Cussons Morning Fresh Complete Tabs. Storing When storing plates, try not to slide them over one another as this may cause scratches on the glaze. The surface of tableware is hard, however, the front of one plate can be scratched by the back of another so care should be taken when stacking and we recommend a paper napkin is placed between each plate. Cups should not be stacked when stored as this may weaken the handles. Caring for Crystal Care should be taken to avoid bumping glasses together when carrying or washing up. It is best to keep crystal out of the dishwasher or it may become cloudy. Wash by hand in a warm soapy water, avoiding the use of scouring pads or abrasive washing agents. Dry with a clean, soft cloth. No good glass should be immersed suddenly in very hot water or very cold water or have very hot or cold liquids poured into them. Store your crystal carefully, standing the right way up and not on the rims of the glasses. Red wine often causes stains on decanters. These can usually be removed by putting a spoonful of rice or tea leaves into the decanter with detergent and warm water and swilling around gently. Stoppers for Royal Doulton decanters are made specifically for each decanter. However, if the stopper becomes stuck, the neck of the decanter should be warmed by wrapping in a hot, wet cloth and then gently pulling on the stopper. Caring for Cutlery Royal Doulton cutlery is made from 18/10 stainless steel, which is a high-quality, long-lasting metal. It is stain and acid resistant, but it is not totally stain-proof. The cutlery can be damaged if care is not taken to protect it from everyday corrosive elements.There are a few simple recommendations to keep your new cutlery looking its best: Clean and dry your cutlery as soon as possible after use. Do not leave it in water to soak, or let it stand in the dishwasher overnight after running a rinse programme. Mineral salts found in water can attack the metal and cause unsightly stains. In the humid atmosphere of a dishwasher, mineral salts can dry onto cutlery and will start the process that leads to corrosion. Do not leave food adhering to the cutlery for long periods prior to cleaning. Acids found in food residue are surprisingly corrosive, and if left in contact for long periods will attack the metal and cause pits and stains. Do not use any abrasive cleaners to remove food residue. Scouring with an abrasive pad will leave tiny scratches in the surface of the metal, which will reduce the shine. If the cutlery is washed promptly after use it is not necessary to use either abrasive detergents or pads to get your cutlery clean. Do not use your Royal Doulton cutlery as cooking implements. High direct heat can damage the surface of the metal leaving discoloured marks. Do not baste meat with eating cutlery, or rest pieces on a hot surface such as a hob. If washing in a dishwasher, we advise that you take the pieces out as soon as the cycle is finished and wipe them dry with a soft cloth before putting away. Dishwasher salt residue that is present in the humid atmosphere of a dishwasher can dry onto the pieces and cause watermarks and stains. Wiping the pieces when they are warm removes this fine corrosive residue. If minor watermarks and stains appear on your cutlery from time to time, you can polish them off with a proprietary stainless steel cleaner. Ensure you follow the manufacturer's instructions. NEVER use a silver cleaner to polish stainless steel cutlery. Silver polishes are not suitable for stainless steel, and will damage the metal. Silver Plated Products For general cleaning, silver plated items should be wiped gently with a clean soft cloth without detergent or chemicals. Solvents such as enamel remover or thinner, abrasives, harsh scourers, wire wool or hard scrubbing brushes should not be used on silver plated products at any time as they will damage the surface. Silver plated product may get discoloured over time, please polish with a silver cleaner or a polish specially formulated for cleaning silver. Silver items should not be stored in direct contact with leather or rubber, such as elastic bands. "}
