They, however, are prone to over 5000 mutations on the spike (S) protein uncovered by a Mutation Tracker based on over 200 000 genome isolates. It is imperative to understand how mutations will impact vaccines andantibodies in development. In this work, we rst study the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the S protein which is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies.Additionally, we build a library of 56 antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics.Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of Sprotein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraictopology, we reveal that most of the 462 mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) will weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies and disrupt the e cacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines. A list of 31 antibody disrupting mutants is identi ed, while many other disruptive mutations are detailed as well. We also unveil that about 65% of the existing RBD mutations, including those variantsrecently found in the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa, will strengthen the binding between the Sprotein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in more infectious COVID-19variants. We discover the disparity between the extreme values of RBD mutation-induced BFEstrengthening and weakening of the bindings with antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is at an advanced stage of evolution for human infection, while the human immune system is able to produce optimized antibodies. This discovery, unfortunately, implies the vulnerability of current vaccines and antibody drugs to new mutations. Our predictions werevalidated by comparison with more than 1400 deep mutations on the S protein RBD. Our results showthe urgent need to develop new mutation-resistant vaccines and antibodies and to prepare for seasonalvaccinations. 1 Introduction The expeditious spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 932 739 con rmed cases and 2 054 853 fatalities as of January 20, 2021. In the 21stcentury, three major outbreaks of deadly pneumonia have beencaused by b-coronaviruses: SARS-CoV (2002), Middle East respiratory syndrome 1Similar to SARS-CoV and CoV-2 causes respiratory infections, and the transmission ofviruses occurs among family members or in healthcare settingsat the early stages of the outbreak. However, SARS-CoV-2 has an unprecedented scale of infection. Considering the high infec- tion rate, high prevalence rate, long incubation period, 2 asymptomatic transmission,3,4and potential seasonal pattern5 of COVID-19, the development of speci c antiviral drugs, anti- body therapies, and e ective vaccines is of paramount impor- tance. Traditional drug discovery takes more than ten years, onaverage, to bring a new drug to the market. 6However, devel- oping potent SARS-CoV-2 speci c antibodies and vaccines is a relatively more e cient and less time-consuming strategy to combat COVID-19 for the ongoing pandemic.7Antibody thera- pies and vaccines depend on the host immune system. Recently,studies have been working on the host -pathogen interaction, host immune responses, and the pathogen immune evasionstrategies, 8-13which provide insight into understanding the mechanism of antibody therapies and vaccine development.aDepartment of Mathematics, Michigan State University, MI 48824, USA.

View Article Online View Journal | View IssueThe immune system is a host defense system that protects the host from pathogenic microbes, eliminates toxic or aller- genic substances, and responds to an invading pathogen.14It has the innate immune system and adaptive immune system astwo major subsystems. The innate system provides an imme-diate but non-speci c response, while the adaptive immune system provides a highly speci c and e ective immune response. Once the pathogen breaches the rst physical barriers, such as the epithelial cell layers, secreted mucus layer, and mucous membranes, the innate system will be triggered to identify pathogens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs),which is expressed on then activatecomplex signaling pathways that introduce in ammatory responses mediated by various cytokines and chemokines,which promote the eradication of the pathogen. 16,17Notably, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 even occurs in asymptomatic infected individuals, which may delay the early response of theinnate immune response. 8Another important line of host defense is the adaptive immune system. B lymphocytes (B cells)and T lymphocytes (T cells) are special types of leukocyte thatare the acknowledged cellular pillars of the adaptive immunesystem. 18Two major subtypes of T cells are involved in the cell- mediated immune response: killer T cells (CD8+ T cells) and helper T cells (CD4+ cells). The killer T cells eradicate cells invaded by pathogens with the help of major histocompatibilitycomplex (MHC) class I. MHC class I molecules are expressed onthe surface of all nucleated cells. 19The nucleated cells will rstly degrade foreign proteins viaantigen processing when viruses infect them. Then, the peptide fragments will be presented byMHC class I, which will activate killer T cells to eliminate theseinfected cells by releasing cytotoxins. 20Similarly, helper T cells cooperate with MHC class II, a type of MHC molecule that is constitutively expressed on antigen-presenting cells, such asmacrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells. 21Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) to recognize antigen boundto MHC class II molecules. However, helper T cells do not havecytotoxic activity. Therefore, they cannot kill infected cellsdirectly. Instead, the activated helper T cells will release cyto-kines to enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. 22Notably, an unbalanced response can result in a \"cytokine storm, \"which is the main cause of the fatality of COVID-19 patients.23Correspondingly, a B cell gets involved in the humoral immune response and identi es pathogens by binding to foreign antigens with its B cell recep-tors (BCRs) located on its surface. The antigens that are recog-nized by antibodies will be degraded to peptides in B cells anddisplayed by MHC class II molecules. As mentioned above, helper T cells can recognize the signal provided by MHC class II and upregulate the expression of the CD40 ligand, whichprovides extra stimulation signals to activate antibody-producing B cells, 24making millions of copies of antibodies (Ab) that recognize the speci c antigen. Additionally, when the antigen rst enters the body, the T cells and B cells will be activated, and some of them will be di erentiated to long-lived memory cells, such as memory T cells and memory B cells.These long-lived memory cells will play a role in quickly and specically recognizing and eliminating a speci c antigen that encountered the host and initiated a corresponding immuneresponse in the future. 25The vaccination mechanism is to stimulate the primary immune response of the human body,which will activate T cells and B cells to generate the antibodiesand long-lived memory cells that prevent infectious diseases,which is one of the most e ective and economical means of combating COVID-19 at this stage. As mentioned above, secreted by B cells of the adaptive immune system, antibodies can recognize and bind to speci c antigens. Conventional antibodies (immunoglobulins) are Y-shaped molecules that have two light chains and two heavychains. 26Each light chain is connected to the heavy chain via a disul de bond, and heavy chains are connected through two disulde bonds in the mid-region known as the hinge region. Each light and heavy chain contains two distinct regions: the constant region (stem of the Y) and variable region ( \"arms \"of the Y).27An antibody binds the antigenic determinant (also called epitope) through the variable regions in the tips of theheavy and light chains. There is an enormous amount ofdiversity in the variable regions. Therefore, di erent antibodies can recognize many di erent types of antigenic epitope. To be specic, there are three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that are arranged non-consecutively in the tips of each variable region. CDRs generate most of the variations between antibodies, which determine the speci city of individual anti- bodies. In addition to conventional antibodies, camelids alsoproduce (HCAbs). HCAbs, contain a single variabledomain (VHH) that makes up the equivalent antigen-bindingfragment (Fab) of conventional immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-bodies. 28This single variable domain can typically acquire anity and speci city for antigens comparable to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies can easily be constructed into multi-valent formats and have higher thermal stability and chemo-stability than most antibodies do. 29Another advantage of nanobodies is that they are less susceptible to steric hindrancesthan large conventional antibodies. 30 Considering the broad speci city of antibodies, seeking potential antibody therapies has become one of the most feasible strategies to ght against SARS-CoV-2. In general, an antibody therapy is a form of immunotherapy that usesmonoclonal antibodies (mAb) to target pathogenic proteins.The binding of an antibody and pathogenic antigen can facili-tate an immune response, direct neutralization, radioactivetreatment, the release of toxic agents, and cytokine storminhibition (aka immune checkpoint therapy). The SARS-CoV-2entry into a human cell is facilitated by the process of a series of interactions between its spike (S) protein and the host receptor angiotensin-converting therapeutic developments focus onthe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies that were initiallygenerated from the patient immune response and T-cellpathway inhibitors that block T-cell responses. A largenumber of antibody therapeutic drugs are in clinical trials. 6930 |Chem. Sci. ,2 0 2 1 , 12,6 9 2 9 -6948 \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

View Article OnlineFiy-ve S protein antibody structures are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), o ering a great resource for mecha- nistic analysis and biophysical studies. Currently, most of the antibody therapy developments focus on the use of antibodies isolated from patients' convalescentplasma to directly neutralize SARS-CoV-2, 32-34although there are eorts to alleviate the cytokine storm. A more e ective and economical means to ght against SARS-CoV-2 is the vaccine,35 which is the most anticipated approach for preventing the COVID-19 pandemic. A vaccine is designed to stimulate e ec- tive host immune responses and provide active acquiredimmunity by exploiting the body's immune system, includingthe production of antibodies, and is made of an antigenic agentthat resembles a disease-causing microorganism, or surfaceprotein, or genetic material that is needed to generate thesurface protein. For SARS-CoV-2, the rst choice of surface proteins is the spike protein. There are four types of COVID-19 vaccine, as shown in Fig. 1. (1) Virus vaccines use the virus itself in a weakened or inactivated form. (2) Viral-vector vaccines aredesigned to genetically engineer a weakened virus, such asmeasles or adenovirus, to produce coronavirus S proteins in thebody. Both replicating and non-replicating viral-vector vaccinesare being studied now. (3) Nucleic-acid vaccines use DNA ormRNA to produce SARS-CoV-2 S proteins inside host cells tostimulate the immune response. (4) Protein-based vaccines are designed to directly inject coronavirus proteins, such as S protein or membrane (M) protein, or their fragments, into thebody. Both protein subunits and viral-like particles (VLPs) areunder development for COVID-19. 36Among these technologies, nucleic-acid vaccines are safe and relatively easy to develop.36 However, they have not been approved for any human usebefore. However, the general population's safety concerns are the major factors that hinder the rapid approval of vaccines and antibody therapies. A major potential challenge is an antibody-dependent enhancement, in which the binding of a virus tosuboptimal antibodies enhances its entry into host cells. Allvaccine and antibody therapeutic developments are currentlybased on the reference viral genome reported on January 5,2020. 37SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family and the Nidovirales order, which has been shown to have a genetic proofreading mechanism regulated by non-structure protein 14 (NSP14) in synergy with NSP12, i.e., poly- merase (RdRp).38,39Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher delity in its transcription and replication process than other single-stranded RNA viruses, such as the u virus and HIV. However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been undergoing many muta-tions, as reported in ref. 40 and 41. As of January 20, 2021,a total of 5003 unique mutations on the S protein have been detected on 203 346 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. Among them, 462 mutations were on the receptor-bindingdomain (RBD), the most popular target for antibodies andvaccines. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to establisha reliable paradigm to predict and mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on vaccines and antibody therapies. Moreover,the ecacy of a given COVID-19 vaccine depends on many factors, including the SARS-CoV-2 biological propertiesassociated with the vaccine, mutation impacts, vaccination schedule (dose and frequency), idiosyncratic response, and assorted factors such as ethnicity, age, gender, and geneticpredisposition. The e ect of COVID-19 vaccination also depends on the fraction of the population that accepts vaccines.It is essentially unknown at this moment how these factors willunfold for COVID-19 vaccines. There is no doubt that any preparation that leads to an improvement in the COVID-19 vaccination e ect will be of tremendous signi cance to human health and the world economy. Therefore, in this work, we integrate genetic analysisand computational biophysics, including arti cial intelligence (AI), as well as additional enhancement from advanced math-ematics to predict and mitigate mutation threats to COVID-19vaccines and antibody therapies. We perform single nucleo-tide polymorphism (SNP) calling 41to identify SARS-CoV-2 mutations. For mutations on the S protein, we analyze their mechanism,42frequency, ratio, and secondary structural traits. We construct a library of 56 existing antibody structures byJanuary 1, 2021 from the PDB and analyze their two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) characteristics.We further predict the mutation-induced binding free energy(BFE) changes of antibody and S protein complexes usinga topology-based network tree (TopNetTree), 43which is a state- of-the-art model that integrates deep learning and algebraic topology.44-46In this work, TopNetTree is trained with newly available deep mutation datasets on the S protein, ACE2, andsome antibodies and its predictions are validated with thou-sands of experimental data points. Our studies indicate thatmost mutations will signi cantly disrupt the binding of essen- tially all known antibodies to the S protein. Therefore, vaccinesand antibody drugs that were developed based on the earlySARS-CoV-2 genome will be seriously compromised by muta- tions. Additionally, we show that most known mutations will strengthen the binding between the S protein and ACE2, whichgives rise to more infectious variants. Our studies also revealthat SARS-CoV-2 is at an advanced stage of evolution withrespect to its ability to infect humans. Although the humanimmune system is able to produce antibodies that are opti-mized with respect to a pathogen, the antibodies, onceproduced, are very vulnerable to attack by mutants. 2 Mutations on the spike protein As a fundamental biological process, mutagenesis changes the organism's genetic information and serves as a primary source for many kinds of cancer and heritable diseases, which isa driving force for evolution. 47,48Generally speaking, virus mutations are introduced by natural selection, replicationmechanism, cellular environment, polymerase delity, gene editing, random genetic dri , recent epidemiological features, host immune responses, etc. 49,50Notably, understanding how mutations have changed the SARS-CoV-2 structure, function, infectivity, activity, and virulence is of great importance for coming up with life-saving strategies in virus control, contain-ment, prevention, and medication, especially in the develop-ment of antibodies and vaccines.

A reader can download the detailed mutation SNP information from ourMutation Tracker website. As mentioned before, the S protein has become the rst choice for antibody and vaccine development. Among the 203 346 complete genome sequences, 5003 unique singlemutations are detected on the S protein. The number of uniquemutations ( N U) is determined by counting the same type of mutation in di erent genome isolates only once, while the number of non-unique mutations ( NNU,i.e., frequency) is calculated by counting the same type of mutation in di erent genome isolates repeatedly. Table 1 lists the distribution of 12 SNP types among unique and non-unique mutations on the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. It can be seen that C > T and A> G are the two dominant SNP types, which may be due to theinnate host immune response viaAPOBEC and ADAR gene editing. 42 Moreover, 144 non-degenerate mutations occurred on the S protein RBD, which are relevant to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein and most antibodies as well as ACE2. Additionally, the218 mutations that occurred on the S protein N-terminal domain (NTD) (residue id: 14 to 226) are relevant to the binding of another two antibodies (4A8 and FC05) and SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein. Furthermore, since antibody CDRs are random coils, the complementary antigen-binding domains must involve randomcoils as well. Table 2 lists the statistics of non-degeneratemutations on the secondary structures of SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein. Here, the secondary structures are mostly extracted from the crystal structure of 7C2L, 52and the missing residues are predicted by RaptorX-Property.53We can see that for both unique and non-unique cases, the average mutation rates onthe random coils of the S protein have the highest values.Particularly, the 23 403 A > G-(D614G) mutation on the randomcoils has the highest frequency of 192 284. If we do not considerthe 23 403 A > G-(D614G) mutations, then the unique and non-unique average rates on the random coils of S protein still have the highest values (2.81 and 212.01), indicating that mutations are more likely to occur on the random coils. Consequently, thenatural selection of mutations may tend to disrupt antibodies. 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibodies In this work, we consider 56 3D structures available from the PDB(https://www.rcsb.org) before Jan uary 1, 2021. These 56 structures include 51 structures of antibo dies binding to S protein RBD, 4 structures of antibodies having binding domains outside the Sprotein RBD, and an ACE2-S protein complex. Among the fourstructures having binding domains outside the RBD, there arethree distinct antibodies not binding to the RBD, namely 4A8, 52 FC05,54and 2G12.55This is because FC05 has two sets of structures (PBD IDs 7CWU and 7CWS) that di er from each other by their components on the RBD ( i.e.,H 0 1 4a n dP 1 7 ) .S o m ea n t i b o d i e sa r e given as combinations of other unique ones. Among the 51 anti-bodies on the RBD, there are only 42 unique ones, including MR17-K99Y as a mutant of MR17. 56 3.1 3D antibody structure alignment on the S protein We present the 3D alignment of 45 structures of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with ACE2 and antibodies (excluding the mutant MR17-K99Y of MR17) in Fig. 3.

Notably, theparatopes of H014 (ref. 69) and S304 (ref. 60) do not overlap withthat of ACE2 directly, but in terms of 3D structures, theirbinding sites still overlap. This suggests that the bindings of 39 antibodies are in direct competition with that of ACE2. Theo- retically, this direct competition reduces the viral infection rate.Such antibodies with strong binding ability will directlyneutralize SARS-CoV-2 without the need for antibody-Table 1 The distribution of 12 SNP types among 5003 unique muta- tions and 467 604 non-unique mutations on the S gene of SARS-CoV- 2 worldwide.

It is speculated that 4A8 may neutralize SARS-CoV- 2 by restraining the conformational changes of the S protein,which is very important for the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. 52FC05 is combined with P17 or H014 to form a cocktail.542G12 binds to the S protein S2 domain.55Any antibody or drug that can inhibit the serine protease TMPRSS2 priming of the S protein priming caneectively stop the viral cell entry. 31 3.2 2D residue contacts between antibodies and the S protein RBD Fig. 3 provides a visual illustration of antibody and ACE2 competitions.

To better understand the antibody and S protein interactions, we study the residue contacts between antibodies and the S protein. We include theACE2 as a reference but excluding antibodies MR17-K99Y aswell as 4A8, FC05, and 2G12 that bind to other domains. In Fig. 4, the paratopes of 42 individual antibodies (excluding MR17-K99Y) and ACE2 were aligned on the S proteinRBD 2D sequence, and their contact regions are highlighted.From the gure, one can see that, except for Fab 52, S309, CR3022, EY6A, H014, and S304, all the other 36 have their antigenic epitopes overlapping with the ACE2, especiallyon the residues from 486 to 505 of the RBD. Although the par-atopes of H014 and S304 do not overlap with that of ACE2directly, their binding sites still overlap in 3D structures.Therefore, these 38 antibodies competitively bind against ACE2as revealed in Fig. 3. 3.3 Antibody sequence alignment and similarity analysis The next question is whether there is any connection or similarity between the antibody paratopes in our library, particularly for those antibodies that share the same binding sites. To better understand this perspective, we carry out multiple sequencealignment (MSA) to further study the similarities and di erences among existing antibodies. Many antibodies are very similar toeach other and can be classi ed into several clusters using the CD- HIT suite. 82Therst and largest and COVA2-39, and the pairwiseidentity score is 90.18%. The fourth cluster is composed of H11-H4, H11-D4, and Nb, and their identity scores to Nb are 99.25%and 95.52%, respectively. They are all nanobodies. The h cluster has Fab 298 and COVA1-16, and the pairwise identity score is 90.80%. Their alignment plots are given in the ESI (Fig. S1 -S5). The above similarity indicates that the adaptive immune systems of individuals have a common way to generate anti-bodies. On the other hand, the existence of ve distinct clusters, as well as antibodies 4A8, FC05, and 2G12 suggests the diversityin the immune response. Note that we have also included ACE2 in our MSA as a reference, but none of the existing antibodies are similar to ACE2 because they were created from entirelydierent mechanisms. 4 Mutation impacts on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies To investigate the in uences of existing S protein mutations on the binding free energy (BFE) of S protein and antibodies, weconsider 462 mutations that occurred on the S protein RBD,which are relevant to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein andantibodies as well as ACE2. Additionally, 540 mutations occurredon the NTD of the S protein (residue id: 14 to 226) which arerelevant to the binding of SARS-COV-2 S protein and antibody4A8 (PDB: 7C2L). We predict the free energy changes following existing mutations using our TopNetTree model. 43The mutations on the RBD are considered for the predictions of BFE changes.Our predictions are built from the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and sd e ned as the subtraction of the BFE of the mutant type from the of thewild type: DDG\u00bcDG W/C0DGM, where DGWis the wild type and DGMis the BFE of the mutant. Therefore, a negative BFE change means that the mutation decreases a nities, making the protein -protein interaction less stable. Four antibody -S protein complexes are examined in this section. Next, we present a library of mutation-induced BFEchanges for all mutations and 51 antibodies, as well as ACE2.The statistical analysis of mutation impacts on antibodies isdiscussed. 4.1 Single antibody -S protein complex analysis For four antibody -S protein complexes, since there are too many mutations, we only consider those mutations whose Fig. 5 Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 mutation-induced binding free energy changes for the complexes of S protein and 4A8 (PDB: 7C2L). The blue color in the structure plot indicates a positive BFE change while the red color indicates a negative BFE change, and toning indicates the strength.Here, mutations R102I, W152C, W152L, S247N, and Y248H could potentially disrupt the binding of antibody 4A8 and S protein. 6936 |Chem.

We rst present the BFE changes ( DDG) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding domain with antibody 4A8 in Fig. 5, which is one of the three complexesthat are not on the RBD in our collections of S protein andantibody complexes. A total 141 of 540 mutations on residue IDfrom 14 to 226 have frequencies larger than 10. Most mutationshave small BFE changes (from /C00.5 kcal mol /C01to 0.5 their energies, while 28 muta- tions have negative BFE changes less than /C00.5 kcal mol/C01. Notably, 53 out of 141 mutations on the binding domain have positive BFE changes, which means that the mutations increaseanities and would make the S protein -4A8 interactions more stable. However, the majority (63%) of mutations have negativeBFE changes, including high-frequency mutations R102I andW152C with frequencies of 89 and 356, respectively. Since thelargest positive and negative BFE changes are 0.37 and/C02.06 kcal mol /C01(/C03.1 if low frequency mutations are coun- ted), respectively, the prediction indicates that antibody 4A8 isolated from 10 convalescent patients at the early stage of thepandemic 52is an optimized product of the human immune system with respect to the original S protein. It is also noted thatmany mutations on the binding domain, such as W152L,S247N, and Y248H, have signi cant negative free energy changes. The mutations on the binding domain with largenegative BFE changes reveal that the binding of antibody 4A8 and S protein will be potentially disrupted. Next, we study the BFE changes ( DDG) induced by 80 muta- tions on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD for the antibody Fab 2-4(PDB: 6XEY) in Fig. 6. Antibody Fab 2-4 shares a similar bindingdomain with ACE2 and thus is a potential candidate for thedirect neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Most mutations inducesmall changes in the binding free energies, while mutationsE484K, E484Q, F486L, and F490S have large negative BFE changes. Overall, 38 out of 80 mutations on the RBD lead to negative BFE changes, which means 48% of mutations willpotentially weaken the binding between antibody Fab 2-4 and Sprotein. For positive BFE changes, the largest value is only0.55 kcal mol /C01and the average of positive BFE changes is 0.16 kcal mol/C01. However, many mutations with negative BFE changes have a very large magnitude, indicating that antibodyFab 2-4 was an immune product optimized with respect to the original un-mutated S protein. In general, the mutations on S protein weaken the Fab 2-4 binding with S protein and make itless competitive with ACE2 as most mutations strengthen the Sprotein and ACE2 binding. It is interesting to note that muta-tion E484K is the so-called South Africa variant. It indeed hasa strong vaccine-escape e ect. In Fig. 7, we illustrate the mutation-induced BFE changes for antibody MR17 (PDB: 7C8W), which shares the binding domain Fig. 7 Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 mutation-induced binding free energy changes for the complexes of S protein and MR17 (PDB: 7C8W).

The rest of the mutations have a small magnitude of changes. 27 out of 80mutations have positive BFE changes with the largest value lessthan 0.25 kcal mol /C01. Our results indicate that antibody MR37 is likely to be isolated from patients at the early stage and thus, itwas optimized based on an early version of the SARS-CoV-2virus. Mutations L452R, E484K, F486L, F490S, and S494L willreduce its with ACE2 (Fig. 7). Finally, we consider the BFE change predictions for the antibody S309 and S protein complex, whose receptor bindingmotif (RBM) does not overlap with the RBM of ACE2 (seeFig. 3(e)). The BFE changes induced by 80 mutations are pre- dicted. Among them, 38 changes are positive. Similar to the aforementioned antibodies, most of the mutations lead to small changes in their binding a nity magnitude but three muta- tions, E340A, N354D, and K356R, induce moderate negativechanges. Interestingly, none of the 80 RBD mutations havea major impact on S309. Although mutation R403K mightdisrupt S309, it does weaken many other antibody bindingswith the S protein. While antibodies play a variety of functionsin the human immune system, such as neutralization of infec- tion, phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, etc., their binding with antigens is crucial for these functions.

Inprinciple, we could create a library of all possible mutations forall antibodies, as we did for ACE2. 84Here, we limit our e ort to all existing mutations. Antibody 4A8 on the NTD has been dis-cussed above. We consider antibodies on the RBD. Based on our earlier analysis, three types of SARS-CoV-2 S protein secondary structural residue have di erent mutation rates. Among them, the random coils are major components ofthe RDB and the NTD, as shown in Fig. 3. Most RBD mutations(287 of 462) occur on the residues whose secondary structuresare coil, while 93 out of 462 mutations are on the helix, and 82out of 462 mutations are on the sheet. Therefore, mutations onthe RBD are split into three categories based on their locationsin secondary structures of helix, sheet, and coil. In Fig. 9, we present the BFE changes for the complexes of the S protein and antibodies or ACE2 induced by mutations on the helix residuesof the S protein RBD. The frequency for each mutation is alsopresented. Most mutations on helix residues lead to negativeBFE changes (pink squares), which weaken the bindings, whilesome mutations induce positive BFE changes (green squares). Itis noted that most mutations lead to the strengthening of the S protein and ACE2 binding, which is consistent with the natural selection rule. Mutations N406G, I418N, N422K, D442H, Y505S,and Y505C give rise to a strong weakening e ect on most anti- bodies. The N439K mutation having the highest frequency,shows a positive BFE change on ACE2 but negative changes onmost antibodies. Mutation D405Y appears to strengthen mostantibodies. In Fig. 10, we present the BFE changes for the S protein and antibody (ACE2) complexes following sheet residue mutations of the S protein RBD. Like the last case, most mutations lead topositive BFE changes for ACE2, indicating infectivity strength-ening. There weaken most antibody and Sprotein complexes. On the other hand, most mutationsstrengthen certain antibodies but weaken other ones, which allows the e ectiveness of antibody cocktails for better protec- tion. The binding of antibody H014 and the S protein isstrengthened by many mutations, particularly S375F, K378O,R403K, and Y453F. Among them, Y453F is an infectivity-strengthening mutation with a relatively high frequency. Fig. 11 -13 present the BFE changes for the S protein and antibody (ACE2) complexes following coil residue mutations ofthe S protein RBD. Overall, most mutations on coil residues lead to mild negative BFE sheet-residue mutation induced BFE changes for the complexes of S protein and 51 antibodies or ACE2. Positive changes strengthen the binding while negative changes weaken the binding. Mutation frequency is presented for each mutation.

Some residues, like A348, N460, and P521, can produce many binding-strengthening mutations for anti-bodies and ACE2. For the high-frequency mutation S447N inFig. 13, the BFE changes are mild on ACE2 and antibodies.Additionally, the N501Y mutation, one of the typical mutationsin the UK B.1.1.7 variant, strengthens the infectivity but inducesmixed reactions to antibodies as shown in Fig. 13. 4.3 Statistical analysis of mutation impacts on COVID-19 antibodies First, we perform a statistical analysis of all mutation-induced BFE changes studied in the last section. Most mutations induce binding-weakening BFE changes. The total rate ofnegative BFE changes is 71% ( i.e., 16 661 out of 23 512); for coil residues, 67% BFE changes are negative, while for helix andsheet residues, 72% and 80% BFE changes are negative,respectively. However, for ACE2, 300 out of 462 mutations ( i.e., 65%) on the RBD produce positive or binding-strengtheningBFE changes, showing the e ect of the natural selection of mutations. In contrast, at most 200 out of 462 mutations on the RBD give rise to negative BFE changes for antibodies. Morespecically, 11 antibodies have less than 100 positive BFE changes while 41 antibodies have less than 200 positive BFEchanges. Interestingly, in our prediction, 4 out of the 43 singleantibodies have less than 100 positive BFE changes, while 7 outof the 9 antibody cocktails have less than 100 positive BFEchanges. Although antibody cocktails have mild negative BFE changes, it turns out that they have high a nities to S protein and the BFE changes are mild for positive ones as well. Fig. 14 indicates the BFE change extreme values (maximal in cyan and minimal in pink) and average values (positive in blueand negative in red) of the complexes of S protein and ACE2 or antibodies following mutations. The maximal BFE changes of the helix, sheet, and their maximal and minimal values indicates the relatively optimalnature of the S protein and antibody binding complexes. Itmeans that the human immune system has the ability to produce optimized antibodies for a given antigen. However, antibodies, once generated, are prone to infection by newmutants. The disparity shown in Fig. 14 also means that theSARS-CoV-2 was at an advanced stage of evolution with respectto human infection. There is not much room for SARS-CoV-2 toimprove its infectivity by single-site mutations. BD604/ relatively less se nsitive to the current S protein mutations. However, some othe r antibodies, such as H11-D4, CV30, CC12.3, and S2H13, can be dramatically a ected by SARS- CoV-2 mutations. Importantly, ACE2 is also impacted by muta-tions and has the largest positive BFE change on average. 5 Mutation impacts on COVID-19 vaccines The increasing number of infection cases and deaths, the global spread situation, and the lack of prophylactics and therapeutics give rise to an urgent need for the prevention of COVID-19. Vaccination is the most e ective and economical means to control pandemics.35Currently, 248 vaccines are in various clinical trial stages, as reported in an online COVID-19 Fig. 13 Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 coil-residue mutation induced BFE changes for the complexes of S protein and 51 antibodies or ACE2 (continued from Fig. 12).

View Article OnlineTreatment And Vaccine Tracker (https://covid- 19tracker.milkeninstitute.org/#vaccines_intro). Broadly speaking, there are four types of coronavirus vaccine in devel-opment: virus vaccines, viral-vector vaccines, nucleic-acidvaccines, and protein-based vaccines, as shown in Fig. 1. Therst type of vaccine is the virus vaccine, which injects weakened or inactivate viruses into the human body. A virus is conven-tionally weakened by altering its genetic code to reduce itsvirulence and elicit a stronger immune response. A biotech- nology company, Codagenix, is currently working on a \"codon optimization \"technology to weaken viruses, and its weakened virus vaccine is in development. 85Unlike a weakened virus, an inactivated virus cannot replicate in the host cell. A virus isinactivated by heating or using chemicals, which inducesneutralizing antibody titers and has been proven to be safe. 86At this stage, both Sinopharm, which works with the BeijingInstitute of Biological Products and Wuhan Institute of Bio- logical Products, and Sinovac, which works with Institute Butantan and Bio Farma, are developing inactive SARS-CoV-2vaccines that are in phase III clinical trials. The second type of vaccine is the viral-vector vaccine, which is genetically engineered so that it can produce coronavirussurface proteins in the human body without causing diseases.There are two subtypes of viral-vector vaccine: the non-replicating viral vector and the replicating viral vector. On February 25, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) granted an emergency use listing (EUL) for a vaccine developedby AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which is a non-replicating viral vector vaccine. Moreover, there are 3 non-replicating viral vector vaccines in phase III trials as well.They work by taking a chimpanzee virus and coating it with theS proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The chimp virus causes a harmlessinfection in humans, but the spike proteins will activate the immune system to recognize signs of a future SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Notably, booster shots may be needed to retain long-lasting immunity. Furthermore, at this stage, only onereplicating viral-vector vaccine is in phase II. The University of Hong Kong, in cooperation with Xiamen University and Wantai Biological Pharmacy, is developing such a replicating viralvaccine, which tends to be safe and provoke a strong immuneresponse. The third type of vaccine is nucleic acid vaccines, which include two subtypes: DNA-based vaccines and RNA-basedvaccines. At least 40 teams are currently working on nucleic-acid vaccines since they are safe and easy to develop. The DNA-based vaccine works by inserting genetically engineered blueprints of the viral gene into small DNA molecules such asplasmids for injection. Moreover, the electroporation techniqueis employed to create pores in membranes to increase DNAuptake into cells. The injected DNA will produce mRNA bytranscription with the help of the nucleus in human cells. Suchan mRNA will translate viral proteins (mostly spike proteins),which are dutifully produced by cells in response to the genes, alarm the immune system, and should produce immunity. Currently, there is one DNA-based vaccine in phase III. Similarto DNA-based vaccines, RNA-based vaccines provide immunitythrough the introduction of RNA, which is encased in a lipidcoat to ensure that it enters into cells. Two RNA-based vaccineshave been granted authorization for emergency use in manycountries. One is designed by BioNTech, which cooperates withPzer, and the other one is from Moderna. The fourth type of vaccine is the protein-based vaccine, which aims to inject viral proteins directly to human bodies totrigger immune readiness. The protein subunit vaccine is one ofthe subtypes of the protein-based vaccine. More than 80 teamsare working on vaccines with viral protein subunits, such asspike proteins and membrane (M) proteins. Another subtype ofthe protein-based vaccine is the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine.VLP vaccines closely resemble viruses. However, they are not infectious since they do not contain viral genetic material. Their non-replicating properties provide a safer alternative to weak-ened virus vaccines; the HPV vaccine or newer u vaccines are Fig. 14 Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 mutation-induced maximal and minimal BFE changes in cyan and pink for the complexes of S protein and 51 antibodies or ACE2, and average of positive and negative BFE changes in blue and red. Here, the maximal change strengthens the binding whilethe minimal change weakens the binding for each complex. 6942 |Chem. Sci. ,2 0 2 1 , 12, 6929 -6948 \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

Currently, 22 teams are working on VLP vaccines for future prevention of COVID-19. 5.1 Secondary structures of antigenic determinants Since the structural basis of antibody CDRs, or paratopes, is random coils, we hypothesize deter- minants. 87,88Fig. 15 depicts the 3D structure of S protein, where the random coils are drawn with green strings, and the othersecondary structure is described with the purple surface. Itshows that the RBD and the NTD mostly consist of random coils. The RBD is the antigenic determinant of 43 structurally known SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; meanwhile, the NTD is thebinding domain of antibodies 4A8 and FC05 and antibody 2G12also binds to the S2 domain with random coils, which con rmsour hypothesis. More detailed analysis considered the random coil percentages of antibodies' paratopes which are summa-rized in Table S1 of the ESI. It reveals that antibodies predominantly contact residues in random coils of S protein. Most of the antibody paratopes had greater than 90% random coil content. Fig. 16 shows the secondary structure of the S protein. The red, blue, and green colors represent helix, sheet, and randomcoils of S protein. It can be seen that the S protein mostlyconsists of random coils, which means that there are manyother potential antigenic epitopes on the S protein for antibodyCDRs. We believe that the emphasis on direct binding compe- tition with ACE2 in the past 66,67,80has led to the neglecting of many important antibodies that do not bind to the RBD.Therefore, we suggest that researchers pay more attention toantibodies that do not bind to the RBD.

View Article Online5.2 Statistical estimation of mutation impacts on COVID-19 vaccines Vaccine e cacy is an essential issue for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The S protein is one of the most popularsurface proteins for vaccine development. However, mutationshave accumulated on the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which mayreduce the vaccine e cacy. As we found in section 2, mutations are more likely to happen on the random coils of S protein, which may have a devastating e ect on vaccines in development. As shown in Fig. 14, mutations could considerably weaken the binding between the S protein and antibodies and thus posea direct threat to reduce the e cacy of vaccines. However, there are a few obstacles in determining the exact impacts of muta-tions on COVID-19 vaccines. Firstly, the four types of vaccineplatform can produce very di erent virus peptides, resulting in dierent immune responses, as well as antibodies. Secondly, even for a given vaccine platform, di erent peptides may be produced due to di erent immune responses caused by gender dierence, age di erence, race di erence, etc.Therefore, in this work, we proposed to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2mutations on COVID-19 vaccines by statistical analysis. Byevaluating the binding a nity changes induced by 51 existing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as shown in Fig. 9 to 13, we can identifyvaccine escape mutants that will strengthen the binding between the S protein and ACE2 while disrupting the binding between the S protein and antibodies. Table 3 lists a collection of the most disruptive mutations. However, this list is notcomplete. There are many other antibody disrupting mutationsas shown in Fig. 9 to 13. For example, the infectivity-strengthening South Africa mutant E484K can cause dramati-cally disruptive e ects on many as H11-D4, Fab 2-4, H11-H4, COVA2-39, BD368-2, etc.but it also enhances other antibodies, such as B38, CV30, CC21.1, Sb23, Fabs in UK B.1.1.7 variants has a disruptive e ect only on a few known antibodies, including B38, CC12.3, S2M11, NAB, S309,S2H12, S304, C1A-B12, STE90-C11, etc. In a nutshell, by setting up a SARS-CoV-2 antibody library with the statistical analysis based on the mutation-inducedbinding free energy changes, we can estimate the impacts ofSARS-CoV-2 mutations on COVID-19 vaccines, which will provide a way to infer how a speci c mutation will pose a threat to vaccines. This approach works better when more antibodystructures become available. Another important factor in prioritization is mutation frequency. Fig. 9 -13 have provided frequency information from our SNP calling. Once a mutation is identi ed as a potential Fig. 17 A comparison between experimental deep mutation enrichment data and TopNetTree predictions for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD and CTC-445.2 complex (7KL9 (ref. 89)).

In principle, all four types of vaccine platform allow the accommodation of new viral strains. 6 Validation Although the details of the methods used in this work are pre-sented in the ESI, we provide a validation of our deep learning prediction model, TopNetTree, 43which is crucial to the credi- bility of this work. Speci cally, we demonstrate the prediction performance of S protein mutation induced BEF changes on CTC-445.2 compared to the experimental deep mutation enrichment data.89More detailed descriptions of methods and datasets are provided in the ESI. Fig. 17 presents a comparison between experimental deep mutation enrichment data on the RBD and machine learningpredicted RBD-mutation-induced BFE changes for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and CTC-445.2 complex. In the heatmaps ofFig. 17, one can see that the predicted BFE changes have a very high correlation with the experimental enrichment ratio data. Both enrichment ratios and BFE changes describe the a nity strength of the protein -protein interaction induced by muta- tions. The high similarity between these heatmaps demon-strates the reliability of our machine learning predictions ofBFE changes following mutations on the S protein RBD. 7 Conclusion The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has goneout of control globally. There is no speci c medicine or e ective treatment for this viral infection at this point. Vaccination iswidely anticipated to be the endgame for taming the viralrampage. Another promising treatment that is relatively easy todevelop is antibody therapies. However, both vaccines andantibody therapies are prone to more than 26 000 uniquemutations recorded in the Mutation Tracker. We present the most comprehensive analysis and prediction of mutation threats to vaccines and antibody therapies. First, weidentify existing mutations on the severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein, which isthe main target for both vaccines and antibody therapies. Weanalyze the mechanism, frequenc y, and ratio of mutations along with the secondary structures of the S protein. Additionally, we build a library of 55 antibodies with structures available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and analy ze their two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) char a c t e r i s t i c sb ye m p l o y i n gc o m p u - tational biophysics. We further predict the mutation-inducedbinding free energy (BFE) changes of S protein and antibodycomplexes using a model called TopNetTree based on deeplearning and algebraic topology. The performance of our model hasbeen extensively validated by its prediction of experimental deepmutation data. Our signi cantndings are as follows. First, we reveal that none of the known mutations are safe to all antibodies. On average, most mutations ( i.e., 71%) will weaken the binding between the S protein and antibodies, which implies that vaccineswill also be compromised by exist ing mutations. Additionally, we identify 31 antibody disrupting mutants that dramatically weakenthe binding between the S protein and most known antibodies. Moreover, we nd that most RBD mutations ( i.e., 64.9%) will enhance the binding strength between the S protein andangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which implies that mostexisting mutations will strengthen the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Thisresult is consistent with the natural selection of mutations and ourearlier ndings. 84Finally, we discover that the maximal BFE change of binding-strengthening mutations are much smallerthan those of binding-weakening mutations for all antibodies, which shows that current human an tibodies were optimized with respect to the original S protein and are prone to the S proteinmutations. Our ndings indicate the pressing need to keep devel- oping mutation-resistant vacci nes and antibody drugs and to be ready for seasonal vaccinations. 8 Data availability Detailed mutation information is available for download at Mutation Tracker.
