Clemson University, Clemson, SC.Behavioral health among agricultural workers Depression, anxiety, and PTSD are prevalent but often untreated among agricultural workers in the U.S. Several studies found that an estimated 20% -50% of Latino farmworkers have mental health concerns at some point during the agricultural season.

Modified from the National Hispanic & Latino MHTTCAnxiety About 30% of farmworkers report symptoms of anxiety. \"Acculturative stress, low self - esteem, ineffective social support, lack of control and choice in living a migrant farmworker lifestyle, low religiosity, and high education were significantly related to high anxiety.\"Although many studies focus on depression, there is much evidence that depression and anxiety often coexist. Farmworkers who experience severe stress are also at risk for anxiety disorders. Hovey, J. D., & Maga\u00f1a , C. G. (2002).

Modified from the National Hispanic & Latino MHTTCDepression Latino farmworkers are at high risk for developing depression and are unlikely to seek out mental health services due to a variety of structural, cultural, and social challenges . Based on the National Agricultural Workers Survey, over 30% of migrant farmworkers displayed elevated depressive symptoms. Depression is under -detected among agricultural workers, partly due to inadequate assessment by PCPs and general low use of healthcare services.Harsh working conditions, immigration -related fears, perceived job insecurity, and discrimination are significantly associated with depressive symptoms.

Convivencia, conexi\u00f3n, and conversaci\u00f3n are important elements to build confianza and foster cultural bridges to address mental health and stress concerns among this worker population. Programs should be culturally -responsive, relevant, and linguistically appropriate. These types of programs may assist workers in understanding more about emotional well -being, engage in positive coping and help seeking behaviors, and enhance relationships among workers. Partnerships with farmworker -serving organizations are vital to being able to provide services and resources that align with assets and needs of the farmworker population.Facilitator training 2022 2023North Central region Resources Request a training: Mental Health First Aid Youth Mental Health First Aid QPR (suicide prevention) https://www.unmc.edu/publichealth/csc ash/feedyard Crisis (1 -866-Su National Hispanic Family Health HelplineMultilingual behavioral health resources https://tinyurl.com/MidwestMHresources Welcoming matters Welcoming communities accept and integrate newcomers, provide opportunities for all to participate and feel a sense of belonging, and are places where everyone has an opportunity to thrive.
