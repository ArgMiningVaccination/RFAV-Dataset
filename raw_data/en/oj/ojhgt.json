It focuses on improving the overall well-being and quality of life of the whole body. Ayurvedic medicine is based on the different combinations of the five elements that the world is made of, i.e., space (ether), water, earth, fire, and air. Their combinations lead to three doshas in the body, namely, Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. They work together to control one's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Let us look at one of these doshas, the Vata dosha, and understand its role in the body, the consequence of its imbalance, and the Ayurvedic remedies to alleviate it. The Vata Dosha Vata prominently consists of the elements air and space. The word Vata means to move like the wind. As per ayurvedic medicine, Vata dosha is responsible for all the movements in the body and the mind, and the management of other vital bodily functions, including- - Breathing - Blood flow - Evacuation of wastes - Movement of thoughts in the brain - Activities of the nervous system - Sensory and mental balance - Cognitive function Even the Kapha and Pitta doshas in the body cannot function without movement. Hence, Vata is also called the 'king of doshas'. It is immensely essential to keep it balanced. The nature of Vata is dry, cold, quick, light, rough, moving, and changeable. It controls the body's greater life force. Types of Vata There are five different forms of the Vata dosha. These are called Vayus and have different purposes in the body. - Prana Vayu is centered in the brain. It moves through the head towards the throat and chest to regulate vital processes like inhalation and swallowing. - Vyana Vayu is centered in the heart. from there, it moves throughout the body and governs the circulatory system. - Udana Vayu starts from the chest cavity and moves upward to regulate memory, speech, exhalation, etc. - Samana Vayu is the equalizing air centered in the small intestine. It controls the digestive processes and maintains overall bodily balance. - Apana Vayus is concentrated in the small intestine and is in charge of processes like elimination, menstruation, urination, and sexual activity. Vata Dosha Imbalance When Vata is balanced- - the body is energetic - digestion, and elimination processes work better - blood circulation and body temperature remain balanced - cognitive functions like learning and memory are improved - the mind remains clear and alert - falling asleep during bedtime is easier and sleep quality is better But what happens when the Vata dosha falls out of balance in the system? Since Vata has a major influence on the body, the slightest of changes in it can have severe effects on the body as compared to the other two doshas. Dry/cold/rough/windy weather conditions; dry, cold, pungent, and bitter foods; and excess stress and anxiety are some prominent causes of Vata imbalance. If it stays imbalanced long enough, the Pitta and Kapha doshas get imbalanced as well. An aggravated Vata can cause wasting of muscles, joint pains, headache, stiffness, constipation, colic, cramps, gas, [digestive issues](https://www.hempstreet.in/blog/how-cannabis-improves-your-digestive-health/), etc. Other physical and behavioral symptoms of Vata imbalance include: - Dry and rough skin - Dehydration - Fatigue - Dizziness [Body ache and other pains](https://www.hempstreet.in/blog/why-medical-experts-resort-to-vijaya-for-chronic-pain-management/)Disturbed sleep/insomnia - Anxiety/depression - Confusion - Nervousness/agitation/impatience Ayurvedic Remedies for Vata Imbalance Since Vata is cold and dry, Ayurvedic medicine recommends consuming warm, moist, smooth, and nourishing foods to neutralize it. Some Vata pacifying foods include warm drinks and herbal teas, hot soups and stews, ghee, olive oil, nuts, dried fruits, oranges, pineapples, kiwis, avocado, olives, coconut, milk/buttermilk, etc. It is best to first boil the milk and then consume it warm for optimal digestion. Moist foods like yogurt, melons, berries, squash, zucchini, etc., and warm spices like turmeric, flaxseeds, ginger, black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, cloves, asafetida, fennel, and cardamom can effectively reduce Vata imbalance. It is recommended to avoid frozen/processed/canned foods and drinks, raw and uncooked foods, cold and carbonated drinks, as well as old leftover foods. Bitter, astringent, and pungent foods; beans and soy products; caffeine, nicotine, and other stimulants; alcohol; deep-fried items; and foods with refined sugar must be avoided as well. Consuming whole, nourishing, and freshly cooked foods is vital for balancing Vata. Furthermore, make sure to drink adequate water for hydration. It is further essential to eat mindfully in well-spaced regular intervals, avoid overeating, and not go empty stomach for long. Vata-Balancing Lifestyle Today's hectic and schedule-driven workflow has forced people to neglect their physical and mental health. Increasing work pressure and deadlines have caused immense stress and anxiety to people. To bring Vata to balance, it is important to relieve stress and anxiety and live life with a calm awareness. Warm oil massages, calming music, gentle exercise (walking, swimming, yoga), meditation, anuloma viloma pranayama, warm baths, sweet scents, indulging in hobbies, and having good company contribute greatly to bringing peace and balance to the system.
