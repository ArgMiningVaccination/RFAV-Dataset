The parties agree to develop a process of meaningful input, as set out in clause 19.01(b) of the Collective Agreement, with the mutual goal of designing a process to effectively and efficiently resolve disputes regarding job content and to ensure the internal equity of job classifications. Until the parties reach agreement on a Job Evaluation Maintenance Program (the \"Program\"), the provisions of clause 19.01(b) shall continue to apply with respect to the process for addressing new or changed job content and qualifications, and the provisions of clause 7.03 shall continue to appl y with respect to the process for addressing the rate of pay for a new or changed job classification. Once in place, the Program will be applied to identify when new or changed job content and qualifications occur in the job duties or requirements of a job classification and when such changes may require an amendment to the existing job profile or to a change in the wage grade, or both. 2. The parties agree to establish a Joint Committee within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days of July 31, 2009 to develop the Program. The Program will outline a dispute resolution process which will include mediation and arbitration. The Joint Committee shall have three (3) representatives from each party. In the event the Joint Committee cannot reach agreement on t he design of the Program, the matter will be referred to the President of Local 416 and the Executive Director of Human Resources for resolution. Failing resolution either party may refer the matter to mediation. The parties agree to mutually decide on the mediator and share equally in any cost. 3. Failing resolution through mediation, the parties will each select their own nominee in order to assist the parties in resolving any matters remaining. The two (2) nominees will then select a Chair of the Board o f Arbitration which will consider any matters in dispute between the parties and make a final and binding determination of the design of the Program. The Arbitration Board will not have the authority to modify those elements to which the parties have alrea dy agreed, including those matters set out in this document. The cost of the Chair will be shared equally by both parties. 4. The parties agree to jointly determine the methodology for reviewing job classifications and that the Program will contain the f ollowing elements: Memorandum of Settlement Page 50 of 56 Not the official signed off document (a) It will incorporate a gender neutral comparison system; (b) It will assess and compare job classifications, based upon the established measures of Skill, Effort, Responsibilities and Working Conditions; (c) It will incorporate a process through which new job classifications established by the City will be evaluated in order to determine their applicable wage grade; (d) It will incorporate a process to determine whether a changed job classification should move to a new wage grade in order to ensure internal equity; (e) It will incorporate a process through which disputes regarding new and changed job classifications will be resolved; (f) In the event that it amends the wage grade of any position, it will do so on a go - forward bas is and without retroactive application; and (g) It will provide transitional wage protection for employees of the bargaining unit who will be protected from loss of income (redcircled) in the event that it is determined that the wage grade for the position that the employee holds is to be reduced, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.

Upon agreement of the parties, existing job classificat ions requiring additional review with regard to the scope, content of duties and matters related to internal equity may be reviewed through the Program. This will include: (i) Reviewing job classifications with a view to determine which, if any, classifi cations should be \"unbundled\" into more than one job classification; and (ii) Reviewing job classifications with a view to determine if new job classifications should be developed. 6.
