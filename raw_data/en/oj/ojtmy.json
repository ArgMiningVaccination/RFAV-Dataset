In deciding whether to get the vaccine, keep in mind the difference between side effects and adverse events. Taking any drug demands a balance of tolerances. Here are [five questions about the vaccine's impact](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/12/10/covid-vaccine-sabin-sunday-polio/3863706001/). What's an adverse event? An adverse event is [any health problem after a vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/sideeffects/index.html). A side effect is an adverse event detected in clinical trials before the vaccine came to market. Side effects of vaccines usually are minor, such a soreness at the injection site, a low-grade fever or body aches. They are also temporary, easing in a few days. Another adverse event is a health problem not detected in clinical trials that arose after vaccination but was not caused by vaccination or cannot be clearly tied to the vaccine. Doctors are required to report to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ certain serious adverse events after vaccination](https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_Following_Vaccination.pdf). The CDC encourages doctors to report all adverse events surrounding vaccinations. Do vaccines for COVID-19 have side effects? Yes, but for most people, they are mild and don't last more than a day. The [New York drug company Pfizer reported](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) that about 85% of more than 36,000 Americans in clinical trials for its vaccine candidate had soreness where they got the injections. Others had redness and swelling, mild fever, body aches, fatigue, chills and headache. First nurse vaccinated at Cincinnati: ['There might really be a ... turning point' in pandemic](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/12/15/coronavirus-vaccine-cincinnati-northern-kentucky-distribution-hospitals-health-care-workers/3903966001/) Pfizer built the vaccine with technology developed by its German partner, BioNTech. In the trials, the vaccine prevented infection with the new coronavirus from progressing to the disease COVID-19 about 95% of the time. The federal government gave permission Dec. 11 for the vaccine's emergency use. A second candidate, a vaccine of similar formulation by Moderna of Cambridge, Massachusetts, tested in about 40,000 Americans, also has reported 95% efficacy and could get federal emergency approval by the end of this week. More shots=more side effects? Some vaccines, such as the drug for shingles, require two shots. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is two shots 21 days apart. The Moderna vaccine is two shots 28 days apart. Preliminary federal reviews have found that the mild side effects arise after the second shot then subside. Are side effects more than just annoying? Yes. As with the flu vaccine, experiencing a side effect of COVID-19 vaccine shows your body's immune system has switched into gear to educate itself on the invader. The next time a coronavirus pays your body a visit, the immune system recognizes the spiky proteins and fights off the virus. Do or don't?: [Should you get the COVID-19 vaccine if you've already had COVID-19? We asked doctors.](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/12/15/should-you-get-covid-19-vaccine-if-youve-already-had-virus/6538889002/) The federal emergency use approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech was based on 60 days of the clinical trial. Moderna also applied for its emergency permission with 60 days of data. People who were the test subjects will be followed for two years to learn the lasting impact of the vaccine. Anything more serious? On Tuesday, the vaccine apparently triggered a severe allergic reaction in [a nurse in Juneau, Alaska](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/12/16/alaska-healthcare-worker-hospitalized-after-receiving-covid-19-vaccine/), that put her in a hospital. The CDC says such a response turned up in clinical trials but occurs slightly more than once in every 1 million doses. The CDC and the [American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology](https://acaai.org/news/american-college-allergy-asthma-and-immunology-releases-guidance-risk-allergic-reactions-pfizer) say the vaccine is safe for people who have allergies. The latest numbers: [Ohio reports 11,412 new COVID-19 cases; nursing home vaccines begin Friday](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2020/12/17/live-ohio-gov-mike-dewine-gives-covid-19-update/3935643001/) Pfizer-BioNTech said four serious adverse events were reported in the clinical trial: a shoulder injury from getting the injection, changes in lymph nodes, irregular heartbeat and the sensation of pins and needles in the leg. Two participants died, one from arteriosclerosis, one from cardiac arrest. Four participants who got the saline solution and not the vaccine died, two from unknown causes, one from a stroke and one from a heart attack. Pfizer-BioNTech investigators said none of the deaths was related to the vaccine or placebo, and there were no COVID-19 deaths.
