{"title": "A Fishy Remedy", "author": "Jasmine Kwok", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2023-04-02", "cleaned_text": "\"fish\" over and over again. Context: When PK was younger, he had hiccups and couldn't get them to stop, so he asked his dad what to do. He told him to say \"fish\" over and over again until they went away. He tried a bit, found that it didn't work, and then asked his father a second time. His father said to try again-\"it will work eventually.\" He would say it over and over and over again until the hiccups stopped. Whether or not they stopped because of \"fish\" or of natural causes is unknown, but PK likes to believe that saying \"fish\" was the remedy. Analysis: These folk \"remedies\" are told to children to provide an effective, lighthearted solution to their inexplicable problems. This is where folklore separates from science and biology: unofficial knowledge passed down from parent to child cannot be taught in institutions. Even if saying \"fish\" doesn't actually stop the hiccups, it further establishes this sense of trust; it is comforting to know that your father has different tricks up his sleeve for each problem you encounter. The magic behind folklore rests upon our ability to believe. These 'life hacks' reflect a reservoir of experience and knowledge; the power dynamic between parent and child is created from the differences in our stages of life. What we learn from our parents can be passed down to our children, and remedies can soon become familial traditions. Even without fully understanding why you're doing something, you believe in it because of parental authority and familiarity. We don't question the logicality of folklore. Although some of these remedies may be widespread and have different variations across multiple regions, it's almost as if your parent has this special, niche understanding of how the world works-they possess wisdom beyond standardized, common knowledge. Context: The interviewee, D, is 19 years old and they were born and raised in Mexico. They told me that when they were a kid, they accidentally made this gesture while trying to get their family dog to sit down. When D's dad saw what they were doing, he asked them why they were cussing out the dog. D obviously did not know what the gesture meant, so their dad explained it to them. That's how D found out that this gesture was basically a way of saying \"F*** you\" to someone. Analysis: There are a lot of gestures that mean very different things depending on where you are in the world and so it's important to keep that in mind, especially if you decide to travel internationally. When I moved to Canada from China, there were a lot of words and gestures that I didn't know the hidden meaning of. I never knew this gesture was a way to cuss at people until D told me. However, I was unable to find the origins of this hand gesture because it's rather hard to describe what I'm looking for online. I actually make this hand gesture quite often, but only towards myself and not other people thankfully as it's how I check my nails and cuticles to see if they need fixing. Context: The interviewee, M, is 18 years old and they were born and raised in what is commonly known as the Bay Area in San Francisco, California. M had brought up this common proverb that they heard growing up while we were discussing minor folklore genres because both their parents are doctors in internal medicine, and they joked that they would eat an apple every time they wanted their parents to stop bothering them. Analysis: The proverb originated in the 1860s in Wales, but it was in a different format: \"Eat an apple on going to bed and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread.\" It wasn't until 1913 that it became the proverb we know today (Davis, 2015). This was because they were advocating for children to eat more apples and healthy foods in general so that they will be in good health and not need to go to the hospital as often. I was also familiar with this saying growing up. I had some health issues when I was younger, and I frequently visited the hospital/emergency room growing up. I had a lot of allergies, one of them being dust, and I used to have asthma as well, so together, they were not a great combination. I was not a big fan of hospitals and doctors, so I would eat apples all the time to try and prevent myself from getting sick or having an allergic reaction and having to go back to the hospital. Davis, M. A., Bynum, P. W., & Sirovich, B. E. (2015). Association Between Apple Consumption and Physician Visits: Appealing the Conventional Wisdom That an Apple a Day Keeps the Doctor Away. JAMA internal medicine, 175(5), 777. Context: S is Korean as well as German, and they also showed me a gesture that they were taught growing up. Their parents told them to always accept a gift from someone with both of their hands rather than one because it showed respect and politeness and that you are giving your full attention to the person who is giving you the gift. Analysis: I believe that this is a big part of Asian culture. I was also taught to receive gifts with two hands and say thank you, especially if they were my elders, to show them my respect and my thanks. I know many of my Asian friends were also taught the same by their parents, and the gesture doesn't always only apply to gifts, but when you are handed anything of importance because it signifies that you are giving the item and them your full attention and focus. I think it is a nice habit to have because so many interactions now aren't even in person, but over the phone, or online, and they've lost their intimacy. It's nice to slow down and just take a moment to put your focus entirely on one person and acknowledge and savour the moment you're sharing. M is 50, and was raised in the Caloocan area of metro Manila, Philippines, and currently resides in San Gabriel, California. M says that \"if there is an occasion in which you don't want it to rain, like a wedding\" then you should leave an egg outside. Interestingly, M couldn't recall where she had heard this belief or the reason why it was so widely held. Research indicated that this was indeed a common belief held among Filipino people, although there is some [discrepancy](https://saksi.livejournal.com/196427.html) whether the belief is a myth or a spiritual belief. One variation acts as an urban myth, with eggs being symbolic for new beginnings, while another variation suggests that the egg is an offering to Saint Clara for good weather. Either way, it is still interesting that there can be multiple different origins for one folk belief. "}
