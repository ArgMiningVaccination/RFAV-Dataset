At The Meditation Center, healing is an important part of our teachings. We believe that many of the conditions we experience are a result of the way we think, and the actions we take, and the choices we make. We maintain a healing book with the names of people to whom we direct our thoughts and prayers for healing in mind, body or spirit. We do not focus on the specific condition, but rather on the process of healing, in whatever form serves the highest good of all concerned. At our Center Weekly Healing Meditation We host a [Healing Meditation](https://www.meditate-wnc.org/weekly-healing-meditation-2/) on most Tuesdays at 7:00 pm, which is done in conjunction with other groups around the country. Our combined efforts raise the vibration of our world, and provide positive energies to do their work wherever they are needed and accepted. Please join us for this inspiring meditation.
