Using quantum theoretical models and mathematical algorithms, new understanding of quantum effects will enable exploitation in existing abiotic applications. This includes exploiting manifestly quantum mechanical effects that exist in biological systems at room temperature to develop a revolutionary new class of compact high sensitivity sensors. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Develop a quantum theoretical model of postulated non-trivial quantum mechanical effects in specific biological systems. - Experimentally verify that the biological system exploits the effect at room temperature. - Formulate testable predictions for impact of perturbations to the 6.000 0.000 6.000 Engineering (STF) (U) The objective of the Scaffold-Free Tissue Engineering program is the development of tissue and organ construction platforms that utilize non-contact forces such as magnetic fields to achieve desired tissue architectures.

The program will provide a paradigm shift versus current tissue engineering approaches using permanent or resorbable protein scaffolds. Such scaffolds are limited to construct sizes of 2-3 square millimeters due to oxygen and nutrient diffusion limitations, which severely limits the complexity of the tissue(s) constructed to a single cell type. In vivo, scaffold-based tissue engineering has not achieved anticipated widespread application due to the inability to properly control the cellular response to the implanted scaffold and due to difficulties in controlling the scaffold integrity/degradation. The initial STF program component is the development of non-contact cell positioning procedures. The fundamental goal is to correctly position target cells in a desired pattern for a sufficient period of time to allow the cells to synthesize their own scaffold. Potential approaches include magnetic field and/or dielectrophoretic positioning. Critical to early programmatic achievement is the capability to position at least two cell types through the identification of cellular magnetic taggants, characterization of cellular dielectric characteristics and determination of application dynamics (e.g., duration, cycles, amplitude) to achieve multicellular tissue construction in vitro. A potential transition to an in situ application would allow wound site reconstruction without the need to implant scaffold material. Construction of a stable implantable skeletal muscle construct (5 cm3) with vascular and neural components will be the final programmatic demonstration. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Identify non-contact approaches such as magnetic fields and dielectrophoresis that provide cell positioning in three dimensions without negatively impacting cell viability. - Demonstrate in vitro construction of multicellular tissue using one or more non-contact cell positioning approaches. - Demonstrate survival and functional implantation of a 2 cubic centimeter multicellular skeletal muscle scaffold-less construct into an appropriate in vivo model. - Develop cellular placement instrumentation for in vivo implementation of scaffoldless 14UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #2 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 15 of 57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESPROJECT BLS-01: BIO/INFO/MICRO B.

(U) The Foundational Machine Intelligence program is supporting research on the foundations of artificial intelligence and machine learning and reasoning. One focus is on techniques that can efficiently process and \"understand\" massive data streams. Deeply layered machine learning engines will be created that use a single set of methods in multiple layers (at least three internally) to generate progressively more sophisticated representations of patterns, invariants, and correlations from data inputs. These will have far-reaching military implications with potential applications such as anomaly detection, object recognition, language understanding, information retrieval, pattern recognition, robotic task learning and automatic metadata extraction from video streams, sensor data, and multi-media objects. Foundational Machine Intelligence also examines the human aspects of computing, with interest in collaboration, interaction and information exchange; non-symbolic representation/reasoning paradigms based upon a universal \"cortical\" algorithm; unmanned vehicles and intelligent agents that generate and manage their own goals within human-described mission constraints; and modeling of human language acquisition by associating words with the real-world entities perceived through multiple modes of sensory input. FY 2010 Plans: - Create machine learning techniques that can assimilate huge amounts of data by creating rich representations of the input data and applying them to multiple applications. - Construct a single, general-purpose algorithm which could start with zero knowledge of its environment, and then grow to represent the structure latent in that environment. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Create parameter-free methods that learn appropriate representations starting from raw inputs with a single architecture and learning algorithm. - Enable machines to incorporate sensory information in a robust way to improve situational awareness.

Centers of Excellence for Computational Science and Engineering (COECSE) (U) The Centers of Excellence for Computational Science and Engineering (COECSE) will address the most difficult and fundamental challenges facing computing today. Computing has reached three walls of security, energy (power consumption) and programmability that cannot be overcome by traditional, evolutionary techniques. Security and energy-efficiency are difficult roadblocks for all current architectural approaches. Revolutionary new architectures, ranging from microprocessors, memory and interfaces to full-scale systems, are needed if we are to sustain the rate of advancement to which we have become accustomed. Languages that make programming current and future multi- core processors far more tractable for the average application developer are needed if we are to reap the benefits of emerging processor paradigms such as massive multi-core. The current approach to security, which attempts to retrofit security onto an evolving, imprecisely known, and increasingly complex (even non-deterministic) COTS infrastructure, is ad hoc and ineffectual - more systematic approaches are required. (U) Traditionally, computing has sought to overcome these three walls separately, with security, processing architectures, and programming languages developed in isolation and applied independently. The Centers of Excellence Program for Computational Science and Engineering will create research centers engaging academics and industry to explore and develop a more holistic approach to breaking down these walls.

Fundamental Laws and Limits of Cyber Security (U) Based on advances from the Foundational Computer Science program, the Fundamental Laws and Limits of Cyber Security program seeks to establish a framework of fundamental laws and limits governing cyber security, which enables pro-active approaches to the complex task of making cyber systems secure. Research in this area focuses on creating a fundamental theory of security-oriented system complexity and a methodology for applying the theory to practical challenges of system security for systems ranging from simple programs on a single computer to large-scale distributed applications. Currently there is little understood on how to measure the efficiency of the huge variety of ad-hoc methods for improving system security and on how to know which of these methods should be used in each particular case. Therefore, the design, development, and integration of secure cyber systems are a continuous, evolving process. U.S. military computing systems are continuously vulnerable to malicious cyber attacks. This program's framework provides military planners the guidance on pro- active decision-making in system design, implementation, and deployment. The key steps in this effort include: 1) development of complexity-based metrics that would directly measure how hard it would be for system developers/integrators to create a system that would be free of security holes; 2) development of a security-oriented complexity hierarchy; 3) development of the requisite theory that would help explain how the system design and implementation affects the metrics; and 4) creation of a methodology for applying the theory to practical systems.0.000 0.000 4.000 0.000 4.000 Volume 1 - 27UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #2 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 28 of 57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESPROJECT CCS-02: MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total *Formerly Quantum OptoMechanics Integrated on a Chip. (U) The objective of the Optical Radiation Cooling and Heating in Integrated Devices (ORCHID) program is to leverage advances in Photonics and Micro fabrication to develop integrated chips capable of exploiting quantum optomechanical applications. Although light is usually thought of as carrying energy but relatively little momentum, light confined to a high-finesse cavity can exert significant force on the cavity mirrors. When the mirror is allowed to vibrate by coupling it to a mechanical (spring- like) system, energy can be transferred between coupled optomechanical resonators. Depending on the detuning of the cavity, one can obtain either damping (cooling) or amplification (heating) of the mirror motion. Notable achievements in this field are the demonstration of mirror cooling (damping of the internal degree of motion) to sub-Kelvin (6 mK) temperatures and demonstration of radiation driven high-Q, high-frequency (1 GHz) oscillators. With sufficiently high cavity finesse and Q's of the mechanical system, it is possible to reach a regime in which the mirror motion is no longer thermally limited. Instead, it becomes limited by the quantum mechanical radiation pressure force. Once this limit is reached, it is possible to take advantage of quantum mechanical effects without having to cool the system. It is anticipated this will result in a new generation of mass-sensing devices and ultra high- Q, high-frequency resonators controlled by light. In optical systems, it will be possible to efficiently squeeze light beyond the standard shot-noise limit producing light sources for infrared detection and quantum information applications. FY 2010 Plans: - Demonstrate resonant frequency of 10 megahertz (MHz). - Demonstrate Mechanical Q of 1x10^6.

Centers for Integrated Photonics Engineering Research (CIPhER) (U) The Centers for Integrated Photonics Engineering Research (CIPhER) program will explore and enhance fundamental understanding in the development and application of integrated photonics, in which an entire photonic system is fabricated on a single chip. Much like integrated electronics, integrated photonics has the potential to enable photonics systems to reach revolutionary new levels of performance and functionality, but with a wider application range than electronics, including such areas as imaging, energy conversion, signal processing, and computing. The rise of integrated photonics as a viable, practical technology, combined with the utility of integrated photonics to many applications, is slated to result in a more rapid transition of basic photonics research to system applications of importance to the Department of Defense. As such, photonics research that is supported by organizations with both fundamental and commercial interests is ideally suited to fostering the growth of the nation's integrated photonics industry. The CIPhER program will therefore use a government/industrial cost-share funding model to foster the next generation of fundamental university- based photonics research. The CIPhER program is directed toward achieving this objective through the establishment of collaborative theme-based focus centers. Focus centers will be comprised of university-led teams, with industrial partners, engaged in long-term basic research of photonic materials, devices, and microsystems.

Molecular Photonics (MORPH) (U) The Molecular Photonics (MORPH) program explored large dendritic and other highly branched organic molecules that offered great potential for active photonic applications. Three-dimensional molecular structures and shapes can be engineered to orient and immobilize optically active substituents to achieve much higher electro-optic activity than with traditional polymer systems. The ability to engineer molecular structure, shape, energy transport, and chemical composition offers the potential for distinct electronic energy level engineering without the traditional semiconductor crystal lattice. Potential applications include: direct conversion of sunlight to power (\"optical antenna\"), inversion-less lasers and electromagnetically induced transparency (coherent organic emitters, and slow light materials), high performance photorefractive materials for signal processing and holographic memory, optical limiters and saturable absorbers as well as high performance modulators.

With microsystem approaches, a prime goal is to be able to address large populations of cells, select as few as one, capture it, make specific edits to its DNA, and examine or replicate the cell as needed. Such capability will be applicable to a wide variety of problems including biological weapons countermeasures and understanding the underpinnings of human cancers. At an intermediate scale, new insights into the interactions of photons with the nervous system tissues of mammals will allow the development of mm-scale microphotonic implants that have the potential to restore sensory and motor function to individuals with traumatic spinal injury, for example. On the other end of the size scale, a primary goal is to apply microsystem techniques to soldier-protective biomedical systems. One example is an in-canal hearing protection device that will provide enhanced hearing capabilities in some settings, but be able to instantly muffle loud sounds of weapons fire. This one example will improve inter-personnel communications and at the same time drastically reduce the incidence of hearing loss in combat situations. For these examples and many more, the goal is to bring exceptionally potent technical approaches to bear on biological and biomedical applications where their capabilities will be significant force multipliers for the DoD.

These technologies will lead to new multi-generation product lines of commercially viable, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications; it will include both supercomputer and embedded computing systems. One of the major challenges currently facing the DoD is the prohibitively high cost, time, and expertise required to build large complex software systems. Powerful new approaches and tools are needed to enable the rapid and efficient production of new software, including software that can be easily changed to address new requirements and can adjust dynamically to platform and environmental perturbations. The project will ensure accessibility and usability to a wide range of application developers, not just computational science experts. This project is essential for maintaining the nation's strength in both supercomputer computation for ultra large-scale engineering applications for surveillance and reconnaissance data assimilation and exploitation, and for environmental modeling and prediction. (U) Even as this project develops the next generation of high-productivity, high-performance computing systems, it is looking further into the future to develop the technological and architectural solutions that are required to develop extreme computing systems. The military will demand increasing diversity, quantities, and complexity of sensor and other types of data, both on the battlefield and in command centers - processed in time to effectively impact warfighting decisions. Computing assets must progress dramatically to meet significantly increasing performance and cyber-security, while significantly decreasing power and size requirements. Extreme computing systems will scale to deliver a thousand times the capabilities of future petascale systems using the same power and size or will scale to deliver terascale-embedded systems at one millionth of the size and power of petascale systems, and will do so with greatly enhanced security capabilities.

In Phase III of the HPCS program, the two remaining vendors will complete the designs and technical development of very large (petascale) productive supercomputers, with demonstration of prototype systems in 2010-2012. DARPA funding is sufficient to cover the contractual requirements of one of the two selected vendors. NSA and DOE, partners with DARPA in this program, are providing funding to maintain a second vendor in the program. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Released the beta version application development software to HPCS stakeholders for evaluation and software which provided familiarity prior to system release, thus reducing the learning curve upon system availability. - Fabricated and tested several of the Application-Specific Integrated Circuits. - Continued to develop and implement operating system scaling and performance improvements. - Continued developing productivity tools. - Conducted critical design reviews of each HPCS vendor's system.

Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (IAMANET) (U) The Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (IAMANET) program continues a series of successful research programs to design a tactical wireless network that is secure and resilient to a broad range of threats which include cyber attacks, electronic warfare and malicious insiders (or captured/compromised radios). Previous programs included the Dynamic Quarantine of Computer- Based Worms (DQW) and Defense Against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad-hoc Network Systems (DCAMANET). (U) IAMANET will build upon the successes achieved in both the DQW and the DCMANET programs. IAMANET directly supports the integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, and safety of Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) communications and data. In contrast, the dominant Internet paradigm is intrinsically insecure. For example, the Internet does not deny unauthorized traffic by default and therefore violates the principle of least privilege. In addition, there are no provisions for non- repudiation or accountability and therefore adversaries can probe for vulnerabilities with impunity because the likelihood of attributing bad behavior to an adversary is limited. Current protocols are not robust to purposely induced failures and malicious behavior, leaving entire Internet-based systems vulnerable in the case of defensive failure. IAMANET, on the other hand, uses a deny-by-default networking paradigm, allowing only identifiable authorized users to communicate on the network. While the objective transition path for IAMANET technologies is to the Services to support mobile tactical operations, the IAMANET systems are interoperable with fixed networks and may also have potential applicability to the broader DoD network architecture.7.432 14.543 11.912 0.000 11.912 Volume 1 - 74UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #10 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 17 of 39Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-03: INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B.

Security-Aware Systems (U) The Security-Aware Systems program will develop and advance a variety of potentially promising technologies to enable the military to field secure, survivable, self-monitoring, self-defending network centric systems. This program will develop security aware systems that will avoid brittleness and vulnerability, due to their ability to reason about their own security attributes, capabilities and functions with respect to specific mission needs. These systems will also dynamically adapt to provide desired levels of service while minimizing risk and providing coherent explanations of the relative safety of service level alternatives. These systems will bolster the reliability and security of critical, open source software systems by reducing vulnerabilities and logic errors, and providing state-of-the-art software analysis techniques augmented with cognitive decision-making techniques with the ultimate goal of applying these systems on to the Global Information Grid. Research efforts will also explore provable protection of information within systems that exhibit imperfect security. A new kind of computational framework is needed that enables critical information and program separation properties (e.g., information in one graphical user interface (GUI) window never leaks to another GUI window). Security- Aware Systems will also address the so-called \"insider threat\" by developing technologies that enable a fundamentally new approach for detecting insider threats that exploits recent advances in cognitive science to accurately model and learn the normal behavior of users. (U) The Application Communities (AC) effort will develop technologies to protect DoD information systems that employ commercial software applications against cyber attack and system failure by developing collaboration-based defenses that detect, respond to, and heal from attacks with little or no human assistance.

AC technology will enable collections of similar systems to collaboratively generate a shared awareness of security vulnerabilities, vulnerability mitigation strategies, and early warnings of attack. AC will revolutionize the security of military information systems and reduce the threat from stealthy intrusion of critical systems and/or denial of service attacks. (U) The Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS) effort will design, develop, demonstrate and validate architectures, tools, and techniques for fielding systems capable of adapting to novel threats, unanticipated workloads and evolving system configurations. SRS technology will employ innovative techniques like biologically-inspired diversity, cognitive immunity and healing, granular and scalable redundancy, and higher-level functions such as reasoning, reflection and learning. SRS technologies will make critical future information systems more robust, survivable and trustworthy. SRS will also develop technologies to mitigate the insider threat. SRS-enabled systems will be able to reconstitute their full functional and performance capabilities after experiencing accidental component failure, software error, or even an intentional cyber-attack. These systems will also show a positive trend in reliability, actually exceeding initial operation capability and approaching a theoretical optimal performance level over long periods while maintaining robustness and trustworthiness attributes.

DISCOVER (U) The DISCOVER program will continue and expand the efforts initiated in TrUST, and focus on the more difficult problem of indentifying rogue components or circuitry in unknown designs. The Department of Defense has become increasingly reliant on electronic parts and systems fabricated outside of the United States. In many cases, these parts have also been designed in foreign countries, and there is currently no method available to decipher the full functionality of these circuits that may contain billions of transistors. Even if the part is designed domestically, there is currently no way of verifying that tampering has not occurred during fabrication, especially as processing technology scales to near atomic length scales. Unreliable electronic systems could potentially compromise the warfighter's mission or safety. DISCOVER will advance non-destructive reverse engineering of integrated circuits whose functionality is not known a priori. These tools will be compatible with leading edge 32 nanometer Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) node size. These tools will ensure that an integrated circuits has full functionality and will provide verification that no malicious changes have been introduced.

Cyber Authentication (U) Current practice for the authentication of military personnel to information systems and facility access uses one or more factors; something you know - passwords, something you have - access cards, and/or something you are - biometrics. Today, biometrics, a method to uniquely authenticate an individual based on one or more physical or behavior traits, relies on being able to access the individuals body (fingerprint, retina scan, face recognition, DNA) and human behavior (voice, typing rhythm) and are preferred means to identify persons. The intent of the Cyber Authentication program is to reduce the authentication burden as well as strengthening the overall network security posture of the Global Information Grid by implementing autonomous 3-factor authentication. The Cyber Authentication program will accomplish this by revolutionary non-intrusive biometric identification tied to human physiology providing autonomous network defense through consistent and non-repudiated authentication. The Cyber Authentication system will securely identify unique individuals when the individual is within proximity of a computing device. A potential transition path of this program is a commercial capability to remotely identify individuals to their commercial systems without needing to interact with today's burdensome biometric systems or remembering logon and passwords combinations.

Total Software Understanding (TSU) (U) The Total Software Understanding (TSU) program seeks to develop automated tools that provide insight into the internal structure and operation of software. Current software projects are massive, dynamic social efforts involving distributed teams of developers, marketers, and users. As a result, there are multiple segments of the software being written simultaneously by different people with their own unique coding style. This segmentation of software development along with the nonstop submission of bug reports result in a continuous evolution of the system design as the software project is being developed. Over time, the software grows in size, developers phase out, and the fundamental core, structure, and layout becomes convoluted and difficult to understand. The TSU program will resolve this issue by developing software tools that distill intended software behavior and verify the intended behavior against the actual behavior. The TSU program will determine software behavior in an automated manner through low-level code analysis techniques and by examining the software development history and socio-economic impact data available during the time of development. The software tools developed under the TSU program will permit visualizations of software properties and logic flows as well as allow a historical and performance analysis of those properties. TSU will enable software engineers to diagnose software for inefficiencies, logic errors, redundant code, and overall software inconsistencies. The tools developed under the TSU program will permit automated software restructuring for efficiency. The ultimate goal of the TSU program is to build tools that enable software developers to improve the overall quality of current and future software products. The software tools developed in this program will enable the improvement and modernization of legacy and open source software, as well as improve and guide future software engineering practices and techniques. This effort will transition to the Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, Military Services, academic, and commercial sectors.0.000 0.000 5.000 0.000 5.000 Volume 1 - 84UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #10 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 27 of 39Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-03: INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B.

Confident Computing (C-2) (U) The Confident Computing (C-2) program will radically change the current paradigm of overly complex, unwieldy, and insecure computing platforms. Current commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems do not keep pace with the security requirements of the Department of Defense and other government agencies; they are incentivized to add layer upon layer of functionality and backwards compatibility, without significantly improved security. The C-2 program will leverage enhanced processor and memory technologies developed under the Trustworthy Systems program to revolutionize the \"minimalization\" of a micro-core operating system, designed to quantifiably defeat adversaries' attempts to compromise the system during computing operations specific to military operations, rather than home use. The resulting technology of the C-2 program will initially be used either as a component or complete system to allow secure command and control communications for deployed forces. Subsequent phases of the program will allow for expanded usability and functionality for in-garrison usage. Mature C-2 technologies will not require add-on security controls (e.g., Anti- Virus, Firewall, etc.) nor time-consuming maintenance from system administrators, thus improving performance and decreasing costs in order to facilitate transition to an operational performer. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Investigate revolutionary designs and technologies of the C-2 system, including embedded operating systems and hypervisors. - Develop technology via approved software development life cycle approach. - Establish an independent validation and verification team to critique the performers during the design phase of the technologies.0.000 0.000 5.349 0.000 5.349 Volume 1 - 85UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #10 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 28 of 39Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-03: INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B.

Securing the Hosts will create new, safer, computer languages and compilers; formal automated proof tools and development environment for security throughout the execution model; and techniques for design and pre-run-time validation of executables. The Securing the Hosts program will take a clean slate approach to the execution model; executables will be crypto-bound to the lower levels of the execution model, subject to proofs checks, and constructed with security-aware languages. Technical approaches will include, but are not limited to co-development of hardware and low level system software, with cryptographic microcontrollers to permit cryptographic handshaking at all system layers; lower levels of the execution model establish a root of trust from the hardware out through the hypervisor and other secure low- level software, cryptographically bound to the upper levels of the execution model; novel hardware architectures for data-provenance tracking, access rights enforcement, information flow tracking and tagging, cryptography, logic, memory, and data access to support secure execution; and provably secure hypervisor.

Clean slate architectures for Internet protocols are needed that reflect security and trust explicitly in their design, starting with network and transport functions, to derive far greater roots of trust. Protocols that reflect more compute intensive approaches to control are enabled by the drastic reduction of computing cost, compared to design assumptions decades ago. Specific approaches will include, but are not limited to, cryptographic handshake at all network layers above physical and data link functions; network management software that exhibits strong roots of trust, running in trusted substrates; routers that permit significant computing power to be applied at intermediate points along the data pathways and provide virtualization features enabling multiple protocols to be deployed; and information movement based on object-by-object encryption, with accountability enforced in network appliances at all network levels. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Develop concepts for a clean-slate re-design of Internet protocols that reflect security and trust explicitly in their design, starting with layer 3 and 4 protocols (network and transport functions). - Develop concepts for an accountable cyberinfrastructure in which it is possible to trace flows to establish the provenance, and by implication the trustworthiness, of network data and information. - Create initial designs for Internet protocols that reflect security and trust explicitly in their design, starting with layer 3 and 4 protocols (network and transport functions). - Develop initial implementations for highly available, censorship-resistant network infrastructure.

FY 2011 Base Plans: - Create overarching system architecture for rapid replanning incorporating environmental and tactical uncertainty. - Design automated identification of the controlling and nuisance parameters to control accuracy. Cyber Immune (U) Cyber security is one of the top challenges facing the DoD and the nation. Despite many years of research in this area, the security of the Internet and our computing systems continues to be insufficient to support the degree of dependence that is increasingly vested in this infrastructure by the military and industry. At the same time, in several other areas such as robotics, DARPA has made significant new breakthroughs by using the mechanisms of biological systems as inspiration for radical re-thinking of basic hardware and system designs. This project seeks to accomplish the same in the cyber-security area. It will investigate and develop new approaches to cyber-security inspired by biological systems, in order to gain major improvements. Higher levels of system security will come from new biologically inspired models that will replace the failed model of perimeter defense that currently dominates today's information systems. This project will develop cyber-resilient systems that assume security cannot be absolute, yet a system that can still defend itself in order to maintain its (possibly degraded) capabilities, and possibly even heal itself.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) This project is developing powerful new technologies for processing foreign languages that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of military and national security needs, both tactical and strategic. The technologies and systems developed in this project will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means. (U) Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wide range of cultures and peoples. The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable communication with the local population during tactical missions. Thus, tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign- language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation. (U) Because foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and captured foreign-language hard-copy documents can provide insights regarding local and regional events, attitudes and activities, language translation systems also contribute to the development of good strategic intelligence. Such applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) translation. Exploitation of the resulting translated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in timely and relevant forms. B.

Multilingual Automatic Document Classification, Analysis and Translation (MADCAT) (U) The Multilingual Automatic Document Classification, Analysis and Translation (MADCAT) program will develop and integrate technology to enable exploitation of captured, foreign language, hard-copy documents. This technology is crucial to the warfighter, as hard-copy documents including notebooks, letters, ledgers, annotated maps, newspapers, newsletters, leaflets, pictures of graffiti, and document images (e.g., PDF files, JPEG files, scanned TIFF images, etc.) resident on magnetic and optical media captured in the field may contain important, but perishable information. Unfortunately, due to limited human resources and the immature state of applicable technology, the Services lack the ability to exploit in a timely fashion ideographic and script documents that are either machine printed or handwritten in Arabic. The MADCAT program will address this need by producing devices that will convert such captured documents to readable English in the field. MADCAT will substantially improve the applicable technologies, in particular document analysis and optical character recognition/optical handwriting recognition (OCR/OHR). MADCAT will then tightly integrate these improved technologies with translation technology and create demonstration prototypes for field trials.12.639 13.500 15.375 0.000 15.375 Volume 1 - 94UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #10 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 37 of 39Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-04: LANGUAGE TRANSLATION B.

Robust Automatic Translation of Speech (RATS) (U) The Robust Automatic Translation of Speech (RATS) program will address noisy and hostile conditions where speech is degraded by distortion, reverberation, and/or competing conversations. Research into the issue of robustness to enhance the capabilities of speech processing will enable soldiers to hear or read clear English versions of what is being said in their vicinity, despite a noisy or echoic environment. In extremely noisy conditions, the technology developed through RATS will be able to isolate and deliver pertinent information to the warfighter by detecting periods of speech activity and discarding silent portions. RATS technology will also be able to detect the language spoken, identify the speaker, and search for key words in dialogue. RATS technology will build upon advances in GALE translation technology.

These technologies will lead to systems with increased self reliance, cooperative behavior, and the capacity to reconfigure themselves and survive with reduced programmer intervention. These capabilities will make the difference between mission success and mission degradation or failure, even in the event of cyber-attack or component attrition resulting from kinetic warfare or accidental faults and errors. Systems that learn and reason will reduce the requirement for skilled system administrators and dramatically reduce the overall cost of system maintenance. As the military moves towards a dynamic expeditionary force, it is critical for systems to become more self sufficient. B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) (U) The Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program enables intelligence in information processing systems so that critical DoD systems can better support the warfighter. PAL systems will have embedded learning capabilities that will allow them to retain prior learned knowledge, apply this knowledge to new scenarios and ultimately provide faster and more effective assistance. Overall, the ability to learn will enable the performance of a PAL system to improve over time. Cognitive systems technologies developed in this program will be applied and demonstrated in ongoing and future Command and Control Systems programs. (U) The PAL program is creating the first comprehensive system that will dramatically empower commanders to understand all aspects of the current military situation, radically reduce manpower and labor required in command posts and in the field, and automate the massive number of administrative and analytical tasks characteristic of today's command centers.

Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total (U) The Integrated Learning program is creating a new computer learning paradigm in which systems learn complex workflows from warfighters while the warfighters perform their regular duties. The effort is focused on military planning tasks such as air operations center planning and military medical logistics. With this learning technology, it will be possible to create many different types of military decision support systems that learn by watching experts rather than relying on expensive and error prone hand-encoded knowledge. The new learning paradigm differs from conventional machine learning in that it does not rely on large amounts of carefully crafted training data. Rather, in the new paradigm the learner works to \"figure things out\" by combining many different types of learning, reasoning, and knowledge. Such a cognitive system will ultimately need the capability to build and update its own internal model of the world and the objects in it without human input. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Modified the integrated learning systems so they can incorporate new software components dynamically and utilize the new capabilities while learning. - Created control algorithms for the systems that manage credit-and-blame assignment on a component-by-component basis so that if conflicts arise the system can reason about which piece of conflicting information is more likely to be accurate. - Created control algorithms that reason about the costs/benefits of resolving a particular conflict and direct system performance accordingly. - Evaluated systems by having them compete against expert humans. FY 2010 Plans: - Expand the scope of the problems being learned so the systems learn multi-user task models. - Modify the integrated learning systems to be able to abstract the details of the process it is learning and learn general process or meta process knowledge. - Extend capabilities of the integrated learning systems so they can share information (low-level data, mid-level hypothesis, and high-level conclusions) with other learners. - Evaluate systems by having them compete against expert humans.

Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total Bootstrapped Learning (U) The Bootstrapped Learning program will provide computers with the capability to learn complex concepts the same way people do: from a customized curriculum designed to teach a hierarchy of concepts at increasing levels of complexity. Learning each new level depends on having successfully mastered the previous level's learning. In addition, the learning program will be \"reprogrammable\" in the field using the same modes of natural instruction used to train people without the need for software developers to modify the software code. At each level, a rich set of knowledge sources (such as training manuals, examples, expert behaviors, simulators, and references and specifications that are typically used by people learning to perform complex tasks) will be combined and used to generate concepts and a similar set of knowledge sources for the next level. This will enable rapid learning of complex high-level concepts, a capability which is essential for autonomous military systems that will need to understand not only what to do but, why they are doing it, and when what they are doing may no longer be appropriate. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Developed a single system capable of being instructed to perform in three diverse domains. - Demonstrated the ability of a system to repeatedly acquire new knowledge that drives future learning and cumulatively adds to the system's knowledge. - Validated through simulation that diagnosis, configuration and control of critical, autonomous military hardware can be addressed with bootstrapped learning technology. FY 2010 Plans: - Establish incontrovertible system generality by demonstrating learning performance in a \"surprise\" domain that is completely unknown to the learning system developers. - Enhance system capabilities to include instructible situational awareness.9.081 8.650 0.000 0.000 0.000 Volume 1 - 104UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #11 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 24Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602304E: COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEMSPROJECT COG-02: COGNITIVE COMPUTING B. Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total (U) The Machine Reading and Reasoning Technology program will develop enabling technologies to acquire, integrate, and use high performance reasoning strategies in knowledge-rich domains. Such technologies will provide DoD decision makers with rapid, relevant knowledge from a broad spectrum of sources that may be dynamic and/or inconsistent. To address the significant challenges of context, temporal information, complex belief structures, and uncertainty, new capabilities are needed to extract key information and metadata, and to exploit these via context-capable search and inference (both deductive and inductive). Machine reading addresses the prohibitive cost of handcrafting information by replacing the expert, and associated knowledge engineer, with un-supervised or self-supervised learning systems that \"read\" natural text and insert it into AI knowledge bases especially encoded to support subsequent machine reasoning. Machine reading requires the integration of multiple technologies: natural language processing must be used to transform the text into candidate internal representations, and knowledge representation and reasoning techniques must be used to test this new information to determine how it is to be integrated into the system's evolving models so that it can be used for effective problem solving. These concepts and technology development efforts will continue in PE 0602305E, Project MCN-01 beginning in FY 2011. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Initiated research into techniques for reasoning with ambiguous and conflicting information found in texts. - Extended knowledge representation to support machine reading of large (e.g. open source web) amounts of material with the goal of encoding and querying at broad but shallow semantic levels. - Produced domain representations that enable semi-supervised approaches to knowledge acquisition. FY 2010 Plans: - Demonstrate the ability of a system to acquire and organize factual information directly from unstructured narrative text in multiple domains.

Foundational Learning Technology (U) The Foundational Learning Technology program develops advanced machine learning techniques that enable cognitive systems to continuously learn, adapt and respond to new situations by drawing inferences from past experience and existing information stores. The techniques developed under Foundational Learning Technology address diverse machine learning challenges in processing of sensory inputs, language acquisition, combinatorial algorithms, strategic analysis, planning, reasoning, and reflection. One very promising approach involves transfer learning techniques that transfer knowledge and skills learned for specific situations to novel, unanticipated situations and thereby enable learning systems to perform appropriately and effectively the first time a novel situation is encountered. This is essential because most military operations occur in ever-changing environments; U.S. forces and systems must be able to act appropriately and effectively the first time each novel situation is encountered. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated the ability of agents to learn in a visual domain and apply the knowledge to solve problems in an action domain such as robotic grasping. - Demonstrated improved entity extraction performance with multiple languages and styles of writing by transferring knowledge between problem classes.

Robust Robotics (U) The Robust Robotics program is developing advanced robotic technologies that will enable autonomous (unmanned) mobile platforms to perceive, understand, and model their environment; navigate through complex, irregular, and hazardous terrain; manipulate objects without human control or intervention; make intelligent decisions corresponding to previously programmed goals; and interact cooperatively with other autonomous and manned vehicles. These capabilities will enable robotic vehicles to support warfighters in diverse environments including urban, ground, air, space, and underwater. A key objective is intelligent control of mobile manipulators to independently perform subtasks over a broad range of domains of interest to the warfighter, thereby reducing operator workload, time on target, training time, bandwidth, and hardware complexity. Another key objective is robust navigation and locomotion even in the absence of GPS, since this underlies the ability to move through the difficult and unpredictable terrain of theater operations, which may include highly irregular and mountainous areas, partially-destroyed roads, rubble-filled urban terrain, and other vehicles and personnel. Robust Robotics is also developing techniques for robots to perform in dynamic environments by improving robotic vision and scene understanding. This includes the capability to predict the future location and even the intent of moving objects in order that robots can handle both movement and clutter simultaneously and plan a collision-free course through the environment. Future autonomous systems must also achieve a much higher autonomy level when performing complex tasks, and so Robust Robotics is developing techniques that will enable robotic agents to achieve15.000 16.490 20.500 0.000 20.500 Volume 1 - 107UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #11 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 10 of 24Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602304E: COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEMSPROJECT COG-02: COGNITIVE COMPUTING B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies. This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces. Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated decision support, information sharing, and ensured communications. Cognitive decision support tools reason about tasks, timings, and interactions so that when plans change or the enemy does not respond as anticipated, U.S. forces can quickly adapt. The quality of such decisions and the effectiveness of our actions depend critically on our ability to take full advantage of all available information in a rapid and flexible manner. This requires the capability to share information and to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad tactical battlespace awareness. Finally, team cohesion requires effective and reliable communication in difficult environments such as urban settings where radio signal propagation is complex. Here the approach is to develop cognitive communications management and control algorithms that reason about channel conditions, higher-level application connectivity requirements and related factors, and decide (often as a group) what parameters each radio will use. The suite of programs under this project will significantly advance the military's ability to successfully deal with complex situations in operational environments. B.

These technologies will allow the military to focus its critical manpower resources on the mission rather than on the maintenance of its information systems and network infrastructure. Cognitive information processing will be used to optimize networked communications based on current conditions, past experience and high-level user guidance. The Cognitive Networking program is also addressing the warfighter's need for actionable situational awareness in complex radio frequency (RF) environments. This work leverages advances in software-defined radio technology to achieve specific military goals. The program has interest in machine learning techniques that can enhance the effectiveness of jamming and other RF countermeasures. So-called \"cognitive jamming\" has the potential to deny the enemy's effective use of the RF spectrum. The Cognitive Networks effort funds three programs: SAPIENT, LANDroids, and BOSS. The Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT) effort will develop a new generation of cognitive protocol architectures to replace conventional protocols that fare poorly in extreme network conditions and do not provide adequate service for key applications. Technology developed in the SAPIENT effort will have military utility wherever tactical communications are deployed. SAPIENT architectures will represent awareness with a knowledge base that is updated based on specification and observation. SAPIENT technology enables the automatic adaptation of protocols to the operational environment to dramatically reduce the effect of network impairments on applications while demonstrating a positive trend in capability as new situations are encountered and learned. The Local Area Network droids (LANdroids) effort will give warfighters reliable communications in urban settings. LANdroids will accomplish this by creating robotic radio relay nodes that move autonomously to configure and maintain a communications mesh by reasoning about their positions relative to one another and relative to the warfighters. LANdroids will move as the warfighters move with the goal of maintaining warfighter connectivity throughout their operations. LANdroids will be pocket-sized so warfighters can carry several and drop or deploy them as they move through an area.

The Brood of Spectrum Supremacy (BOSS) effort will provide actionable situational awareness to the warfighter in complex radio frequency (RF) environments. BOSS adds collaborative processing capabilities to tactical software-defined radios to achieve specific military goals. BOSS exploits cooperative use of computational, communication and sensory capabilities in a software radio, in aggregate, to generate breakthrough capabilities in the warfighter knowledge of their surroundings, with a particular focus on RF-rich urban operations. Machine learning techniques will enable real- time characterization of an adversary's radio dynamics and provide cognitive, networked responses to new enemy threats. Ultimately this effort will develop Software Communications Architecture (SCA)- compliant waveforms suitable for implementation on a tactical software radio system.

Cloud Computing (U) Cloud Computing is a technique to enable information, applications, services, storage, and other resources that reside on military networks to be used by web-based clients to perform critical mission functions. The Cloud Computing program will create architectures to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad tactical battlespace awareness. The Cloud Computing program will produce the infrastructure and application technologies needed to automate the integration of multiple media (text, video, and digital photographs) as well as its analysis, indexing, and storage so that it can be easily queried and retrieved by users across the DoD enterprise. Inherent to such ubiquitous availability of enterprise data is the need for strong security including fine-grained/role-based access controls.

The Digital Object Storage and Retrieval (DOSR) effort is pursuing a network-based approach to information storage and management that will enable a network-based repository to hold all digital information. The DOSR repository will reside on the network and provide a mechanism for the virtual (i.e., logical, not physical) centralization of all enterprise information. DOSR technology will enable and facilitate controlled access to information by approved and authenticated users across administrative domains, and in this fashion it will enable transparent sharing of information across the enterprise.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Machine Intelligence project is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it is developing technologies that will enable computing systems to extract and encode information from dynamic and stored data, observations, and experience, and to derive new knowledge, answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations. Enabling computing systems with machine intelligence in this manner is now of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems continuously generate and deliver data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act. Since its creation over 50 years ago, artificial intelligence (AI) has gone through several phases. Initially, AI emphasized rule-based and symbolic approaches. These were eventually reconceived using a human-intelligence paradigm (\"cognitive computing\"). Recently, a more powerful approach has emerged, with rule-based, symbolic and human-oriented approaches combined with large-scale statistical approaches that make explicit use of massive distributed data and information bases. These data/information bases are curated (e.g., machine-filtered or human-selected) and raw (e.g., as originally obtained and perhaps of unknown provenance); structured (e.g., tabular or relational) and unstructured (e.g., text documents, multi-media files); static (e.g., historical, unchanging) and dynamic (e.g., real-time sensor data). This explosion in available data/information, combined with the ready availability of inexpensive mass storage and ubiquitous, inexpensive, computation-on-demand, provide the foundation for entirely new machine intelligence capabilities. The technologies developed in the Machine Intelligence project will result in revolutionary capabilities in military command and control, intelligence, decision-making, and situational awareness/indications and warning for a complex, global environment where traditional (e.g., nation-states) and non-traditional (e.g., trans-national) actors and new classes of cyber-physical-human threats have become the status quo.

Such technologies will provide DoD decision makers with rapid, relevant knowledge from a broad spectrum of sources that may be dynamic and/ or inconsistent.

DoD systems sense, capture, and store information in the form of text, audio, imagery, and video, and so advanced machine reasoning capabilities must extract knowledge from, and reason about, all types of multimedia data. New visual faculties will enable cognitive systems to learn from visual experience, to reason about action in the real world, and to apply that knowledge in a broad range of domains to solve problems in tactical and security contexts. (U) Machine Reading addresses the prohibitive cost of handcrafting information by replacing the expert, and associated knowledge engineer, with un-supervised or self-supervised learning systems, systems that \"read\" natural text and insert it into AI knowledge bases, i.e. data stores especially encoded to support subsequent machine reasoning. Machine Reading requires the integration of multiple technologies: natural language processing must be used to transform the text into candidate internal representations, and knowledge representation and reasoning techniques must be used to test this new information to determine how it is to be integrated into the system's evolving models so that it can be used for effective problem solving. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Extend knowledge extraction capabilities of machine reading systems to acquire simple relationship information in addition to factual data. - Force generality of machine reading systems through introduction of multiple, hidden domains. - Develop knowledge extraction, representation, and reasoning capabilities to support spatial, complex temporal, and event reasoning. - Develop an abductive inference system that discovers explanatory relationships between formal assertions without need of formal proof. - Integrate new visual reasoning components into a complete architecture that combines visual concept learning, analysis, and imagination with facilities for low-level visual processing, cognition, and user/system interfaces.

Program interest extends to semantic web technologies whereby the semantics of information and services are made explicit, enabling machines to understand and satisfy the information requests of users (people and machines). This will provide the basis for semantically-enabled search and processing capabilities that automate information discovery and manipulation. The Web-Scale Information Integration program will also create a new suite of intelligent information integration tools that will learn to automatically understand heterogeneous information systems and integrate them into the existing information environment. In this fashion the Web-Scale Information Integration program will enable virtual interoperability of information systems that are currently stovepiped. The result will be more complete and reliable information as the basis for better decision-making for warfighters.0.000 0.000 13.786 0.000 13.786 Volume 1 - 126UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #12 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 7Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602305E: MACHINE INTELLIGENCE C.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total Unconventional Therapeutics (U) This thrust is developing unique and unconventional approaches to ensure that soldiers are protected against a wide variety of naturally occurring, indigenous or engineered threats. Past successes in this effort have come from developing therapeutics that are designed to work against broad classes of pathogens. Work in this area has also uncovered new approaches to therapeutics that, rather than attacking specific pathogens, enhance innate human immune mechanisms against broad classes of pathogens. Integral to these efforts is the development of methods that rapidly identify a broad spectrum of pathogens. Not only will these approaches be more effective against known pathogens, they also promise to offer substantial protection against unknown pathogens including engineered and emerging pathogens from third-world environments. (U) A current emphasis is on the discovery and development of technologies that will allow a rapid response (within weeks) to unanticipated threats, whether they are naturally encountered emerging diseases or agents from intentional attack. This thrust has a goal of radically transforming the protein design process by researching and developing new mathematical and biochemical approaches to the in silico design of proteins with specific functions.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total Super-Fast Submerged Transport (U) The Super-Fast Submerged Transport program (Underwater Express) will explore the application of supercavitation technology to underwater vehicles, enabling high speed transport of personnel and/ or supplies. The inherent advantages of traveling underwater are: the ability to transit clandestinely, no radar or visible signature, and avoidance of rough sea conditions that may limit or deny mission execution. Supercavitation places the vehicle inside a cavity where vapor replaces the water, and drag due to fluid viscosity is reduced by orders of magnitude, thus reducing the power requirement dramatically. This program will use modeling, simulation, experiments and testing to develop the understanding of the physical phenomena associated with supercavitation and the application to underwater vehicles.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total vehicles and reinforced structures. Current technology uses chemical explosive energy to form the jets and fragments. This is highly inefficient and requires precise machining of the metal liners from which the fragments and jets are formed. Generating multiple jets or fragments from a single explosive is difficult and the timing of the multiple jets or fragments cannot be controlled. MAHEM offers the potential for higher efficiency, greater control, the ability to generate and accurately time multiple jets and fragments from a single charge, and the potential for aimable, multiple warheads with a much higher EFJ velocity, hence increased lethality precision, than conventional EFJ/SFP. MAHEM could be packaged into a missile, projectile or other platform, and delivered close to target for final engagement. This could provide the warfighter with a means to address stressing missions such as: lightweight active self-protection for vehicles (potential defeat mechanism for a kinetic energy round), counter armor (passive, reactive, and active), mine countermeasures, and anti-ship cruise missile final layer of defense. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Successfully tested a static brassboard prototype of a self-contained MAHEM munition to demonstrate the ability to package a MAHEM device into a shoulder-launched munition form factor. FY 2010 Plans: - Using theoretical models, design flux compression generator (FCG) components in preparation for fabrication and testing of the armature and stator configuration with static and dynamic loads. - Perform testing of FCG components. - Design, model, and fabricate shaped charge liners and magnetically formed penetrators (MFPs) that will provide maximum penetration against hardened targets of interest. - Test shaped charge liners and MFPs.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total Lightweight Ceramic Armor (LCA) (U) The Lightweight Ceramic Armor (LCA) program leverages recent breakthroughs in novel ceramic fabrication processes developed in the Materials Processing Technology project to drive a dramatic performance shift in the trade-off between weight and ballistic projectile protection of body armor. Currently fielded Boron Carbide body armor is heavy and limited in the diversity of shapes that may be molded. Its weight and bulk limit a soldier's agility and mobility, and its cost prohibits consideration of using it to protect vehicles. Recent breakthroughs in ceramics processing technology offers the opportunity for cost effective fabrication of molded shapes, the retention of nanostructured grains for significantly higher energy dissipation, a fifty percent reduction in weight for equal ballistic protection, and similar reduction in cost. The focus areas of the program are: the optimization of the material composition and nanostructure for maximum protection per unit weight and cost, and scale up of the fabrication technology to body armor size scale articles. The program will additionally investigate the potential for the development of dramatically improved ballistic armored headgear along these same lines. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Optimized integrated backing materials - ceramic armor materials systems for minimum weight at Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts ESAPI ballistic performance. - Evaluated the characteristics of an optimized LCA system optimized for minimum weight at ESAPI ballistic performance.

Crosshairs (U) The Crosshairs program seeks to develop a vehicle mounted threat detection and countermeasure system that will detect, locate, and engage enemy shooters against a variety of threats to include bullets, Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs), Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs), and direct fired mortars, both stationary and on the move. Threat identification and localization will be accomplished in sufficient time to enable both automatic and man-in-the-loop responses. Phase I of the program focused on initial development and testing of the Crosshairs sensor system. Phase IA culminated with a static live fire test to determine the most effective candidate sensor system. During Phase IB, enhancements were made to the sensor system for on the move performance, and on the move testing against multiple threats was conducted. DARPA and the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) entered into an MOA for Phase IIA. Phase IIA consisted of a moving demonstration of the hardened, packaged, and enhanced Phase I sensor system on two networked HMMWVs (Humvee), integration with candidate response systems, and testing and evaluation of the complete systems in relevant environments. The program is currently in Phase IIB. During this phase, the Crosshairs sensor system is being integrated with the Iron Curtain Active Protection System (IC-APS) on four up- armored vehicles. At the end of Phase IIB, the Crosshairs systems will be ready for field testing. (U) The Concept of Operations is to provide a military vehicle with an affordable vehicle mounted detection and response system that operates both stationary and on the move for light tactical vehicles. Bullets will be detected and localized using the DARPA-developed Boomerang acoustic gunfire detection system. Radar detection of all other threats will be made using the CrossCue radar. Protection against incoming RPGs will be provided by the IC-APS. The CrossCue radar is a dual mode, continuous wave, and pulsed Doppler radar, which will be used to determine range, velocity, and angle of bearing of the incoming threat.

Counter Improvised Explosives Laboratories (CIEL) (U) Improvised explosives (IEs) are one of the most popular weapons used by terrorist groups. Over the past twenty years, IEs have become very common due to their easy preparation and the high availability of raw materials. Efficient methods for detecting and neutralizing/desensitizing sensitive explosives labs in an urban environment will minimize interference with troop operations and minimize collateral damages. The goal of the Counter Improvised Explosives Laboratories (CIEL) program is to develop the infrastructure and methodology for novel chemo-sensors that would identify labs that are building IEs to a very high degree of specificity and reliability; and develop the infrastructure for tools for safe handling of improvised explosives and their mixtures. The CIEL program will also examine methods to improve current collection techniques used to detect sensitive explosives and their residues in an urban environment. The goal is to develop a detection system that is sufficiently selective and sensitive for collection of trace explosives; this system will be field-deployable and will provide clear and fast identification of the target explosive with minimal impact on troop operations.

An objective unit cell laser module with integrated power and thermal management is being designed and fabricated by two laser suppliers and will demonstrate an output power of >34 kW. Based on the results of the unit cell demonstration, additional laser modules will be fabricated to produce a 150 kW laser that will be demonstrated in a laboratory environment. The 150 kW laser will then be integrated with beam control, prime power, thermal management, safety, and command and control subsystems that are based upon existing technologies to produce a laser weapon system demonstrator. The capability to shoot down tactical targets such as surface-to-air missiles and rockets and the capability to perform ultra-precise offensive engagements will be demonstrated in a realistic ground test environment. Additional funding for this integration effort will be provided for HELLADS testing in Project NET-01, PE 0603766E starting in FY 2011.

Aero-Adaptive/Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) (U) The goal of the Aero-Adaptive/Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) program is to improve the performance of high energy lasers on tactical aircraft against targets in the aft field of regard. In order to achieve high off-boresight targeting capability, current optical turret designs protrude into the flow. This causes severe aero-optic distortions in the aft field of regard due to turbulence in the wake and the unsteady shock movement over the aperture. These distortions decrease the power flux on target (the measure of lethality for a directed energy system) and consequently limit the directed energy system to targets in the forward field of regard. This program will optimize flow control strategies for pointing angles in the aft field of regard. The program will also explore the ability of the flow control system to be synchronized with adaptive optics. This effort will initially focus on wind tunnel testing to prove the feasibility of steady and periodic flow control techniques to reduce or regularize the large scale turbulent structures surrounding an optical turret. These tests will culminate in a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration utilizing flow control with an adaptive optics system in a full-scale wind tunnel test for the turret. Following successful wind tunnel demonstrations, a preliminary design of a flight test turret incorporating flow control will be undertaken.

RealWorld (U) The RealWorld program exploits technical innovation and integration to provide any U.S. warfighter with the ability to open a laptop computer and rehearse a specific mission in the relevant geo-specific terrain, with realistic physics. Because the system will be scalable and distributed, warfighters can practice by themselves, in small groups, or with as many other warfighters as needed for the mission over a local or distributed network, and across all relevant platforms (dismounts, vehicles, helicopters, and fast movers). Most important is the understanding that RealWorld is not a static simulation; it is a simulation builder with applications across the spectrum of modern kinetic and non-kinetic warfare. The program is building tools that allow warfighters to rapidly and easily build their own missions though the introduction of new methodology for building simulation software. These methodologies and adherence to a highly modular approach will cause a fundamental paradigm shift in the acquisition, as well as the construction, of DoD modeling and simulation products.

Infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems in particular depend on intense sources at these bands. The current generation IRCM systems utilize diode-pumped Thulium (Tm) lasers used to pump optical parametric oscillators, most commonly based on zinc germanium phosphide. (U) The lasers developed in this program will operate across the three relevant bands within the MWIR at 10 W power with wall plug efficiencies of at least 10 percent. By virtue of the enormous volumetric reduction (100-1000 times), power reduction (ten times), and superior pulse format (cw-operation), such sources will enable new architectures and approaches permitting IRCM systems to be deployed on platforms (e.g., rotocraft) which are highly vulnerable to Man Portable Air Defense Systems and other threats but for which current IRCM systems are prohibitive or are inadequate (e.g., unable to defeat staring sensors). At least two diode-based laser approaches will be explored in this program, both involving antimonide-based compound semiconductor materials. These include intersubband-based quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) and type-II antimonide lasers, including so-called \"W-configuration\" approaches, the name taken from the shape of the conduction band profile. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Scaled the power, in a parallel development, of the efficient individual QCL sources developed previously. FY 2010 Plans: - Demonstrate epitaxial growth and preliminary characterization of final structures.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total Helicopter Quieting (U) Studies and analysis of military helicopter operations have shown that the survivability and lethality of U.S. helicopters can be increased by reducing the range at which their acoustic signature can be detected and recognized. The goal of the Helicopter Quieting program is to advance the capability for analytical development of advanced rotor technologies that will dramatically enhance the survivability of military rotor systems while enabling improvements to performance, affordability, availability and suitability. A critical element toward this goal is to create and demonstrate a physics-based toolset that enables analytical design of novel rotor systems and rotorcraft for reduced acoustic susceptibility (detection and recognition) by human and electro-acoustic threats. (U) Current rotor development is very costly involving a time-consuming iterative, trial and error cycle of analysis and model wind tunnel tests, or occasionally, a faster but much riskier analysis path directly to full-scale wind tunnel/flight test. Additionally, the primary limitation of existing computational models is their inability to accurately predict the pressure distribution on a rotor blade and in the flowfield away from the blade.

(U) The Helicopter Quieting program will also optimize survivability by developing propagation and perception modeling for rotorcraft acoustic signatures within state-of-the-art visualization architectures. Multiple advanced human perception and cueing models will be developed as a part of the integrated acoustic design and analysis environment. The ability of the toolset to accurately characterize the differences in these factors will support design decisions for advanced rotors and rotorcraft that exhibit dramatically reduced perceptibility. The toolset will also enable assessment of operational tactics, techniques, and procedures, to include pilot technique, toward optimization for survivability.

Operations in the urban terrain require sensors that can navigate in difficult terrain and be inserted without being detected. Small air vehicles capable of navigating interior domains without GPS would enable autonomous prosecution of a number of high risk missions that are currently performed by warfighters.

Drag reduction allows aircraft to fly at increased ranges, reduces fuel consumption, and may allow increased payload capacity. Formation flight is used in nature by geese and other migratory birds to reduce drag, but requires the development of an autonomous system to maintain the optimum position for drag reduction to be practical for long duration aircraft flights. Safety of flight considerations require aircraft separation distances of up to one mile, necessitating automated sensing and tracking algorithms to track the lead aircraft wake.

The goal is to define the major components and overall design of a TX vehicle that would be suitable for military scouting, personnel transport, and logistics missions. Technical areas that will be explored include: hybrid electric drive ducted fan propulsion system, ring motors, energy storage methods such as batteries and ultra capacitors, morphing vehicle bodies, and advanced flight controls and flight management systems. The TX vehicle is intended to make roads irrelevant for military small unit maneuvers. These units can use TX air vehicles to fly over obstacles or impassible terrain, avoid ambushes and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Personal TX vehicles could be dispatched for downed airman recovery or for evacuating injured personnel from difficult to access locations, or to resupply isolated small units.

Counter-Unmanned Air Vehicles (C-UAV) (U) The components to construct long range, autonomous unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are ubiquitous. Off-the-shelf hobbyist navigation systems are capable of following GPS waypoints. Vision based systems can track roads or follow on-the-ground moving targets. Small engines and payloads can be accommodated in relatively small aircraft. Slow, low-altitude UAVs are difficult to distinguish from migratory birds, or even ground vehicles, and are frequently filtered out of radar systems by clutter filters for this reason. These vehicles pose a threat to future military operations. Already, UAVs have been used in combat operations against allies of the United States. Countries with little or no capability to field a manned air force are using UAVs for surveillance and reconnaissance. In the future, the electronics required to navigate and control these aircraft will become increasingly available and affordable. The Counter-Unmanned Air Vehicles (C-UAV) program will investigate methods for defeating such threats. The program will study a range of technologies from detection, to tracking and identification of UAVs, to intercept or defeat. Traditional detection systems, used for large manned aircraft, require modification to detect small, slow, low-altitude UAVs. Data fusion from multiple sensors may be required to unambiguously identify small UAVs and differentiate them from other objects such as birds and ground vehicles. The intercept of these UAVs, which may be launched from close range, may require novel approaches. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Assess current UAV threats; classify types of vehicles and missions. - Assess current UAV detection capabilities, including radar, acoustic, vision-based, infrared, and capabilities of each. - Perform initial assessment of viable approaches to UAV detection.0.000 0.000 5.100 0.000 5.100 Volume 1 - 188UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #18 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 49 of 60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-07: AERONAUTICS TECHNOLOGY Accomplishments/Planned Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total Integrated Compact Engine Flow Path (U) The goal of the Integrated Compact Engine Flow Path program was to fully integrate the aircraft structure and propulsion flowpath.

The mission applications share data to form consistent battlespace understanding tailored to the needs of commanders at each node. The types of tailoring include common operational pictures, timelines, and resource usage descriptions. The mission applications also negotiate plans for future operations based on mission needs presented at each node. To maintain focus on operationally relevant problems, the project's technical goals are posed and evaluated in the context of mixed manned/unmanned forces. (U) Technologies developed in this project enable localized and distributed collaborative processing. This allows networks of sensors to rapidly adapt to changing force mixes, communications connectivity, and mission objectives while enabling distributed command and intelligence systems to effectively collaborate in a dynamic environment. Technologies are demonstrated and evaluated in the laboratory and in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations. Demonstrations employ both stationary and autonomous mobile platforms. Operational benefits are: 1) smaller forward deployment of image and signal analysts in complex operating conditions including urban battlefields; 2) deeper understanding of the evolving stability and support operational environment; 3) consistent integration of target and environment information; and 4) flexible operational tactics and procedures to find evasive targets in difficult environments.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total ability to quickly search large volumes of existing video data and monitor real-time video data for specific activities or events will provide a dramatic new capability to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. Currently, video analysis for Predator and other aerial video surveillance platforms is very labor intensive, and limited to metadata queries, manual annotations, and \"fast-forward\" examination of clips. The software tools developed under VIRAT will radically improve the analysis of huge volumes of video data by: 1) alerting operators when specific events or activities occur at specific locations or over a range of locations and; 2) enabling fast, content-based searches of existing video archives. The VIRAT program is developing innovative algorithms for activity representation, matching and recognition which can support both indexing and retrieval. The primary focus of VIRAT is activity-based and dynamic information. Object/scene matching and recognition are also of interest, but only to the extent they support activity analysis. The final product of the VIRAT program is a system that can be transitioned to and integrated within an operational military system, such as the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS). FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Developed multiple initial sets of descriptors for activities in videos. - Developed initial indexing methods for activity descriptors and several search methods against those indices. - Developed initial interactive query refinement methods to fine tune and improve the query and retrieval process. - Developed preliminary interactive retrieval processes to either alert the user or return to the user matching \"activities of interest\". FY 2010 Plans: - Refine and further develop critical technologies to accommodate concatenated and more complex activities. - Continue developing efficient indexing and interactive retrieval against thirty activities.

Home Field (U) The Home Field program develops networked video and Laser Detection and Ranging (LADAR) processing technology to rapidly and reliably update a 3-Dimensional (3-D) model of an urban area. It provides 3-D situational awareness with sufficient detail and accuracy to remove the \"home field advantage\" enjoyed by opponents. Detailed mobility maps to support ground vehicle routing will be inferred and generated, and detailed visibility data to support sensor positioning will then be derived to maximize coverage and minimize detectability. High fidelity baselines will be created to support change detection to cue searches for targets and anticipate changes due to current or impending meteorological events. The program will supply real-time context information to sensor managers, maneuver controllers, weapons operators, and commanders. Furthermore, the program will filter natural change from artificial change indicative of human (threat) activity and permit operation of military forces in hostile terrain normally deemed favorable to opponents because of their historical familiarity with hide points, sight lines, and mobility characteristics.12.513 20.578 8.225 0.000 8.225 Volume 1 - 193UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #18 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 54 of 60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-13: NETWORK CENTRIC ENABLING TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total (U) Drawing upon technologies developed in the Home Field program, the Urban Photonic Sandtable Display (UPSD) program is developing revolutionary interactive holographic displays for complex volumetric 3-D data to replace current 3-D visualization technologies that are either static or have limited effective field-of-view. Current technologies include traditional holography, computer graphics on 2-Dimensional (2-D) screens, slice stacking, parallax autostereo, and goggles/glasses. These techniques not only give a poor image quality and poor movement, they also are not created quickly and do not allow for collaborative viewer interaction. The desire to improve these components has launched the development of the UPSD. Applying the design fundamentals of the monochrome active grouping of pixels for a light modulator element into a single 3-D holographic pixel (hogel-based proof- of-concept) display and further developed module, a scalable and tileable laboratory prototype has been validated by transforming computer data to optical data, making sophisticated integration possible to optimize image quality. The UPSD program will develop an affordable 3-D display that operates at full video rate, displays red-green-blue (RGB) color, increases viewing angle, and increases display size. The result will be the world's first full-motion, full aspect 3-D imaging technology system. Utilizing the technologies developed under the Novel Technologies for Optoelectronics Materials Manufacturing (NTOMM) program in ELT-01, the Emissive Micro Displays program will develop technologies to support the fabrication of Low-cost High pixel density Power efficient Direct emission Microdisplays (LHPDM). Current microdisplay systems use light modulation systems (liquid crystal displays, digital micromirror devices,) and by using LHPDM, it will enable the transmission of larger fractions of light from the illumination source. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Researched advanced technologies for improving the production methods of pixilated emissive displays. - Demonstrated the final reconfigurable system at full video rate, color display, and with the capability of tiling to larger display scales (e.g., 6-feet by 6-feet). - Developed cost effective synthesis methods for Group II-VI and III-V materials.

Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) (U) The Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) program develops and integrates a set of data analysis tools into a unified information system to support Theater Security Cooperation (TSC). The ICEWS system monitors, assesses and forecasts leading indicators of events that make countries vulnerable to crises. ICEWS technologies include quantitative and computational social science modeling and simulation, scenario generation, ontological modeling of security problems, advanced interactive visualization techniques, and agent-based programming. When integrated, these tools allow combatant commanders and their staff to understand and anticipate conditions that precipitate instability and conflict while there is still time to influence them. ICEWS also helps anticipate unintended consequences of actions taken to influence or remediate situations, consequences that may be delayed by months or years.10.608 10.195 5.063 0.000 5.063 Volume 1 - 195UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #18 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 56 of 60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-13: NETWORK CENTRIC ENABLING TECHNOLOGY B.

Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) (U) The objective of the Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) program is to revolutionize rifle accuracy and range by developing the first ever guided small caliber bullet. The EXACTO 50- caliber round and optical sighting technology will more than double the day and nighttime range over current state-of-the-art sniper systems while allowing the sniper to prosecute moving targets even in high wind conditions, such as those commonly found in Afghanistan. Prosecution of these types of targets is impossible with current technology. This system will not only improve sniper effectiveness, but also enhance troop safety by allowing greater shooter standoff range and reduction in target engagement timelines. The system combines a maneuverable bullet and a real-time guidance system to track the target and deliver the projectile to target. Technology development includes the design and integration of aero-actuation controls, power sources, optical guidance systems, and sensors. The components must fit into the limited volume (2 cm to the third power) of a 50-caliber projectile and be designed to withstand a high acceleration environment.

Digital Media Exploitation (MEDEX) (U) The Digital Media Exploitation (MEDEX) program will develop technology to extract intelligence of tactical value from digital media found on computers captured in the field. MEDEX will automatically search content (text documents, audio files, images, videos, applications, etc.) and identify data of high intelligence value. Traditionally, the objective of a digital media exploitation system has been to extract content for later analysis, so accuracy (e.g., precision and recall) and scalability to multiple processors for large data volumes have been emphasized. However, warfighters may have very limited time to process the data for key evidence that may result in tactical advantage; therefore, speed and accuracy are critical.

PERsistent Stare Exploitation and Analysis System (PerSEAS) (U) The PERsistent Stare Exploitation and Analysis System (PerSEAS) program will develop and demonstrate a tool to automatically and interactively identify events of interest from persistent, wide area, motion imagery data with support from signal intelligence and other sources. Persistent, wide area surveillance imagery is an ever increasing source of operational data, but exploitation of this data at present is mostly manual and requires hours to days to produce results. Tools are needed to automatically detect potentially significant adversary activities and to discriminate these from nominal background activity. These tools would be supported by libraries of activity patterns, logic to generate hypotheses about which activities are being observed, and mechanisms to quantitatively score the consistency of the data with each activity hypothesis.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total (U) The Very High Efficiency Solar Cell (VHESC) program seeks to raise the system power efficiency of a new class of solar modules to forty percent and deliver engineering prototype modules that are producible. The modules use a novel optical system that splits light from the Sun into at least two different paths corresponding to the color of the light, and concentrates the light onto photovoltaic (PV) cells that cover different segments of the solar spectrum. System power efficiency includes all factors that impact the system (module) power efficiency, such as the transmission of light through the optics, as well as the individual efficiencies of the PV cells. Analysis predicts that fifty percent efficiency at the PV cell level yields a system power efficiency of at least forty percent. DARPA is developing the VHESC solar module technology for compact renewable energy to power both permanent and mobile bases, as well as to reduce the considerable logistical burden of supplying energy (e.g., batteries and fuel) to the warfighter in the field.

Maintaining Combat Performance (U) The Maintaining Combat Performance thrust utilizes breakthroughs in biology and physiology to sustain the peak physical and cognitive performance of warfighters operating in extreme conditions. Today, warfighters must accomplish their missions despite extraordinary physiologic stress. Examples of these stressors include extremes of temperature (-20 degrees F to 125 degrees F), oxygen deficiency in mountains, personal loads in excess of 100 lbs, dehydration, psychological stress, and even performance of life-sustaining maneuvers following combat injury. Not only must troops maintain optimum physical performance, but also peak cognitive performance, which includes the entire spectrum from personal navigation and target recognition, to complex command and control decisions, and intelligence synthesis. The Maintaining Combat Performance thrust leverages breakthroughs in diverse scientific fields in order to mitigate the effects of harsh combat environments. For example, understanding the natural mechanisms for core body temperature regulation in hibernating mammals has led to a novel, practical approach for soldier cooling, which is now being evaluated by troops in the far forward combat areas. Other examples include fundamental research elucidating the biological mechanisms of adaptation to extreme altitude, and the molecular correlates of muscle fatigue and psychological stress.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total severely injured warfighters. Implicit in this thrust is the fact that there are unique, warfighter-specific challenges in acute and chronic treatment that are not addressed by civilian research and development. Today, more than half of American battlefield fatalities are due to hemorrhage, particularly due to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). To prevent these deaths, there is an urgent need for technologies that enable relatively unskilled personnel (battlefield medics) to diagnose and treat injuries, including the ability to locate and coagulate non-compressible deep bleeders in the thorax or abdomen. Other critical needs stem from the fact that warfighters are frequently victims of blasts, causing patterns of brain, burn, and orthopedic injuries not seen in civilian medical practice. As such, there is a unique military need to develop systems for pain control that are safe even in medically unmonitored environments, such as an active battlefield. Once lives are saved, there is an unmet need for new methods to restore function, for example, by restoring long segments of bone that were lost due to blast fragmentation. The results of this program will greatly enhance our ability to save lives on the battlefield and provide restoration of normal function to survivors. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated extended survival time using an FDA-approved estrogen product after 60% total blood volume loss in swine hemorrhage model. - Developed a physiological-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of the cardiovascular system to aid in determining appropriate estrogen doses in humans suffering lethal hemorrhage. - Demonstrated blastemal associated initiation of early joint formation at appropriate site during healing. - The Deep Bleeder Acoustic Coagulation (DBAC) program is currently developing a portable, non- invasive, automated system for the detection, localization, and coagulation of deep bleeders that is operable in the combat environment by minimally trained personnel. The stationary wrap-around device must prove to be lightweight and operate on batteries. To this end, one therapy module and one detection and localization (D&L) module with weight commensurate to meet a full 40 x 80 cm cuff weight of less than or equal to 4.8 kg was successfully designed and built.

In the initial effort, the types of sensors that propagate entangled light out to and back from a target were proven to be ineffective when realistic scattering and absorption occur between the source and the target.

Self-HEALing mixed-signal Integrated Circuits (HEALICs) (U) The goal of the Self-HEALing mixed-signal Integrated Circuits (HEALICs) program is to develop technologies to autonomously maximize the number of fully operational mixed-signal systems-on-a- chip (SoC) per wafer that meet all performance goals in the presence of extreme process technology variations, environmental conditions, and aging.

Remoted Analog-to-Digital Converter with De-serialization and Reconstruction (RADER) (U) The objective of the Remoted Analog-to-Digital Converter with De-serialization and Reconstruction (RADER) program is to develop a novel analog to digital converter (ADC) front-end that acts as a performance multiplier for conventional ADCs. This program is an outgrowth of the Analog-to- Information research. The military's need to operate in dense signal environments, performing friendly communications and detecting low-power adversarial signals concurrently, requires ADCs with unparalleled resolution and wide instantaneous bandwidth (IBW). Commercial systems available today are capable of achieving high resolution, or wide bandwidth, but not both at the same time. To meet the military's need, the RADER program will develop a system that uses many commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) ADCs in conjunction with a novel de-serializer front-end architecture to meet both the resolution and bandwidth requirements simultaneously.

Advanced CAD (U) The Advanced Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Program will radically overhaul the way circuit and system design is carried out, and in the process make the most advanced technologies under development for DoD use accessible to a far broader base of talented designers than at present. The principle aim of this effort is to develop a unifying framework for design and simulation of electronic systems that intelligently and seamlessly harmonizes the multiple interacting phenomena that must be dealt with in state-of-the-art system development. For example, it has become essential to consider, across length-scales from nanometers to meters, the actions and interactions of electronic, electromagnetic, mechanical, thermal, quantum, and fabrication process effects. Also, it is critical to co- optimize and co-design system functions across all of these domains - currently not possible. In the past, clunky individual software modules would separately estimate system behavior in one domain at a time, then pass the estimates to subsequent domain-specific codes. This program will result in a unified and modern code base for this purpose, importantly incorporating device and technology models reaching well beyond the state-of-the-art into cutting edge technologies.

Another key goal of this effort is to integrate cognitive functions for immediate design assistance and real-time estimation to provide intuition-building feedback to the designer mimicking the effect of turning a knob and seeing what happens to a circuit on a bench. The overall outcome of this effort is expected to be a dramatic lowering of the barrier to entry for designers to access the best technologies, as well as a huge force multiplier in terms of designer productivity. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Demonstrate through simulations that co-design of processor algorithm achieves greater processing efficiency. - Develop tool set for design methodology for optimized co-design, demonstrating logical abstractions for hardware functional blocks and complex non-linear interactions between different functional blocks of a microsystem. - Investigate designs to demonstrate feasibility of two-times reduction in communication power for high density wafer-scale communication. Advanced Imaging (U) The ability to see farther with higher clarity and through darkness and/or obscurants is vital to nearly all military operations. At the same time, there is immense pressure to reduce the size, weight, and power (SWAP) requirements of advanced imaging systems. In the past, the main driver for this was the need for dismounted soldiers to carry the best available imaging tools - often a matter of life and death. With the advent of smaller and smaller UAVs, which can provide a huge advantage to our troops, the pressure to miniaturize and reduce power is even more intense. This program responds to that need by simultaneously pushing the envelope of imager performance through new detector devices and also dramatically reducing SWAP for UAV and head-worn applications.

Enabling Future Energy Concepts Through Microsystem Technologies (U) The DoD mission demands continuous pursuit of the most advanced portable, reliable and dense energy systems. A large number of critical systems are limited in performance and/or mission duration by the amount of electrical energy available at the point-of-use. This program seeks to create breakthrough advances in power storage, management and delivery, all enabled via the application of microsystems technologies. A core component of this effort will be the development of new architectures, reversible electrode structures, materials, and chemistries for the development of rechargeable, high energy density batteries that match or exceed energy density of hydrocarbon fuels (e.g. gasoline, JP8, etc.), requiring the energy density to increase over ten-fold compared to current lithium ion batteries. An equally important aspect of this program is the development of novel electromagnetic switching power converters to optimize the efficiency of energy use at the micro scale. In order to achieve this, both materials and circuits are necessary. Advanced micromagnetic materials and fabrication techniques will be developed to achieve greatly improved performance (i.e., > 100x higher magnetic permeability, > 20x higher magnetic-energy product, 140% higher magnetic saturation) in a reliable microsystem-compatible manner. With the resulting tiny inductors that can be directly merged with integrated circuits, it will be possible not only to allow every battery to optimize its own performance, but to allow integrated circuits to locally regulate their own energy supplies. This profound change away from centralized power systems will yield dramatic size, weight and efficiency improvements across scales from individual integrated circuits through entire phased-array radar and other large electronic systems.

Transformational Antenna Technologies (U) The Transformational Antenna Technology program goal is to develop and demonstrate new and innovative antenna design concepts that have the potential to fundamentally change the way that the Department of Defense (DoD) exploits the electromagnetic spectrum. The focus of the effort is to develop antennas that are physically or electrically small to support a variety of warfighter needs, such as applications including integration on small and micro UAVs, low observable platforms, soldier radios and manpacks. This program is attempting to reduce antenna size, provide additional sensitivity, and increase the frequency band over which small antennas operate. These techniques will give new levels of flexibility to our radio technology, enabling not only communications but intelligence gathering, jamming, and information operations on the same radio equipment, and implementation of new capabilities on smaller platforms such as UAVs. The antennas that will be developed will be smaller, and cover a wider range of frequency bands. The technologies and systems developed under this program support all Services. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Develop and model realistic electrically small antenna designs at a wide range of frequencies. - Develop methods of implementing transmit non-Foster matching circuits over wide bandwidths. - Develop integrated circuit designs that can be used to create specialized circuits for a wide range of impedance matching problems. - Develop methods to perform antenna beam management using only a single antenna port on a radio. - Develop methods to adjust antenna topology, resonant structure, and polarity. - Develop new scalable design techniques that support conformal implementation on surfaces of wings and fuselage of a variety of aircraft designs.0.000 0.000 8.000 0.000 8.000 Volume 1 - 283UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #20 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 34 of 42Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY C.

Terahertz (THz) Photonics (U) The Terahertz (THz) Photonics program will enable semiconductor continuous-wave laser sources that are THz frequency sources operating at room-temperature. Approaches to such sources include quantum cascade lasers and quantum dot lasers. Although the field of THz photonics has grown considerably, the physical path to an efficient continuous wave laser source at room temperature has eluded researchers prior to this program. The program will demonstrate designs that enable laser sources at these frequencies by mitigating the degradation of population inversion at room temperature. The program will invent an alternative laser active-region design, or more radically, use a new material system such as the gallium arsenide-based system to maintain the population inversion for lasing at room temperature. Highly efficient laser sources for portable systems such as infra-red counter- measures and active imagers will be enabled by this program.

Realizing the material benefits of gallium nitride and other wide band gap materials for power applications will not be possible unless the thermal conductance at or near an electronic junction is significantly improved. Power densities that approach material-limited performance for high powers may be enabled by integrating high conductivity materials, such as diamond films or nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes or graphene-related structures that control the phonon behavior to increase thermal conductance.

Non-Silicon Electronics The goal of the Non-Silicon Electronics program is to develop a new generation of vacuum electronic devices in which nano-scale structures are integrated with transistors to overcome traditional limitations in reliability and performance. While the commercial electronics world is almost totally dominated by silicon transistors, military systems can benefit enormously from the additional performance enabled by the use of alternate materials. These include phosphides (e.g., InP), antimonides (InSb), and nitrides (GaN). For example, the ability of GaN to achieve very high frequency operation while maintaining low on-state resistance offers an opportunity to achieve compact, even device-scale DC to DC power conversion systems. Such power conversion systems are virtually omnipresent, and by scaling their size by 10X or more while maintaining high efficiency would potentially lead to new capabilities such as chip-scale power converters. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Investigate designs for integrating vacuum electronic nano-structures with semiconductor-based transistors on the same wafer in order to demonstrate high efficiency, high power frequency sources. - Demonstrate RF and power electronics circuits using non-silicon transistor electronics.0.000 0.000 7.725 0.000 7.725 Revolutionary Mixed-Signal Electronics (U) Since the earliest days of electronic circuits, there has been a synergistic relationship between the electronic device technology of the day and the circuit design ideas that combined them into systems of steadily increasing complexity and capability.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total driving the scaling and performance increase of CMOS circuitry, an undesirable side-effect of the \"Moore's Law\" scaling is the collapsing of the dynamic range (signal swing range) of analog circuits which are increasingly forced to coexist with digital circuits (on so-called \"mixed-signal\" integrated circuits). DoD requirements for electronics pull in exactly the opposite direction, requiring increased dynamic range, increased power density, and increased linearity, among other features. In order to harness commercial technologies and augment them to meet DoD needs, a combined approach will be taken, coupling evolving semiconductor device capabilities with innovative new circuit topologies. For example, new Gallium Nitride and vacuum devices will be harnessed to push to the limits of speed (terahertz), dynamic range, and power densities for applications such as extending the reach of radars and jam-proofing communications systems. Design techniques for optimally combining heterogeneous device technologies such as these with mainstream silicon circuits will allow the development of circuits with heretofore impossible performance capabilities. Finally, novel silicon-only design approaches will harness, at the lowest possible cost, secure commercial CMOS capabilities to trade abundant transistor speed for extended dynamic range, linearity and power efficiencies. Overall, this program seeks to develop entirely new designs and design methodologies to push the envelope of mixed signal performance across the entire spectrum of advanced device types available for DoD applications.

DiscRotor Compound Helicopter (U) The goal of the DiscRotor Compound Helicopter program is to design and demonstrate the enabling technologies required to develop a new type of compound helicopter capable of high-efficiency hover, high-speed flight, and seamless transition between these flight states. The aircraft will be equipped with an aft-swept wing as well as a mid-fuselage disc with extendable rotor blades, enabling the aircraft to take-off and land like a helicopter. Transition from helicopter flight to full fixed-wing flight is achieved by fully retracting the blades within the disc. An aircraft capable of long range high speed (300-400 kts) and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL)/hover will satisfy an ongoing military interest, bridging the gap in helicopter escort and insertion missions by providing survivability, mobility, and responsiveness for troop and cargo insertion. The DiscRotor enabling technologies are: variable thrust ducted prop- fans, extending telescopic rotor blades, counter torque control, and an integrated propulsion system. A prime technical objective of the DiscRotor concept is to achieve seamless reversible transition between hover and wing borne flight states.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions. (U) A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets. The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential attacks, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, the ability to neutralize man-made space environments, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets. Ready access to space allows the delivery of defensive systems and replenishment supplies to orbit. An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime. In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space. (U) Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include solar thermal propulsion, novel ion-thruster applications, payload isolation and pointing systems.

A major goal of the SST program is to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance. This capability will enable ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions. The Air Force will participate in the DARPA funded developmental testing of SST and then take over operation of SST as a sensor in the Air Force Space Surveillance Network. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been established with Air Force Space Command for transition. (U) In addition, the program will investigate multi-aperture SST (MASST) alternatives. It will evaluate technologies and techniques to achieve the detection/tracking sensitivity and high search rate of the SST with a more affordable and manufacturable approach, to include the combined use of multiple small telescopes to achieve the same resolution as one large one. MASST alternatives will leverage advances in complex field sensing to combine the fields from multiple small telescopes to produce high resolution images. It will determine how the complex field sensing should be performed at each sub- aperture (telescope), as well as design and develop the appropriate adaptive optics correctors, the compensation algorithms for phase differences between telescopes, and the timing and optimization algorithms needed to generate high resolution imagery in real time. The program will develop and design one or more technology demonstrators to prove the benefit and feasibility of the concepts identified. This approach will enable wider deployment of systems which can detect and track small deep space objects.3.134 14.960 10.840 0.000 10.840 Volume 1 - 309UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #33 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 21Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY C.

System F6 (U) The objective of the System F6 program is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a satellite architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional \"monolithic\" spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules. Each such \"fractionated\" module would contribute a unique capability, e.g., computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, etc., or it can replicate the capability of another module. The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit or potentially self-assemble into an aggregate system. Critical to this architecture is a robust, system-level approach to ensuring security, integrity, and availability, while implementing authentication and non-repudiation. While delivering a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft, System F6 significantly enhances functional and programmatic flexibility and robustness, reducing risk through the mission life and spacecraft development cycle, and enabling incremental deployment of the system. The System F6 architecture provides valuable options to decision makers throughout the life cycle development of future space systems that are absent in present-day monolithic architectures. (U) The F6 program will culminate in an on-orbit demonstration of a multi-module space system incorporating the F6 Technology Package\u2014a suite of technologies, components, and algorithms which enables autonomous multi-body orbital rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) and real- time distributed spacecraft avionics. The F6 Technology Package will be designed such that it can be integrated with most off-the-shelf spacecraft buses to enable them to cooperatively perform a mission or missions. The on-orbit demonstration will be capable of accommodating one or more spacecraft payload modules supplied by a third-party stakeholder. Residual capability to support future payloads with the existing on-orbit infrastructure will also remain, and the infrastructure can be upgraded for an on-orbit resource capability.

Front-end Robotics Enabling Near-term Demonstration (FREND) (U) The goal of the Front-end Robotics Enabling Near-term Demonstration (FREND) program is to develop, demonstrate, and fly robotic manipulator technologies designed to allow interaction with geosynchronous orbit (GEO)-based military and commercial spacecraft, extending their service lives and permitting satellite repositioning or retirement. Existing GEO spacecraft are outfitted with sufficient propellant to provide for needed station keeping, repositioning, and retirement maneuvers, which in many cases defines their useful mission durations. Once this propellant is expended, the vehicle is retired and, in many cases, replaced. FREND technologies can enable significant service extension to these spacecraft through re-boosting near end-of-life. (U) Recent events have significantly increased the number of objects/debris in low earth orbit (LEO), particularly in orbital planes of most interest to DoD users, causing an increased threat to safe space operations. FREND combines detailed photogrammetric and laser imaging with robotic multi-degree- of-freedom manipulators to autonomously grapple space objects not outfitted with custom interfaces. A FREND-based servicing spacecraft offers the potential for spacecraft salvage, repair, rescue, reposition, de-orbit and retirement, and debris removal. The program will examine possible solutions for all classes of LEO debris to determine the most economical technical solution set to mitigating the problem. In addition, FREND will investigate neurorobotics as a potential replacement for the baseline10.806 19.000 11.000 0.000 11.000 Volume 1 - 315UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #33 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 10 of 21Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY C.

The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force. (U) The Catcher's Mitt program is an extension of work performed under the FREND program and will address the increasing on-orbit debris collision problem faced by all U.S. space assets. Recent events have caused a dramatic increase in orbital debris. These events are part of a continuing trend that raises the probability of debris strikes with valuable U.S. space assets, possibly causing critical failures. Catcher's Mitt seeks to reduce the risk of catastrophic collision for on-orbit U.S. space assets, develop new methods for rapidly clearing important orbits after an event generates a large debris field, and develop a new method for long term clearing of debris in the most cost-effective manner. The Catcher's Mitt program will identify critical operational areas at risk as well as new solution concepts to address those risks. Solutions may include development of technologies enabling improved debris detection and tracking, improved collision prediction techniques, improved spacecraft and rocket body de-orbit/ retirement capabilities, urgent response orbit clearing, long term orbit clearing, and other novel orbital debris mitigation solutions. The program will culminate in an on-orbit demonstration of selected orbital debris remediation technologies. The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.

Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) (U) The goal of the Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) program is to demonstrate a suite of critical technologies including high efficiency solar cells, sunlight concentrating arrays, large deployable structures, and ultra light weight solar arrays. These technologies enable light-weight, high efficiency, and high-power satellites of 20kW scalable to 80kW or more. The specific power goal is 130 W/Kg yielding an ultra light-weight power system of approximately 230 Kg for a 30 kW array. Combined with electric propulsion, FAST enables fast-transfer roaming satellites with nearly five times the fuel efficiency of conventional chemical propulsion. For example, FAST will permit on-demand access to any point on the geosynchronous ring or within the high-altitude, super synchronous \"graveyard\" (where derelict systems are regularly repositioned in order to free up orbital slots within the ring), greatly improving our ability to rapidly deploy and reposition satellites, as well as monitor the geosynchronous environment. Alternatively, FAST will permit responsive launch capabilities including deployment of small geosynchronous satellites on small launch vehicles. Scaled up systems will nearly double the effective satellite mass launched to high altitude orbits today, significantly downsizing the need for large launch vehicles. The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.

Space Situational Awareness (SSA) & Counterspace Operations Response Environment (SCORE) (U) The goal of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) & Counterspace Operations Response Environment (SCORE) program is to develop and demonstrate an operational framework and responsive defense application to enhance the availability of vulnerable commercial space-based communications resources. SCORE will correlate a wide range of operational support and space system ground user data to rapidly identify threat activities, propose mitigating countermeasures, and verify the effectiveness of selected responses. Critical technologies include accessing disparate sources of relevant data, model-based situational awareness, and candidate response generation and evaluation. Particular emphasis will be placed on the ability to continuously adapt to changes in defended system components and usage patterns as well as validation of SCORE system integrity.

MEO Synthetic Aperture Radar (MEOSAR) (U) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) integration time is currently limited by the amount of ground vehicle motion encountered during the synthetic aperture collection time. For space radar systems, this has traditionally meant that SAR had to be accomplished at low earth orbit (LEO) trajectories where the collection time would be much shorter given the high speeds of a LEO satellite. Although the specifics depend heavily on geometric considerations, medium earth orbit (MEO) SAR imaging intervals can be a factor of approximately eight times longer, compared to a LEO alternative. The longer integration times required at MEO can have a major impact on the quality of the otherwise equivalent SAR image due to the presence of internal motion within the image scene. To achieve equivalent quality imagery, the contribution of the moving targets within the image must be excised. The MEO Synthetic Aperture Radar (MEOSAR) program will develop techniques to identify moving targets and extract them from the data prior to imaging to avoid the streaking caused by their motions. The program will develop reliable automated detection of moving targets within SAR imagery using a double thresholding process in interferometric phase and amplitude. This moving target detection technique can be readily reversed to excise the moving targets from the clutter (image) background. Temporal sub-array processing will demonstrate early detection and rejection of moving targets in sub-array images. The program will develop improved motion detection and removal algorithms, demonstrate their performance on simulated and airborne data, and develop an architectural concept for a MEOSAR system. The developed technology will be transitioned to the Air Force.

Multi-Aperture Geosynchronous (GEO) Imager (MAGI)* *Formerly Bi-Static Shield. (U) The goal of the Multi-Aperture Geosynchronous (GEO) Imager (MAGI) program is to demonstrate a segment of a world-wide millimeter wave (MMW) surveillance capability by combining radar and radio astronomy technologies and techniques. By merging interferometric receiving and correlation techniques, used by radio astronomers for decades, with high power narrow-band radar transmitter technologies, MAGI hopes to prove the capability to obtain an order of magnitude improvement in imaging resolution of GEO and near-GEO satellites. A low cost demonstration using the NASA Goldstone X-Band radar and existing radio astronomy assets (the National Radio Astronomy Organization's Very Long Baseline Array) will be conducted to prove the concept at X-band. Based upon resolution requirements, the follow-on prototype demonstration will be at MMW (~90GHz), and will, to the greatest extent practicable, utilize COTS MMW antennas and high power (HP) narrow-band transmitters.

XTIM (U) Leveraging technology developed in the MiDSTEP program, XTIM is an autonomous system of determining timing and positioning of space assets using X-ray pulsars and then broadcasting this information for navigation and time uses independent of, and supplemental to, GPS. XTIM autonomously calculates its position and absolute time from celestial sources. XTIM then broadcasts this information to users either on the ground or in space as a method to enhance their navigation solutions. In addition, XTIM reference data can be used to update the GPS constellation ephemerides and timing with limited or no ground support. XTIM also provides an alternative timing source that can be used as a checksum for GPS receivers to insure detection of spoofing or sophisticated jamming attacks. XTIM leverages previous work by DARPA which analytically demonstrated that X-ray pulsars could be used for navigation of space assets.

The current mainstream approach for fabricating radiation-hardened electronics depends on specialized process technologies and dedicated foundries that serve this military market niche. While commercial semiconductor fabrication is not explicitly radiation hardened, recent trends in deeply scaled fabrication such as very thin oxides, trench isolation, and multiple levels of metal are resulting in semiconductor devices that are inherently more tolerant of radiation than older generations. This program pursued development of design-based technologies to enable pure commercial fabrication technologies to attain radiation hardened electronics equivalent to those from the dedicated foundries. The design technology developed under the Radiation Hardening by Design (RHBD) program is planned for transition to the Air Force and to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) at the end of Phase II.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Advanced Electronics Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility. Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements. (U) The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments. MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements. The MEMS project has three principal objectives: the realization of advanced devices and systems concepts, the development and insertion of MEMS into DoD systems, and the creation of support and access technologies to catalyze a MEMS technology infrastructure. (U) The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems. These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness and security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.

Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems. The MEMS program addresses issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements. These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments. The microfluidic molecular systems program will develop automated microsystems that integrate biochemical fluid handling capability along with electronics, optoelectronics and chip- based reaction and detection modules to perform tailored analysis sequences to monitor environmental conditions, health hazards and physiological states. (U) The MEMS program has three principal objectives: the realization of advanced devices and systems concepts; the development and insertion of MEMS into DoD systems; and the creation of support and access technologies to catalyze a MEMS technology infrastructure. These three objectives cut across a number of focus application areas to create revolutionary military capabilities, make high-end functionality affordable to low-end systems and extend the operational performance and lifetimes of existing weapons platforms. The major technical focus areas for the MEMS program are: 1) inertial measurement; 2) fluid sensing and control; 3) electromagnetic and optical beam steering; 4) chemical reactions on chip; 5) electromechanical signal processing; 6) analytical instruments; and 7) thermal management.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total unprecedented performance, stability, and lifetime. Micromechanical RF switches are of particular interest, where sizable power throughputs and impacting operation constitute harsh operational environments. Other applications such as vibrating resonator reference tanks, gyroscopes, and accelerometers are also of interest. Among the HERMIT implementation approaches deemed likely to succeed, two are of the most interest: 1) wafer-level encapsulation or packaging strategies based on MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) technology that isolates a micromechanical device from its surroundings while maintaining a desired environment via passive or active control; and 2) material and design engineering strategies that render a micromechanical device impervious to its environment with or without a package (if possible). A key approach in this program that should allow orders of magnitude power savings is to selectively control only the needed micro-scale environment or volume via MEMS-enabled isolation technologies. The success of this program should enable a myriad of strategic capabilities including lower cost, more complex phased array antennas for radar applications; tiny frequency references with long- and short-term stabilities that greatly extend the portability of ultra- secure communications; and micro-scale inertial measurement units with bias stabilities approaching navigation-grade. The HERMIT program is anticipated to transition via industry to phased array antenna, reconfigurable communication front-end, seeker, and steerable aperture programs being developed by the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as to inertial navigation systems and Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) communications needed by these Services. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated micromechanical devices (e.g., RF switches, vibrating resonators) fully integrated together with environment isolating measures (including circuits, if any) that maintain unprecedented performance, stability, and reliability, even under harsh environments. - Demonstrated high yield MEMS RF switching component technologies that result in test devices that can operate for at least 100 billion switching cycles. Yield goals were to attain a 95% confidence that 99% of tested devices met 100 billion cycles. - Implemented parallel measurement set-up to increase test throughput. - Initiated efforts for demonstrating the performance of RF switches in relevant radar applications.

MEMS Exchange (U) The MEMS Exchange program seeks to provide flexible access to complex MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication technology in a wide variety of materials and to a broad, multi-disciplinary user base via the MEMS Exchange service. A major goal of the effort is to ensure self-sustained operation of MEMS Exchange after the end of the program by adding several process modules to the existing repertoire and increasing the number of processes run per year to raise revenues to the point of self-sufficiency. Among the future payoffs of this program is the establishment of an accessible infrastructure for low or medium volume production of MEMS-enabled products for DoD applications. The goal of the MEMS Exchange program is to provide MEMS fabrication services to all levels of industry and academia in support of Army, Navy, Air Force, and other DoD requirements without further DARPA sponsorship. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Inserted MEMS technology into three DoD applications using MEMS Exchange as the fabrication vehicle.

Low Power Micro Cryogenic Coolers (MCC) (U) The Low Power Micro Cryogenic Coolers (MCC) program will attain superior performance in micro-scale devices (e.g. Low Noise Amplifier (LNA's) IR detectors, RF front-ends, superconducting circuits) by cooling selected portions to cryogenic temperatures. The key approach in this program that should allow orders of magnitude power savings is to selectively cool only the needed volume/ device via MEMS-enabled isolation technologies. Such an approach will benefit a large number of applications where performance is determined predominately by only a few devices in a system, e.g., communications where the front-end filter and LNA often set the noise figure; and sensors, where the transducer and input transistor in the sense amplifier often set the resolution. Additionally, this program will develop a high performance chip-scale micropump for efficient fluid distribution within various microsystems. MEMS technology will also be instrumental for achieving micro-scale mechanical pumps, valves, heat exchangers, and compressors, all needed to realize a complete cryogenic refrigeration system on a chip. Transition of this technology is anticipated through industry, which will incorporate elements of the technology in current and future weapon system designs.

The concept of beam clock has been known at least since the 1960's but has not been widely pursued due to the difficulty in containing a large volume of xenon gas. This problem will be addressed by going to the micro- scale. Miniaturization of the conventional beam clocks with major innovations are possible due to microscale implementation - microscale xenon atom source, micromachined permanent magnets, and micromechanical atom flux detectors. This approach will not only improve the stability over existing CSAC but will further reduce the required power. This technology will be transitioned into DoD systems through innovative companies, including performers under the Chip-Scale Atomic Clock program.

The program will also develop mechanical gain elements using physical effects such as giant magnetoresistance, buckling, electromechanical phase transitions, van der Waals forces, and Casimir forces to enable very low- noise, high-frequency amplifiers for low-power, low-noise analog signal processing. Mechanical power supplies and mechanical vibrating clocks could facilitate production of electronics that are less susceptible to electromagnetic pulse attacks. Integrating nanomechanical elements in direct bandgap materials will circumvent problems of gate oxide stability, allowing fast logic with optics functionality. This program will transition into DoD systems via industrial program performers.

However, the unique capability to precisely rotate micromachined structures in a controllable manner has been under-utilized in MEMS systems. Although the use in micromotors for optical and mechanical switches has been demonstrated, most applications passively use the structures fabricated into the rotary stage.

This program will explore ways at pushing the envelope by engineering ways of coupling power and signals to a rotating MEMS stage, and measuring its position with much higher accuracy then possible at the macroscale. With this capability, arrays of rotating 100-1000 micron diameter stages could carry various sensors that can be aimed at any azimuth and inclination, and can be rotated 360 degrees for cancelling angle dependent biases. Examples of sensors that might utilize this capability include microphones, antennas, radiation sensors, etc. Although many of these sensors exist, by adding the rotating stage functionality without increase in sensor/system size, weight, and power, one can really see the benefit of integrating MEMS with traditional sensors.

Enhancing air-cooled exchangers by reducing the thermal resistance through the heat sink to the ambient, increasing convection through the system, improving heat sink fin thermal conductivity, optimizing and/or redesigning the complimentary heat sink blower, and increasing the overall system (heat sink and blower) coefficient of performance is another thrust of this program. Another element of this effort is focused on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the thermal interface layer between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heat sink.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems. These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms. At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave/microwave. Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module. The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system. This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'. (U) The field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date. Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication. This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies. This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures. Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). (U) The program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon. The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer/ nanometer scale. The program includes the development of micrometer/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf/mmwave/microwave technologies. example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment.

Nyquist-Limited Infrared Detectors (NIRD) (U) The Nyquist-Limited Infrared Detectors (NIRD) program develops high density, long-wave infrared (LWIR) arrays and signal processing to improve capability to image through scattering media such as dust and sand, known as brownout, fog, snow storms, and to enhance situational awareness needed for aircraft navigation. The LWIR provides advantages in imaging through the dust clouds created in helicopter landing especially in desert areas. This obscurant penetration capability of LWIR imaging can be significantly improved when the pixel size is reduced to preserve high frequency information, while at the same time, a practical size optical aperture is maintained with approximately F/1 optics. The obscurant penetration capability of the LWIR focal plane array (FPA) can be further enhanced with signal and imaging processing. The low frequency pedestal in the image caused by the obscurant must be reduced to increase image contrast and the effective dynamic range. The small pixel FPA presents unique challenges in detector design and fabrication and in the interconnection of the detector array to the read-out integrated circuit (ROIC). The origin of noise currents in the detector must be understood and characterized, especially the role of surface currents in the small pixel devices. The method of interconnection must be compatible with large arrays of small pixel elements, achieve a low contact resistance, and reliably interconnect at each pixel across the array.

Military electronics capabilities are currently limited by the high cost of nanofabrication. To solve this important problem, DARPA has invested in a variety of maskless patterning technologies including parallel e-beam arrays, parallel scanning probe arrays, and an innovative e-beam lithography tool.

The ability to eliminate poor visibility due to rain, fog, sand storms, and snow storms using electro-optical and signal processing techniques could save lives and loss of aviation equipment. This program will transition via industry. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Conducted feasibility study incorporating the results from the static runway measurements, outside data collection sources, and dynamic flight tests. - Developed requirements to support the development of a high resolution sensor pertinent to limited visibility flight operations. Data in Optical Domain Network (DoD-Network) (U) Currently, optical networks use photonics to transport data and electronics to process data. However, as the underlying bit rates of the optical networks are pushed beyond 40 giga-bits per second there will be significant processing bottlenecks in these networks and these bottlenecks will severely limit the military's ability to rapidly transport time critical information. A potential solution to this problem is to develop photonic technology so optics can take over higher order network processing functions. The Data in Optical Domain Network (DoD-Network) program explored four key photonic technologies to meet these challenges: all-optical routing, all-optical data buffering (controllable and eventually random access), optical logic and circuits, and all-optical (multi-wavelength) regenerators. These photonic technologies will lead to intelligent all-optical networks. The program had two major areas of interest: the first focused on developing new photonic technology that is essential if photonics is to play a significant role in higher order processing in optical networks, the second area focused on developing novel architectures that will fully exploit the new photonic technology to bring new and increased functionalities to the optical networks. The DoD-Network program will transition via industry to high-speed, high-capacity optical networking programs of interest to the Air Force.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total Precision Navigation (U) The Precision Navigation program goal is to provide compact, rugged, low-power and extremely accurate means for determining position. The resulting systems will provide accurate tools for GPS- denied vehicle operation, on-foot cave and building exploration, precision munitions delivery and many other applications where previous options were too heavy, inaccurate, large or power-hungry. In order to achieve this, sensors will be developed to use internal and external reference information to maximum advantage. One component of the internal type is the development of a new class of microsystems capable of measuring the absolute angle of rotation with the ultra high precision, effectively operating as a mechanical integrator of rotation (MIR). The MIR will not rely on any absolute reference, but will define the reference itself in the absolute inertial space. The device will measure angle of rotation at an unprecedented precision of arc-seconds and a bandwidth in tens of kHz (all characteristics are at least 3 orders of magnitude better than the state-of-the-art). Another component of the program is the development of navigation grade integrated micro gyroscopes with the goal of achieving 0.01 deg/hr bias drift in very compact form factors (less than 1 cm3) and a total power consumption less than 5 mW per sense axis. Another key goal of this program is to harness external references where possible, which can be fused with internally referenced navigation signals to greatly improve performance. One approach to be pursued is the development of miniaturized atomic gradiometer arrays (AGA). Reducing previously bulky and high power AGA's to micro-scales will entail the use of nuclear magnetic resonance phenomena in extremely compact packages for timekeeping, rotation and magnetic field measurements. The AGA's will be deployed in arrays on the order of 10,000 individual sensors, each with the unprecedented target sensitivity of 0.1 femtoTesla (fT). This level of performance will yield not only highly capable navigation instruments making use of local gravitational variations, but also portable devices that are able to detect unexploded bombs/IEDs, camouflaged/faked military assets from platforms such as UAV's. When combined in systems, these new technologies will yield unprecedented navigational capabilities and help deny any advantage for adversaries who might interfere with GPS availability.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) Military operations since the end of the Cold War illustrate that current theater-level command, control, communications, and intelligence/information systems lack the ability to fully support operations in complex, time-critical environments. Warfighters must be prepared for operations ranging from conflict and peacekeeping in urban centers to heavy battle actions in remote areas. Current capabilities do not provide the commander with real-time, secure, situational awareness or the ability to orchestrate high-tempo planning, rehearsal, and execution. The programs in this project are developing and testing innovative, secure architectures and tools to enhance information processing, dissemination, and presentation capabilities. The programs provide the commander insight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making, and execution, secure multimedia information interfaces, and software assurance to the warfighter \"on the move.\" Integration of collection management, planning, and battlefield awareness are essential elements for achieving battlefield dominance through assured information systems.

Deep Green (U) Deep Green is a next-generation, battle command and decision support technology that interleaves anticipatory planning with adaptive execution to help the commander think ahead, identify when a plan is going awry, and prepare options before they are needed. Deep Green will radically reduce the time needed to plan and execute military operations and will reduce the number of staff officers needed in an operations center. Through rapid mission planning and execution and reduced staff overhead, Deep Green will save lives and reduce costs. Deep Green will automatically induce a plan and commander's intent from the commander's hand-drawn sketches with accompanying speech to facilitate rapid option creation. Deep Green generates a broad set of possible futures from those options for all sides in an operation and predicts the likelihood of each future. It supports anticipatory planning by using information about the ongoing operation to nominate future states that are no longer feasible and probable future states upon which the commander should focus additional planning efforts. By anticipating decision points early and allowing the commander to explore the future option space, Deep Green supports commander's visualization and adaptive execution, enabling correct, timely decisions by the commander. Deep Green technology will transition to the U.S. Army. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Developed sketching and speech tools to help commanders generate options quickly. - Developed fast, multi-resolution models to generate possible futures. - Developed the ability to automatically evaluate diverse possible futures. - Developed interface allowing commanders to foresee downstream effects of decisions.10.949 19.282 17.727 0.000 17.727 Volume 1 - 373UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #53 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 36Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT CCC-01: COMMAND & CONTROL INFORMATION SYSTEMS B.

The program provides support for combined operations employing dismounted soldiers, manned platforms, and autonomous vehicles through a graphical interface with unit commanders. The program also extends plans by applying adversarial reasoning techniques to identify vulnerabilities and opportunities in the predicted enemy course of action. Finally, it examines modifications or counteractions to reduce vulnerabilities. Program products will transition to the Services. (U) The effort is developing a support tool that autonomously and continuously, during the execution of a military operation, tracks the state of what is known about the environment and provides automated assistance to the process of collections planning to enable more effective, rapid, complete identification of the enemy's state. (U) The program will also develop integrated, in-theater tools for organizational design, cognitive resource configuration, and adaptive management of complex, often unconventional command and control (C2) structures. These tools will enable the U.S. military in real time to modify responsibilities, relations, tasks, and priorities to meet the rapidly changing needs of the command across multiple units, echelons, and organizations, while shaping the choices of countries at strategic crossroads. U.S. forces increasingly encounter complex C2 structures that include Coalition forces (manned and unmanned), civilian agency resources, indigenous formal and informal powers, and non-governmental organizations, and the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command has identified a critical gap in the technologies for agile configuration and analysis of C2 structures.

This will have many capabilities that are well beyond those of currently used copper- and multi-mode-fiber-based technologies. Originally, the program focused on specific technologies for application on the Navy's EA-6B Prowler aircraft; however, the program has been broadened to focus on technologies that will provide advanced capabilities to a multitude of military aircraft, such as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The NEW-HIP technologies and associated architecture will provide: scalability in the bandwidth and the number of connected devices; immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and cable cross-talk; reduced cable and overall system weight and volume; increased reliability without an associated weight or volume penalty; ease of integration and future upgradeability; and the ability to carry mixed analog and digital signal formats. This will be accomplished by taking full advantage of single-mode fiber-optic WDM technology and leveraging optoelectronic and photonic integration techniques developed in DARPA photonics components program. To reduce the size, weight and power and to increase the reliability and the flexibility of interconnecting arbitrarily placed client devices with various signal formats, the NEW-HIP program will use passive, transparent and wavelength-routing technology at the core of the network, and tunable optical transmitters and receivers (transceivers) to inter-connect the client devices at the edge of the network.

Mobile Ad Hoc Interoperability Networking GATEway (MAINGATE) (U) Building upon gateway technology developed under the WNaN and Future Combat Systems (FCS) Communications program, the Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Networking GATEway (MAINGATE) program seeks to develop the next generation Network Centric Radio System (NCRS) with additional capabilities and an assured affordable unit price to the user. MAINGATE will enable heterogeneous groups of radios to be integrated into a heterogeneous network tolerant to high latency and packet loss. The technologies developed for the program will permit affordable, tactical, real-time, high fidelity video, data, and voice services to be deployed in a networked environment to support tactical operations in maneuver or dismounted operations for line-of-site and beyond-line-of-site communications on the move and at the halt. Two critical technologies for achieving these goals: 1) a backbone radio architecture that enables a versatile IP Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) and 2) a radio gateway that enables legacy analog and digital communications systems to be interconnected through a network. The MAINGATE program will use an iterative build-test-build approach that will culminate with limited user testing by U.S. and Allied Experimental Forces evaluating the affect of MAINGATE on new tactics, techniques and procedures designed for the networked maneuver and dismounted forces. The resulting MAINGATE system and capability is planned for transition in 2011 to the U.S. Army and Marine Corps with a focus on Special Operations Forces.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total (U) The goal of the Polarized Rotation Modulation (PZRM) Communications program was to develop new extremely high data rate, point-to-point, or point-to-multipoint wireless communications waveform using the PZRM/Orthogonal Signal Spectrum Overlay (OSSO) communications concept to exploit the presently unused polarization and rotation dimensions of radiation. The PZRM Communications program investigated the use of polarization, including OSSO, modulation and the ability for conventional radios to carry all information over the transmitted signal amplitude, phase and frequency. The program demonstrated as an enhancement to an otherwise state-of-the-art communications system. Technologies developed under this program are available for transition to the Services in FY 2009. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Completed final assessment of technology. Next Generation (XG) (U) The Next Generation (XG) program developed both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide dramatic improvements in assured military communications in support of a full range of worldwide deployments through dynamic spectrum access. U.S. Forces face unique spectrum access issues in each country in which they operate due to competing civilian or government users of national spectrum. These constraints must be reflected in all force planning and may preclude operation of critical systems. Coalition and allied operations are even more complex to manage, and may severely limit the U.S. ability to fully exploit its superiority and investment in information technology. The XG program developed the theoretical underpinnings for dynamic access to the spectrum, the technologies and subsystems that enable dynamic access, and the system prototypes to demonstrate applicability to legacy and future DoD radio frequency emitters.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total (U) The DARPA Interference Multiple Access (DIMA) Communications program developed a networked radio system that supports voice, video and data. The program developed a network that is dynamically controllable using techniques such as reconfiguration, optimum resource allocations based on mission priorities, and dynamic policies, as opposed to relatively passive reactions to changes by the commercial infrastructure. This program initially developed direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) communications technologies as a building block to enable robust, mobile, tactical wireless networks, which are the foundation for network centric warfare concepts. The fundamental technical challenges are scalability, multi-user detection processing, low probability of detection/low probability of interception (LPD/LPI), robustness and platform size, weight and power (SWAP) requirements. The DIMA Communications program then developed and demonstrated a system based on multi- user detection (MUD) concepts that take advantage of overloaded channels while operating in an environment absent of infrastructure (ad-hoc networked). The technologies developed under this program are transitioning to the Army and USMC.

It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. (U) The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. (U) The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.

This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations.

These algorithms will be scaled to operate on data streams including full-motion video, Laser Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), multi- and hyper-spectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in addition to conventional electro-optical (EO) geospatial imagery. GEO algorithm architectures will be explored to achieve scalability through spatial, temporal and ontological partitioning. GEO technologies are planned for transition to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Activities funded within the GEO research space include: The Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) program is developing a 3-D urban object recognition and exploitation system that enables advanced mission planning and situation analysis capabilities for the warfighter operating in urban environments. URGENT will create techniques for the rapid exploitation of EO and LIDAR sensor data at the city scale to recognize urban objects down to the soldier scale. URGENT will apply image processing technology to geospatially registered 2-D/3-D data collected from airborne and terrestrial sources, yielding precise annotations for the objects in an urban area. URGENT will also develop a 3-D reasoning engine to query object shapes, locations, and classifications for advanced geospatial exploitation capabilities. The Geospatial Representation Integrated Dataspace (GRID) program is developing an automated geospatial data fusion, modeling, and dissemination system from national assets for the tactical warfighter. Geospatial registration algorithms will automatically fuse geospatial data from multiple sources including EO, LIDAR, SAR, and hyperspectral - and encode the fused data as a temporally indexed volumetric model that drastically reduces geospatial data storage requirements while enhancing image quality. Updates will propagate to the model using a compressed geospatial data format capable of reaching the warfighter even with the bandwidth constraints of tactical networks.

Network Command (U) The Network Command program leverages recent advances in network computing, simulation, and visualization to dramatically improve collaboration among physically separate command posts and lower echelons. Network Command enables warfighters to share situation information and exploited data from the area of responsibility, develop coordinated battle plans, generate and compare alternate courses of action, and assess likely outcomes, without conventional group briefings. Network Command also enables warfighters to prepare for joint missions using high-fidelity, mixed-reality combat simulation and visualization technologies. The Network-Centric Situation Assessment program develops and deploys technologies to assess military situations at levels of interest above individual targets. The program uses all-source data to reconstruct unit organizations, mission relationships, logistics connections, and communications connectivity and analyzes data over time to infer movement, communication, and supply patterns. Within this context, capability analyses are provided and future courses of action are hypothesized. The objective is to understand potential capabilities and intentions of opposing forces.

Focused acoustic sources will be employed to remotely stimulate plastic or metal antipersonnel and antitank mines. A laser vibrometer system will be used to detect the stimulated resonant characteristic of the mines to discriminate against natural sources of clutter. Similarly, the interaction of near-surface seismic waves with tunnels and other objects will be observed with a multi-pixel laser vibrometer system and used to assess the depth and extent of the targets in the midst of natural and man-made clutter. The systems developed under this effort will be tested against a wide variety of soil types and environments to support operations under a wide range of conditions.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The objective of the Maritime Systems project is to identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces. B.

River Eye (U) Early entry maritime forces need maps of morphology, water depths, and currents in complex riverine/estuarine environments for mission planning and execution. This information is critical for route planning, sensor placement, rendezvous determination, vulnerability assessments, and determining objective assault engagement/disengagement strategies. For uncharted and/or denied areas, present methods are inadequate for obtaining the necessary information. Reliable remote sensing methods do not exist that produce bathymetry and water current data in waters that are sediment laden (bottom not visible) and/or sheltered (swell and significant wind waves are not likely). The River Eye effort will provide a new capability to predict or assess, in real time, river and estuary conditions to enable special operations mission planning and execution. New techniques will be developed to indirectly determine current speed and direction by remotely sensing advection of scene features.

MPSA will use layered and distributed sensing, and add data from all sources for the non-traditional areas of infrastructure, socio-political developments and economic indicators. These systems will enable timely and coordinated decision- making and vastly improved situational awareness under uncertainty for naval commanders. MPSA will enable intelligent deployment of sensors and network infrastructures to protect sea-based assets through effective cross-platform and multi-mission fusion and resource management with focus on stand-off and elusive threats. Automated tracking with intelligent fusion and classification, and assimilation of non-traditional information sets are of particular interest. This will require bringing additional processing power to bear, allowing implementation of complex processing algorithms. MPSA will also enable the decoupling of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance/defense missions from offensive missions, improving the power projection capability of the deployed force. MPSA will depart from previous approaches in assessing the operational environment in that it will not rely solely upon military indicators, but will also expand understanding to include national infrastructure, socio-political, and economic indicators to better assess trends and threat development. The program will transition to the Navy. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Developed system concepts to assimilate and process data from all sources to detect changes in national infrastructure, socio-political climate and economic indicators that could affect adversary military capacity and capabilities.

Blue Laser for Submarine Laser Communications (SLC) (U) The Blue Laser for Submarine Laser Communications (SLC) program will develop the critical laser technology necessary to support the requirements for non-acoustic Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), mine detection, and SLC. SLC and non-acoustic ASW programs are intended to develop the world's first wall-plug efficient laser that operates both at an optimum water transmission band of open ocean water and at the wavelength of a Cesium Atomic Line Filter. There is a pressing need for improved ASW capabilities in the current operating environment, particularly in shallow water (above the thermocline) and littoral areas of operations. This laser has the potential to enable duplex communications for the submarine at unrestricted speeds and deep depths and improve the detection depth of a non-acoustic anti-submarine warfare lidar system by a significant factor. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed among DARPA, Commander, Submarine Forces (COMSUBFOR), Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8), and Program Executive Officer, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (PEO C4I). The MOA establishes a joint program to conduct a demonstration of the SLC technology during a recognized fleet exercise in FY 2012. The Blue Laser technology is planned for transition to the Navy. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Designed, built and tested a power amplifier module to verify performance optically and thermally at high power. - Commenced development of a breadboard blue solid state laser with improved wall-plug efficiency. - Completed compatibility testing of breadboard blue solid state laser with Cesium (Cs) atomic line filter.4.500 10.025 21.550 0.000 21.550 Volume 1 - 428UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #55 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 23 of 27Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NET-02: MARITIME Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total FY 2010 Plans: - Complete design, build, and test of the breadboard blue solid state laser. - Demonstrate laser / filter capability in a laboratory environment. - Commence detailed design of flight brassboard transmitter. - Commence optical, mechanical and electrical designs. - Build and test optical, mechanical and electrical subassemblies for integration into the brassboard transmitter. - Commence building, integration, and testing of amplifier modules into a full power output subsystem. - Commence integrating the laser module transmitter with the receiver module.

Thermal Management System for Ship Decks (TMD) (U) It is anticipated that the high engine exhaust temperatures from the next generation of Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft deployed on navy ships will dramatically reduce the life of both the deck structure and the non-skid surfaces. The Thermal Management System for Ship Decks (TMD) will address this problem by demonstrating a heat distribution system with an integrated thermally stable non-skid coating. Upon satisfactory completion of the development and certification of the design, the TMD will be transitioned to the Navy for integration into amphibious assault ships.

Deep Sea Operations (DSOP) (U) The Deep Sea Operations program will achieve game changing advantages through operations in the deep ocean exploiting maritime persistent surveillance and communications technologies. The deep ocean offers the ability to distribute, conceal and protect maritime assets and operations that today are readily described as concentrated, exposed, and vulnerable. The unfavorable extreme conditions of pressure, temperature, and signal propagation challenge the ability to operate in this frontier. Breakthroughs are needed in several areas: 1) Development of energy and power for persistence and propulsion, including energy harvesting, energy delivery, and solutions for air- independent propulsion; 2) Development of alternatives for through-water communications for high- bandwidth data exfiltration and command and control; and 3) Development of new sensing modalities to exploit unique signatures and deep ocean conditions, including overcoming acoustic aperture constraints through advanced synthetic aperture sonar or virtual laser-defined hydrophones for high resolution detection and classification. Success will lead to systems that capitalize on these breakthroughs to provide high payoff capability relevant to anti-submarine warfare, infrastructure protection, shore monitoring, and forward staging operations. The program will transition to the Navy.

Accomplishments/Planned Program ($ in Millions) FY 2009 FY 2010FY 2011 BaseFY 2011 OCOFY 2011 Total proliferation of hard and deeply buried targets with major strategic capabilities around the world is increasing dramatically. These strategically hardened facilities are used to harbor our adversaries' most dangerous assets including leadership bunkers, command and control functions, and weapons of mass destruction. However, because the size and weight of traditional earth penetrating weapons scale exponentially with the depth of the facility, current warhead penetration depths are and always will be insufficient to reach many of these targets. As a result, a strategic capability gap exists and new approaches to earth penetration and warhead delivery are needed. This program leverages recent advances in earth-penetrating technologies for full defeat of strategically hardened facilities at depths inaccessible to traditional earth penetrating weapons. Technology developed under this program will be available for transition to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in FY 2010.

As conceived, surface receivers at known locations will compare time difference of arrival of very low frequency (VLF) sferic events and employ super-resolution correlation techniques to accurately determine the VLF source locations. Any subsurface receiver will also detect the sferics, and real time or post-mission correlation with the surface data will enable geo-location of the subsurface receiver.2.000 8.256 6.543 0.000 - 440UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #56 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 46Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-01: SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B.

Rescue Transponder (RT) (U) Building upon technologies developed in other sensor programs, the Rescue Transponder (RT) program will investigate the use of a unique localization and tracking technology to provide a very low probability of detection (LPD) call for help signal. The system will use a wide band radio frequency signal with low power and extremely low duty cycle. The goals of the RT program are to develop a small, rugged transponder that provides a call for help to friendly forces. The RT system will operate over ranges that enable rescue forces or surveillance systems to receive its signals.

Combat Laser Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) Proactive Survivability System (CLIPSS) (U) The Combat Laser Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) Proactive Survivability System (CLIPSS) will enable air dominance at low altitude and at night against infrared missile threats in the form of man portable air defense (MANPAD) systems, adjunct missile guidance systems and advanced infrared search and track systems, based on proactive infrared countermeasures (PIRCM). Leveraging the systems and focal plane array (FPA) technology development established by the Multifunction Electro- Optics for Defense of U.S. Aircraft (MEDUSA) program (budgeted in PE 0603768E, Project GT-01) in the near infrared, mid-wave infrared, and potentially the long-wave infrared bands of the optical spectrum and the reactive directed infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) capabilities currently in the field, CLIPSS will provide a near term demonstration and transition of the proactive capability and serve as a pathfinder for the longer range, all band objectives of MEDUSA. The primary technical obstacles of this approach will be the continued development and integration of high sensitivity infrared Focal Plane Array (FPA) and multi-frequency laser technologies into compact, efficient packages for demanding IRCM environments. The real-time processing of the range resolved laser returns over wide fields of view to rapidly cue the proactive countermeasures poses a significant systems integration challenge as well and will be addressed by this demonstration.

Robust Surface Navigation (RSN) (U) The Robust Surface Navigation (RSN) program (previously funded under PE 0603768E, Project GT-01) will provide the U.S. warfighter with the ability to navigate effectively when the Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable due to hostile action (e.g. jamming) or blockage by structures and foliage. The RSN program will use Signals of Opportunity (SoOP) from a variety of ground, air, and space-based sources, augmented by judiciously placed RF beacons; these will be received on the Warfighter's forthcoming software defined radios and use specially tailored algorithms to determine position. The greater strength and diversity of these signals will provide coverage when GPS is denied due to environmental conditions or hostile activity. This is a two-part program: (1) cataloging and assessing potential exploitable signals followed by analysis and performance modeling and hardware- based concept validation, and; (2) designing, testing, and demonstrating a (non-form-fit) prototype receiver(s) and algorithms for geolocation using the SoOP. The RSN technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Special Operations Command and the U.S. Army with specific elements of the program transitioning to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force in FY 2011.0.000 0.000 7.000 0.000 7.000 Volume 1 - 445UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #56 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 12 of 46Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-01: SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B.

Global Tactical ISR (U) The Global Tactical ISR program will develop technologies to provide tactical-grade ISR with coverage scalable from the local to the global, to address issues of global importance. Our forces must conduct military operations with exquisite precision across an expansive theater of operations like the Pacific Ocean, in addition to highly specific locations such as a building in a densely populated urban area. The ISR that supports this wide range of operations needs to be correspondingly precise and accurate at rates typical of tactical operations, as well as meet salient requirements such as operate through jamming. New technologies are needed that address the demanding challenges presented by tactical-level ISR with geographic coverage extending from the extremely broad to the ultra narrow. These technologies include new signal sources for probing the environment, receivers, algorithms, and sensors in general. The program will result in fundamentally new technology approaches. For example, the application of commercial technologies to military problems often results in signature or performance compromises that need to be re-examined to enable the maximum benefit to the warfighter. Specific examples include a pulsed fiber-laser that pushes existing peak-power system limitations may be developed for rapidly deployable long-range laser radar systems, as well as a mid-IR laser sources for biological and chemical detection applications. Stand-off detection of special nuclear material at distances greater than 1 km may be enabled by a novel X-ray source. New engineering approaches to be developed by the program may include enhancing the performance of existing airborne and space-borne sensors through novel algorithms that minimize the need for costly new flight hardware. Thermal inertia imaging, and other technologies when combined with the advanced data processing may yield solutions to persistent problem sets such as underground facility detection and tunnel detection.

The overriding objective of this program is the development of sensor technologies that enable ISR for local areas of operation typical of the brigade-level and below, as well as for the global and regional coverage needed by the Combatant Commands. This program plans to transition to the Services FY 2015. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Identify alternative concepts for revolutionary signal sources, receivers, algorithms and/or sensors for global tactical ISR. - Establish proof-of-concept for global tactical ISR technologies. - Initiate development of prototypes. Assured Operations in High Latitudes (U) The Assured Operations in High Latitudes program will develop technologies to assure operations in the extreme environment typical of high latitudes, which has the challenges of ice, snow, permafrost, weather, and unique ionspheric/magnetospheric phenomena. The focus of current operations for U.S. forces is primarily in mid-latitudes, with existing systems and technologies optimized for use in these latitudes. The high latitudes of the Arctic comprise an emerging operational domain for which new technologies are needed. (U) Mapping the extent and thickness of the sea ice in the Arctic is fundamental to operations in this region. Current technologies exist for the wide area mapping of the extent of the Arctic sea ice, e.g., satellite-based synthetic aperture radar, but the mapping of the thickness of the ice relies primarily on electro-magnetic induction point measurements above the ice followed by interpolations between these points, which is a very slow process. The program will develop technology for rapid, wide area mapping of ice thickness to determine where to surface through the ice, as well as chart courses through the ice. This technology will build upon space- and/or aircraft-based millimeter-wave radar (based on technologies developed under the MEO-SAR under PE 0603287E, 447UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item #56 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 14 of 46Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2011 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2010 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-01: SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B.

Enhancing situational awareness for U.S. forces in the Arctic is an additional benefit of the mapping technology to be developed by the program. (U) The program will also develop technologies that will enable a navigation and communication infrastructure for future platforms and sensors operating under the Arctic ice. This infrastructure includes leave-behind, through-ice nodes that act as beacons and communication ports, low-power trans-Arctic acoustic transmitters for GPS-like navigation, and navigation via scene mapping relying on detailed bottom bathymetry. The through-ice nodes will need to generate sufficient thermal power to melt through the ice, and advances in miniature combustion engines provide one path to achieve this goal that is superior to past failed efforts using chemical reactions and batteries. Long-baseline acoustics for GPS-like navigation has never been done, but recent scientific work on low-power, flow- frequency sound propagation to measure ocean temperatures suggests feasibility. This program plans to transition to Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Army in FY 2015. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Develop conceptual designs for revolutionary technologies to enhance rapid mapping of ice thickness and/or navigation and communication beneath the ice for high latitude operations. - Establish proof-of-concept for technologies to rapidly map ice thickness and/or navigate and communicate beneath the ice for high latitude operations. Speckle Exploitation for Enhanced Reconnaissance (SEER) (U) The Speckle Exploitation for Enhanced Reconnaissance (SEER) program provided long-range, non-cooperative identification of moving/stationary targets using incoherent scattered laser speckle reflected off a target surface. Laser speckle has reduced sensitivity to adverse turbulence-induced distortion and so provides a viable signal at ranges exceeding those projected for other active laser systems.

FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Developed algorithms that reliably and uniquely associate target signatures with speckle patterns. - Implemented algorithms using optical Micro Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMs) or other related technologies to achieve reduced size, weight and power. Cross-Border Tunnel (CBT) (U) The Cross-Border Tunnel (CBT) program investigated technologies and systems to detect small tunnels used to breach security perimeters and national borders. The program goal was to develop innovative technologies inspired by geophysical exploration techniques that detect and characterize these threat tunnels while simultaneously satisfying operational considerations such as search rate, site access, monitoring persistence, and exposure of friendly forces. The initial CBT program thrust performed collections of seismic and electromagnetic (EM) data at a test bed using current state of the art sensors from the geophysical industry. (U) The program's recent focus was on a Fast-Scan CBT detection technique. This technique investigated developing a tunnel detection system focused on providing a fast linear scan rate, for operationally tractable protection of large controlled areas or national borders. Current subterranean interrogation techniques based on geophysical exploration methods have the combined impediments of slow interrogation rate, need for complete site access, or exposure of forces.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for military's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.

Advanced Radar Sensor Technology (U) The Advanced Radar Sensor Technology thrust develops radar systems to provide significant improvements in our ability to detect, identify, and track surface targets and threats over very wide areas in all climatic conditions. Program efforts focus on exploiting emergent and novel RF sensing technology and phenomenology. Key elements are advancements in band, bistatics, detection, tomographic imaging, space- time adaptive processing and other advanced signal processing, advanced Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) techniques, and foliage, building, and ground-penetrating radar phenomenology. Program developments are integrated with current and emerging military platforms, including small and micro UAVs, with emphasis on the most stressing military radar sensor challenges. Examples are operations featuring complex cluttered ground environments; those against small and slow moving surface targets; urban operations, and situations where camouflage, decoys and countermeasures must be overcome.

NetTrack* *Previously part of Advanced Radar Sensor Technology. (U) DARPA's NetTrack Program is developing feature aided tracking technologies to enable airborne surveillance radars to maintain track on moving High Valued Targets (HVTs) in traffic and cluttered environments. Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) radars provide excellent potential for tracking high value targets because they operate in all weather and at long ranges. However, maintaining target tracks is very challenging because obscuration and close target spacing make it difficult to associate radar kinematic measurements over time. To address this challenge, NetTrack is developing feature aided tracking technology that automatically collects and exploits target high range resolution (HRR) radar measurements. Specific NetTrack technologies include signal processing to generate HRR measurements from raw radar returns, feature extraction and matching to exploit HRR measurements, multiple hypothesis tracking to associate measurements to tracks and estimate target location and velocity, and sensor resource management to automatically select optimum radar mode parameters and timing sequences. Technologies are planned for transition to the Navy, Army and Air Force.

Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing (U) The Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program develops electro-optical and infrared sensors and surveillance for aerial platforms. Significant challenges arise as the result of two warfighting trends. First, the ever-changing mix of airborne platforms now includes a greater number of smaller UAVs. Second, the target set is increasingly challenging and now includes vehicles and individual dismounts that operate under foliage and in urban canyons, using camouflage, obscurants, and other means of concealment. In response to these challenges, the Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program brings recent advances in optical, electro-optical, photonic and other technologies to airborne optical sensing systems. Specific examples of these technologies include: embedded image processors tailored to real-time detection, identification, and tracking of military targets; hyper-spectral sensing technologies; flash detection, and underwater object detection; advanced laser radar technologies; advanced digital signal processing to support onboard image reconstruction, atmospheric correction, and system calibration; video exploitation techniques, including new approaches to scene understanding and activity detection; and adaptive optics techniques, such as deformable mirrors and liquid crystal spatial light modulators. The program extends these technologies and makes them practical for airborne surveillance systems. Efforts in this program include: The Standoff Precision ID in 3-D (SPI 3-D) program is developing an affordable sensor package capable of high-resolution 3-D images for confirmatory target ID at long ranges as well as full field of view (FOV) ranging to support precise geolocation of targets. The system provides intensity, range and polarization information for each pixel in the field of view with each laser pulse. The program includes a series of ground-based and airborne demonstrations of SPI 3-D precision ID capabilities and track fusion techniques.

Results will provide commanders with significantly improved long-range identification of enemy ground targets, as well as targeting information to support guided weaponry. The SPI 3-D system employs optics, focal plane arrays, and gimbals combined with a range measurement technique. SPI 3-D technologies are being designed to be compatible with operational ISR systems and may be installed in a joint-service ISR pod (such as LITENING) or a Class IV UAV (Predator, Firescout & Warrior) Multi-spectral Targeting System (MTS) turret. A manned airborne demonstration of SPI-3D components in an ISR pod will be performed to illustrate SPI-3D capabilities. Subsequent to the manned airborne demonstration, transition will be to the U.S. Air Force at the conclusion of Phase III. The program will produce high speed, ultra sensitive photodetectors for systems requiring operation at very low photon counts. This will support long range sensors that can detect highly obscured targets under canopy/camouflage as well as very wide-area search for submerged targets including sea mines and semi-submerged mobile vessels. Video and 3-D imaging through obscurants (VITO) will enable robust under-canopy, high-resolution real-time 3-D video and imagery and for target detection, identification, and tracking based on real-time Volumetric Change Detection (VCD) or Volumetric Moving Target Indication (VMTI). VITO will employ high speed, ultra sensitive photo-detectors and selective range gate processing to permit improved viewing under obscurations.

Wide Area Video Surveillance technologies are planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force. Efforts in this program include: The Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance - Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) program is developing an airborne sensor system that provides persistent, real-time, high-resolution, wide- area video surveillance. ARGUS-IS will provide the warfighter with a minimum of sixty-five \"Predator like\" video windows across the field of view. Each video window is electronically steerable and independent of the others. ARGUS-IS can also provide a global moving target indicator for vehicle size objects across the entire field of view. ARGUS-IS is comprised of three major subsystems: (1) a Gigapixel Sensor Subsystem (GSS) which consists of a set of four telescopes and is mounted in a 3- axis stabilized gimbal; (2) an Airborne Processing Subsystem (APS) which takes raw pixels from the GSS and performs all required processing; and (3) a ground processing subsystem which provides the interface to the user and records down-linked imagery. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the transition of ARGUS-IS from DARPA to the U.S. Air Force has been executed. The transition period is FY 2009 - FY 2010. The Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance - Infrared (ARGUS-IR) program is developing an airborne sensor system that provides a persistent, real-time, high-resolution, wide- area night video surveillance capability. ARGUS-IR uses an advanced infrared (IR) focal plane array (FPA) sensor. The nighttime persistent capability provided by ARGUS-IR combined with the daytime capability provided by ARGUS-IS enables 24-hour day/night surveillance. ARGUS-IR's wide-area, high-update-rate, high-resolution imaging capability will enable detection and tracking of dismounts as well as vehicles. ARGUS-IR will utilize the signal/image processor developed as part of ARGUS-IS, enabling ARGUS-IS and ARGUS-IR to be combined into a common pod. ARGUS-IR must overcome a number of demanding technical challenges beyond those faced by ARGUS-IS. The most significant challenges relate to the IR FPA and size, weight, and power constraints for the IR sensor. Technologies are planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force.

Wide- area continuous tracking of moving vehicles requires very small coverage gaps, small resolution cells, and target separation and identification features. The ideal sensor has the area coverage rates of GMTI radar and the resolution/identification capabilities of an electro-optical infrared system. The LACOSTE program will provide wide area surveillance, simultaneous tracking, and target engagement with electro-optical and infrared sensors for tactical GMTI operations. The program is developing a sensor with a very wide field of regard (90 degree cone angle), and a wide instantaneous field of view (FOV) that is rapidly scanned in a search-while-track mode, tracking up to 10,000 targets in an urban area. Additionally, the LACOSTE sensor will provide next-generation precision tracking to enable engagement on a large number of (approximately 100) targets in dense urban areas within that same field of regard with minimal penalty on the search-mode area coverage rate. The program is also developing a rapid \"zoom\" capability for target identification that enables feature-aided tracking through dense target environments, plus sufficient target identification for separating like-targets when back-tracking a particular target via the historical track data. The LACOSTE technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army at the conclusion of the program.

(U) The Super-Resolution Vision System (SRVS) program will develop and build a field prototype soldier-portable optical system that will demonstrate improved recognition and identification range over existing systems. The key technical innovation is exploitation of atmospheric turbulence-generated micro-lensing phenomena to generate images that are superior to diffraction-limited images. A variation of lenses approach, to include adaptive polymer lenses, will also be investigated. SRVS will facilitate new operational and tactical opportunities for land forces. Through enhanced resolution imaging, SRVS will (1) extend target recognition and identification to decisively longer distances; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage. It will culminate in a field demonstration of a prototype. (U) Additionally, the program will investigate the ability to overcome field of view (FOV) and depth of field (DOF) limitations of conventional optical systems such as those encountered in macro photography by obviating the need for steering or focusing of the optical system through the use of conventional lenses. Recent advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged. It is expected that combining this approach with active 3D laser radar systems will result in the reduction of the overall size, weight and power of imaging systems while providing high-resolution detail at several ranges for target identification purposes. Technology developed under this program will transition to Special Operations Forces.

Humans are able to operate successfully with sensor assistance, but situational awareness significantly degrades. Successful development of this technology will restore this situational awareness to tactically relevant distance and time scales. Significant technical obstacles that must be overcome include development of an ultra-short pulse laser with sufficient bandwidth and fast enough pulse rise time to create transient-like propagation characteristics in an aerosol cloud, distributed active sources, and advanced filtering techniques.

This program will develop and demonstrate robust, low cost, small size, weight and power (SWAP) distributed electronic warfare (EW) platforms to allow the warfighter to disrupt and impede an adversary's communication network. The PreEW program uses an array of nodes that have synchronized clocks to enable the signal from each node to be aligned so that the carrier and phase are focused on the desired location. The effect will be to place the desired energy on the specific target area while not affecting the non-target area. The node is planned to contain localization, network, synchronization and jamming processing and communication in a low-cost, easily deployable package.

Transparent Earth (U) The goal of the Transparent Earth program is to determine the physical, chemical, and dynamic properties of the earth down to 5 km depth, including natural or man-made structures at militarily- relevant spatial scales. The program will focus on two key challenges: the first is to develop a common data model for, or mathematical description of, a three-dimensional section of the earth, to enable aggregation of disparate measurements. The second challenge is to take advantage of emerging sensors and natural indicators of subsurface activity and combine these (along with existing sources) with new algorithms/mathematics (based on algorithm developments under the Airborne Tomography using Active Electromagnetics (ATAEM) program in Project SEN-01) to estimate physical/chemical properties for volumetric elements throughout the earth. Success in these two challenges will lead to the integration of the volumetric elements into a global three-dimensional picture of the earth's subsurface with variable spatial, temporal, and information resolution, allowing changes at local scales to propagate through both physical models and proximity rules to update the global picture. Transparent Earth technology is anticipated to transition to the Army, Air Force, and SOCOM, as well as mapping/intelligence organizations such as NGA and DIA in 2015.

Target Identification Technology (U) The Target Identification Technology thrust develops semiautomatic methods to identify targets from sensors operating in all spectral bands. Its objective is to detect, characterize, and identify military threats, and to assess the environment around them. Data sources include national, theater, and organic sensors. Exploiting the acoustic emissions of potential targets is of interest because acoustics has the advantage of not requiring an unobstructed line of sight between the emitter and sensor, and under certain circumstances sound may propagate great distances. Critical performance metrics are timeliness, accuracy, error rates, and interpretation workload. The thrust addresses the challenges of target identification, acquisition and tracking under restrictive rules of engagement.

Sandblaster addressed this important operational challenge in a Blackhawk platform environment, in four distinct areas: (1) Advanced flight controls which enable the helicopter to auto-land at a pilot-selected landing point; (2) See-through sensing based on a forward-looking three dimensional W-band radar, which enables the pilot to see through the dust and select a safe landing point; (3) A powerful fusion engine which combines map and obstacle database knowledge with real-time radar data to construct a full current assessment of landing zone hazards; and (4) An enhanced synthetic vision display to present this evolving real-time landing zone information to the pilot in the most useful manner, combined with all necessary aircraft-state symbology needed to complete a safe landing. The technology developed under this program transitioned to U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Completed Sandblaster system performance testing and demonstrated capabilities in the JUH-60A Blackhawk helicopter. - Transitioned Sandblaster technology to the services. FY 2010 Plans: - Commence design of a lighter weight system for use on DoD operational helicopters.

(U) The Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) program provided optical techniques to correct for crosswinds on ballistic objects. The C-WINS program developed a novel weapon mounted optical correction sighting system for various rifles and machine guns. An eye safe laser and a high speed camera record motion of eddies in the atmosphere to measure the wind profile that will be used to provide ballistic correction. The system provides offset corrections to the shooter for compensating the aim point affected by the crosswind. Key parameters of interest are: a) bullet hit points less than the target size at any range up to weapons effective range; b) down range profiling up to weapons effective range; c) ranging accuracy sufficient to provide elevation correction; d) automatic ballistic correction; e) day/night operation; and f) no setup or calibration. Additional capabilities could include: increased effective ranges for a wide range of weapons; eye safe ranging; increased ID range during day and night; and shimmer compensation. This program transitioned to the U.S. Army and Marines. (U) Leveraging technologies developed under the Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) program, the Dynamic Image Gunsight Optics (DInGO) program will develop an optical scope that enables a soldier, with minimal training, to shoot a firearm with marksman accuracy. The ability to engage targets at range with a conventional firearm is currently limited by user training rather than the accuracy of the weapon. The technology developed under this program line will enhance a soldier's ability to observe and engage targets at range as well as enhance the capability for close quarters combat. Technical achievements under other programs in this PE/Project provide the basis for radically new approaches to optical scopes, dynamic imaging systems, and low-power video analytics. By extending the capability of combat optics, DInGO enables a soldier to operate at the limit of the system performance with reduced training requirements. Transition to the Army in 2013 is anticipated. FY 2009 Accomplishments: Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) - Developed transition and manufacturing plans.

(U) The Laser Geospatial Referencing (LGR) system investigated technologies to allow ground troops to designate targets for engagement by air forces where the pilot or UAV operator can see the designated spots within the field of view of their visible or forward looking infrared system. The LGR concept looked to provide nearly instantaneous target location, identification and designation capabilities to weapon platforms supporting urban or other ground operations. The LGR concept enables these assets to be immediately directed by dismounted soldiers. Data developed in this program transitioned to the U.S. Army and Marine ground forces and U.S. Air Force.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets. In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis. Efforts will focus on difficult ISR environments, for example (a) urban environments with extensive building obscuration, large volumes of civilian traffic, and feature-rich terrain, (b) mountain environments with highly variable terrain elevation, complex local and regional threat networks, and predominantly dismounted adversaries, and (c) jungle environments with targets under heavy canopy, animal and other sources of clutter masking human activity, and widely dispersed threat activities. The resulting technology will enable operators to more effectively use ISR data in the execution of a wide variety of wide area search, border and road monitoring, high value target tracking, overwatch, and other missions.

Results will inform future experiments, lead to specifications for future sensor design, and provide insights into how to integrate other narrow and wide area sensors into an integrated approach to countering insurgencies. Transition is planned for U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command. FY 2010 Plans: - Conclude the Chemical Detection Experiment series, analyze results, and provide data to inform new sensor designs. - Examine the feasibility of new sensor designs. FY 2011 Base Plans: - Design and develop new sensors specific to close-in insurgent activity detection. - Demonstrate new insurgent activity detection techniques in field exercises at the National Training Center. Foliage Penetrating Radar Planning and Exploitation (U) The Foliage Penetrating Radar Planning and Exploitation program will complete final Forester FOPEN radar demonstrations (previously budgeted in PE0603767E, Project SEN-02) and provide further exploitation capabilities to find dismounted targets in densely forested terrain. Current foliage penetrating radar systems provide an important capability for detecting dismount targets under foliage, but the systems also detect animals, moving water, blowing trees, and other scene clutter moving under or in the foliage that makes situation assessment manpower and radar resource intensive. Further, Doppler signature data that experiments indicate may enable improved automated discrimination of dismount targets from other detections is not currently exploited. Finally, no planning tools are available for optimizing and dynamically replanning collection assets to improve imaging geometries and detectability. This program will provide capabilities to address these issues by exploiting Doppler signature data, automating temporal processing approaches currently used, and automating terrain, weather, and on-line exploitation data to enable planning and dynamic replanning.

Multi-Sensor Exploitation (U) The Multi-Sensor Exploitation program continues efforts previously budgeted in PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 and will provide multi-sensor exploitation capabilities enabling mission overwatch, border surveillance, high value target tracking, and threat network detection using mixes of imaging, radar, signals, human intelligence, and other sources. Key challenges in the first two missions include real-time and wide area dismount and vehicle target detection, discrimination, tracking, and pattern of life analysis. Key challenges in the third mission include tracking through periods of obscuration and confusion in environments in which existing sensors and methods are not able to provide high quality signature data. Key challenges in the fourth mission include discriminating threats from large volumes of civilian clutter and determining the behavior patterns of and relationships between those threats. The Multi-sensor Exploitation program will develop new target tracking methods for wide area motion imaging sensors enabling long duration tracking of vehicles and dismounts through the development of new target dynamic modeling methods, new processing methods tailored to dismounts, and new methods for signature aided tracking. The program will develop new methods for automatically correlating different sources of information to identify threats, estimate threat networks, and analyze behavioral patterns.

Target Identification (U) The Target Identification program continues efforts previously budgeted in PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 to develop methods to detect, characterize, and identify targets from both electromagnetic and acoustic sensors. Data sources include national, theater, and organic sensors. Exploiting the acoustic emissions of potential targets is of interest because acoustics do not require an unobstructed line of sight between the emitter and sensor, and under certain circumstances sound may propagate great distances. Critical performance metrics are timeliness, accuracy, error rates, and interpretation workload. The program addresses the challenges of target identification, acquisition, tracking and denial in difficult environments. The technologies will apply advanced signal processing and control to leverage advances in sensor capabilities.

This requires that: 1) military surveillance and targeting systems geolocate targets accurately in the same coordinate system in which the weapon system navigates; 2) the surveillance, targeting and weapon systems have precision navigation and guidance systems on-board; and 3) navigation and target location systems robustly operate day/night and in adverse weather. In addition, future systems designed to accomplish precision strike missions must be significantly more affordable. Thrusts are included in this project to improve our ability to navigate when the Global Positioning System (GPS) is jammed or otherwise unavailable; to increase the versatility of navigation systems applications by developing microelectromechanical sensor inertial navigation system technologies; and to apply the geolocation technologies/techniques to precision threat geolocation of short-dwell emitters or passive air defense systems.

The greater strength and diversity of these signals will provide coverage when GPS is denied due to environmental conditions or hostile activity. This is a two-part program: (1) cataloging and assessing potential exploitable signals followed by analysis and performance modeling and hardware-based concept validation, and; (2) designing, testing, and demonstrating a (non-form-fit) prototype receiver(s) and algorithms for geolocation using the SoOP.

These sensors utilize the quantum- mechanical wave-like nature of atoms in the atomic analogue of an optical interferometer to provide unprecedented sensitivity to accelerations and rotations. The atomic sensors will further be used to measure the local gravitational field gradient to ensure that instrument alignment is properly maintained throughout vehicle maneuver, thus mitigating gravity-induced navigation errors. Initial program efforts will focus on developing fundamental technology components upon which future systems would be constructed. While originally planned for transition to the Navy at the conclusion of Phase III, program developments indicate opportunities for insertion in multiple Service applications and plans are being revised accordingly. FY 2009 Accomplishments: - Completed extensive laboratory testing single degree-of-freedom atom-based inertial measurement unit and single-axis gravity gradiometer and evaluated long-term performance characteristics. - Designed and constructed pre-production prototype for final evaluation by Marine Corps combat swimmers. FY 2010 Plans: - Complete study of technical hurdles preventing 200 hour continuous sensor system operation and design system changes to address key items identified. - Devise transition plan for technology insertion consistent with Department of Defense Positioning, Navigation, micro-scale gyros with navigation-grade performance that use only milli-watts of power.
