L., Hellertown, PA Are you looking for real solutions but don't know where to turn? Are you looking for a doctor trained in pharmaceuticals AND homeopathy? Are you looking for a doctor who truly listens? Your visit with a naturopathic doctor will likely be different than any other doctor's visit. Your first visit is one hour, giving you the time to get your questions answered. Explanations for your condition will be in plain English. Whether it's an acute illness or a longstanding condition, recommendations will be given that truly address your symptoms, and the underlying cause as well. Many people come to naturopathic doctors because they are unsatisfied with their current health or with their current treatments. Many have been on the same medication for years with their condition 'managed', while suffering from the side effects of the drug. Many have been told by conventional doctors that there is nothing more that conventional medicine has to offer. Conventional medicine has much to offer, especially in life-threatening emergencies, but may leave their chronically ill patients with unmet needs.
