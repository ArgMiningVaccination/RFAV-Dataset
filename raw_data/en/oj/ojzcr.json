Under both the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for key sectors and the provincial civil service vaccination directive, all employees are required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30. Those who are partially vaccinated may be subject to other health and safety measures, including testing. Those who do not have a first dose by today will face employment consequences, including unpaid leave, which will begin tomorrow, December 1. Latest data shows 99 per cent of frontline healthcare, continuing care, paramedics, education employees' and others in the COVID-19 vaccine mandate have at least one dose of vaccine. It also shows 99 per cent of provincial government employees have at least one dose. \"Nova Scotians are showing they care about the people they serve by getting vaccinated and keeping them safe,\" said Premier Tim Houston. \"I'm told there will be few disruptions to service as vaccination rates are very high.\" Government is working with all organizations to monitor and address any impacts. All organizations have contingency plans, but most are anticipating they will not be needed. The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development says there may be some disruption to school busing in Halifax Regional Centre for Education (HRCE) and small pockets in other education regions. School regions are working with their bus providers and staff to mitigate impacts to students and families. In HRCE, drivers may be assigned to new routes and one driver may need to cover an additional route before and after school, leading to potential delays for students. Families will be notified if there is a change or delay to their child's bus route. The Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care is working closely with long-term care facilities and home-care agencies to ensure residents and seniors continue to get the care they need. While vaccination rates are high across the sector, existing workforce shortages mean that even a small number of unvaccinated staff could result in a facility or agency not being able to accept new residents or seniors. Contingency plans could include using employment agencies and travelling nursing staff and offering part-time and casual staff full-time employment.
