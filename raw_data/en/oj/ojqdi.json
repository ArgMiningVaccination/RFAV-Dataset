It uses the [Meridian](/index.php/Meridian_(Chinese_medicine)) theory of [Traditional Chinese Medicine](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_Medicine) that was introduced into Japan from China. Meridian Shiatsu contrasts with [Tsubo Shiatsu](/index.php/Tsubo_Shiatsu) where the tsubos or [acupuncture points](/index.php/Acupuncture_point) are determined from an [anatomical](/index.php/Anatomy) and [physiological](/index.php/Physiology) perspective. However, the clinical results of Tsubo Shiatsu and Meridian Shiatsu are comparable because the location of meridian points and Tsubos are identical or very close. Only the underlying theories differ. In 1964, a book called \"Anpuku and Shiatsu Therapy\", edited Izawa](/index.php?title=Tadashi_Izawa&action=edit&redlink=1), introduced comparing [Anma](/index.php/Anma), which uses meridian theory, with Shiatsu therapy for the first time. Other styles of Shiatsu incorporating meridian theory were developed by Iwajiro Sato, the author of \"Shiatsu Therapy and Syoatsu Therapy\" and [Shizuto Masunaga](/index.php?title=Shizuto_Masunaga&action=edit&redlink=1), the founder of [Zen Shiatsu](/index.php/Zen_Shiatsu). proponents of Shiatsu using Meridian theory follow Tadashi Izawa's original tenets. Meridian Shiatsu practitioners use their entire bodies in a graceful art form to catalyze change in the patient. \"Diagnosis and Therapy Combined\" is a common [mantra](/index.php?title=Mantra&action=edit&redlink=1) of this practice. Setsu Shin in Japanese means \"touching diagnosis\" and also \"cutting diagnosis\" (cutting as with a knife). Meridian Shiatsu practitioners cut through the outer layers to touch the living essence within. Simply by laying hands on a recipient, meridian shiatsu practitioners seek to effect profound transformation. Touching the innermost being of a receiver equates to treatment. As the inner experience of an individual is acknowledged by their kinsmen, the internal paradoxes are reconciled and healing is possible.
