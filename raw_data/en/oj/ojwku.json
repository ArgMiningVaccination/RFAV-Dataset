Unfortunately, we do not have a direct answer, but this is often a time to engage a person in reflection about a shift to a more healthful lifestyle, and to con- sider options for change for the both patient and family. We get enough information about diet and lifestyle in the media that the prob- lem is not lack of knowledge. The greatest challenge is one's determination to keep the changes going for the long term. Ronald Glick, MD Medical Director, Center for Integrative Medicine Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and Family Medi- cine According to the American Cancer Society, close to one half of all men and over one third of all women will develop cancer in their lifetimes. It's fair to say that almost everyone's life is touched in one way or another by this disease. Taking a holistic approach, there are three points in time when we can have the greatest impact. We see a lot in the media about the newest tests and screenings as well as options in can- cer treatments, but our greatest challenge is in preventing the initial development of can- cer. Each year research tells us more about factors that increase the risk of cancer, as well as other health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Taken together, it's clear that diet is a big factor. While studies are mixed, specific concerns that may contribute to cancer risk include hormones in meat and dairy, and environmental toxins such as pesti- cides and bisphenol A (BPA in plastics), which can act as a xeno -estrogen (xeno meaning foreign), exerting a prolonged hormonal ef- fect on the system. During cancer treatment, our focus shifts to providing support to allow the therapy to go easier and alleviate symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and nausea. Supportive measures may include modalities such as acupuncture, mas- sage therapy, and shiatsu. Additionally, daily practices such as meditation, yoga, tai chi, and qi gong can reduce the impact of stress and improve energy. Shadyside Place Suite 310 580 S. Aiken Ave 412-623-3023 integrativemedicine.upmc.com Structural Integration \u2014Less Pain, More Function Pioneered in the 1950s by Dr. Ida Rolf, Struc- tural Integration (SI) works on the body's fascia, the connective tissue wrapping of every muscle, bone, and nerve, as well as ligaments and tendons. Recent scientific findings indicate that fascia works hydraulically and participates in every body movement. SI, also known as Rolfing, takes an anatomical and postural approach to chronic pain and performance issues. It's founded on the premise that function follows form, that shape matters, says structural integrator, David Lesondak, BCSI. If you have three patients with the exact same pain symptoms, the treatment works better when you factor in the individual differences in their posture. Even though their pain may be in the same areas, the causes may not be. Once the structure is analyzed, a specific treatment plan is designed, tailored to the individual. The treatment consists of slow, precise fascial and myofascial releases with equally slow movement participation from the patient. Slower is better in my world, says Mr. Lesondak. That way I can be more pre- cise and find the right level of pressure and depth. It also ensures the best comfort and effectiveness levels for the patient. Addition- ally, it has an end point, with most finding that 10 to 12 treatments over a period of three to five months is sufficient to make positive changes and keep them. David Lesondak, BCSI, practices Structural Integration, a form of bodywork that treats fascia, at the Center for Integrative Medicine. He has collaborated with leaders in the field of fascia research in developing the video series, Fascia Research Pioneers, as well as a three -DVD volume on fascial anatomy, Anatomy Trains Revealed.

For many people with cancer, treatment may include lymph nodes being removed or damaged by surgery or radiation. This can place them at risk for developing lymphedema, which is a permanent, but manageable condition that occurs when excess fluid is retained in the lymph nodes and the interstitial spaces (between cells and sur- rounding tissues). Swelling is most often in the extremities, but can occur anywhere in the body, and may not even develop until years after treatment. In addition to medical and surgical treatment, the lymphatic system can be impaired by trauma, infection, stress, inac- tivity, tight clothing, and age. Newer surgical approaches, particu- larly for breast cancer, try to spare as many lymph nodes as possi- ble, which may prevent lymphedema. A healthy lymphatic system is critical to our body's ability to main- tain a healthy immune system, detoxify, drain stagnant fluids, and regenerate tissues. Lymph drainage therapy (LDT) is a very gentle, non-invasive hands -on technique developed for achieving proper functioning of the human fluid system. It also is very calming to the central nervous system. While regular LDT is not a guarantee against developing lymphedema, it is an outstanding preventive treatment for health maintenance. Second Annual Amy Stine Workshop on Holistic Medicine April 2, 2011 Massage Therapy \u2014Its Role in Cancer Care ing issues around mind, body, and spirit. Following her tragic death two years ago, her family has worked to create a venue for the education of physicians, other health care practitioners, and the community at large in collaboration with the De- partment of Family Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the Center for Integrative Medicine, in order to learn more about the kind of practice Dr. Stine embodied. The keynote speaker for this year's program is Dr. Ben Kligler, a family physician from Albert Einstein Medical Center in New York, who is involved in all aspects of integrative medicine. Dr. Kligler is founding medical director of his hospital's integra- tive health clinic. He directs the Integrative Medi- cine Fellowship Program at Beth Israel Hospital, Shadyside Place Suite 310 580 S. Aiken Ave 412-623-3023 integrativemedicine.upmc.com With the success of the program last spring, we are pleased to announce that the Amy Stine Workshop on Holistic Medicine will become an annual event. Dr. Amy Stine was a much beloved holistic family physician who devoted her practice to address-and is co -editor -in-chief of Explore, the Journal of Science and Healing . Dr. Kligler also is the chair - elect of the Consortium of Academic Health Cen- ters for Integrative Medicine, a group of 46 North American medical schools of which the University of Pittsburgh is a member. His lecture is titled, Environmental Health: The Benefits of Going Green. Local faculty also will be presenting at the program. This year, two programs will run concurrently: one primarily geared for physicians and other health professionals seeking continuing education credits, and a second program for the community. The program will run from the morning to early after- noon on Saturday, April 2, at UPMC Shadyside. For more information and to register, follow the link at https://ccehs.upmc.edu . Lymphatic Drainage Therapy \u2014Erin Custer Simon, CMT, LLC Therapeutic Massage \u2014Jessie Violet Larson, NCTMB Unfortunately, we all have been touched by cancer, either personally or among our friends and family. While modern medicine is continually dis- covering new therapies and medicines to treat its many forms, massage is accepted more frequently as a beneficial treatment. Studies have found that regular massage -therapy patients experience significant decreases in levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol also ties in with the im- mune system and partially explains the connection between psychological stress and altered immunity. While it's too soon to say to what extent massage therapy may enhance the immune system, there are more tangible benefits for individuals whose lives are touched by cancer. Patients undergoing treatment for cancer may experience muscle pain from decreased activity. Massage therapy can cer- tainly help relax and loosen tight muscles. Studies with cancer patients also find benefits for stress and anxiety, mood, and physical symptoms such as nausea. I had the opportunity to study and work with Gayle MacDonald, who literally wrote the book on massage therapy for people with cancer. The most important thing I learned, which I see in my practice every day, is that everybody has a unique story. My passion as a therapist is discov- ering an individual's needs and goals, and working together on a plan of massage therapy treatment towards relief and recovery.

Other integrative medicine modali- ties may not have been subjected to the same level of scientific inquiry as western medicine treatments. The Center for Integrative Medicine, in concert with the University of Pittsburgh, is actively pursuing re- search to support the benefits of these therapies.

PITT Study T ests Chiropractic and Medical Care for Low Back Pain \u2014Principal Investigator Michael Schneider, DC, PhD Low back pain is the second most common reason, after the common cold, for a patient to seek medical treatment. There is evidence that both chiropractic manipulation and standard medical care with anti -inflammatory medica- tions can help relieve back pain. What is not yet known is whether some patients respond better to one type of treatment compared to the other. This study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, is designed to help answer that question as well as compare the two most common types of chiropractic manipulation. Most people think of chiropractic manipulation as a hands -on procedure in which the chiro- practor has the patient lie on one side and gently twists the spine into alignment. Manual manipulation is often accompanied by a little click or popping sound. This method is cer- tainly the most common type of manipulation used by chiropractors; however, many chiro- practors also use various devices - instead of their hands - to deliver a gentle mechanical force to realign the spine. This method is known as mechanically -assisted manipulation. This research study will compare the effective-ness of the manual and mechanical types of manipulation to see if they are equally effec- tive, or if one appears to give better pain relief. Both types of manipulation will be compared to standard medical treatment. For patients to be eligible for this low back pain study, they must be eighteen or over, experiencing a new episode of low back pain, and willing to come to the Center for Integra- tive Medicine for treatment twice a week for four weeks. No prescription drugs or x -rays are involved in this trial. All treatments \u2014 whether standard medical care or chiropractic care\u2014will be provided at no charge, and re- search volunteers will be compensated for their time and transportation costs.
