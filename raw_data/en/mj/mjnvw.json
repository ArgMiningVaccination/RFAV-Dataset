162 3 / 166 An Equal Opportunity Institution STATEMENT OF NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY It is the policy of the College that no person shall, on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, family or marital status, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation or genetic information be subjected to any discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended; Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972; the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008; Delaware's anti-discrimination law and other applicable laws, regulations and Executive Orders. All persons associated with the college are subject to this policy while on property owned or controlled by the college or while acting in an official capacity, including faculty, staff, officers, trustees, volunteers, contractors and vendors. In addition, this policy applies to conduct that occurs off college property or is otherwise unrelated to the person's association with the college if: 1.The conduct was in connection with a college or college-recognized program, activity or event; 2.The conduct is alleged to have created a hostile environment for a member of the college community; 3.The conduct disrupts the normal operations and processes of the college and is offensive to the college's mission; 4.The continued presence of the individual accused of violating this policy poses a moderate or higher threat to any member of the college community; or 5.The nature of the alleged conduct adversely affects the reputation, mission, image or public perception of the college. This policy applies to recruitment, employment and subsequent placement, training, promotion, compensation, continuation, probation, discharge and other terms and conditions of employment over which the College has jurisdiction as well as to all educational programs and activities. The College has designated a Civil Rights Coordinator, who serves as the College's Title IX Coordinator and the College's ADA/Section 504 Coordinator, to carry out its commitment to equal opportunity and nondiscrimination. Inquiries or complaints by students or employees regarding the College's nondiscrimination policies may be addressed to: Christina M. Garcia, Civil Rights & Title IX Coordinator, Office of the President, 100 Campus Drive, Dover, DE 19904, (302) 857-1903, civilrights@dtcc.edu (Revised Board of Trustees 6/18/2018)POLICY ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT The College is committed to maintaining and strengthening a learning environment founded on civility and respect, and to providing programs, activities and an educational environment free from all forms of violence. Any act of sexual misconduct is also a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. The College has a zero tolerance policy for violence and discrimination and is committed to eliminating all forms of sexual misconduct and discrimination from its campuses. Therefore, it is the policy of the College that students and employees of the College are prohibited from committing any and all acts of sexual misconduct. The College is also committed to fostering a community that promotes prompt reporting of any allegations of sexual misconduct and the timely investigation and fair resolution of any report of sexual misconduct. While the College has the greatest respect for a victim's or survivor's right to privacy and confidentiality, the College must balance those rights against the safety and welfare of the College community. Therefore, it is the policy of the College that any allegation of sexual misconduct will be investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the College's policy, unless otherwise stated therein. It further retains its discretion to report acts of sexual misconduct to law enforcement authorities based on the nature and seriousness of such allegations. Any person who violates this Policy will be subject to disciplinary action including, but not limited to, dismissal from the College or termination from employment. Reporting Acts of Sexual Misconduct The College encourages any person who believes that he or she has been a victim of sexual misconduct to report the alleged misconduct to any College employee or any member of the Board of Trustees of the College as soon as possible (hereafter \"Responsible Employee\"). Duties of a Responsible Employee All Responsible Employees are required to report any allegations of sexual misconduct they receive to the Title IX Coordinator. Allegations of sexual misconduct can be made verbally or in writing to the Responsible Employee and may come from either the victim, a third party or the accused. In addition, the Responsible Employee shall also: 1. Advise the reporting person of his or her obligation to report the allegations of sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator. The employee must also advise the complainant that, depending on the nature and 4 / 166 seriousness of the allegations, the College reserves the right to notify law enforcement authorities of the alleged misconduct. 2. Advise the reporting person that Delaware Tech will respect the privacy of the reporting person or victim and will maintain confidentiality on behalf of the reporting person or victim to the extent the law and Delaware Tech's policies permit. 3. Advise the victim that the victim may contact law enforcement or Delaware Tech Public Safety and that the employee will contact law enforcement or Delaware Tech Public Safety on the victim's behalf if requested. 4. Notify law enforcement or Public Safety within 24 hours after the victim requests such notification. 5. Advise the victim that he or she is entitled to certain rights in criminal proceedings and direct him or her to: The Victim's Bill of Rights, Chapter 94, Title 11 of the Delaware Code: http://delcode.delaware.gov/title11/c094/index.shtml 6. Provide information to the victim regarding confidential medical, counseling, and advocacy services, or direct him or her to: https://www.dtcc.edu/about/public-safety/sexual-violenc e 7. Contact the Child Abuse and Neglect Report Line for the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families at (800) 292-9582, if the victim is a minor at the time of the report. Responsibilities of a Campus Security Authority A \"Campus Security Authority\" is a Delaware Tech employee who is also a campus administrator, a member of the College's Public Safety Department, Deans of Student Affairs (including professional staff), Deans of Instruction (including professional staff), Directors of Human Resources (including professional staff), athletic directors and coaches, faculty advisors to a student group, disabilities support counselors, a member of the CARE Threat Assessment Team, community resource contacts, the Title IX Coordinator and Review Officers. An employee who is a Campus Security Authority and who receives a report of sexual misconduct must report the allegations of misconduct to both the Title IX Coordinator and the Delaware Tech Public Safety Department. If the reporting person requests that the misconduct not be reported to Public Safety, the employee shall advise the reporting person that the employee must report the allegations of sexual misconduct, but will report only non-identifying information in order to maintain the reporting person's request for confidentiality. Sexual Misconduct Defined Sexual misconduct is comprised of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual harassment, stalking and hate crimes, which are defined as follows:: 1. Sexual Assault \"Sexual Assault\" means any sexual act or acts committed on a person who has not consented to such act or acts or for which a person is incapable of consenting due to age, intoxication or other reasons. Sexual assault includes, but is not limited to: A. Rape, or attempted rape; B. Intentional and unwelcome sexual touching (including disrobing or exposure), however slight, with any body part or any object, by a person upon another person without consent, of the person's breasts, buttocks, groin, or genitals (or clothing covering such areas), or coercing, forcing, or attempting to coerce or force another to touch you, themselves, or a third party with any of the body parts or areas when such touching would be reasonably and objectively offensive; C. Any sexual act in which there is force, violence, or use of duress or deception upon the victim; D. Any sexual act perpetrated when the victim is unable to give consent; and, E. Sexual intimidation, which includes, but is not limited to: 1.Threatening, expressly or impliedly, to commit a sexual act upon another person without his or her consent; 2.Stalking or cyber-stalking; and, 3.Engaging in indecent exposure. 2. Dating and Domestic Violence Both dating and domestic violence encompass any sexual, verbal, or emotional abuse of one partner by the other in a romantic relationship. While arguing and \"verbal fighting\" occurs in all relationships, intimate partner violence is about power and control. Partner violence can be hard to identify and victims often have difficulty in recognizing and acknowledging partner violence due to the nature of the relationship and complex feelings between the victim and abuser. \"Dating Violence\" means abuse or violence committed by a person: A. Who is, or has been, in a relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; B. Where there is, or has been, abuse, as defined in this policy, or a pattern of behavior in the relationship which 5 / 166 is used to establish power and control over the victim through fear and intimidation. 1.\"Pattern of Behavior\" means behavior by one party in an intimate relationship that is used to establish power and control over the other person in the relationship through fear and intimidation. 2.A pattern of behavior is determined based on the repeated use of words and/or actions and inactions in order to demean, intimidate, and/or control another person. This behavior can be verbal, emotional and/or physical. C. Examples of abuse, which can occur singly or as a pattern of behavior, include but are not limited to, slapping, pulling hair, punching, damaging property, driving recklessly to scare someone, name calling, humiliating one in public, harassment directed toward a current or former partner or spouse, threats of abuse, such as threatening to hit, harm or use a weapon on another, or other forms of threat. \"Domestic Violence\" means abuse or violence committed by a current or former spouse of the victim; by a person who is cohabiting with the victim where they hold themselves out as a couple, with or without a child in common; by a person living separate and apart from the victim with a child in common; or by a person in a current or former substantive dating relationship with the victim, or by any person similarly situated to a spouse or intimate partner of the victim under the domestic violence laws of the State of Delaware; or by a person against a family member as that term is defined in \u00a7901(12) , Title 10 of the Delaware Code; or by any person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic violence laws of the State of Delaware. 3. Stalking \"Stalking\" means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to: (i) fear for his or her safety or the safety of others; or (ii) suffer substantial emotional distress. A. \"Course of conduct\" means two or more acts, including but not limited, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follow, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person's property. It can include, but is not limited to: 1.Non-consensual communication (face-to-face, telephone, email) 2. Threatening or obscene gestures; 3.Surveillance/following/pursuit; 4.Showing up outside the victim's classroom or workplace;5.Sending gifts (romantic, bizarre, sinister, or perverted) 6. Making threats B. \"Emotional distress\" means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily require medical or other professional treatment or counseling. C. \"Reasonable person\" means a reasonable person under the circumstances and with similar identities to the victim. Stalking behavior has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's academic or work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive learning and work environment. Incidents of stalking occurring on or off the College's campuses are subject to the College's disciplinary process. 4. Sexual Harassment \"Sexual Harassment\" means any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, written, or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: A. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's education; or B. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for academic decisions affecting that individual; or C. If non-physical, such conduct is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that the victim is effectively denied equal access to the College's resources and opportunities. Sexual harassment may involve individuals of the same or different gender. Sexual harassment is most frequently associated with those situations in which a power differential exists between persons involved; however, it also may occur between individuals of the same College status, i.e., student-student. Examples of severe and pervasive non-physical conduct, which may constitute sexual harassment when such expression is so objectively offensive that it denies the victim equal access to the College's resources and opportunities include, but are not limited to: A. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other non-physical conduct of a sexual nature; B. Sexually explicit statements, comments, questions, pictures, objects, jokes, or anecdotes; C. Unwelcome use of the electronic mail or telephone 6 / 166 communication system to communicate prohibited conduct or activities; or D. Graphic comments about a person's clothing or body. 5. Hate Crimes A hate crime is any conduct against an individual based on their race, color, religion, creed, ethnic or national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, genetic information, disability, age, status as a covered veteran, socio-economic status or any other category protected by federal and state civil rights law and which: A. Adversely affects a term or condition of an individual's employment, education, participation in the College's activities or environment; B. Has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's employment or academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, offensive or abusive environment; C. Is used as a basis for or a factor in decisions that tangibly affect that individual's employment, education, or participation in the College's activities or environment. 6. Other Definitions Other definitions relating to this Policy are contained in Section 13.04 of the Personnel Policy Manual . Confidentiality The procedures followed in any complaint will be kept confidential to the maximum extent allowable by federal and state law, including, but not limited to, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"). The College will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to complaints in a confidential manner. Complainants, however, are advised that the College's ability to investigate and respond to complaints may be limited in circumstances where the Complainant does not wish to disclose his or her identity. The College reserves the right to notify law enforcement authorities about allegations of sexual misconduct based on a reasonable belief that such incidents rise to the level of criminal activity. The use of these procedures does not preclude a Complainant from seeking recourse through the appropriate state or federal criminal law enforcement agencies at any time. College personnel will assist the Complainant in notifying these authorities if the Complainant requests such assistance. Requests not to Investigate or Refusal to ProsecuteA. Victims always have the option to forgo criminal prosecution of the accused after an act of sexual misconduct is reported. Victims may also request that the College not investigate the allegations reported, may refuse to file a complaint, and/or refuse to cooperate in the investigation and/or resolution of allegations. However, the College is committed to balancing the rights of the alleged victim and providing a reasonably safe and non-discriminatory environment for its students and employees. Therefore, the College cannot guarantee that it will not conduct an investigation or pursue resolution of the alleged sexual misconduct. B. The College has the discretion to proceed with an investigation and disciplinary action if there has been a finding by the College that the sexual misconduct occurred even if the victim does not want to move forward with a complaint to the College and/or criminal prosecution. The College will evaluate such reports in the context of its commitment to providing a reasonably safe and non-discriminatory environment. In order to do so, the Title IX Coordinator may conduct a preliminary investigation into the alleged sexual misconduct and may consider the following factors in determining whether to honor the request for confidentiality: 1.The seriousness of the alleged sexual misconduct; 2.The alleged victim's age; 3.Whether there have been other complaints of sexual misconduct against the alleged offender; 4. The alleged offender's right to receive information about the allegation, if the information is maintained by the College as an \"education record\" under FERPA; and, 5.The applicability of any state and/or federal laws mandating disclosure. C. The Title IX Coordinator shall inform the alleged victim if the College intends to conduct further investigation and seek resolution of this matter. Retaliation No individual shall be subject to retaliation at any time for making a claim of sexual misconduct or for participating in the procedures for the resolution of sexual complaints. It is a violation of College policy for any member of the College community to retaliate against the Complainant, any individual who participates in the investigation or proceedings, or against the individual who has been accused of engaging in sexual misconduct. While all sexual misconduct allegations will be reviewed in accordance with these procedures, the College community is advised that the submission of a claim of sexual misconduct is not proof that the accused is guilty of prohibited conduct under this Policy. Anyone who believes that he/she has been subject to retaliation 7 / 166 arising from sexual misconduct complaints is encouraged to report such behavior to College officials. Students or employees who have engaged in retaliatory conduct shall be subject to the College's disciplinary process and to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or termination from the College. Protective Measures At any point during the complaint, investigative or disciplinary processes, the Title IX Coordinator shall have the authority to take any and all reasonable steps necessary to protect all parties involved, as well as any member of the College community who the Title IX Coordinator believes needs protection, from harassment and/or retaliation. The occurrence or non-occurrence of any protective measure is neither an indicia of guilt nor innocence under these procedures. Any protective measures taken to protect members of the College community from harassment and retaliation shall remain in effect pending the resolution of the allegation(s). Examples of such protective measures are: (1) placing a transcript hold on the alleged offender's transcript; (2) summarily suspending the alleged offender; (3) changing the alleged offender's schedule; (4) taking such steps as are reasonable, appropriate and necessary to restrict the alleged offender's movement on campus; and/or (5) reassigning the alleged offender or placing him or her on administrative leave. Protective measures may also include, but are not limited to: (1) issuing no-contact orders to prevent any contact between the alleged victim, the alleged offender, witnesses, and/or third parties; (2) providing the alleged victim an escort to ensure that he or she can move safely between classes, work, and/or other activities; (3) changing work arrangements; (4) arranging for the alleged victim to take an incomplete in a class; (5) moving the alleged victim or the alleged offender from one class section to another; (6) permitting a temporary withdrawal from the College; (7) providing alternative course completion options; and/or (8) providing counseling and/or academic support services. Protection Orders Any order of protection, no contact order, restraining order or other similar orders should be immediately presented to the Campus Public Safety Department. Additional protective measures may be given to the victim if requested and such accommodations are reasonable and available, such as changing academic or working situations. Receipt of a Complaint of Sexual Misconduct or Hate Crime Procedures for resolving complaints of sexualmisconduct and/or a hate crime are contained in Section 13.04 of the Personnel Policy Manual . Role of the Title IX Coordinator The College's Title IX Coordinator is responsible for overseeing all Title IX and sexual misconduct and discrimination reports and complaints made to the College and for implementation of the College's sexual misconduct and anti-discrimination policies. The College's Title IX Coordinator has appointed \"Civil Rights Officers\" to assist in carrying out the responsibilities related to the implementation of its policies. Role of the Advisor The complainant and the accused shall have the opportunity to be accompanied by an advisor, including an attorney, of his or her own choice to any meeting or proceeding related to the complaint, investigation, hearing, and adjudication process. Notwithstanding, no party may use an advisor for the purpose of intimidating, or creating a legitimate fear of retaliation in, the other party, such that the other party foregoes his or her right to move forward in the process. Rights of the Parties The Complainant and the accused shall have the same opportunity to present evidence, to be heard, and to have an advisor present throughout the complaint, investigation, hearing, and adjudication process. Each party shall be informed of the outcome of disciplinary proceedings pertaining to complaints of sexual offenses, defined as the College's final determination with respect to the alleged sexual misconduct and any sanction that is imposed against the accused. Provided, however, no party or their advisors shall have the opportunity or right to conduct direct or cross-examination of the other parties' witnesses or of the parties themselves. A. All College personnel will treat the parties with respect. B. The parties are entitled to privacy during every aspect of the reporting process and any ensuing investigation. C. All information obtained will be confidential to the maximum extent permitted by law. D. Victims of sexual misconduct have the right to receive medical treatment and counseling services. The College will provide victims with information of appropriate medical and counseling services available through community-based counseling services. E. The College will inform victims that they have the option to report their case through the 8 / 166 above-referenced College procedures and/or have the appropriate police agency respond and conduct a full investigation. While victims have the right to refuse to participate in any such proceeding or investigation, the College is required by federal law to investigate all incidents of alleged sexual misconduct on campus. F. The College will notify victims of their options for protective measures, including but not limited the option to adjust their academic schedule whenever reasonably possible. Victims also have the right to decline the use of any protective measures. Bystander Intervention Bystander intervention is when you assume the responsibility, by exercising safe and positive options, to prevent or interrupt acts of sexual misconduct or the potential for such acts. The College is committed to eliminating sexual misconduct within the College community and believes that actively intervening to prevent or interrupt acts of sexual misconduct or any other act of violence in a safe and positive manner so as not to endanger oneself or others is a way of eliminating such misconduct. You can stop or interrupt such acts by: A. Verbally intervening and attempting to de-escalate the situation or instructing the participants to separate; B. Indirectly intervening by alerting the parties' friends, other bystanders, a college officer, campus public safety, or local law enforcement C. Distracting the attention of one party away from the other party D. Remember: 1.Do NOT use violence 2. Do NOT be antagonistic 3.Be honest and direct whenever possible 4.Stay calm and positive 5.Recruit assistance to keep yourself and others safe 6.Contact public safety or local law enforcement if the situation escalates. Victim/Bystander Reporting Options A. Call 911 B. Call the Campus Public Safety Department. C. Call a College official. D. Complete the Incident/Behavior Report form (located on Public Safety web page). E. Use an emergency phone located on campus and inthe parking lots. Reporting does not require a victim or reporting person to take further legal action. (Revised Board of Trustees, 4/12/16, 4/11/17) PROCEDURE FOR THE RESOLUTION OF DISCRIMINATION AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS 1. Oversight. The Civil Rights Coordinator/Title IX Coordinator (\"Title IX Coordinator\") will be responsible for overseeing the prompt, fair and impartial investigation and resolution of reports of discrimination and sexual misconduct to the College. Upon receipt of a complaint, the Title IX Coordinator shall make an initial determination regarding whether or not the complaint states a claim of discrimination or sexual misconduct; provided, however, that no determination that a complaint fails to state a claim for discrimination or sexual misconduct shall be made without first speaking with the Complainant. In cases where a claim of discrimination or sexual misconduct has been stated, the Title IX Coordinator shall immediately communicate, or attempt to communicate, with the Complainant to determine and implement interim/protective measures to the extent necessary. The Title IX Coordinator shall attempt to obtain a written statement from the Complainant within 5 days from the date of receipt of the complaint. However, a delay or refusal by the Complainant to complete a written complaint will not suspend or postpone the Title IX Coordinator's obligation to move forward in the investigation. In addition, when a claim of discrimination or sexual misconduct has been stated, the Title IX Coordinator shall notify the Respondent that a complaint has been filed, the substance of the complaint, any protective measures that may have been instituted, the prohibition against retaliation or harassment involving the Complainant, the name of the Review Officer that will be assigned to investigate the complaint, and, if applicable, whether mediation is available. 2. Mediation. Mediation is an informal and confidential way for the parties to resolve a complaint of discrimination or sexual misconduct prior to an investigation. It is available as an alternative means of resolving a complaint only if the alleged discrimination or sexual misconduct does not involve violence or abuse. Mediation requires the consent of all parties to the complaint and shall be documented by an agreement to mediate. When mediation is appropriate, the Title IX Coordinator shall make the offer to the Complainant first. If the Complainant or Respondent declines mediation, or if the Respondent fails to respond within 5 days from the date he or she receives notice that mediation is available, the Review Officer shall 9 / 166 immediately begin his or her investigation. Mediation may be discontinued at any time: (1) by either party; (2) by the mediator when he or she feels that further efforts to mediate would be non-productive; or (3) when a voluntary agreement has been reached. The mediator shall notify the Title IX Coordinator of the success or failure of the mediation. If the mediation results in a voluntary settlement, a copy of the signed agreement shall also be provided to the Title IX Coordinator.

In addition, the Review Committee/HearingOfficer shall be charged with determining, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether or not a violation of the College's Policy on Discrimination or Policy on Sexual Misconduct has occurred. The Review Committee/Hearing Officer shall accept and consider any and all relevant information or evidence offered by or on behalf of any party, including testimony from the Review Officer regarding the substance of their investigation.

Sanctions. Sanctions for violations of the College's Policy on Discrimination or Policy on Sexual Misconduct include counseling, verbal and/or written reprimand, improvement or corrective action plan, suspension and/or dismissal from the College or termination from employment at the College, exclusion from academic participation or other college sponsored programs, and/or denial of access to College facilities as determined through these procedures. Any recommendation for sanctions made by the Review Committee/Hearing Officer shall be reviewed by the appropriate Campus Director if the Respondent is a student or campus employee. If the Respondent is an Office of the President employee, then the 11 / 166 recommendation for sanctions shall be reviewed by the Vice-President with administrative responsibility for the division in which the Respondent is employed. The Campus Director of Vice-President shall either accept, reject or modify any recommendation. Where a recommendation is rejected, the Campus Director or Vice-President shall then determine what sanctions should be taken and the reasons for taking such sanctions, which may be greater or less than the sanctions recommended. For positions that directly report to the President, the President shall be substituted for the Vice-President in the operation of this policy. 12. Timeframe for Resolving Complaints. Every reasonable effort shall be made to conclude the investigation and resolve the complaint within sixty (60) days following receipt of the complaint. Within this sixty (60) day time frame, absent good cause, it is expected that the Review Officer will conclude the investigation and present a report to the Title IX Coordinator, that the parties will be notified in writing of the Review Officer's determination and that a final disposition will have occurred based on the findings of the Review Officer, or on the decision of the Title IX Coordinator or Review Committee in the event an appeal is taken. 13. Confidentiality and Document Retention. The Review Officer, Title IX Coordinator, or anyone having possession of any work product relating to the complaint shall not disclose, distribute, copy or transfer said work product to the parties or any third party. \"Work product\" is defined as any information gathered by the Review Officer for purposes of conducting an investigation of a complaint of discrimination or sexual misconduct. The complete file, which includes, but is not limited to the complaint, all work product, the investigative report and all dispositions, decisions and/or determinations shall be maintained at the Office of the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator shall maintain confidentiality of the file, which shall only be disclosed by Order of a court of competent jurisdiction or by applicable state or federal law. When a finding of discrimination/sexual misconduct is final, the Review Committee/Hearing Officer's report and a record of the sanctions imposed shall be maintained as part of the student's educational record or employee's personnel file, as applicable. 14. Conflicts of Interest. The Review Officer shall disclose to the Title IX Coordinator of any potential conflicts of interest which would prevent him or her from conducting the investigation of alleged discrimination or sexual misconduct. The Complainant or Respondent may identify to the Title IX Coordinator in writing of any real or perceived conflicts of interest posed by assigning such Review Officer to the matter. If any conflict of interest exists between the Review Officer and any of the parties, the Title IX Coordinator shall reassign the report of alleged discrimination or sexual misconduct to another Review Officer. 15. Prohibition Against Retaliation. It is a violation of College policy for any member of the College community to retaliate against the Complainant, any individual who participates in any discrimination or sexual misconduct investigation or proceeding, or against the Respondent who has been accused of engaging in discrimination or sexual misconduct. While all discrimination and sexual misconduct allegations will be reviewed in accordance with these procedures, the College community is advised that a claim of discrimination or sexual misconduct is not proof of prohibited conduct. Anyone who believes that he/she has been subject to retaliation arising from discrimination or sexual misconduct allegations is encouraged to report such behavior to the Title IX Coordinator. A finding of retaliatory conduct is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

(Revised Board of Trustees, 4/12/16, 4/11/17) GUIDE TO REQUESTING ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS AND/OR AUXILIARY AIDS GETTING STARTED Delaware Technical and Community College is committed to providing reasonable academic adjustments for students with disabilities which may include auxiliary aids and/or accommodations that do not alter a fundamental requirement of our academic programs. Since every disability manifests itself differently in each individual, every attempt will be made to tailor all academic adjustments to meet individual needs. Students with disabilities who wish to request academic adjustments must see the campus ADA contact. The campus ADA contact will evaluate the request and engage in an interactive process to determine what, if any, academic adjustments are warranted. Students seeking academic adjustments must request the same at least 4 weeks prior to the start of each semester for which academic adjustments are sought. Academic adjustments requested by students who fail to follow these procedures may be denied or may not be available prior to the start of classes. CAMPUS ADA CONTACTS The following individuals are the ADA contacts for their respective campuses. They will assist you in fulfilling the requirements to obtain reasonable and necessary academic adjustments. Dover Charles Mundell (302) 857-1349 cmundell@dtcc.edu Georgetown Matthew (302) 454-3927hstatler@dtcc.edu Wilmington Victoria Chang (302) 434-5553 vchang1@dtcc.edu DOCUMENTATION Students should provide the campus ADA contact with documentation of their disability. This information may include diagnosis of disability, functional limitations, psycho-education testing results, most recent IEP (if available), and any other information that may provide insight, clarification or support of the student's condition and how that may impact the student's ability to perform in an academic setting. Since many types of disability remain unchanged over the course of a student's lifetime, information may be accepted in cases where the campus ADA contact determines in his or her sole discretion that a meaningful interactive process can occur and reasonable adjustments can be approved. In some instances, discussion between the student and the campus ADA contact may be sufficient to determine the appropriate assistance. In other situations, a professional evaluation will be necessary to enable the campus ADA contact to understand how the disability impacts the student's ability to function in a college setting. If documentation is necessary, the student must sign a release authorizing the information to be given to the campus ADA contact. PROVIDING THIS DOCUMENTATION IS THE OBLIGATION OF THE STUDENT, AT THE STUDENT'S SOLE EXPENSE . The student and the campus ADA contact (together with such other parties as may be designated by the Campus ADA Contact) will discuss which academic adjustments are appropriate for the student's individual situation and coursework. CONFIDENTIALITY The ADA campus contact will maintain appropriate confidentiality of records or communication, except when disclosure is authorized by the student or by law. EXAMPLES OF ACADEMIC ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDED BY THE COLLEGE In providing academic adjustments, we do not lower or effect substantial modifications to essential technology requirements nor do we make modifications that would fundamentally alter the nature of a program. Examples of the types of academic adjustments which may be provided are as follows: Accessible Furniture: Providing classroom furniture, 16 / 166 which is most appropriate for the student in light of their disability. Assistive Listening Device: An amplification system designed to help the student hear better by minimizing background sounds and amplifying desired sound. Clear View/Lip-Reading: The process of viewing the speaker's lips to facilitate communication (requires unobstructed view of the speaker). Course Reductions which do not fundamentally alter the nature of the program: Students may elect to attend on a part-time basis. Part-time study may impact the length of time to complete program requirements and/or financial aid. Course Substitutions will be considered so long as the modification does not fundamentally alter the nature of a program. Early Access to Course Syllabus: Providing the student with a course syllabus prior to the beginning of the term. A student who needs class material in alternate format or who requires additional time to complete reading or writing assignments will benefit from having early access to course requirements. Early access to the course syllabus allows the accommodation process to begin early and reduces chances of delays in services. Large Print Handouts: Enlarging written material on standard photocopier or word processor to facilitate reading for a student with various processing or sensory impairments. Note taker/Scribe: Individual assigned to assist a student by recording class lecture notes of instructor's spoken words. The scribe may also assist student to record in-class assignments. Priority Seating: Allowing the student to choose the class seating arrangement which is most appropriate in light of the disability. Sign Language Interpreter(s): A person who translates spoken English into American Sign Language (ASL) and vice versa for students with significant hearing loss or deafness. A student using an Interpreter should be allowed to choose classroom seating which is most appropriate for that student's particular need. The college will provide the interpreter; it is not reasonable to expect the College will pay for an interpreter you have used before or currently use on a daily basis. Tape Recording/Transcribing Lectures: Recording spoken material presented in the classroom using a tape recorder. Visual Media: Using graphics or other visual methods, such as PowerPoint slides or handouts, to supplementclass lecture and spoken information. The following is a list of testing adjustments which may be made, depending upon the course and the needs of the student: Alternative Test Design: Changing test format or design to allow the student to demonstrate mastery of course material while minimizing the interference of their disability. For example, one might use a multiple-choice design instead of an essay design. Alternative Test Location: The student is assigned to take an exam in a mutually agreeable location. Arranged and coordinated by the ADA campus contact. Computer Usage: Use of a personal computer during testing allowing the student to use a spellchecker, word processing capabilities, or special assistive software required for their specific disability needs. Distraction - Free Environment: An environment free from noise and other distractions (classroom activities, phones, loud talking, operating machinery) that might interfere with the testing process. Electronic Speller/Dictionary: An electronic speller is a portable device, which assists the student in spelling correctly. Extended Time: Additional time given to complete a test. Length of extension varies according to the student's needs and documented disability. The standard time extension is \"time and a half.\" Individual Test Proctor: Individual assigned to personally administer a test to the student. Large Print Test: Enlarging tests to provide the student with visual access to the test. Oral Test: Administering test orally to the student and allowing the student to provide oral responses. Reader: Individual assigned to read test directions and/or test questions to the student with a disability. Scribe: Individual assigned to record test responses of the student with a disability but who does not offer assistance with content of test responses. Sign Language Interpreter(s): A person who translates directions and/or information given during test administration from English into American Sign Language (ASL). It may also include allowing the student to ask questions for further clarification using his/her ASL interpreter during test questions. Test on Tape: Tape recording test questions so the students can listen to the questions. This might include 17 / 166 allowing the student to tape record the answers. Voice Calculator: A calculator that provides voice output of mathematical data and mathematical processes. EXAMPLES OF REQUESTS WHICH ARE NOT REASONABLE The following is a list of services that the college will not provide. This is not an exhaustive list, but rather provides examples of unreasonable requests. The ADA campus contact may be able to provide community referrals to these services, if appropriate. 1.Providing personal attendants (aides) 2.Feeding students 3.Administering and storing of medications 4.Assisting with personal hygiene (catheter bags, etc.) 5.Writing and proofreading papers 6.Tutoring (will be referred to campus tutorial support) 7.Psychological counseling 8.Storage of medical supplies and equipment (oxygen tanks, wheelchairs, etc.) 9.Diagnosis of disability condition 10.Providing care for service animals COMMUNICATION WITH FACULTY The ADA campus contact will send notification to faculty and campus offices of the academic adjustments that will be provided. Students are encouraged to discuss their academic adjustment (s) with their instructors; however, students are NOT obligated to self-disclose the nature of their disability to the instructors. Students are responsible for communicating the effectiveness of the academic adjustment(s) with the instructors and the campus ADA contacts. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE If a student is not satisfied with the academic adjustment(s) that, after discussion with all parties, has been determined to be appropriate by the campus ADA contact, then s/he may use the following grievance procedure. Students who are unsatisfied with the academic adjustments approved by the campus ADA contact or otherwise feel they have been the subject of discrimination on the basis of disability shall state their concerns in writing to the appropriate Dean of Student Affairs. The inquiry shall be made as soon as reasonably possible after the action occurs but in no case later than 10 working days after such occurrence. The time for filing a grievance can be waived for good cause at the discretion of the Dean of Student Affairs. The Dean of Student Affairs, or designee, shall conduct a thorough investigation of the grievance, affording all interested persons and their representatives an opportunity to submit relevant information. The Dean of Student Affairs shall consult with the College's Civil Rights Coordinator, or designee, and shall issue a written response, with a description of the resolution, if any, to the grievant and other appropriate persons within 15 working days of receipt of the complaint. The decision of the Dean of Student Affairs shall be final. Nothing in this procedure prevents any individual who believes he or she may have been discriminated against from pursuing any and all legal remedies. RETURNING STUDENTS Accommodation(s) plans are NOT carried over from semester to semester. A new request for academic adjustments must be made for each semester that adjustments are desired. Once a request is made, students must allow the campus ADA contact up to four weeks to facilitate appropriate academic adjustments. 18 / 166 A Message From the President Welcome to Delaware Technical Community College!

HISTORY The Delaware General Assembly created Delaware Technical Community College in 1966, when it approved House Bill 529, signed into law by then-Governor Charles L. Terry, Jr. A Board of Trustees was appointed to oversee development of the statewide institution. The Board Chairman was E. Hall Downes; members were William A. Carter, Edward W. Comings, William C. Kay, Clement J. Lemon, John H. Long, and Charles L. Simms. The studies and reports of the original Board were used to create the Southern Campus which opened in September 1967, near Georgetown in Sussex County, with 367 students enrolled. The name was changed to the Jack F. Owens Campus in May 1995. A temporary Northern Campus opened in New Castle County in 1968. The Northern location was replaced by two 21 / 166 campuses-Stanton in the fall of 1973 and Wilmington in the spring of 1974. The Terry Campus opened in 1972 and moved to its current location north of Dover in 1974. The President's Office, located adjacent to the Terry Campus, functions as a central office by providing collegewide leadership and a variety of services in support of the campuses. Students of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life have benefited from the training and education that Delaware Tech has provided. It is estimated that one-fourth of Delaware's population has taken courses at Delaware Technical Community College during its short history.

The College's open-door college admissions policy does not mean that every academic program/curriculum is open-door. Students must meet course pre-requisites before enrollment and program/curriculum specific criteria for program admission. Admission requirements for non-award seeking students (high school students, visiting college students, and adults who want to enroll in credit courses for personal enrichment and lifelong learning) are delineated in separate policies. Operational Information A high school diploma or GED\u00ae credential is one of the eligibility requirements for Federal financial aid. The College's Adult Basic Education program prepares students for GED\u00ae testing and/or to strengthen academic skills in preparation for college course placement. Reasonable academic adjustments for testing are available for students with disabilities, which may 23 / 166 include auxiliary aids and/or accommodations that do not alter a fundamental requirement of demonstrating college readiness. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS PROCEDURE For admission to the College and for full access to services, applicants should plan to complete the admissions process at least 30 days before the first day of class. Applicants should review their selected program as shown in the College Catalog to determine if there are additional admission requirements related to their specific program of study. The following procedures for admission to any campus should be followed. 1.Submit an Application to the College. Applicants can apply on-line or contact any campus for a paper application. 2.Request that your high school and/or college transcript or GED\u00ae certificate be sent immediately to the Admissions Office on the campus to which you are applying.

Academic Program Admission Information Delaware Tech is an open access college, but students must demonstrate academic readiness for college courses, satisfy course pre-requisites, and additionally be selected for admission into some academic programs that have limited seats and specific program admission criteria and requirements. Selection for admission is not guaranteed into these programs, which currently include Nursing, Allied Health, and several others such as Aviation Maintenance. The academic programs with specific admission criteria, requirements and limited seats offer admission to qualified students through either a Competitive Process or a Wait List Process. In the Competitive Process , qualified students are ranked on the basis of their performance in meeting admission criteria and completing admission requirements. Performance measures may include but not be limited to grades, course pass attempts, scores on national and college specific examinations, etc. Ranking is conducted each time program admission is open so a student's chances of admission change in relationship to the performance of other student applicants. In this process, program admission is notguaranteed to any student. In the Wait List Process, qualified students are placed on a wait list for program admission after they meet all admission criteria and requirements at the minimal prescribed level. In this process, all qualified students who meet the admission criteria and requirements are eventually offered a seat in the program. Additional typical requirements for program admission and for employment include the following: satisfactory criminal background check, possession of a valid social security number and legal status to work, satisfactory physical examination, the ability to perform physical tasks, negative drug testing, and no record of abuse. Academic programs with competitive or wait list admission procedures provide this information on their specific web page. Programs with limited seats and specific program admission criteria and requirements may afford preference to residents of the State of Delaware. Delaware residency is determined in accordance with the requirements contained in the College's Residency policy. The President of Delaware Technical Community College is authorized to establish enrollment quotas for qualified candidates by county for these programs which are offered in one or two counties and not offered in the other county or counties. At no time shall the quota for the campus offering the program be less than two-thirds of the entering enrollment. ADVISORY STATEMENT Delaware Technical Community College is an open admissions institution with degree, diploma, and certificate programs that require completion of courses, internships, practicums, clinical, and field work assignments and other experiential learning requirements. Approval of a student's placement in settings, such as health care facilities, schools and human services agencies, which provide these experiences is the prerogative of the organization providing the setting and not the College. Although requirements vary by organization and are constantly evolving, common criteria include: the lack of a criminal history including a review of the adult abuse and child protection registries; a satisfactory health exam including proof of immunizations and drug screenings; a valid Social Security number and proof of legal residency; and other applicable licensing/credentialing requirements. 24 / 166 Legal residency is required to work.

A student may seek the assistance of an Academic Counselor, Program Advisor or academic program Department Chairperson in identifying conditions of acceptance and enrollment in all programs and courses at Delaware Technical Community College. Conditions of employment are established by potential employers and not by Delaware Technical Community College and such conditions of employment may include or exceed any or all of the above requirements.

Non-award seeking students who are enrolling in courses for personal or professional enrichment do not have demonstrate college readiness if they enroll in Listener status. VISITING STUDENTS COLLEGE Students pursuing a degree program at another college or university who want to take Delaware Tech courses to transfer back to their home institution. This includes University of Delaware Associate in Arts students. Students are not required to demonstrate college readiness because their advisement derives from their home institution. It is the visiting student's responsibility to obtain authorization from the home institution regarding the transferability and applicabilityof the Delaware Tech course to their curriculum.

A variety of means are accepted including high school cumulative GPA, standardized tests, previous college-level coursework in English and mathematics, transfer credit, other credit for prior learning for required courses in English and mathematics, or possession of an associate or higher degree. High School Cumulative GPA To use high school cumulative GPA as evidence of readiness for college-level courses, applicants must provide a copy of the official high school transcript showing a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher (83% or higher on a percent grade scale or B or higher on a letter grade scale; see GPA conversion chart). High school cumulative GPA is a measure of effort over time, so only the final cumulative GPA at the end of the junior or senior year may be used for placement purposes. Transcripts with pass/fail grades and/or multiple grades excluded from the cumulative GPA may not be eligible as a measure for placement. All transcripts are subject to review. Students presenting a credential other than regular diploma (as defined by the state in which the high school is located) may not be eligible to use high school cumulative GPA for placement purposes. There are no age limits on high school GPA being used as evidence of college readiness; however, students using high school GPA for placement are also required to provide standardized test scores (see below) for the purposes of advisement. Students who place at college-level based on GPA but do not indicate college readiness on the tests are required to discuss the differences in placement during academic advisement. While students have the right to enroll in college-level courses, planning and advisement is key to finding the course that is most likely to help the student be successful. Standardized Tests Students may submit standardized test scores for placement purposes. The College accepts SAT scores and placement test scores from a combination of ACCUPLACER and locally-developed placement tests. ACCUPLACER Retake Policy Students are eligible to retake each portion/subject of the ACCUPLACER test one time even if they have had developmental education instruction at the College. Readmitted students or students who previously applied as visiting high school or dual enrollment students who have not demonstrated college readiness are allowed to take the ACCUPLACER once they matriculate no matter how many previous attemptsthey have had. They are also permitted one retake after matriculation. The length of time between retakes is the student's prerogative, but students should be strongly encouraged to prepare for the retake attempt. The dean of student affairs may approve additional re-take attempts in exceptional circumstances. There is a per subject charge for each retake. Previous Coursework, Transfer Credit, or other Credit for Prior Learning Previous coursework, transfer credit, and other credit for prior learning may exempt students from testing and qualify them for college-level placement in the respective subject. ACADEMIC ADVISING At Delaware Tech, academic advising is an essential part of the student's learning experience and a critical component of student success. Academic advising teaches the student to navigate the college experience, identify goals, understand program and course options, connect to campus resources and activities, and develop and implement strategies to successfully achieve the student's goals. Faculty and staff throughout the College community collaborate to provide comprehensive academic advising. Initial advising is provided in the advising center. In addition, the student is assigned a program advisor based on the selected program of study. Together, the advisors and student develop a Student Educational Plan focused on achieving the student's educational, professional, and life goals. Advising Center The advising center provides general advisement by appointment and walk-in hours. At the advising center, Academic Counselors work with the student to begin the Student Educational Plan. The Academic Counselors guide the student in navigating the steps to enrollment, exploring career options, selecting a program of study, learning to access MyDTCC, selecting first semester courses, and identifying opportunities for engagement and strategies for success. The student is encouraged to visit an advisement center throughout the educational experience to clarify goals, answer questions, seek referrals, and discuss additional opportunities for success. Program Advisor The program advisor provides ongoing advising specific to the student's area of study and collaborates with the student to continue to develop the Student Educational Plan. The program advisor mentors the student in evaluating career options, understanding program requirements, making effective decisions about course 26 / 166 enrollment, developing professional behaviors, and reviewing progress towards goal achievement. Regular, ongoing meetings with the advisor are essential in helping the student achieve goals in a timely manner. Student Educational Plan The Student Educational Plan (SEP) is an electronic tool that enables consistent communication between the College and the student to identify goals and develop comprehensive strategies to achieve them. The SEP is created at the initial meeting with an advisor. Each student is required to meet with a program advisor to continue developing the SEP before enrolling for a second semester. The student is expected to work with a program advisor on an ongoing basis to update the SEP. The SEP is accessible through the Student Information System. Registering for Courses After selecting courses for the upcoming semester(s), the student must complete the registration process to enroll in the courses. Students may register online through the Student Information System or at the Registrar's Office. Designated registration periods for each semester are posted on the Academic Calendar. Early registration is recommended for greater course availability. REGISTRATION Registration is the period of time set aside each semester during which students select and enroll in courses for the following semester(s). Students are encouraged to meet with their assigned program advisor as early as possible after admission, but must meet with their program advisor to develop their individual Student Educational Plan prior to second semester enrollment. Students may obtain walk-in assistance from campus advisement centers.

Congress passed the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, requiring the certification of federal grantees of a drug-free workplace; and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989, mandating the certification of adoption and implementation of programs to prevent unlawful possession, use or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students and employees. The College supports these Acts. For these reasons, the College has adopted the following regulations: (a) The unauthorized and/or unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of a controlled substance or alcohol is strictly prohibited in all facilities of the College, in all places where its employees/students work/attend, including all State-owned vehicles, and as any part of the College's activities. A controlled substance is one which appears in schedules I through V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812). As a condition of employment/enrollment, all employees/students shall abide by this prohibition and notify the College of any criminal drug or alcohol statute conviction for a violation of this Policy as provided by paragraph (b) below. Violation of such prohibition shall result in action against the employee/student, as set out in section (g) below, which shall include action up to and including termination/expulsion, and/or satisfactory participation in an approved drug or alcohol abuse assistance or rehabilitation program. Participation in such a program shall not be paid for by the College, but may be covered by a(n) employee's/student's health insurance policy. Appendix A contains a description of Federal trafficking (distribution) penalties for substances covered by the Controlled Substances Act.

(h) A description of the health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs is outlined in Appendix C . A description of the health risks associated with the abuse of alcohol is as follows: Alcohol consumption causes a number of marked changes in behavior. Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely, increasing the likelihood that the driver will be involved in an accident. Low to moderate doses of alcohol also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including spouse and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental functions, severely altering a person's ability to learn and remember information. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death. If combined with other depressants of the central nervous system, much lower doses of alcohol will produce the effects just described. Repeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Alcohol withdrawal can be life threatening. Long-term consumption of large quantities of alcohol, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver. Mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These infants have irreversible physical and mental abnormalities. In addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other youngsters of becoming alcoholics. (i) Employees and students are encouraged to review Appendix D for a listing of providers offering drug or alcohol counseling, treatment, or rehabilitation services. In addition, employees enrolled with the State of Delaware's health care provider are eligible to receive drug or alcohol treatment services through the Employee Assistance Program. Employees may contact the Human Resources Division within the Office of the President for more information regarding the Employee Assistance Program. Appendix A Appendix B Appendix C Appendix D 32 / 166 TOBACCO-FREE POLICY In order to ensure a safe, healthy environment, all Delaware Tech facilities are tobacco free for employees, students, and visitors effective January 1, 2011. The use of all tobacco products is prohibited within the boundaries of all College locations including all buildings, facilities, indoor and outdoor spaces and grounds owned, rented, operated, and/or licensed by the College. This policy applies to parking lots, walkways, sidewalks, sports venues, State vehicles and private vehicles parked or operated on College property. For the purposes of this policy, tobacco is defined as any type of tobacco product including, but not limited to: cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, electronic cigarettes, pipes, bidis, hookahs, smokeless or spit tobacco or snuff. The enforcement of this policy is intended to be educational, but repeat violators will be subject to disciplinary action as outlined in the Personnel Policy Manual, Section XII, Conduct and Corrective or Disciplinary Action. (Board of Trustees, 9/14/10) HEALTH SERVICES Health services are limited to basic first aid and early critical care such as CPR and use of an AED. Emergency Medical Services (911) will be called for assistance when the injury or illness is of a serious nature. If the injured/ill student has provided a designated emergency contact, the College will attempt to contact that person upon the request of the student or if the student is unable to make a request. STUDENT ACTIVITIES Delaware Technical Community College provides a balanced student activities program which contributes significantly to the total educational experiences of its students. The Student Activities program is designed to foster the intellectual, social, emotional and physical development of students through participation in educational, cultural, recreational and athletic activities. These activities are planned by the Student Activities Coordinator and/or student organizations with funds provided by the Student Services fees and individual club fundraisers. Student activities provide opportunities for development of leadership skills, social interaction, relaxation, and improved physical fitness. The general administrative responsibility for the Student Activities program rests with the Dean of Student Affairs at each campus. Details regarding specific activities may be found in the campus Student Handbook. The Student Handbook is available online at www.dtcc.edu/handbook/ ATHLETIC PROGRAMDelaware Technical Community College is a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). Eligibility rules, codes of conduct, substance abuse policies as well as gender equity policies are mandated or suggested by the NJCAA. Eligibility is reviewed both on the national and regional level. Problems with eligibility or ethical behavior are brought before the Regional Standards and Ethics Committee. All high school graduates are eligible for intercollegiate competition. Once a student begins taking college courses, his/her eligibility is determined by the number of college credit hours attempted and the grades earned in those courses. Transfer students from other colleges must produce a college transcript to determine eligibility. Any additional information concerning athletic matters (forms, scholarships, eligibility, etc.) should be referred to the Campus Athletic Director. JOB PLACEMENT FOR GRADUATES Delaware Technical Community College measures its success in large part by the success of its graduates' successful entry into career field employment. Graduate job placement is a \"critical effectiveness indicator\" that is annually assessed by the College. Academic programs are developed and maintained in consultation with advisory committees that include employers. Academic counselors and faculty meet with business and industry representatives to stay abreast of job opportunities and refer students to potential employers. They also prepare students for job seeking by assisting with skills such as interview techniques and resume preparation. Annual placement reports document graduates' employment. TRANSCRIPTS A transcript is an official historical academic record of all courses for which a student has registered. A copy of this record may be obtained from the Registrar's Office. Requests for Delaware Technical Community College Official Transcripts should be made on a Transcript Request Form or by personal letter to the Registrar. Telephone requests will not be honored. Normal time for processing transcript requests is two working days or less. Every effort will be made to accommodate verifiable emergency requests that day except during peak registration days, end of term grade processing and graduation. The Registrar's Office cannot issue transcripts from other colleges or high schools. TRANSFER OUT AND ARTICULATED PROGRAMS The College has articulation agreements with 33 / 166 universities and colleges in specific programs. These agreements enable a student to transfer to the senior institution as a junior, provided the required courses have been completed and the appropriate Cumulative Grade Point Average (CUM GPA) has been achieved as required by the receiving institution. The student must apply to the senior institution and complete all required admissions processes. Students need to see their advisor for information on articulation agreements called \"Connected Degree Programs.\" Connected Degree Sheets which summarize these program articulation opportunities are available on campus and on the college website at www.dtcc.edu/connecteddegree/ The Student Affairs Division will assist students in making transfer inquiries, obtaining information, and completing applications to other colleges and universities. A transfer matrix outlining pre-approved specific course by course transfers with Delaware and a variety of out-of-state institutions is available on the College's website. FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include: 1.The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the College receives a request for access. A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The College official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the College official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2.The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA. A student who wishes to ask the College to amend a record should write the College official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed.If the College decides not to amend the record as requested, the College will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3.The right to provide written consent before the College discloses personally identifiable information from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. Some, but not all, of the exceptions are explained in this notice. The College discloses education records without a student's prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including campus public safety personnel and health staff, if any); a person or company with whom the College has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using College employees or officials (such as National Student Clearinghouse, an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. Upon request, the College also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the College. FERPA also allows the College to disclose appropriately designated \"directory information\" without written consent, unless the student has advised the College to the contrary in accordance with the procedures set forth in this notice. The primary purpose of directory information is to allow the College to include this type of information from your education records in certain school publications. Examples include: A playbill, showing a student's role in a drama production; The annual yearbook; Honor roll or other recognition lists; Graduation programs; and Sports activity sheets showing weight and height of team members. 34 / 166 Directory information, which is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released, can also be disclosed to outside organizations without a student's prior written consent. If a student does not want the College to disclose directory information from the student's education records without prior written consent, the student must notify the Registrar of the campus in writing within 30 days of the issuance of this notice. Delaware Technical Community College defines directory information as follows: Name Address College E-mail Address Field of Study Full- or Part-time Enrollment Status Dates of Attendance Degrees and Awards Honors (President's List, Dean's List, Academic Recognition, and Honor Societies) Participation in Officially Recognized Activities and Sports Date of Birth Most Recent Previous High School Attended Weight and Height of Athletes Photograph* *Use of Student Photographs: Photographers employed or contracted by the College regularly take photographs of students to illustrate or describe various aspects of the College and campus life. These photographs will be taken at public venues such as athletic events, concerts and graduation, and/or in other organized campus photo shoots where the subjects will have given verbal consent to be photographed. Individuals who are photographed while attending a public event or who verbally agree to participate in a photo shoot will be understood to have authorized Delaware Technical Community College to use their likeness in print and electronic materials to promote the College. The College will retain the usage rights to the photographs in perpetuity. 4.The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-5901TUTORING Tutoring is a service designed to help students master a subject, prepare for tests, and sharpen their skills in order to become independent learners. Tutoring services are free for all students and are provided to the extent of campus resources. Some departments recommend students to work as Peer Tutors to provide extra help for students in various courses. Advanced students work with individuals or small groups to increase understanding of course material. Comprehensive tutoring services are available during the fall and spring semesters. Students generally receive up to one hour of tutoring per course each week, as necessary. Limited tutorial services may be provided during the summer sessions. PRIORITY OF SERVICE POLICY FOR VETERANS AND ELIGIBLE SPOUSES The U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) provides certain funds to Delaware Technical Community College to provide employment and training services to eligible residents and workers. As a condition to receiving those funds, priority of service (POS) shall be given to veterans and eligible spouses in training and placement services. In accordance with the implementation of the Veterans' Priority Provisions of the \"Jobs for Veterans Act\" (PL107-288), qualified veterans and eligible spouses will receive priority referral to services over non-veterans as determined by each program's mandatory eligibility criteria, if any. Veterans and eligible spouses must meet all eligibility and program requirements for participation in order to receive priority for a program. The veteran or eligible spouse shall be identified at the point of entry, whether in person or virtual, so that the priority of service may be implemented over the full range of services available including,but not limited to registration, training and placement. Veterans shall be asked to self-identify upon application. Priority of service means that a covered person receives access to the service or resource earlier in time than a non-covered person or if the service or resource is limited, the covered person receives access instead of or before a non-veteran. Eligibility For purposes of this policy only, the following definitions will apply. Veteran : a person who served in the active military, 35 / 166 naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable, as specified in 38 U.S.C. 101(2). Active service includes full-time duty in the National Guard or a Reserve component, other than full-time duty for training purposes. Eligible Spouse: The spouse of any of the following: (1) Any veteran who died of a service-connected disability; (2) Any member of the Armed Forces serving on active duty who, at the time of application for the priority, is listed in one or more of the following categories and has been so listed for a total of more than 90 days: (i) Missing in action; (ii) Captured in line of duty by a hostile force; or (iii) Forcibly detained or interned in line of duty by a foreign government or power; (3) Any veteran who has a total disability resulting from a service-connected disability, as evaluated by the Department of Veterans Affairs; (4) Any veteran who died while a disability, as indicated in (3) above, was in existence. The status of a veteran or an eligible spouse can be verified by referring a variety of official documents, including, but not limited to: A DD 214 (issued following separation from active duty); An official notice issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs that establishes entitlement to a disability rating or award of compensation to a qualified dependent; An official notice issued by the Department of Defense that documents the eligibility of an individual, based on the missing or detained status of that individual's active duty spouse; or An official notice issued by a State veterans' service agency that documents veteran status or spousal rights,provided that the State veterans' service agency requires Federal documentation of that information. Implementation Priority of service shall be provided in course registration and in acceptance into selective admission programs with waiting list and competitive ranking admission procedures.Admission -Veterans and eligible spouses will be asked to self-identify on the application to the College. The academic counselor who provides ancillary services to veterans will contact the veteran/spouse to discuss priority of service and request documents to verify eligibility, if applicable. Course Registration -Online and in-person registration shall open one day earlier for eligible veterans and spouses than for other students. Admission into Programs with Waiting Lists - Eligible veterans and spouses who have met all the program admission requirements shall be placed at the top of the waiting list and admitted in the next program cohort offered seats. Admission into Programs with Competitive Ranking - Each program shall establish and publish the program admission minimum score/requirements for eligible veterans and spouses to be admitted to the program, independent of the regular competitive ranking admission process. The minimum score/requirements shall be determined based on the program's student success data. As expectations for the workforce and curriculum requirements change, changes may be made to the minimum score/requirements established for priority of service. Eligible veterans and spouses who meet that minimum shall be admitted. 36 / 166 Financial Information TUITION & FEES (for the 2018-2019 academic year) In-State Students Out-of-State Students 1-15 credit hours $149.50 per credit $373.75 per credit 15+ credit hours $2,242.50 per semester $5,606.25 per semester Registration Fee* $15.00 per semester Student Service Fee* $20.00 per semester (full-time and part-time students) Technology Support Fee* $10.00 per credit for all credit hours taken.

INSTALLMENT PAYMENT PLAN Delaware Tech has partnered with Nelnet Business Solutions (NBS) as a way to increase affordability and access to education. The Installment Payment Plan (the Plan) allows students to defer the cost of tuition and fees through a payment option that offers installment payments rather than in one-lump sum payment. The Plan is available each semester on the opening day of registration. Enrollment into the Plan is only available for a limited time each semester (through the drop/add period); however, early enrollment is encouraged because the down payment amount is determined by the date on which the student signs up. Earlier signup results in a lower required down payment and a greater number of installments, resulting in much more affordable monthly payments. After you register for classes, you can enroll into the NBS Installment Payment Plan to pay your tuition and fees in smaller monthly installments. The specific timeline for these installment payment options are available by logging into the Plan. If you do not wish to enroll in the Plan, you can pay your tuition and fees in full in person at the Business Office or pay online . Students and parents should review all of the information about the Plan carefully before signing up. Nelnet Business Solutions is a third party, and payment plan agreements are executed between the student and NBS - not Delaware Tech. View additional installment payment plan FAQs . PAYMENT DEADLINES The College publishes payment deadlines in the Academic Calendar to encourage students to pay early so that they can increase affordability through the Installment Payment Plan. Enrollment into the Plan by the payment deadline date provides access to the least expensive monthly payment option. If a student does not make a payment by the payment deadline, Delaware Tech will not delete the registration, and the student will still be responsible to pay. A student account becomes delinquent when the student has not made payment in full to the College or has not enrolled in the Installment Payment Plan by the second week of the semester. When accounts are delinquent, the College will place a financial hold on the account, preventing future registration, and related services. Accounts that remain delinquent at the end of the semester are referred to a collections agency.FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT Students are responsible for paying tuition and fees when they enroll. The College will not delete any registration or drop any course for a student's failure to make payment to the College. Additionally, failure to attend any class or failure to receive a bill does not remove the student's financial responsibility. Students who do not plan to attend class(es) are responsible for officially dropping the course(s) to minimize their financial responsibility. TUITION/FEE ADJUSTMENT POLICY COURSE OR SEMESTER WITHDRAWAL To receive a tuition/fee adjustment for a course drop, the student must first officially drop the course (see Course Drop/Add/Withdrawal Procedure). Students will not be charged any tuition or refundable fees (lab or technology support) for courses dropped before or during the first week of the session. Students will be responsible for 50% of the tuition and refundable fees for courses dropped during the second week of the session. After the second week, students may officially withdraw from a class, but there is no tuition/fee adjustment. Students are responsible for 100% of tuition and fees for officially withdrawn courses. For courses less than four weeks in length, there is no tuition/fee adjustment period. Students enrolled in these courses on the first day of the session are responsible for 100% of the assessed tuition and fees. The following fees are non-refundable: registration, late registration, student services, healthcare program, credit by examination, evaluation of work experience, and pass-through fees. EARNED TITLE IV FINANCIAL AID Students who receive federal financial aid are eligible for payment according to their enrollment status and attendance. Students who attend more than 60 percent of a semester (approximately 9 weeks of a 15 week semester) are eligible to receive 100 percent of their payment. Students who attend 60 percent or less of a semester are eligible to receive a percentage of their payment, depending on the date of withdrawal from all classes. This percentage payment is done according to the Return of Title IV Funds Regulations. (34 CFR 668.22) 1.If the amount of earned federal financial aid is not adequate to pay institutional charges, the student is liable for any outstanding debt the student may owe the college. In addition, the student may be responsible for repaying a portion of his/her federal financial aid to the federal government. 2.Earnings from the Federal Work Study Program are not used in this calculation. The student is paid what he/she earns. 3.Students receiving loans must maintain 40 / 166 half-time enrollment (at least 6 credits) in order to receive payment of the loan. 4.Basic-level courses (courses beginning with 00) do not count toward enrollment status for Title IV Funds. This policy applies to federal financial aid money only and will be the policy applied to students who withdraw from all classes. The date of withdrawal from all classes that will be used in the calculation is the date that the Registrar's Office processes the official College Withdrawal Form used by students who wish to withdraw from all their classes during the semester. Students must contact the Registrar's Office to obtain this form. The withdrawal date for students who drop all their classes without using the official College Withdrawal Form will be the last documented dates of attendance or the mid-point (50% point) of the semester without documentation. Withdrawing from the College may affect a student's eligibility for future financial aid funding. Federal law requires that students who receive federal financial aid must attend the classes for which they register in order to receive financial aid payment. Students who never attend a class will not receive any federal financial aid relating to that class, even if an official drop/withdrawal procedure is completed. The complete policy and additional information about financial aid are available on the Delaware Tech Web page, www.dtcc.edu/financialaid , that provides ongoing updates to all financial aid opportunities and the College's refund policies. BOOKS & SUPPLIES Books and supplies vary in cost according to course requirements. Instructors will inform students about texts, supplies and materials required in each course. This information is also available on the College's website. MALPRACTICE INSURANCE Students enrolled in allied health and nursing programs are required to purchase malpractice insurance through Delaware Technical Community College. STUDENT SERVICE FEE For students taking credit courses, a nonrefundable fee of $20 per semester for full-time and part-time students will be charged by each campus. Senior citizens are exempt from paying this fee. The Delaware Tech/University of Delaware Associates in Arts Degree Program student service fee is the same. LAB FEESFees vary -- $12 per lab hour up to a maximum of 6 hours or $72 per course. There are program specified exceptions wherein the lab fees may be less or more, depending on program needs. Industrial education course lab fees are determined by the specialized equipment utilized in the course. REGISTRATION FEE All students who register for fall, spring, and summer sessions will be assessed a $15.00 Registration Fee per session for credit courses only. Students can make registration changes without an additional fee being charged. The Registration Fee is non-refundable. TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT FEE $10.00 per credit for all credit hours taken per semester to support cost of technology, instructional/course materials, and Internet e-mail/access for all credits taken. HEALTHCARE PROGRAM FEE Students enrolled in the College's healthcare credit programs on a full-time or part-time basis will pay a non-refundable Healthcare Program Fee of $25 per semester to support operational costs to include healthcare programs' clinical rotation fees and instructional equipment. LATE REGISTRATION FEE The starting date for Late Registration is published each semester in the Academic Calendar. Students who initiate their registrations on or after this published date will be charged a Late Registration Fee of $25. Students who have an active registration at the time that Late Registration begins will not be assessed the Late Registration Fee if they add or modify their courses at a later time. The Late Registration Fee is non-refundable. The fee may be waived by the campus dean of student affairs for the following reasons: (1) a disabling accident, certified by a physician; (2) a serious illness, certified by a physician; or, (3) campus or College functions that are beyond the control of the student, such as campus closings or problems with administrative systems. EVALUATION OF PRIOR LEARNING/WORK EXPERIENCE FEE For students seeking College credit through the evaluation of prior learning or work experience, a fee equivalent to tuition for a one-credit course will be charged for each course in which a student requests credit, effective with the fall semester 1993. OTHER FEES AND CHARGES 41 / 166 Credit by Examination Fee Additional fees or changes to existing fees are subject to action by the Board of Trustees. All fees listed above are non-refundable. All tuition and fees are accepted for payment of student accounts, pending final audit of those accounts by the Business Office. Students will be responsible for reimbursing the College for payments made to third parties on their behalf for charges such as online access for distance education courses, telecourse rental fees, student malpractice insurance, etc. These \"pass through\" charges are non-refundable.

Academic Policies and Procedures ADVANCED STANDING Students are encouraged to pursue advanced standing during the admissions process. Credits earned through advanced standing will be entered on the student transcript by the Registrar as they are received from the Dean of Instruction. Types of advanced standing are explained below. CLEP and DANTES Students who have taken CLEP (College-Level Examination Program) or DANTES (Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support) tests may request CLEP or DANTES to forward the results to Delaware Tech for evaluation for Advanced Credit.. Specific CLEP or DANTES tests which apply to the student's academic program may be granted corresponding Delaware Tech credit. International Baccalaureate International Baccalaureate (IB) is a non-profit educational foundation offering programs of international education. Students who are high school graduates with acceptable scores may submit official copies of the IB test results for evaluation for credit for courses. Credit by Examination A student may receive credit for courses offered at Delaware Technical Community College by taking a competency evaluation administered by the department chairperson or his/her designee. The exact nature of the evaluation will be determined by the evaluator. In order to qualify for credit by examination, the student must have completed the admissions process and request approval in writing for the course in which he/she wishes to receive credit by examination. In addition, the student must not have received prior instruction at Delaware Tech in the course in which he/she is seeking credit by examination. Since no instruction has taken place, a grade will not be assigned to credits awarded by examination. Successful completion of a course by examination will appear on the student's transcript as \"Advanced Credits.\" Credits earned by way of examination may not be applied 43 / 166 toward the residency requirement of the College. A fee equivalent to tuition for one credit hour will be assessed for each course which a student attempts to complete by examination. Advanced standing credits will appear on the transcript of a declared student only upon completion of at least one term of instruction and provided the student is in satisfactory academic standing. Credit for Advanced Placement Tests The College recognizes the Advanced Placement Program offered through the College Board of the Educational Testing Service and grants credit, upon documentation, for Advanced Placement Test scores of three or higher. In order to obtain Advanced Placement credit, the student must submit official test scores to the Admissions Office for review by the appropriate chairperson. Credits from Foreign Institutions College-level credits earned at institutions outside the United States may be evaluated for transfer. Students will be required to submit transcripts with an official English translation by a professional foreign educational credentials evaluation service such as Worldwide Educational Service, North American Educational Group, AACRAO International Education Services, or International Education Research Foundation, if the original language for the institution is not English. Age Limits on Courses Delaware Tech does not apply blanket age limits to courses for the purpose of transfer in, meeting selective admissions programs' ranking/entrance procedures, or meeting program requirements in award completion. Age limits on courses for any of these purposes must be recommended by the relevant department chairpersons and approved by Academic Affairs administrators. Approved age limits on courses will be related to the competency(ies) students/graduates must demonstrate in the field, employment and other measures such as certification exams. Approved time limits on applicability of courses to program admission and completion is available in program admission documents and on program web pages. Evaluation of Transfer Credits Credits from postsecondary institutions that are accredited by a U.S. Department of Education approved regional accrediting association will be accepted, if they apply to the established curricula of Delaware Technical Community College (Delaware Tech) and meet otherrequirements listed below. Transfer Credit Evaluation Process: The student must request and arrange for an official transcript from transferring institution to be sent to Delaware Tech. The student must be admitted to Delaware Tech before transfer credits will be evaluated or posted to the student's academic history/transcript. The Delaware Tech department chairperson who has oversight for the subject will evaluate course(s) for equivalent learning outcomes to a Delaware Tech course(s) when the following criteria is met: The student earned a grade of \"C\" or better in the course being evaluated for transfer; The course is applicable to a Delaware Tech major; The course is eligible for transfer consideration based on the Age Limits on Courses Policy. Approval of transfer credit for a course does not mean the transfer credit will satisfy selective programs' admission requirements or will apply to academic program requirements. APPROVED AGE LIMITS FOR TRANSFER IN OF COURSES DELAWARE TECH PROGRAM AND COURSES YR. LIMIT (date approved by Deans) CIS - Computer Information Systems5 years (9/14) CNE - Computer Network Engineering Technology5 years (9/14) CSC - Computing & Information Systems5 years (9/14) ISY - Information Security 5 years (9/14) ITN - Information Technology and Networking5 years (5/18) MLT-Medical Laboratory Technician5 years (10/14) WIS - Web Information Systems5 years (9/14) Students requesting transfer credit may be required to provide supporting materials such as the course description(s) from the institution's catalog and/or course syllabus (syllabi) to complete the transcript evaluation. Once evaluation of the course(s) is complete, Delaware Tech will post all transferred courses to the student's Delaware Tech academic 44 / 166 history/transcript. Notification of accepted and/or declined courses will be sent to students via the Delaware Tech email system. Students may inquire with the appropriate department chairperson about declined transfer courses. Transfer credits may not be applied toward the residency requirements of the College. Students may check with their department chairperson regarding time limits and applicability of transfer courses to program admission and completion. Information is also available in program admission documents and in program web pages. Transfer credits for developmental courses will be accepted if the Delaware Tech department chairperson responsible for the developmental courses(s) approves the transfer course as equivalent to the Delaware Tech course(s). Transfer credit for a developmental course exempts relevant portions of the Accuplacer test. Students transferring to Delaware Tech with a previously awarded associate, baccalaureate, master, or doctoral degree from a postsecondary institution accredited by a U.S. Department of Education approved regional accrediting association will receive advanced standing (transfer) credit for Critical Thinking and Academic Writing (ENG101) and Composition and Research (ENG102). Inter-Campus Transfer of Advanced Standing Credits Advanced standing credits approved by a Delaware Tech campus department chairperson and dean of instruction become a part of the student's permanent record and will not be suppressed or negated by any other campus of Delaware Technical Community College. Internal Career Education Pathways Guidelines Internal Career Education Pathways Guidelines provide a bridge for completion of Workforce Development and Community Education (WDCE) non-credit programs/courses to advanced standing in designated Instructional Division credit programs/courses. A list of these approved opportunities is available from the campus WDCE office, the campus Registrar and academic counselors. To receive advanced standing, the student must: Successfully complete the approved WDCE course(s) and demonstrate mastery of course objectives as required for advanced standing.Request to receive advanced standing within the credit program's time frame for credit course transfer. Be admitted into the credit program. Advanced standing for a non-credit course(s) does not exempt students from demonstrating college readiness. If the student's Accuplacer scores indicate they need developmental course work the completed non- credit course(s) does not exempt them from the required developmental courses. Military Credits Credits earned through military training and service with a grade of \"C\" or better may be evaluated for transfer if the courses were taken at a regionally accredited college or university. Courses must meet time limit guidelines, be applicable to a Delaware Tech major, and have equivalent learning outcomes to a Delaware Tech course. The American Council on Education's Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services is used in the evaluation of military training and experience for academic credit. Prior Learning/Work Experience Assessment Students seeking college credit through evaluation of non-credit prior learning or work experience must complete a competency based evaluation form to initiate an application for Prior Learning/Work Experience evaluation by the Department Chairperson. Students must be accepted in a program to apply for the evaluation process. Upon acceptance for the process, the student will pay a fee equivalent to tuition for a one-credit course. Once the department chairperson accepts the student for the evaluation process, the chairperson or his/her faculty designee will guide the student to submit documentation to complete the evaluation process. Transfer-Back Policy Students who have transferred from Delaware Tech without earning a bachelor's degree, associate degree, diploma, or credit certificate may complete program requirements by transferring back courses that have been earned at other institutions and are approved as relevant to the award requirements of the major at Delaware Tech. If the student attended Delaware Tech within two calendar years, the transfer-back course(s) would be entered upon the student's record when the courses are accepted by Delaware Tech. If the student has not been enrolled in Delaware Tech for any of six consecutive terms, including summer sessions (two calendar years), the student must follow the readmission process and current curricular requirements for graduation. Time limits on completed Delaware Tech courses, as well as courses being 45 / 166 transferred back, must meet departmental guidelines. The student must satisfy all requirements for graduation, including credits in residence. Appeals Process To appeal the evaluation or transferability of a course or prior learning/work experience evaluation, the student must submit a written request to the department chairperson responsible for the course for re-evaluation of advanced standing credit. The appeal must be made within 60 days of the notification of the declined course(s) and must include documentation for re-evaluation. Upon receipt of the appeal, the department chairperson will submit a copy of the appeal to the dean of instruction. The department chairperson will inform the student in writing within 14 working days if additional documentation for further evaluation is needed. The department chairperson will inform the student in writing of the final transfer credit decision. ATTENDANCE Each student is expected to attend class regularly in order to achieve maximum benefit from instruction. Course requirements and evaluation measures are specified in writing and distributed at the beginning of the course. Attendance per se is not an approved evaluation measure. However, evaluation measures may necessitate attendance in order to demonstrate mastery of course objectives. Faculty must maintain attendance records to comply with requirements related to veterans' and service members' benefits, social security benefits, and financial aid and scholarship programs, etc.(Rev. 6/29/12) CONTRACT FOR ACADEMIC PROGRAM COMPLETION The courses required for completion of each academic program are listed in the College Catalog and on the program sequence sheet. When a student is admitted and enrolled at the College, the course requirements in effect at that time are considered the academic program contract for the student. When a student changes his/her major or requires College readmission, the student's academic program contract is updated to the one currently in effect. Program requirements for completion are periodically updated. To take advantage of curriculum updates, a student may request approval from his/her department chairperson to change his/her academic program contract to reflect current requirements. A student may not change to a contract that was in effect prior to his or her initial enrollment in the academic program. CURRICULUM CHANGESA student may change his/her curriculum by consulting with a faculty advisor or counselor. Signatures are required from the advisor and counselor of the department from which the student is withdrawing, as well as from the advisor and counselor of the department to which the student seeks to be admitted. A completed Change of Program/Status Form must be returned to the Registrar's Office for the change of curriculum to become official. COURSE DROP AND WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURE Dropping a Course A course that is dropped will not show on the student's transcript, and the student is eligible for a tuition adjustment as dictated by the Tuition/Fee Adjustment Policy. Students may drop a course online or by completing and submitting a Drop/Add/Official Withdrawal form at the Registrar's Office. Classes can only be dropped through the end of the second week of the session. Students will not be charged any tuition or refundable fees (lab or technology support) for courses dropped prior to the end of the first week of the session. Students will be responsible for 50% of the tuition and refundable fees for courses dropped during the second week of the session. For classes less than two weeks in length, there is no tuition refund period. Students enrolled on the first day of the session are responsible for 100% of the assessed tuition and refundable fees. No approvals are required for students to drop a course(s). The day the completed form is received by the Registrar's Office determines the official date of the course drop. See the Academic Calendar for specific drop dates. See the Tuition/Fee Adjustment Policy for details on tuition and fee refunds. Officially Withdrawing From a Course An official withdrawal means the student provided notice that the student would no longer attend the course. A course that is officially withdrawn from shows on the student's transcript as a W, which does not calculate into the GPA. An official withdrawal is not eligible for a tuition adjustment. Students may officially withdraw from a course online or by completing and submitting a Drop/Add/Official 46 / 166 Withdrawal Form at the Registrar's Office. Students may officially withdraw from a course from the date the drop period ends through approximately the eighty percent point of the semester. Students are responsible for 100% of tuition and fees for officially withdrawn courses. Withdrawing from a course may affect the financial aid award for the current semester and eligibility for future financial aid. Students are responsible for understanding how an official withdrawal affects their schedule bill and financial aid. After the eighty percent point of the course, students may not officially withdraw from the course. See the Academic Calendar for official withdrawal periods. No approvals are required for students to withdraw from a course(s). However, students are responsible for discussing the withdraw with their advisor and the Financial Aid Office. The day the completed form is received by the Registrar's Office determines the official date of the course withdraw. Unofficially Withdrawing From a Course An unofficial withdrawal means the student stopped attending class, without providing official notice. A course that is unofficially withdrawn from shows on the student's transcript as a U, which is calculated into the GPA as a failing grade. An unofficial withdrawal is not eligible for a tuition adjustment. Students are expected to attend all class sessions. Students who are not regularly attending class and who do not follow the procedures to drop or officially withdraw from class will be reported as an unofficial withdrawal. Students are responsible for 100% of tuition and fees for unofficially withdrawn courses. Unofficially withdrawing from a course may affect the financial aid award for the current semester and eligibility for future financial aid. Students are responsible for understanding how an unofficial withdrawal affects their bill and financial aid. See Attendance Policy COURSE ADD PROCEDURE Students may add a course online or by completing and submitting a Drop/Add/Official Withdrawal Form at the Registrar's Office. During the first week of the session, students may add a course(s) or change sections if a seat is available. During the second week of the session, students may only add a class or change sections with instructor permission. After the second week of the session, students may only add a class or change sections in extenuating circumstances. Instructor and dean of instructionapproval is required. Classes added after the fifteenth day of the semester may not be eligible for financial aid. Students should talk with the Financial Aid Office to see how adding a class will affect their financial aid. For sessions less than ten weeks in length, students cannot be added after the first class session. After the class has begun meeting, students may only add a class or change sections in extenuating circumstances. Instructor and dean of instruction approval is required. READMISSION TO THE COLLEGE Students who have previously attended Delaware Technical Community College must follow the readmission process when they have not been enrolled at Delaware Tech for six consecutive terms including summer sessions (two calendar years). Readmitted students will be responsible for the current requirements of the program they are entering. Readmitted students will have a new contract year to reflect the current graduation requirements of the program. (Rev. 4/30/14) VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS READMISSIONS POLICY I. Readmission Eligibility Requirements Delaware Technical Community College students who interrupt their studies to perform service in the United States military are subject to separate readmissions procedures. Students who withdraw, take a leave of absence, or otherwise leave their studies at Delaware Tech on or after August 14, 2008, in order to serve in the U.S. Military, are subject to these readmission procedures if they meet the following conditions: 1.The student served in the U.S. military for a period of more than thirty (30) consecutive days and provides appropriate documentation to prove such service to the Veterans and Service Members Counselor at his or her campus of enrollment. 2.The student gave advance written or oral notice to the Veterans and Service Members Counselor at his or her campus of enrollment. A student is not required to indicate whether he or she intends to return to Delaware Tech upon completion of military service in the advance notice. Furthermore, the advance notice need not come directly from the student, but rather, can be provided by an appropriate officer of the United States Armed Forces or official of the United States Department of Defense. Advance notice is not required if it is precluded by military necessity. In such cases, the requirement for advance notice can be fulfilled 47 / 166 by the student's filing of an attestation that the student performed military service at the time the student seeks readmission. 3.The student's cumulative length of absence from Delaware Tech to perform U.S. military service, including all previous absences to perform U.S. military service and only the time the student spent actually performing military service did not exceed five (5) years. The five-year length of absence period does not include any service: i) That was required, beyond five (5) years to complete an initial period of obligated service; or ii) During which the student was unable to obtain orders releasing the student from a period of service in the U.S. military before the expiration of the five-year period through no fault of the student; or iii) That the student was ordered to or retained on active duty. 4. The student must have notified the Veterans and Service Members Counselor at the campus within three (3) years of the end of the U.S. military service of his or her intention to return to Delaware Tech. However, a student who is hospitalized or recovering from an illness or injury incurred in or aggravated during the U.S. military service must have notified the Veterans and Service Members Counselor within two (2) years after recovering from the illness or injury of his or her intent to return to Delaware Tech. 5.The student did not receive a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or have been sentenced in U.S. court-martial proceedings. Students should contact the Veterans and Service Members Counselor at the campus of their enrollment to determine their eligibility for readmission under this Policy. II. Readmission Procedures Students who meet all of the above conditions (\"eligible students\") shall be promptly readmitted to Delaware Tech at the same academic status as the student had prior to leaving for military service. A. Promptly Readmitted Promptly readmitted means that the College will readmit the eligible students into the next class or classes in the service member's program beginning after the service member provides notice of his or her intent to reenroll, unless the service member requests a later date of readmission in writing to the Coordinator of Veterans and Service Members (not to exceed the time frame outlined in section I.3). A later date ofadmission may also be imposed on the service member for unusual circumstances, such as the time period required to prepare the service member to resume his or her course of study at the College. B. Same Academic Status Same academic status means that the College readmits the service member: 1.To the same program to which he or she was last admitted by the College unless the student requests or agrees to a different program. In the event that the program to which the student was last admitted is no longer offered, the College will readmit the veteran to a course of study that is most similar to the program that was discontinued. 2.At the same enrollment status that the student last held at the College, unless the student requests admission at a previous enrollment status. 3.With the same number of credit or clock hours completed by the student, unless the student is readmitted to a different program to which the credit or clock hours are not transferable. 4.With the same academic standing (e.g. with the same satisfactory academic progress status) the student had at the College immediately prior to leaving for military duty. College placement test fees and placement test policies may be waived upon a review of the veteran's previous test(s) and submittal of military service documentation submittal to the campus Veterans and Service Members Counselor. C. Tuition and Fee Responsibilities For the first academic year in which the eligible student veteran returns to Delaware Tech, that student who is readmitted to the same academic program must also be readmitted with the same tuition and fee charges the student was or would have been assessed for the academic year in which the student left for military duty unless any increase of the prior amount is covered by the student's service member educational benefits. Should that veteran be readmitted to a different academic program in his/her first academic year upon return , the student may be charged the same tuition and fees as others in that academic program. Likewise, in all subsequent academic years and for any program in which the student was readmitted, the member of the armed forces may be charged the same tuition and fees as the others in the student's program. If the veteran has an outstanding balance from previous year(s), the veteran must pay the balance by the end of the first semester s/he returns. If the balance is not paid by the end of the returning semester, then the College's 48 / 166 business office will place a hold on his/her account (and s/he will therefore be blocked from class registration) until the debt is paid. D. Program Preparation Should the eligible student's academic department determine that the member of the armed forces is not prepared to resume the program with the \" same academic status \" at the point where the student left off, or will not be able to complete the program, the College will make reasonable efforts at no extra cost to the student to help the student become prepared or to enable the student to complete the program including, but not limited to, providing refresher courses or placement testing at no charge to the veteran. If a veteran requests reinstatement preparation, then student will be referred to his/her program advisor who will discuss available options and route the student to the appropriate academic department for possible program preparation actions. The determination of possible program preparation actions is decided by the academic department which offers the course. If program preparation is not deemed necessary by the academic department, but the veteran feels preparations are necessary, then the veteran bears any financial burden preparation necessitates. The veteran will be awarded any program preparation at no extra cost for those eligible students who require such preparation as determined by the relevant academic department. This includes any additional fees (supplies and or books) that may be required for program. In the event that program preparation is completed through a course, the veteran should return to the Veterans and Service Members Counselor to coordinate costless course registration and book/supply purchasing with the business office and with the Delaware Tech bookstore. The veteran will not be charged a registration fee if the program preparation course is the only course the veteran registers for during that semester. If the program preparation is completed through a course and the veteran is receiving VA benefits, the course will be certified through the VA for reimbursement. If the veteran is receiving VA benefits but is not awarded VA benefits which cover 100% of the tuition and fees, the veteran will not be responsible for the remainder of the bill. The veteran may request that the course not be certified through the VA for reimbursement. In such cases, the student will not be charged for the course. Once the veteran has met with his/her program advisor, the advisor will update the veteran's Student Educational Plan (SEP). If program preparation is deemed necessary by an academic department, the academic department will note this in the veteran's SEP. The notation should include how the preparation will take form, evaluation of preparation results, and any dates by which preparation must be complete. If the student does not complete the program preparation adequately within the amount of time designated by the academic department, then the veteran is then responsible for completing such program preparation without financial assistance from the College. This may delay timely reentry into the student's program. E. Denial of Readmission Veterans who do not meet the eligibility requirements set forth in the above are not entitled to be readmitted pursuant to this Policy. In addition, the College is not required to ultimately readmit the eligible student veteran on his or her return if: 1.After reasonable efforts by Delaware Tech, the College determines that the student is not prepared to resume the program at the point where he or she left off. 2.After reasonable efforts by Delaware Tech, the College determines that the student is unable to complete the program; or 3. The College determines that there are no reasonable efforts the College can take to prepare the student to resume the program at the point where he or she left off or to enable the student to complete the program. AGE LIMITS FOR COURSES APPLIED TO GRADUATION (Approved 4/30/14) Students may apply all approved transfer in and Delaware Tech completed courses toward certificate, diploma and degree requirements as long as they meet program specific requirements for technical relevance to the career field as measured by external outcomes such as licensure or certification exams. Program specific age limits on major or major support courses that may be applied to completion requirements are collegewide decisions approved by the academic program Chairperson(s), Deans of Instruction, and Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs/Vice President for Academic Affairs. These decisions are not subject to appeal. The list of approved age limits on major or major support courses which can be applied to program completion are below and can be found on the Delaware Tech Academic Programs web pages.

Courses completed at Delaware Tech or transferred in more than five years ago may only be applied to graduation requirements for students who have remained in active status (taking courses at least once every 6 semesters and not requiring readmission). GRADE POINT SYSTEM (4.00) The grade point average (GPA) for each student is based upon the scale of grade point values, and it is weighted for each course by its credit value. Cumulative grade point averages (CUM) are also based on the grade point values, and these have been maintained for all students enrolled since the fall of 1977. Effective fall 2012, the following grading policy is in effect: Grading Policy A 92-100 B 83-91 C 75-82 F 0-74 Note: From fall 1991 until fall 2012 a \"R\" grade was used instead of an \"F.\" The following is the College's grading interpretation: Grading Interpretation A Student meets the measurable objectives in an outstanding manner B Student meets the measurable objectives in an above-average manner C Student meets the measurable objectives F Student has not met the measurable objectives and must repeat the course 50 / 166 L Listener/Auditor (with approval only) I Incomplete S Continuing Satisfactory (used only in courses with numbers under 100) W Withdrawal with approval from College U Withdrawal without approval from College The following grades are included in the GPA calculation: A 4.0 grade point value B 3.0 grade point value C 2.0 grade point value F 0.0 grade point value U 0.0 grade point value The CUM includes the inactive grades \"D\" (Distinctive) and \"P\" (Proficient), which became inactive in the Fall Quarter of 1978. D 4.0 grade point value P 2.5 grade point value Note: Students who receive an \"S\" grade and are receiving veterans Administration educational benefits will be paid for the course during the first term of enrollment only. If the student reregisters for the course, the course cannot be included in the total Veterans Administrations credit hours reported for benefits. All students who receive an \"S\" grade must re-enroll in the course within the succeeding term in order to improve his/her grade unless exception is made by the Dean of Instruction or his/her designee. The following grades are excluded from the GPA calculation: I Incomplete L Listener/Auditor W Withdrawal with approval from the College The following grades are given in Basic and Pre-Tech courses and are excluded in the GPA calculation: AE Meets measurable objectives in an outstanding manner BE Meets measurable objectives in an above average manner CE Meets the measurable objectives FE Has not met the measurable objectives and must repeat course SE Continuing satisfactory Definition of Terms: Grade Point Value is the value assigned to grades \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"F\" \"D\" and \"P\" will continue to carry grade point value historically. Quality Point is the product of the grade point value multiplied by the quality hours of the course.Quality Hours are the credit-hour value of those courses which are used in the calculation of the grade point average. The Term GPA is the total quality points earned during the term divided by the total quality hours attempted. Pre-tech and Basic courses will not be included in the calculation of term GPA. Term GPA will not be recalculated unless one of the two following conditions occurs: (1) an \"I\" grade is resolved or (2) a grade change is authorized. Cumulative GPA is the total cumulative quality points earned divided by the total cumulative quality hours attempted. The cumulative GPA is an historic index of all work taken at Delaware Tech and is not recalculated when a student changes majors. Work taken at other institutions is not included in the calculation of the cumulative GPA. Pre-tech and basic courses are no longer included in the cumulative GPA. The cumulative GPA at the end of each term will not be recalculated unless one of the two following conditions occur: (1) an \"I\" grade is resolved or (2) a grade change is authorized. ACADEMIC AMNESTY PROCEDURE The following criteria and application has been created to aid currently enrolled students who began their studies at Delaware Technical Community College prior to the conversion to a Semester system in the Fall of 1993 (94-1). To qualify, a student must complete The Petition for Academic Amnesty form and submit the form to the Dean of Instruction or his/her designee. The following conditions apply: 1.Any student who has a non-completion grade (R, U) in a course prior to the Fall of 1993 (94-1) or has an enrollment date prior to 94-1 and has successfully repeated the course(s) (A, B, C grade) or the semester equivalent may petition the Dean of Instruction or his/her designee to eliminate the non-completion grade from the CUM grade point average calculation. Each non-completion grade in the same course will be eliminated from the CUM GPA calculation. 2.The student must submit a written application for Academic Amnesty to the Dean of Instruction or his/her designee. 3.If the request for Academic Amnesty is approved, the non-completion grade (R, U) will be replaced with an administrative grade (AR, AU). The administrative grade (AR, AU) will not be included in the students new CUM Grade Point Average. 51 / 166 4.All students are cautioned that many undergraduate professional programs, graduate and professional schools consider all grades listed on a transcript when considering applications for admission and scholarship. 5.Academic Amnesty does not change accumulated Financial Aid history. Accumulated term and award limits include all terms of enrollment. TRANSFER CREDIT EFFECT ON CUMULATIVE GRADE POINT AVERAGE Students who have received approval for the transfer credit for courses previously completed at Delaware Tech with grades of \"R,\" \"F\" or \"U\" may request that the effect of the \"R,\" \"F\" or \"U\" grade be removed from their cumulative grade point average by submitting a request to the Registrar's Office with a copy of their unofficial transcript. All grades and courses remain on the student's transcript. GRADE POINT AVERAGE ADDENDUM When a student repeats a course, the first passing grade will be calculated in the cumulative grade point average (CUM GPA). A student can request that a higher grade (for coursework 1994-01 forward) be included in the CUM GPA by submitting a request to the Register's Office for coursework that was repeated spring 2007 forward. All courses taken and grades received will remain on the student's transcript, even though some will not be used to determine GPA. Selective admissions processes, scholarships and academic award decisions at other colleges and universities may take into consideration the complete academic record of the student. FRESH START POLICY The Fresh Start policy provides students with an opportunity to request consideration and approval from the College's Deans of Instruction or designee to allow them to recalculate their cumulative grade point average (cumulative GPA). In order to be eligible, students must: 1. be currently enrolled in a program and not have previously earned a degree (associate, diploma, or certificate) at Delaware Tech. 2. have not attended Delaware Tech for a minimum of five full semesters (not including summer). For example, a student who was last enrolled in fall 2012 would be eligible to begin a Fresh Start in fall 2015. 3. upon readmission, complete a minimum of 12college-level credits with at least a 2.00 GPA. 4. apply in writing to the Dean of Instruction or designee requesting consideration for a Fresh Start. The Dean of Instruction or designee will review the student's application, determine if the guidelines have been met, and make a final decision on granting the Fresh Start. Course grades prior to readmittance that do not fulfill graduation requirements in the student's current major will be excluded from the recalculated cumulative GPA. The excluded courses cannot be used to fulfill graduation requirements. Course grades prior to readmittance that fulfill graduation requirements (passing grades) in the student's current major will continue to be included in cumulative GPA recalculation. Fresh Start is granted only one time per student and is irreversible. Fresh Start has no impact on financial aid maximum credits allowed. Although cumulative GPA will be recalculated once the Fresh Start is applied, all attempted hours, grades, and courses will remain on the student's transcript, and a statement will be added to the student's transcript to indicate the Fresh Start effective date. INCOMPLETE \"I\" STUDENT EVALUATION Incomplete (\"I\") Student Evaluation An Incomplete \"I\" evaluation may be awarded by an instructor in situations where extenuating circumstances prevent the student from completing the course work. The following conditions must be met: 1.The extenuating circumstances must occur after the drop/withdraw period has ended. 2.The student must be making satisfactory progress in the course. 3.It must be reasonable to complete the remaining course work and objectives under \"I\" circumstances (i.e., outside of the regular course format). 4.Prior to an instructor agreeing to give or post an \"I\" grade, approval for an \"I\" grade must be given by the department chairperson and Dean of Instruction responsible for the course. Students who receive an incomplete course evaluation must complete the requirements for the course within the time frame specified by the instructor or by the end of the semester following the term in which the \"I\" is received if no time frame is specified. Otherwise the incomplete grade will be changed to a \"F\" grade, and the student must register for the course in a future term. For \"I\" grades earned at the end of the spring 52 / 166 semester, the student will have until the end of the fall semester to complete the requirement, unless a shorter time period is specified by the instructor. The student and instructor determine how the incomplete portion of the course will be completed. If an instructor deems it essential that an incomplete be extended beyond the deadline, a request in writing should be sent to his/her chairperson for endorsement and then to the Dean of Instruction for approval. The request should include a projected date of completion and the reason for the requested extension. A student who receives an incomplete grade does not re-register for the course. SATISFACTORY \"S\" STUDENT EVALUATION The \"S\" evaluation is used only in courses with numbers under 100 where the student has progressed satisfactorily. This grade can be received only one time per course. The student must re-enroll in the course within the succeeding term in order to improve his/ her grade, unless an exception is made by the Dean of Instruction or his/her designee. Note: Students who receive an \"S\" grade and are receiving Veterans Administration educational benefits will be paid for the course during the first term of enrollment only. If the student reregisters for the course, the course cannot be included in the total Veterans Administrations credit hours reported for benefits. LISTENER/AUDIT \"L\" EVALUATION Students who wish to change from credit to Listener status must change their registration status prior to the end of the \"add\" period and will receive an evaluation of \"L\" at the end of the semester. Students may change from Listener to credit status under the following conditions: The request must be made prior to the end of the \"add\" period; The student must meet all admission requirements for the College Instructional Division credit programs; and, Must have instructor, department chair and Dean of Instruction approval ACADEMIC RECOGNITION President's List To be eligible for the President's List, a student must: 1.Earn 12 or more credit hours in courses at the 100 level or above in one term.2.Have a term GPA of at least 3.8. 3.Have no \"I\" or \"S\" grades. If \"I\" grades are later changed to passing grades, thereby affecting President's List eligibility, the student may request a letter noting President's List recognition. This letter may be used for employment, college transfer or other personal purposes. 4.Receive an \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" or \"W\" in all courses of enrollment below the 100 level. Dean's List - Full-Time Students To be eligible for the Dean's List, a student must: 1.Earn 12 or more credit hours in courses at the 100 level or above in one term. 2.Have a term GPA of at least 3.25. 3.Have no \"I\" or \"S\" grades. If \"I\" grades are later changed to passing grades, thereby affecting Dean's List eligibility, the student may request a letter noting Dean's List recognition. This letter may be used for employment, college transfer, or other personal purposes. 4.Receive an \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" or \"W\" in all courses of enrollment below the 100 level. PART-TIME STUDENTS A student will receive a letter of recognition, signed by the Dean of Instruction and Dean of Student Affairs, if the student has earned at least 6 credit hours but less than 12 credit hours in courses in one term at the 100 level or above, has a term GPA of at least 3.25, and meets requirement 3 and 4 of the Dean's List criteria. GRADUATION HONORS Graduation honors are calculated for diplomas, associate degrees, and bachelor's degrees. Certificates are not eligible for graduation honors. Diploma and associate degree honors are based on all coursework that is included in the cumulative grade point average (CUM GPA) at the time the diploma or degree is awarded. Bachelor's degree honors are calculated based on all 300- and 400-level program coursework that is included in the CUM GPA at the time the degree is awarded; general education coursework is not included in bachelor's degree honors. Students earning a CUM GPA between 3.25 and 3.49 will graduate cum laude . Those earning a CUM GPA between 3.5 and 3.79 will graduate magna cum laude . Those earning a CUM GPA between 3.8 and 4.0 will graduate s umma cum laude . Graduation honors are printed on the graduation program and the student's transcript. 53 / 166 COLLEGE POLICY ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY College Policy On Academic Integrity The students and staff of Delaware Technical Community College have an obligation to participate in the academic life of the college in a responsible and intellectually honest manner. As members of the Delaware Tech community, students have responsibilities and duties commensurate with their rights and privileges. One of these responsibilities is to be honest and forthright in their academic work. To falsify the results of one's work, to steal the words or ideas of another, or to cheat on an examination corrupts the academic process. The College Policy on Academic Integrity defines academic dishonesty and outlines sanctions when academic integrity is breached. Academic dishonestly, in any form, is not tolerated; therefore, the College has the right and the responsibility to apply the sanctions outlines in this policy in order to safeguard the ideals of scholarship and character. Forms of Academic Dishonesty Cheating Cheating is an act of deception by which a student misrepresents that he or she has mastered information on an academic exercise that he or she has not mastered. Examples of cheating include but are not limited to: A. Using and/or copying from another student's work such as test paper, project, or computer program. B. Allowing another student to copy one's work. C. Using unauthorized materials such as a textbook, notebook, cell phone or other technology/materials during testing or competency performance without permission. D. Collaborating during a test or competency performance with any other person by attempting to request or receive or by actually requesting or receiving information verbally, in writing, or electronically without permission. E. Using specifically prepared materials that are not permitted during a test (e.g. notes, formula lists, notes written on the student's clothing or person, etc.). Academic Misconduct Academic misconduct is the intentional violation of college policies by tampering with grades, taking part in obtaining or distributing any part of a learning tool (such as quiz, test, paper, presentation, etc.), orsubmitting the same work in more than one class without permission. Examples of academic misconduct include but are not limited to: A. Stealing, buying, selling, or otherwise obtaining all or part of a learning measurement tool. B. Selling or giving away all or part of a learning measurement tool, including answers to a learning measurement tool. C. Bribing or coercing any other person to obtain or attempt to obtain a learning measurement tool or any information about the tool. D. Changing or attempting to change a grade in a grade book, computer system, on a test, or on other work for which a grade has been given. E. Changing, altering, or being an accessory to the changing or altering of a grade in a grade book, on a test, on a \"change of grade\" form, in an electronic system or in other official College academic records that relate to grades. F. Obtaining or attempting to obtain a learning measurement tool. G. Submitting written work to fulfill the requirements of more than one course without the explicit permission of both instructors. Fabrication Fabrication is the intentional use of invented information or the falsification of research or other findings with the intent to deceive. Examples of fabrication include but are not limited to: A. Citation of information not taken from the source indicated. B. Listing sources in a bibliography or other report not used in the academic exercise. C. Inventing data or source information for research or other academic exercise including but not limited to fabrication of log entries or internship hours. D. Submitting as your own any academic exercise prepared totally or in part by another. E. Taking a test for someone else or the student permitting someone else to take a test on one's behalf. Plagiarism Plagiarism is the inclusion of someone else's words, ideas, or data as one's own work. When a student submits work for credit that includes the words, ideas, or data of others, the source of that information must 54 / 166 be acknowledged through complete, accurate, and specific references and citations, and if verbatim statements are included, through quotation marks as well. By placing his or her name on work submitted for credit, the student certifies the originality of all work not otherwise identified by appropriate acknowledgment. The student will avoid being charged with plagiarism if academic citations have been used accurately: A. Whenever quoting another person's words. B. Whenever using another person's idea, opinion or theory, even if it is completely paraphrased in the student's own words. C. Whenever borrowing facts, statistics, computer programs, or other illustrative materials-unless the information is common knowledge. Informing Students about Academic Integrity The College informs students about the importance of academic integrity - including its relationship to professional integrity and success in the workplace and in higher education - and its role in protecting the public trust through the College Catalog and the Student Handbook, at New Student Orientation, in First Year Seminar (SSC 100), and on the portal. Procedures for Adjudication of Alleged Academic Dishonesty 1.The instructor/designee must investigate an alleged attempted or apparent act of academic dishonesty and review the evidence and incident to ensure it is sufficient to warrant a charge of academic dishonesty. This investigation should include a documented discussion with the student prior to the submission of an Academic Dishonesty Report. If the investigation has not been completed prior to the grade due date, the instructor must submit an \"I\" (incomplete) grade and notify the assistant dean of instruction (hereafter referred to as \"assistant dean\"). 2.If the instructor/designee believes that academic dishonesty has occurred, he or she must complete an Academic Dishonesty Report providing a complete description of the incident, documented evidence of a meeting with the student, and evidence supporting the allegation. The instructor/designee must forward a copy of the Academic Dishonesty Report and copies of all evidence to his or her department chairperson and the assistant dean to notify them of the alleged infraction. The report must be completed and forwarded to the individuals listed above within five (5) working days ofbecoming aware of the alleged academic dishonesty. (The instructor or designee must keep the original assignment, test/examination, or other evidence as well as a copy of the Academic Dishonesty Report.) An instructor may not assign a disciplinary grade such as \"F\" or zero to an assignment, test, or other coursework as a sanction for admitted or suspected dishonesty in lieu of following the Academic Integrity Policy. 3.Upon receipt and review of the Academic Dishonesty Report and evidence submitted, the assistant dean must notify the student in writing at the address of record regarding the alleged academic dishonesty and must forward to the student a copy of the Academic Dishonesty Report and a copy of the evidence. The assistant dean will notify the student that he or she may not drop the course. (Note: In this policy, when responsibility is assigned to the assistant dean, it may include his or her designee.) The assistant dean will make every attempt to schedule a joint meeting with the student, the instructor/designee, and the department chairperson within ten (10) working days of receiving the Academic Dishonesty Report. When necessary, the meeting may be conducted by video-conference. During this meeting, every effort will be made to preserve a productive instructor/designee-student relationship. The student will be given the opportunity to ask questions about all written documents and to respond to the allegation. The student will be given the opportunity to accept responsibility for the infraction or to refute the charges. At the meeting, the student will be asked to sign the Academic Dishonesty Report, thereby acknowledging that he or she is aware of the alleged infraction, accepts responsibility for the infraction or intends to refute the charges, and understands the possible sanctions. If the student chooses to refute the charges, the assistant dean will request that the student produce additional evidence/information relevant to the incident. The assistant dean may also attempt to acquire additional information, depending on the nature of the discrepancies. The student has five (5) working days to submit additional evidence. The assistant dean will review the additional evidence within five (5) working days of receipt. The student may not withdraw from the class in 55 / 166 which the alleged infraction occurred and is expected to complete coursework until the alleged infraction has been resolved. If the alleged infraction has not been resolved by the time grades are due, the instructor must assign the student an \"I\" (Incomplete) grade. This grade will remain until the alleged infraction is adjudicated. If under any circumstance the student stops attending the course, a \"U\" (Unofficial Withdrawal) grade with a last date of attendance will be assigned. 4.If the assistant dean determines there was not an infraction of the Academic Integrity Policy, the instructor will clarify the standards of the assignment/test/examination/project with the student. In circumstances in which the assignment was not completed, an opportunity for the student to complete the assignment will be provided. In this case, the assistant dean will document the outcome on the Academic Dishonesty Report and maintain the document in the Office of Instruction. If the assistant dean determines that the student violated the Academic Integrity Policy or if the student accepts responsibility for the infraction, the assistant dean will determine the appropriate sanction(s) in keeping with the adjudication procedures listed in this Academic Integrity Policy and will note such sanction(s) on the Academic Integrity Report. The assistant dean will formally notify the student, the instructor/designee and the department chair that the student has been found responsible for a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy and communicate the sanction(s). This communication to the student will be sent by both email and certified letter with return receipt requested within five (5) working days of reaching a determination that an infraction of the policy has occurred. 5.A student may appeal the decision by requesting a due process hearing with the Campus (for first and second infractions) or the College (for third infraction) Academic Integrity Appeal Committee. If the student chooses to exercise his or her right to a hearing, he or she must notify the assistant dean in writing within ten (10) working days of receipt of the letter informing him or her of the decision and sanction. Upon receipt of this notification, all imposed sanctions are suspended until the appeal process is completed. The student must advise the assistant dean in writing if he or she will exercise his or her right to bring an advisor or attorney to the hearing. The assistant dean will notify the chairperson ofthe Campus or College Academic Integrity Appeal Committee (depending on the infraction) of the student's request for a hearing. 6.Final decisions regarding the academic integrity infraction will be documented in the College's student conduct database. Sanctions for Academic Dishonesty First Infraction The assistant dean may impose an \"F\" grade for the course or a lesser sanction if warranted by the circumstances. When an \"F\" grade for the course is imposed, the student will be required to complete an academic integrity tutorial within a timeframe set by the assistant dean. The assistant dean could also require a student to successfully complete an information literacy tutorial within a set timeframe. If either or both tutorials are not completed by the specified date, a dean's hold will be placed on the student's record until the tutorials are successfully completed. An alternative sanction to the \"F\" grade may be imposed in situations in which the assistant dean determines, after reviewing the evidence and discussing the situation with the student, instructor/designee and department chairperson, that the student did not understand his or her actions were a form of academic dishonesty and there was no intention to be dishonest. An example of this may be plagiarism by completely paraphrasing in one's own words another person's idea, opinion, or theory without giving credit. Additionally, in circumstances that do not justify an \"F\" grade for the course, a zero grade may be assigned for the assignment/test/examination/project in which the infraction occurred. In this case, the student will be required to retake or redo the assignment/test/examination/project to demonstrate mastery of the learning objective or to demonstrate mastery through an alternative means determined by the instructor/designee and approved by the department chairperson. The zero and the new grade will be averaged and factored into the final grade for the course, in accordance with the weight approved for the specific course evaluation measure within the overall evaluation measures approved for the course, which could still result in failure of the course depending on the weight of the assignment in the overall course grade. Second Infraction If the assistant dean determines that a second infraction of academic integrity has occurred in either the same or another course, the student will be assigned an automatic \"F\" in the course in which the 56 / 166 second infraction occurred. The student will be required to complete an academic integrity tutorial, even if completed previously, by a date determined by the assistant dean. If the tutorial is not completed by the specified date, a dean's hold will be placed on the student's record until the tutorial(s) is successfully completed. Third Infraction If the assistant dean determines that a third infraction of academic integrity has occurred in either the same or another course, the student will be dismissed from the College. Dismissal from the College means that the student cannot continue in any course in which he/she is enrolled. The student will receive an \"F\" grade for the course in which the infraction occurred and a \"W\" (Withdrawal) for any other course in which the student is enrolled. Appeals The Campus Academic Integrity Appeal (Committee) will hear appeals of first and second infractions. The committee is composed of the dean of instruction, a faculty member appointed by the campus director, and the dean of student affairs. The dean of instruction will chair the committee. The College Academic Integrity Appeal Committee will hear appeals of third infractions. The Committee is composed of a dean of instruction from another campus, a dean of student affairs from another campus, and the assistant vice president for academic affairs. The associate vice president for academic affairs will chair the committee. The Campus or College Academic Integrity Appeal Committee will conduct their proceedings as follows. At the hearing, which is closed to the public, the chair of the Committee will introduce the written appeal to the Committee. The Committee will discuss issues, hear testimony, question witnesses, and consider available evidence pertaining to the appeal hearing. The Committee may call upon the instructor/designee, department chairperson, and anyone else who may provide relevant information. The student will have the opportunity to present statements, testimony, evidence, and witnesses; refute evidence brought forth to the Committee and present any relevant evidence in his or her defense; question witnesses; and respond to questions by the members of the Committee. The student may bring an advisor or attorney to the due process hearing but must advise the assistant dean in advance of the hearing, and the assistant dean will notify the chair of the appropriate appeal committee. The written findings of facts and the sanction(s) will be submitted by the Committee to the campus director and to the dean of instruction of the campus where thealleged infraction took place within three (3) working days of the hearing, unless this time is extended for good cause by the Committee. The Committee's decision will be final and will be sent via certified mail with return receipt requested within three (3) working days of the hearing to the student. A copy will also be sent to the instructor/designee and the department chair. The dean of instruction will authorize the registrar to record/change any grade. The written findings of the facts and the sanction(s) will be kept in a confidential file in the office of the Committee chairperson (campus dean of instruction or College associate vice president for academic affairs) and made available to the student for at least five (5) years. ACADEMIC STANDING POLICY A student's Cumulative Grade Point Average (CUM GPA) for total credits attempted must be equal to or greater than that indicated on the \"Minimum CUM GPA for Satisfactory Academic Standing Table\" (below) in order to be in satisfactory academic standing at Delaware Tech. Minimum CUM GPA for Satisfactory Academic Standing Table To be in satisfactory academic standing at Delaware Tech, students must meet the minimum CUM GPA for the number of credits attempted. The CUM GPA is calculated using all courses taken. Official withdrawal from courses (W grades) are not counted in the GPA calculation. Credits Credits 1 - 15 1.5 16 - 30 1.6 31 - 45 1.8 46+ 2.0 Academic Warning The first semester a student does not earn the minimum CUM GPA required for satisfactory academic standing, the student will be placed on Academic Warning and restricted to a maximum of 13 credits in the next semester of attendance. A student who registers for more than 13 credits for a subsequent semester before the end of the current semester and is determined to be on Academic Warning after grades are submitted must adjust the number of credits on their schedule to 13 or fewer credits. If a student does not reduce the number of credits to 13 or fewer credits, the credits will be reduced by the 57 / 166 College. Academic Probation If a student does not earn the minimum CUM GPA required for satisfactory academic standing in two successive semesters, the student will be placed on Academic Probation and restricted to a maximum of 9 credits in the next semester of attendance. A student who registers for more than 9 credits for a subsequent semester before the end of the current semester and is determined to be on Academic Probation after grades are submitted must adjust the number of credits on their schedule to 9 or fewer credits. If a student does not reduce the number of credits to 9 or less, the credits will be reduced by the College. Status after Break in Enrollment A student who withdraws or has a break in enrollment from the College while on Academic Warning or Academic Probation will retain that status upon re-enrolling. The student must earn the minimum CUM GPA required for satisfactory academic standing by the end of the semester, or the student will progress to the next level of academic probation. Appeal of Credit Load Restriction A student on Academic Warning or Academic Probation may appeal the credit limit restriction by completing the Academic Standing Petition form and submitting it to the dean of instruction/designee for approval to register for more credits than Academic Warning and Academic Probation status allow. If the petition is approved, it is the student's responsibility to submit the approved petition to the Registrar's office in order to update the student's record and allow registration. Academic Probation-Continuing A student in Academic Probation status who does not earn the minimum CUM GPA required for satisfactory academic standing or a semester GPA of at least 2.0 in the next or subsequent semesters will not be allowed to register for the next semester unless the student submits an Academic Standing Petition that is approved by the dean of instruction/designee to the Registrar's office. The dean/designee may approve any number of credits for registration, including none, for that semester. A student who registers for a subsequent semester before the end of the current semester and remains on Academic Probation after grades are submitted mustsubmit an approved Academic Standing Petition. After a petition is approved by the dean of instruction/designee, it is the student's responsibility to submit the approved petition to the Registrar's office. If an approved petition is not submitted, the student's registration will be deleted by the College. Academic Suspension Academic Suspension status was eliminated at the conclusion of summer semester 2012 (2012-53.) Students who would have been in Academic Suspension status under the previous policy will be treated as students who are on Academic Probation-Continuing. Note: Satisfactory academic standing is just one of the three components required for \"Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress.\" The other two components are meeting \"Maximum Credits Allowed\" requirements and \"Percentage of Courses Completed\" requirements. DEVELOPMENTAL HOLD POLICY The Developmental Hold Policy serves to identify students enrolled in developmental education (courses below the 100 level) who are at risk for continuing academic failure and in need of academic advisement to support their future success and retention. The non-completion course grades listed below will trigger the following corresponding hold and actions. One (1) FE (fail) or UE (Unofficial Withdraw) grade in a developmental course Developmental Hold Math or Developmental Hold English placed on account. Requires the math or English department advisor's approval signature for the student to register for classes. Two (2) or more FE or UE grades in the same course Developmental Hold Program Advisor placed on account. Requires the program advisor's approval signature for the student to register for classes. When a student is concurrently enrolled in college credit and developmental courses, both the Academic Standing Policy and the Developmental Hold Policy apply. FINANCIAL AID SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS 58 / 166 Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward degree, diploma, and certificate completion in order to receive federal, state, or Delaware Tech financial aid. Students must meet all three satisfactory academic progress requirements: 1.Maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (CUM GPA). (See the Academic Standing Policy in the College Catalog ) 2.Maintain a 67% cumulative completion rate by successfully completing 67% of all credits attempted 3.Complete the program of study within the maximum time frame for the program. The maximum credits allowed is 150% of the number of credits required to earn the award. These requirements apply to the student's entire period of attendance at Delaware Tech, including any periods during which the student does not receive any financial aid. Satisfactory academic progress is one eligibility requirement for financial aid; view a complete list of financial aid eligibility requirements . Satisfactory academic progress is calculated at the end of each semester to determine eligibility for the student's next semester. Students who do not meet the satisfactory academic progress requirements for cumulative GPA and/or completion rate will be placed on financial aid warning. A student must meet these requirements at the end of the next semester, or the student will be ineligible for financial aid until satisfactory academic progress requirements are met. Students on financial aid warning are required to successfully complete financial aid counseling before financial aid can be disbursed. Students who have not completed the program within the maximum credits allowed will be ineligible for financial aid. They may appeal to have financial aid eligibility reinstated if extenuating circumstances prevented them from maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Such circumstances include: Medical condition, illness, or injury to the student or an immediate family member Death of an immediate family member Change or loss of employment for you or an immediate family member Other special circumstances Documentation must be provided, and the student must complete a financial aid appeal explaining the reason(s) the student did not maintain satisfactory academic progress and what has changed in the student's situation that would allow the student to regain satisfactory academic progress. The appeal process also requires the student to submit an academic plan that sets forth the requirements thestudent must meet to make satisfactory academic progress. Students must also successfully complete financial aid counseling before the appeal will be considered. The Financial Aid Office will provide the student with the appeal decision and explain what the student must do to reestablish eligibility for federal/state financial aid. Submitting an appeal does not guarantee the student will regain financial aid eligibility. The decision of the Financial Aid Office regarding the financial aid appeal is final. If the appeal is not approved, then the student is ineligible for financial aid until satisfactory academic progress is achieved at the student's own expense. If the appeal is approved by the Financial Aid Office, the student is then placed on Financial Aid Probation for the authorized enrollment status . A student placed on Financial Aid Probation may receive financial aid as long as the student is satisfying the requirements of an approved academic plan. If after the one semester of Financial Aid Probation, the College determines the student achieved satisfactory academic progress, the student's financial aid eligibility will be reinstated for the next semester of attendance. Thereafter, such student's academic progress will be evaluated in accordance with this policy. If after the one semester of Financial Aid Probation, the College determines the student met all the requirements of the student's academic plan, but did not achieve satisfactory academic progress, the student will be permitted to continue to receive financial aid for the next semester and subsequent semesters of attendance for the authorized enrollment status provided that the student continues to meet all of the requirements of the academic plan. A student who meets the academic plan requirements may request to increase the authorized enrollment status by submitting a new academic plan. If after the one semester of Financial Aid Probation, the College determines that the student did not meet all the requirements of the academic plan and did not successfully achieve satisfactory academic progress, the student will lose financial aid eligibility until the student achieves satisfactory academic progress at the student's expense. Students may make another appeal for financial aid eligibility by submitting a new financial aid appeal form and providing a new academic plan. However, students are advised that financial aid appeals for academic plan deficiencies will only be approved for changes to the student's major and required courses or in extenuating circumstances as determined by the Financial Aid Office Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements 59 / 166 In order to be eligible for federal, state, or institutional financial aid, each student at the College must make satisfactory academic progress toward the attainment of the selected degree, diploma, or certificate according to the following three requirements that comprise financial aid satisfactory academic progress. (Other eligibility requirements also apply.) 1. Minimum Cumulative Grade Point Average: The table below represents the minimum CGPA needed to be eligible for federal/state financial aid. The CUM GPA is calculated using all courses taken. Official withdrawal from courses (W grades) are not counted in the GPA calculation. Students enrolled in bachelor's degree programs must meet the minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA at the end of each semester of enrollment. Credits Attempted CGPA 1 - 15 >1.5 16 - 30 >1.6 31 - 45 >1.8 46+ >2.0 2. Completion Rate: Students at the College must successfully complete, on a cumulative basis, 67% of all credits attempted. All non-completion grades (\"W,\" \"U,\" \"R,\"/ \"F,\" and \"I\") are used in the calculation of completion rates. As an example, the following table shows the minimum number of credits a student must successfully complete (with an \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\") on a cumulative basis to be eligible for federal/state financial aid . Developmental (remedial) credits are not calculated in the completion rate. Completed Credits Required To Achieve Satisfactory Completion Rate Attempted CreditsCompleted CreditsAttempted CreditsCompleted Credits 1 1 16 11 2 2 17 11 3 2 18 12 4 3 19 13 5 3 20 13 6 4 21 14 7 5 22 15 8 5 23 15 9 6 24 16 10 7 25 17 11 7 26 17 12 8 27 18 13 9 28 19 14 9 29 19 15 10 30 20 2. Maximum Credits Allowed (MCA) for a Degree/Diploma or Previous Associate Degree: A financial aid recipient is restricted to a maximumnumber of credits for which the student can receive financial aid. The maximum credits allowed (MCA) is 150% of the published length of the eligible educational program in which the student is currently enrolled. For example, if 60 credits are required for a specific degree, the MCA for the degree program would be 90 credits (60 x 150% = 90). The published program lengths are available on the College website and in the Catalog. In addition, the credits from a previous diploma or degree program earned at Delaware Tech or elsewhere that are applied to a new degree program at Delaware Tech will be counted toward the MCA for the new degree program. Students may receive financial aid for a second diploma or degree providing they are meeting other satisfactory academic progress and financial aid eligibility requirements. An appeal must be completed in order for the student to be considered for financial aid. Maximum Credits Allowed (MCA) for Remedial Courses: Developmental (0 and 00 level) classes are considered remedial courses. Basic classes (00 level) are not eligible for federal financial aid payment, but are used in calculating the remedial MCA. The MCA for a student enrolled in remedial courses is 30 credit hours. This MCA value is separate from the degree or diploma MCA value. No extension is permitted for a student who exceeds the 30-credit remedial limit. English as a Second Language classes are not remedial classes and do not count in the 30 credit hour remedial limit. Repeat Coursework: Students may receive financial aid for repeating failed coursework if all other eligibility requirements are met. In addition, one repetition of previously passed coursework is eligible for federal financial aid. However, a previously passed course is not eligible for financial aid if it is being repeated because the student failed other coursework (e.g., must repeat the course again because of co-requisite requirements). Repeating a course may improve CUM GPA, but each attempt impacts the completion rate and maximum credits allowed. Transfer Students: Coursework completed at another institution that is officially accepted as transfer credit by the College counts toward the cumulative completion rate and MCA. Transferred grades are not calculated in CUM GPA and, 60 / 166 therefore, are not included in the satisfactory academic progress calculation. All information is subject to change based on revisions to federal laws, regulations, or college policies and procedures. Students are required to abide by any such revision. CREDIT HOURS Students registered for 12 or more credit hours (or equivalent) are considered full-time. A student registered for less than 12 credit hours per semester is considered to be part-time. The class hours, laboratory hours, and total credits are printed in the College Catalog following each course description. The total credits, class hours and laboratory hours are printed. Example: (4:3:3) CREDITS IN RESIDENCE Candidates for the associate degree must complete a minimum of twenty-four (24) credits of course work at Delaware Technical Community College. For the Associate in Applied Science or Associate of Arts, at least twelve (12) credits of the residence requirement must be major courses from the program in which the degree is awarded. For the Associate of Science degree, at least twelve (12) credits of the residence requirement must be core courses. Candidates for the diploma must complete twelve (12) credits of the residence requirement with six (6) credits in major courses. Candidates for the certificate must complete 50% of credits required for the certificate at Delaware Tech. Credits earned under the Advanced Standing Policy may not be applied toward the residency requirements of the College. Exceptions to this policy may be made with the approval of the Deans of Instruction, Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs and Vice President for Academic Affairs. Candidates for the RN to BSN program must complete a minimum of 75% of the 300 and 400 level nursing courses at Delaware Tech. CREDITS IN RESIDENCE FOR ACTIVE-DUTY SERVICE Academic residence for all degrees for active-duty service members is limited to no more than twenty-five percent of the degree requirements. Of the twenty-five percent, at least twelve credits of the residence requirement must be in major courses from the program in which the degree is awarded. Academic residence can be completed at any time while active-duty service members are enrolled. Reservist and National Guardsmen on active-duty are covered in the same manner.GRADUATION POLICY A student will graduate when the student has: satisfactorily completed the courses required for a degree, diploma, or certificate in the program/major area as certified by the department chairperson and the dean of instruction and verified by the registrar, and the credits in residence requirements have been met. No Delaware Technical Community College degree, diploma, or certificate is to be awarded or the student allowed to participate in official graduation ceremonies unless that student has completed all requirements for said degree, diploma, or certificate. Degree and diploma students may participate in the commencement ceremony as long as all required steps are completed. Campuses SUSSEX COUNTY LOCATION JACK F.

The Workforce Development and Community Education Division is the outreach arm of the College, encompassing special projects not available through other instructional areas. DISTANCE EDUCATION Mission Statement The mission and purpose of distance education at the College is to improve access, enable learning experiences that promote student satisfaction and success, and achieve excellence through student engagement. Delaware Tech seeks to provide a highquality student experience by expanding the times and places of program offerings and embracing technological innovation. Distance Education Course Definitions Distance education is a formal educational process in which a percentage of the learning occurs when students and the instructor are not in the same location. Distance education courses employ a wide variety of interactive learning technologies to deliver synchronous (occurring simultaneously) and asynchronous (occurring at different times) instruction. Online \u2014 All course activity is done online; no required in-person sessions or on-campus activities are required within the course. Online courses consist entirely of online elements that facilitate the three critical student interactions: with content, the instructor, and other students. Students taking an online course may be required to take proctored tests at a testing center or through an online proctoring system. Additionally, students may be required to complete a practicum, residency, or internship depending on the requirements of the course/program. Hybrid \u2014 Online activity is mixed with classroom meetings, replacing up to 75% of in-person instruction. In addition to classroom meetings, students may be required to participate in online synchronous meetings. Additionally, hybrid courses require that students meet in-person for the first day of class and receive instruction during all subsequent in-person meetings. Students may be required to take exams during some scheduled class meetings. Web Conferencing \u2014 Web-based technologies are used to extend classroom lectures and discussions to students at remote sites in real time. These courses use web conferencing or other synchronous e-learning media to provide access to the classroom experience to students at off-campus locations (such as their homes, places of employment, other campuses, etc.) while otherwise maintaining a traditional classroom structure. Video Conferencing \u2014 Course meetings are held in a campus-based video conference room (e.g. Distance Learning Classrooms) at designated times. Distance Education Support Services Students in online learning programs have access to student services, financial aid, course registration, advisement, library services, technology support, career, and placement counseling as traditional classroom students. Contact information for each of these services is available on the College's website, portal, and/or learning management system. Distance education students have access to learning 66 / 166 resources including but not limited to the library, research databases, bookstores, laboratories, tutoring centers, writing centers, testing centers, and computer labs. Many library resources are available online. Computer Access It is required that distance education students have consistent access to a personal computer with reliable high-speed internet access. Additionally, the student should have a back-up plan should the primary equipment fail or become unavailable. Many public libraries have public use computers, as do the computer labs and libraries at each of the Delaware Technical Community College campuses. For some courses, a cell phone may not meet the minimum technology requirements for performing the work for distance education courses. Information regarding minimum technology requirements for distance education is available on the College's website. There may be additional hardware/software requirements that are course specific. This information will be provided to the student by the course instructor at the start of the course. Learning Management Systems A learning management system, or LMS, is a web-accessible software application that provides for the administration of course content, delivery of assessments, communication and collaboration between students and instructors, and the ability to track grades and other relevant performance data. To be successful in distance education courses, students must be able to effectively navigate and utilize the LMS for their course. All students at the College can access their LMS courses through the MyDTCC portal. Students also have access to 24-7 learning management system technology support. Information on how to contact support can be found in the learning management system. Additional information can be found on the College's Information & Instructional Technology website. Testing and Proctored Exams Testing in distance education courses can be conducted in a variety of ways, depending on the course. Some distance education courses may require proctored exams. A proctored exam is one that is overseen by an impartial individual, called a proctor, who monitors a student during the exam. The proctor ensures the security and integrity of the exam. Students may be given the option of taking the proctored exams in an approved testing center (either a Delaware Tech campus testing center or one approved by the instructor) or via the College's supported online proctoring service (e.g., Examity). Be advised that some proctoring services may charge a fee, which is theresponsibility of the student. All distance education exam and proctoring policies will be clearly indicated in the course policies at the start of the course. Student Complaint Process Distance education students follow the same process for filing complaints as do traditional classroom students. For more information on this process, please refer to this section of the student handbook. This complaint resolution process is applicable to all students, whether Delaware residents or nonresidents, and regardless of the state's NC-SARA membership. For online distance education students that live outside of Delaware, all students are strongly encouraged to utilize the internal complaint resolution process established by the College under section IV.B. of the College's Student Rights And Standards Of Student Conduct. If an online student who resides outside of Delaware is dissatisfied with the outcome of their complaint under the College's Student Rights and Standards Of Student Conduct process, the student may file a complaint with the Delaware Department of Education. The College is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education which also provides a process for complaints against Member institutions .

Food safety is the application of food science to the selection, preservation, processing, packaging, distribution, and use of safe food. The food consumed on a daily basis is the result of extensive food research - a systematic investigation by food scientists into a variety of foods' properties and compositions. It is through the application of the research that food reaches the consumer. Using the principles of food safety, food products are mass produced, and it is the food safety technicians who have the knowledge of selection, preservation, processing, packaging, and distribution resulting in safe food being consumed. All of these interrelated fields contribute to the food industry -- the largest manufacturing industry in the United States.
