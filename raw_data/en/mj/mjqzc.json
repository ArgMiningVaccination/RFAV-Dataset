New Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners Holistic therapist Robert Kropf is now a certified BodyTalk therapist. He adds this new area of expertise to his current list of specialties, which includes holistic physical therapy, the Alexander Technique, craniosacral therapy, and the Rubenfeld Synergy Method. Kropf has practiced a multidisciplinary holistic approach to healing for over 25 years. Formerly located in Ann Arbor's Parkway Center, he recently moved his practice to 2190 S. State Street. There he changed the name of his practice from Bodyhalen Therapies to Holistic Bodytherapies. BodyTalk is a therapy that focuses on harnessing the body's natural ability to heal itself. BodyTalk works to recreate lines of communication within the body to bring it back into balance and optimal function. Kropf first became aware of BodyTalk when a colleague asked him to attend a weekend workshop. Not looking for anything new at the time, Kropf agreed to try one hour of instruction. He says he was able to get relief from some digestive problems that had been bothering him for over five years. Impressed, he pursued training in the system. According to Kropf, the process is simple. \"Certified BodyTalk therapists use neuromuscular feedback to highlight which area or system in the body is the next priority to be re-energized. By raising the vibration of the weakest link, we prevent future imbalances in that area, while also maximizing the person's ability to heal on many different levels.\" He explains that raising the vibration level of one part of the whole also will raise the vibration level and energy of the entire system.BodyTalk is safe and effective and can be used for a multitude of everyday problems for adults, children, babies, and animals. It has been effective in the treatment of pain, stress, arthritis, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, endocrine disorders, digestive disorders, learning disorders, migraine headaches, phobias, allergies, and back and neck pain. Robert Kropf can be reached at (734) 660-4131 or at rmk48103@gmail.com.Ann Arbor's Naturopathic School of the Healing Arts and New Life Energies Center has expanded into a beautiful 4,100-square-foot facility on Jackson Road, and the first class from their three-year Traditional Naturopathy Diploma Program will graduate this fall. The school's spacious new facility contains two large classrooms, a library/lounge that also contains the school's herbal apothecary and dispensary, student clinic space, and more. The facility allows them to meet a long-held goal: to evolve into \"By raising the vibration of the weakest link, we prevent future imbalances in that area, while also maximizing the person's ability to heal on many different levels.\" [Kropf] explains that raising the vibration level of one part of the whole also will raise the vibration level and energy of the entire system.

The school is now able to host a variety of practitioners for classes and events. The graduating class of naturopaths started in 2009, and seven students will be completing the program. There are 14 students currently in their second year of the program, and the school expects more for the next class.

Every Body Happy Yoga is run by Patty Hart, certified Prana Yoga instructor. Prana is a gentle form of Hatha Yoga that focuses heavily on breathwork. Hart calls it an \"adaptive style,\" adjustable to the individual through modification as necessary. Many of Hart's clients are older adults who may be experiencing some reduction in physical ability. She says her practice helps people to focus on the experience of being happy in the body as it currently is, without the distraction of what it used to, or should be, like. Robin Okun runs Mindful Movement. She has been a licensed clinical social worker for 25 years, and has offered Mindful Movement for the past seven years. The Mindful Movement practices include awareness, movement, music, breathwork, and creative expression in a community of compassion, acceptance, and respect. Okun explains that Mindful Movement helps women develop more conscious, loving, trusting relationships with their bodies. Women learn to access a greater sense of confidence, assertiveness, and freedom while moving beyond the internal judgment voices that often dominate thinking, doing, and feeling. Mindful Movement is not an exercise or physical fitness class, Okun emphasizes, but an opportunity for women to connect with their bodies. She works individually and in small groups, and is offering introductory workshops in the fall. Hart explains that she found herself in need of someone to share her space at about the same time that Okun was looking for a new space, and they met by chance at around that time. Okun says their common goal, beyond the purposes of each of their businesses, is to \"create a heart space where people can come together and transform.\" Every Body Happy Yoga is online at www.everybodyhappy.net, and Patty Hart can be reached at (734) 645-7251 or patty@everybodyhappy.net. Mindful Movement's website is at RobinOkun.com, and Robin Okun can be reached at robin@robinokun.com or (734) 395-2624. Both practices are located in the Aprill Wellness Center, 107 Aprill Drive, Suite 4, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. Monica Gurnani, classical homeopath, has expanded her practice into Ann Arbor with a shared space in the Parkway Center. Gurnani holds a bachelor's degree in homeopathic medicine from the University of Bombay Medical School. For the last 15 years, she has been practicing homeopathic medicine at various hospitals, health care centers, and in her own practice. Continued on page 12 Patty Hart of Every Body Happy Yoga and Robin Okun of Mindful Movement Okun says their common goal, beyond the purposes of each of their businesses, is to \"create a heart space where people can come together and transform.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 12 Gurnani now maintains office hours in Ann Arbor on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and operates from her Farmington Hills office on Monday and Wednesday. As a homeopath, Gurnani treats a variety of conditions, including acute viral infections, earaches, flu, cold, cough, chronic allergies, asthma, ADD/ADHD, colitis, thyroid problems, menopausal issues, and chronic yeast infections. She explains that homeopathic medicines are created with the whole person in mind, not a singular condition or symptom. \"Homeopathy doesn't look at disease as an external entity; symptoms manifested by the body of the individual during sickness help us to identify a unique remedy for that individual. It's like a tailor-made dress, rather than buying something from a store,\" Gurnani says. She gives an example of a young girl she treated who suffered from severe allergies and asthma, but who also had an extreme fear of going into the water. By understanding the girl's temperament and treating her as a whole person, Gurnani was not only able to treat her allergies and asthma, but her fear also subsided. Another patient of Gurnani's was a medical nurse suffering from an acute viral infection that had been spreading throughout her workplace. With homeopathic care, not only was the woman feeling better much faster than her coworkers with the same symptoms, but her uterine fibroid tumors were also treated and began to subside. Gurnani explains that by creating a natural remedy for the individual person according to their mental, emotional, and physical makeup, all chronic conditions in the person's system are dealt with, returning the body back to a state of balance and health. Monica Gurnani's Ann Arbor practice is located in the Parkway Center, at 2345 S. Huron Parkway, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. She can be reached at monicagurnani@ hotmail.com or at (248) 982-3642. Tai Chi Master Sang Kim is offering relationship counseling as a natural extension of the tai chi principles he has been teaching for 18 years. Couples tend to seek counseling because they feel their problems are caused by a lack of communication, says Kim, but this is not necessarily the problem at all. He explains that different people have different levels of need: emotional, physical, spiritual, et cetera, and different essential drives. For example, one person might have a much higher tolerance for risk than another, and, because of this, they might not perceive an action as risky \u2014 while a person with a low risk tolerance might see it as obviously risky. This sets up the two people for conflict. Kim explains that one way he can help couples is to: first, diagnose the differences in needs and drives that are causing conflict; second, to help them craft a legitimate solution; and third, to help them get to a place where both people are working toward a common goal. He explains that male energy and female energy work differently, which can cause misunderstandings in relationships as well. Understanding the differences in how the other deals with emotions can also help couples create better understanding and a better way of relating to one another. For example, he says that men are less in touch with their emotions on a moment- to-moment level than women. To get in touch with what he is actually feeling, a man will tend to lie down or recline. To a female trying to talk with a male, this can be distressing, because it seems to her like he is ignoring her.What's New in the Community Continued from page 11 Monica Gurnani\"Homeopathy doesn't look at disease as an external entity; symptoms manifested by the body of the individual during sickness help us to identify a unique remedy for that individual. It's like a tailor-made dress, rather than buying something from a store,\" Gurnani says. Kim says that money and sex are two of the most common sources of marital strife. These may seem somewhat unrelated, but both go back to differing levels of need. He cites Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, which is expressed in a pyramid with physiological needs at the bottom (e.g., food, water), followed by safety needs (security of body, employment, health), then love/belonging (family, friendship, intimacy), esteem (confidence, achievement, respect of and by others), and, at the top, self-actualization (morality, creativity, problem solving, and so on). The idea is that if lower-level needs are not being met, a person will seek to fulfill those needs before higher-level needs. Thus, if one person in a relationship is worried about money, which generally means physiological and safety needs are not being met, they will not be able to focus on achieving greater intimacy with their partner. If lower-level needs are not being met, a person will seek to fulfill those needs before higher-level needs. Thus, if one person in a relationship is worried about money, which generally means physiological and safety needs are not being met, they will not be able to focus on achieving greater intimacy with their partner. Tai Chi Master Sang KimThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 13 Kim helps couples understand their own needs and the needs of their partners. He also helps them understand their own and their partner's levels of \"intelligence\" (knowledge or skill) in different areas, which can cause conflict as well. Different people have different levels of physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, and other types of intelligence. If ignored, these differences can cause conflict; if they are explored, they can strengthen a partnership. As an example, Kim says that his wife loves doing research and is good at it, while he cannot stand it. When the couple has a goal that will need research to accomplish, she does the research, while he contributes in other ways. Kim developed the Sun Shen model of tai chi in 2002 as a synthesis of the ancient spiritual traditions with a modern scientific approach. Sun Shen comes from a place of self-cultivation. He says that most therapy assumes \"something is wrong with you,\" and works on fixing it. Self-cultivation assumes you are fine, and helps you maximize on your strengths. This applies to the way that Kim teaches tai chi and to the way he has been helping couples achieve better relationships for the past several years. Sang Kim can be reached at (734) 904-9050 or info@dojokitchen.com. His website is at www.dojokitchen.com. New Practitioners and Businesses Naturopathic doctor Diana Quinn, psychologist Sierra Hillebrand, social worker and yoga instructor Barbara Brookens-Harvey, acupuncturists and Chinese herbologists Diana Gonzalez and Abby Humphrey, and integrative wellness practitioner Deb Rhizal have come together to form the Hygeia Center for Healing Arts. Hygeia offers a variety of mind-body-sprit wellness services including acupuncture, clinical social work, craniosacral therapy, Reiki, infant mental health services, pregnancy and childbirth classes, tai chi, psychotherapy, massage, yoga, naturopathic medicine, and wellness coaching. The practitioners are all passionate about providing empowerment and better health to those they serve. Naturopathic doctor Diana Quinn has had a suite at the space since 2007. When she and the other five women began to talk about their shared vision for a healing arts center made up of a collective of small businesses, they decided to take over the entire building where Quinn's practice is located. Hygeia operates on a non-profit model. Services are offered at full-pay rates for those who can afford them; those in need of services who cannot pay full price or, sometimes, cannot pay at all, can apply for assistance through the community-supported Phoenix Fund. The fund, created by the Hygeia group to extend income- Continued on page 15 Tuesdays: Sept 18, Oct 16, Nov 13, Dec 11 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 14 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 15 based discounts to clients who cannot otherwise access their services, is funded through donations, grants, and fundraisers. Hygeia Center for Healing Arts is located in the Kerrytown area at 220 N. Fifth Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48104.

New Books by Area Authors A Rebel Chick Mystic's Guide, Lisa Marie Selow's first book, will be released by Hay House, Inc. in November of 2012. Selow, a self-described rebel, rocker chick, and modern mystic, recently turned 40. Having begun her personal healing journey at age 18, she has much to share with \"brave, misfit women or those who aspire to be.\" Growing up, Selow attended a parochial Christian school for nine years, but says she was always curious about other paths, religions, and world views. She asked lots of questions, which wasn't always appreciated by her teachers. While in college, she embraced Ann Arbor's rich culture of diverse spiritual paths. Crazy Wisdom has been a favorite destination whenever she returns to the city from her Metro Detroit home. As an adult, Selow has explored various career paths, always stemming from her interest in helping others live full and empowered lives. She has been a massage therapist, energy worker, and intuitive advisor. Currently, she works as a life coach and motivational speaker. She says that writing a book was a natural outcome of her desire to help a larger audience of people. Selow describes the Guide as a self-help book, but says, \"There's no book out there that can help you live your life.\" In effect, through the book's exercises, readers write their own manual for living the life they want. She views the book as a guide that will \"help you get clear on who you are and what makes you happy.\" After all, she adds, \"the point of the path is to be happy.\" Lisa Marie Selow can be contacted via email at lisa@lisaselow.com. More information about her and her book is online at lisaselow.com. Upcoming Events On September 29-30, the Self Realization Meditation Healing Centre in Bath, MI will host an Animal Healing Course with international teacher James Whittingham. Whittingham lives in England and is a direct disciple of Mata Yogananda Mahasaya Dharma, the spiritual head and founder of the worldwide Self Realization Meditation Healing Centres. He is a teacher of Pure Meditation, Natural Spiritual Healing, and Animal Healing courses, and has 13 years of experience as a Natural Spiritual Healer and Animal Healer. The Animal Healing Course is open to those who want to practice professionally as well as those who just want to deepen their love and understanding for animals. Hands-on experience will include giving healing to local pets and animals at a nearby farm. Joanne Rowe, who runs the Centre along with Paul Rowe, described her first experience with animal healing. She had begun to receive healing herself and wasn't entirely convinced that the process was anything except the power of suggestion. She owned a horse that she says had \"very special needs,\" and her teacher offered healing to the horse, which improved immensely. From this point on, she was a believer. \"You can't talk a horse into believing in something that isn't working,\" she says.The Animal Healing Course runs for two days, from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., with lunch and refreshments provided. The cost is $225, with overnight accommodations and additional meals available for around $50 for those who wish to stay for the weekend. Rowe explains that, as with any course taught at the Centre, ongoing support is always available after training is complete. The Centre is a 501c3 non-profit organization and provides \"bursaries\" (scholarships) to those (seeking training) who would otherwise not be able to afford it. The Self Realization Meditation Healing Centre is at 7187 Drumheller Road, Bath, MI 48808. Joanne and Paul Rowe can be reached at (517) 641-6201 or at SRMHCMichigan@cs.com. More information is available online at www.SelfRealizationCentreMichigan.org. Jeanne Ballew of Edit Prose and Christa Chambers-Price of Knowledgecrush have created a new way for entrepreneurs to get together and build relationships, called Entre-SLAM. Bored by typical networking events for entrepreneurs and inspired by National Public Radio's The Moth, a live storytelling show, Ballew and Chambers-Price came up with a storytelling competition, similar to a poetry slam, but for entrepreneurs. The events are held at LIVE, a nightclub in downtown Ann Arbor. There is live music, food from local restaurants, and an emcee to keep things going. Storytellers have five minutes to tell a true story, with no reading allowed. Each monthly Entre-SLAM has a theme that the storytellers must stick to and, because this is a gathering of entrepreneurs, one more rule must be made clear: no pitches. Participants and attendees are there to get to know one another and the authentic human journey behind each business, not to sell. \"Promotion and networking does happen, but it's casual and natural, not planned or forced,\" says Ballew. The first Entre-SLAM took place in March 2012 and was a successful beyond what Ballew and Chambers-Price initially hoped. There have since been three more and, while they are taking the summer months of July and August off, the event will resume in fall on the last Thursday of each month, from 7-9 p.m. The theme for the September 27 SLAM has not yet been decided; previous themes have included \"The Best Mistake I Ever Made,\" \"Going Against the Grain,\" and \"The Show Must Go On.\" Each show is recorded and, starting with this SLAM, the highlights will be aired on the local Community Television Network (Channel 17). Ballew says there is an amazing cross-pollination of entrepreneurs who attend; a 60-year-old CEO of a multimillion-dollar business might sit next to a 20-something contemplating a start-up. This, says Ballew, is community-building as well as business-building. Admission is just $10, so entrepreneurs at every level can attend. The Entre-SLAM slogan is \"Kicks the work out of networking,\" and Ballew says that she and Chambers-Price set out to create an experience that would be delightful and fun. Videos of past SLAM stories on their website would suggest they succeeded. You can register online to attend the next Entre-SLAM as a storyteller or general attendee at www.knowledgecrush.com/index.php/entreslam. Jeanne Ballew can be contacted at editprose@provide.net. Parker Whitaker, a muscle and pain therapist who specializes in Muscle Release Technique (MRT) and Release and Repattern Muscle Therapy (RRMT), will hold the first of three intensive weekend seminars on RRMT at the Ann Arbor School of Naturopathy in October. These seminars will be of interest to massage therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and hands-on sports trainers. According to Whitaker, RRMT is a hands-on therapy that facilitates releasing and resetting of scar tissue, re-patterning and reestablishment of normal movement, and restored blood flow to injured areas. He says that with most massage modalities, symptoms are treated but reappear, necessitating repeated visits. Most of his clients need only one or two sessions in order to find lasting relief from pain \u2014 except in cases of degenerative diseases such as muscular sclerosis, which may require regular treatments. The first seminar will be an introduction to RRMT and will take place on October 26-28. The weekend will consist of 25 hours of instruction and is targeted to practitioners who already have a good understanding of anatomy. Two further seminars are scheduled for February and April of 2013 that will increase the participants' knowledge and practice of this technique. The cost of each seminar is $950, or $2400 if all three are purchased as a package.What's New in the Community Continued from page 13 Continued on page 16Selow describes the Guide as a self-help book, but says, \"There's no book out there that can help you live your life.\" In effect, through the book's exercises, readers write their own manual for living the life they want. [Rowe] owned a horse that she says had \"very special needs,\" and her teacher offered healing to the horse, which improved immensely.

Michael Peters, a green business entrepreneur and artist, has been creating dance meditation events in Detroit and Ann Arbor since November 2011. These events have been an amazing blend of meditation, dance, food, music, painting, and prayer. Until now, the events have been monthly; currently, Peters is making some changes. The general progress of a dance meditation evening begins with 15 minutes of a shaking, shouting catharsis. Live drummers play, but not in rhythm; they just make noise to add to the general energy release. Next, a variety of devotional world music is played and the dancing begins. The social contract of the participants during this time is to focus on the self \u2014 not looking at the others or dancing with them, which allows for privacy even in a group setting and the ability to reach inward, releasing psychic tension. Dancing lasts for an hour and a half. Also during this time, live painters create their vision of the angelic by channeling their energy into their paintings. Afterward, a 15-minute mediation helps participants calm and ground themselves. Finally, a motivational speaker talks, food and drinks are served, and participants socialize with one another. There is often live music to which people can dance individually or with others, and the paintings that were created during the dancing are on display. Despite the high attendance, with 40-50 people attending each event, Peters says the monthly meditations were getting hard to sustain. The new plan is to hold weekly, stripped-down meditations in Ann Arbor and Detroit consisting only of the catharsis, dancing, and closing meditation as a two-hour pay-what-you-can class. Details on times and locations will be announced on Peters's website, ImagineDoTV.com, as soon as they are available. Quarterly, a larger event called the Temple of Devotion will be held, with food, painting, speakers, live music, and a general high-energy atmosphere that will go late into the night. The first of these events will be held at Concourse Hall in Ann Arbor on Friday, December 21, 2012. The intention of the creation of the paintings is to make energized images for a purpose. Peters explains that the resulting paintings will be \"sold\" to bidders and then installed in needed areas of Detroit. The buyers are, in effect, sponsoring the paintings' installation and, along with the public, will be able to visit the installed paintings, to charge them with energy and prayer. Peters says that these events are about \"transforming tension into creativity.\" The dancing is not intended to be impressive or sexy, but authentic. He says that in choosing clothing to wear, dancers should go with comfort above all else. But modesty is important, too, as each dancer should be drawn inward and not distracted by other dancers during the dance meditation. More details on the weekly classes and on the quarterly Temple of Devotion events will be available on ImagineDoTV.com. Michael Peters can be contacted at admin@imaginedotv.com. New Classes Paulette Grotrian completed the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) teacher training at the University of Massachusetts Medical School Center for Mindfulness in 2011, and will teach two courses on meditation and MBSR this fall. At the Aprill Wellness Center in Ann Arbor, Grotrian will offer an eight-week \"immersion course\" in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. She describes the course as a way to break the cycle of distress, which is the result of stress and which can cause chronic illness such as anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, insomnia, and cardiac problems. Students will learn coping techniques and begin a personal meditation practice. The class will meet once weekly on Wednesdays from 3:30-5:30 p.m. beginning September 26 and will include a one-day retreat at the Matthaei Botanical Gardens for a day of relaxation in the beauty of nature. A free information and orientation session will be held on Wednesday, September 19 at 3:30 p.m. The course cost is $330, with a sliding scale available for those in need. At the Chelsea Wellness Center, Grotrian will offer an eight-week course in two parts: Introduction to Meditation and Deepening Meditation. These courses will be offered weekly on Mondays beginning on September 10. The cost is $80 for the first four weeks, $100 for the second four weeks. Grotrian is Professor Emeritus in Interpersonal Communication at Washtenaw Community College and has been practicing meditation since the 1990s.

This will be Blue Lotus's second program of this type; the first was completed in February 2012. The program is led by Michelle Tupko, Kelly Kempter, and Tanya Thunberg. Tupko began her studies of Thai Bodywork in 2004 with Chuck Duff in Evanston, IL and continued her studies with Paul Fowler and Paul Weitz at Blue Lotus Thai Healing Studies in Chicago. She has spent much of the past three years living, studying, and teaching in Thailand, primarily with Master Pichest Boonthumme. Kempter first studied Thai Massage in 2003 with Randy Fillion and furthered her studies in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in 2008. Nationally certified as a massage therapist and bodyworker, she practices at her own studio, Kaizen Healing Arts, in downtown Ann Arbor. Thunberg is a Licensed Master Social Worker, Registered Yoga Teacher, Thai Yoga Bodyworker, and experiential educator. She owns Spirit Moves, a private healing arts practice in Ann Arbor. Tanya also studies partner yoga, contact improvisation, and devotional singing, which greatly influence her Thai Yoga Healing practice. Thai Bodywork differs from western bodywork in that it incorporates the manipulation of the \"energy body\" as well as the physical body. Therapists use hands, elbows, forearms, and even knees and feet to deliver techniques, and massage is performed while the receiver is fully clothed and at first lying down, then sitting on the floor. The therapist moves the receiver through a number of different positions in the course of the bodywork, making it seem almost dance-like, according to Tupko. Tupko emphasizes that the Blue Lotus program teaches not only Thai Bodywork but also uses meditation, breathwork and other self-care and self-understanding techniques that improve the health and well being of the practitioner, while increasing their ability to provide this type of treatment effectively. The idea that the practitioner receives much through the practice, and that there should never be a compromise of the practitioner's health in the service of the practice, is tantamount.

New Practitioners and Businesses Local resident Nancy Dargan has opened System Designed Solutions, a grant-writing business that serves organizations with goals involving \"giving back to humanity.\" Dargan retired from the University of Michigan in 2006, having gained over 20 years of experience in grant writing. For a few years, she used her time to care for her grandchildren, but eventually she felt the children needed the interaction of other kids through day care, and that she needed something fulfilling to keep herself occupied. Not just any job would do, and Dargan wanted to use her considerable experience and skills to do something she was passionate about. Dargan explains that her retainer fee is very low and, if a grant is made, she requests only a small finder's fee. When choosing which projects to accept, she says she lets \"my heart, my karma, my inner self decide.\"One favorite project has been a domestic violence grant, which helped fund a program in which victims of spousal abuse who end up in women's shelters can make use of an attorney who stands ready to process a very quick divorce in as little as a week. Another grant funded suspended walkways in a summer camp for handicapped children. Because of the walkways, the children can explore much more of the beautiful wetland areas. Dargan works mainly with non-profit organizations, but will consider working with for-profit businesses if they provide something she feels that people need, such as the arts, humor, or massage therapy. She is also putting together a curriculum for teaching others to write grants, which she says will be ready in fall 2012 or winter 2013. Nancy Dargan can be reached by email at nancy.dargan@yahoo.com or by phone between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. at (734) 891-0566. Holistic medical practitioner Joel Robbins opened Nourishing Life Wellness above the People's Food Co-op in downtown Ann Arbor in June. The practice specializes in customized herbal formulas, supported with acupuncture, medical massage, Chinese nutritional consultation, and therapeutic exercise. Robbins holds a master's degree in Chinese medicine from the Seattle Institute of Oriental Medicine and a bachelor's degree in clinical nutrition from Bastyr University. He is also a Registered Acupuncturist and a certified instructor of the energy arts taiji, bagua, and qigong. Robbins says his journey in natural medicine began while he attended Community High School in Ann Arbor in the 1990s, where he took taiji classes. He also attended classes in wild edible and medicinal plants at Matthaei Botanical Gardens. He says he has always been interested in \"what people can do to take care of their own life; their own sense of well-being.\"What's New in the Community Continued from page 16 Thai Bodywork differs from western bodywork in that it incorporates the manipulation of the \"energy body\" as well as the physical body...Massage is performed while the receiver is fully clothed and at first lying down, then sitting on the floor.Tanya Thunberg, Michelle Tupko, and, Kelly Kempter One favorite project [of Dargan's] has been a domestic violence grant, which helped fund a program in which victims of spousal abuse who end up in women's shelters can make use of an attorney who stands ready to process a very quick divorce in as little as a week.Nancy Dargan One unique aspect of the practice is Robbins's new community acupuncture clinic concept...

Debra Metler, responding to the need for a non-toxic deodorant, has created Sweet Sweat LLC. Sweet Sweat is a chemical-free, unscented, gluten-free deodorant that Metler has found to be more effective than anything else currently available. Metler explains that she had been re-applying regular deodorant up to three times a day and still having problems with odor. Concerned with the possible toxic and carcinogenic effects of aluminum and chemicals found in deodorants, as well as their ineffectiveness, she began searching for an alternative. One \"natural\" alternative Metler found was crystal deodorants and sprays but, upon further research, she discovered that the \"natural mineral salts\" used in these products actually contain bauxite ore \u2014 the main source of aluminum. Since aluminum has been linked to breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease, with aluminum being detected in the breast tissue of cancer patients, Metler found this alternative unacceptable. Other \"natural\" deodorants contained preservatives, fragrances, and other chemicals. Metler scoured the Internet for solutions and began formulating her own deodorant, finally coming up with a simple recipe consisting of just a few natural ingredients: arrowroot powder, baking soda, cocoa butter, beeswax, and coconut oil.One \"natural\" alternative Metler found was crystal deodorants and sprays but, upon further research, she discovered that the \"natural mineral salts\" used in these products actually contain bauxite ore \u2014 the main source of aluminum.

Metler found this alternative unacceptable.Robbins often helps patients who are dissatisfied with their current medical treatment or want to avoid drugs or surgery by trying traditional medicinal methods first. As an example of alternative treatments, he described a non-invasive treatment to get a breech baby to turn over for delivery involving placing a hot coal near the mother's pinky toe. This method is not painful or damaging, and can be much more palatable than a painful manual manipulation of the baby. One unique aspect of the practice is Robbins's new community acupuncture clinic concept. Private acupuncture is more expensive than many can afford; but by putting several people in the same room (with draping for privacy as needed), Robbins can work on two to four people at one time, lowering each person's cost for treatment. This type of treatment carries a sliding scale of just $20-$40. Nourishing Life Wellness maintains an extensive herbal dispensary, which includes local wildcrafted herbs. Robbins says that many conditions can be treated with herbs, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, menstrual problems, allergies, high blood pressure, digestive problems, infertility, colds and flu, and more. Nourishing Life Wellness is located above the People's Food Co-op at 218 N. Fourth Ave., Suite #212, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. Joel Robbins can be reached at (734) 315-0573 or at NourishingLifeWellness@gmail.com. Having moved back to her hometown of Ann Arbor after living in California, Emily Presley has brought her practice, Heirloom Healing Arts, with her. The practice consists of one-on-one massage and energy healing, along with workshops on trauma healing and stress release. Presley holds a bachelor's degree in neuroscience and religion as well as certifications in energy healing, massage, and trauma healing. She is trained in craniosacral therapy and Reiki, and integrates a number of techniques into her bodywork. Heirloom, Presley explains, carries implications of humanity's collective roots, traditions, and knowledge \u2014 our species' valuable inheritance. The stress and trauma relief techniques she teaches are a part of this legacy. Presley is certified through Capacitar International, an organization that trains practitioners in a program of energy-based healing practices. She says that the techniques are easy to learn and immediately applicable to people's lives.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 19 Emily Presley Continued on page 20 Free e-book Free Raw Food Chef John classes at Crazy Wisdom Sept 18, Oct 16 and Nov 20 An unscented product, Sweet Sweat can be used by men and women and won't clash with other scents a user might wear. \"You want to stand out, not your armpits,\" says Metler. Sweet Sweat does not prevent sweating (commercial deodorants use aluminum to literally clog the sweat glands to achieve this goal, with some effectiveness), but Metler says she has noticed some decrease in sweat with use of the product. She notes that the body needs to sweat and interference with this natural process is likely harmful in itself. Metler says she now only applies a small amount of Sweet Sweat once daily and never has problems with odor any more. She also doesn't have to worry about \"slathering her armpits with toxic chemicals,\" either. Sweet Sweat's slogan is \"Saving the world two armpits at a time,\" and Metler is passionate about making her safe, effective, and needed product available to as many people as possible. Currently, Metler makes the deodorants herself at home. A few natural health stores in California, New York, and Kalamazoo carry it, and more are planned in the future. A recent breakthrough in the formula eliminated melting of the product at high temperatures, thus increasing its shelf life stability and shipping ability. Metler currently works as a substitute teacher, and looks forward to being able to make Sweet Sweat her full-time work. Sweet Sweat can be ordered online at sweetsweat.webs.com. Debra Metler can be contacted at debmetler@gmail.com. Laura McCurdy, local Reiki practitioner, started Ann Arbor Reiki in April 2012. McCurdy has been practicing Reiki for approximately 10 years. She became certified through Level 3 with the late Ray Golden of Ann Arbor. She then took Reiki Master training in April with Lisa Guyman, who resides in Colorado. McCurdy explains, \"I was introduced to Reiki when I was pregnant with my second child. During the pregnancy, my hormones were way off and I was depressed. The doctors wanted to put me on an antidepressant, but I refused.\" A friend recommended Reiki. McCurdy knew nothing about it, but was \"willing to try anything.\" She says, \"It was the only thing that got me through. I released so much during the pregnancy on an emotional level. I went a couple times a week and was happily surprised and impressed by the results.\" After her child was born, McCurdy \"immediately\" started going to Golden's Open Reiki Share nights and then took training over the years. McCurdy started by working on friends and family. They, and her other clients, have reported great healing results. \"I've worked on my father recently, who said he could not only feel the energy, but the arthritis in his back is gone. My 13-year-old son has had some heart problems, as well as baseball and hockey injuries, to the point where he would not be able to play the next day. When I have worked on him, he was able to play every time,\" McCurdy says. \"I am currently working with a client to help him get off his antidepressants,\" McCurdy shares. \"So far, he has been successful with the help of Reiki, nutrition, exercise, and vitamins.\" (She also sells Shaklee vitamins, if a client is interested.) \"He would get terrible migraines that Reiki helped, as well as did working through the anger and emotional part of it.\" McCurdy explains that she uses affirmations (positive statements) on various parts of the body during the Reiki session. \"When someone has physical pain, I always go to my 'second bible': the Louise Hay book, You Can Heal Your Life. I incorporate her affirmations into the Reiki session, allowing the person to heal physically and emotionally.\" She also asks to work with one's angels and guides during the session, to bring in more healing energy. Sometimes McCurdy acquires intuitive information during the process as well, which she'll share with the client. Before and after each session, McCurdy also offers clients the opportunity to choose an angel card for a short reading. \"It usually speaks to them and can aid in the healing as well,\" she says. McCurdy also has experience with helping people through divorce and abandonment, and will email the client to provide support when they are going through an emotional time.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 20 What's New in the Community Continued from page 19\"The one thing I love about Reiki is that it helps clear our blocks that prevent us from moving forward in life. It's like peeling the layer of an onion,\" McCurdy states. \"I've had adults cry on my table. This is why I work out of my home \u2014 to provide a safe, loving environment for my clients, to allow the healing in.\" Laura McCurdy works with clients in her home in Ann Arbor and can be reached at lauramccurdy@yahoo.com or (734) 660-4200.Erin Stohl, LLMSW, launched her website and holistic psychotherapy and healing practice, The Illuminated Heart, in June 2012 . Stohl's approach to healing involves a combination of traditional psychotherapy with a variety of holistic, embodied, and mindfulness-based practices. She says, \"I believe that healing happens when we shine the light of love on the darkest places within, revealing the truth that we are all whole, perfect, and complete just as we are.\" The Illuminated Heart incorporates psychodynamic, cognitive, transpersonal, somatic, mindfulness, and sound therapies. Stohl also offers energy work, nutrition information, and spiritual guidance for individuals interested in those forms of support. Stohl has had training in homeopathy and recognizes the connection of the physical body to the mind and spirit as part of a whole that must be addressed for healing to occur \u2014 which is why, in addition to psychotherapy, she uses body-based trauma release techniques. She is particularly interested in helping women to heal from trauma and abuse and to fully stand in their power. Stohl has office spaces in Ann Arbor, Plymouth, Canton, and Royal Oak. Her website is at www.illuminatedheart.net and she can be reached at lovewithinall@gmail.com or (313) 942-5586. Angela Gorman, holistic health expert, recently opened Sacred Body, Ann Arbor's first \"Yoga-by-Donation\" studio. Sacred Body offers multiple styles of yoga, dance, movement, and meditation classes, at various times throughout the day, seven days a week. There is a suggested donation of $10 to $20 per class, \"remembering that one gets out of life what they put into it, but no one is turned away!\" Gorman explains, \"Donation-based yoga cultivates profound self-awareness and a unity vibration that allows you to truly honor your teacher as an extension of yourself. In this way, we return to the original yogi traditions.\" The teachers at Sacred Body range from serious to fun and fanciful. Many teachers also offer private sessions and their own form of bodywork or healing. There is also a \"by-donation\" community meeting room with various weekly or bi- monthly classes in nutritional healing, cancer recovery, and more. Sacred Body holds workshops and retreats hosted by guest practitioners as well. Sacred Body's favorite on-going monthly events are the Reiki and Beyond Gatherings hosted by Marianne Carduner and the Full Moon Kirtan Jam Party around the full moon, with Trevor Eller and many guest musicians from the Ann Arbor Kirtan band.

Robert Kropf , CBT, CMT 734-660-4131 holisticbodytherapies.com The intricate enteric nervous system responds to changes in neurotransmitters like serotonin, a chemical that affects mood and sleep. Although serotonin affects the mind, and is targeted by some types of anti-depressants, the majority of serotonin is produced in the gut and is essential for digestive function. Because of the relationship between intestinal health and mood, treating the gut is crucial for improving mental health. Through optimizing digestion, consuming live fermented foods or supplementing probiotics, and identifying and avoiding food sensitivities, intestinal health can be restored and maintained. Aside from avoidance of food sensitivities, patients with depression or anxiety are advised to restrict \"bad mood\" foods like sugar, caffeine, and alcohol. A naturopathic plan includes individualized nutritional recommendations, which may vary based on tolerance of complex carbohydrates and other dietary components. Generally, a whole food diet is recommended, with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, and adequate protein. Neurotransmitters are built from the amino acids in proteins, so ensuring optimal protein intake and digestion is foundational, and therapeutic doses of single amino acids can be supplemented for mood support. A naturopathic approach to mental health includes assessment of underlying factors contributing to depression and anxiety, removing obstacles, and supporting the body's innate healing capacity. The foundation of this approach is in addressing imbalances using nutrition and lifestyle modifications like stress management, exercise, and time spent in nature. Holistic therapies such as bodywork, homeopathy, herbal and nutritional medicine, psychotherapy, and yoga aid in enhancing the vis medicatrix naturae, to restore harmony in the body, mind, and spirit. Diana Quinn ND is a licensed naturopathic physician who sees patients in Ann Arbor at Hygeia Center for Healing Arts, 220 N. Fifth Avenue, (734) 769-6100, and at Beaumont Hospital Integrative Medicine in Royal Oak, (248) 551-9888.Sustainable Health By Diana Quinn, ND Naturopathic medicine is a holistic and integrative approach to healing the body, mind, and spirit. By inviting the whole self to the process and acknowledging the integrity of the whole being, not falsely dividing the body/mind into separate and unrelated organ systems, a space is held for opening to inherent healing wisdom. In naturopathic medicine, this wisdom is called the vis medicatrix naturae, the healing power of nature. It is this innate capacity within each being that allows for healing to unfold, a process that can be enhanced by removing obstacles and aiding healing through lifestyle, nutrition, herbal medicine and homeopathy, and mind-body therapies. Often, I see patients who come with a specific physical complaint for which they want help and, as they tell me their stories, I learn that there is accompanying mental, emotional, or spiritual disharmony. For example, a patient with heart disease struggles with feeling down and irritable, or a perimenopausal woman has night sweats, a racing heart, and panicky feelings that interfere with her sleep. I also have many patients for whom a mental health diagnosis is the primary reason for their visit, and they are looking for natural medicine options to manage their problem. In both cases, natural medicine provides many options that can provide great relief. Symptoms of depression can manifest differently in men, women, and children, but may present as sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, or irritability. Many people experience a change in appetite or sleep patterns, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. Physical symptoms like aches and pains or digestive complaints are common as well, and people who have depression along with other illnesses tend to have more severe symptoms of both the depression and the illness. Fortunately, treating the depression can also improve the outcome of the co-occurring illness. Generalized anxiety often presents as fearfulness or uncertainty, worry, or agitation, as well as physical symptoms like a pounding heart, tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Because many of the symptoms of anxiety are physical, people suffering with anxiety may fear there is a serious physical condition. While fear of unexplained physical symptoms is a hallmark of anxiety, it is important to rule out physical illness, such as thyroid disorder and cardiovascular disease. Many metabolic and endocrine imbalances contribute to and worsen mental health conditions, so a comprehensive workup to address underlying physiologic issues is necessary. Hormones, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters communicate information throughout the body, and subtle shifts can produce significant physical, mental, and emotional effects. Transient changes in mood quickly change the internal physical environment, and vice versa, via these messengers. The patient's symptom picture can reveal much about the orchestra of hormones and neurotransmitters, and lab testing can provide a further window to the internal environment. A full workup may include a complete thyroid panel and measurements of sex hormones, the adrenal hormones cortisol and DHEA, and neurotransmitters and their metabolites. Nutritional influences may also contribute to psychological dis-ease, and these can be assessed through routine blood work and with functional medicine assessment like micronutrient testing. Several nutrients are critical for maintaining optimal neurological health and mood, including omega 3 fatty acids, B vitamins, magnesium, and vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent and contributes to many chronic physical illnesses, as well as depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder. Most people living in Michigan could benefit from regular supplementation of vitamin D, but lab testing may be needed to detect deficiencies requiring higher doses of supplementation. Naturopathic medicine has long espoused the connection between digestive health and overall wellness, and today a growing body of evidence is demonstrating the connection between the microflora environment in the gut and physical and psychological ailments. The gut is often referred to as the \"second brain\" because it is rich with its own nerve supply, called the enteric nervous system.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 22 By inviting the whole self to the process and acknowledging the integrity of the whole being, not falsely dividing the body/mind into separate and unrelated organ systems, a space is held for opening to inherent healing wisdom.

In Ann Arbor, one of the places you can go for help in making positive changes in your environment is Bgreen Today, located in the former Hollywood Video space on Packard Street. \"Our primary objective is to sell products that are sensitive to our environment and contribute in some way to reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses that are released into the atmosphere,\" owners Daniel and Delphine Stephens explain on their website. Daniel and Delphine have been residents of Ann Arbor for the last 20 years. Daniel originally hails from Cincinnati, Ohio, where his parents were both professors at the University of Cincinnati until 1973, when his father was fired from the university because of his opposition to the Vietnam War. He then took a post at Bowling Green State University, and the family made frequent trips into Ann Arbor to browse the many bookstores. His mother is also a published writer, primarily of fiction, but also of a couple of biographical works.Delphine is originally from Switzerland, but her background and heritage are too diverse to explain in such a short space. She and Daniel met in Managua, Nicaragua, in 1994, during the time when the Sandinistas lost control of the government. Daniel was working as an accountant with Witness for Peace, which was involved in getting funding to the Contras stopped. They made their way to Michigan when they began selling a line of wool sweaters at Ethnic Creations stores. \"We realized that the colder the climate, the more sweaters we sold,\" Daniel explained. \"So, we are definite transplants to the community, and I fully intend to transplant again when our son graduates from high school \u2014 and to a warmer climate, like the Caribbean!\" They might be transplants, but they've put down some solid roots in the community and are firmly devoted to making the local and global community a better place to live. Bgreen has two sides: one side is dedicated to wholesale restaurant supplies, while the other side is dedicated to retail building supplies. The two fit together nicely, because they are both focused on energy efficiency and reducing consumption. Daniel cut his teeth in his early twenties with companies such as Co-Op America, which was strong on socially responsible issues. He firmly believed in the ideals he'd learned and cultivated through these companies. So when he and Delphine opened [their first business], they did so with the goal of selling the most natural products possible, made as cooperatively as possible. These same ideals resonate in Bgreen Today. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 25 Bgreen Today opened its doors on January 1, 2008, after Daniel and Delphine had spent 15 years owning Ethnic Creations and Kayu Furniture, a chain of women's clothing and furniture stores. They closed all but one store, due to the steady decline of the Michigan economy. (They still have one Ethnic Creations store operating in Petoskey.) Daniel cut his teeth in his early twenties with companies such as Co-Op America, which was strong on socially responsible issues. He firmly believed in the ideals he'd learned and cultivated through these companies. So when he and Delphine opened Ethnic Creations and Kayu Furniture, they did so with the goal of selling the most natural products possible, made as cooperatively as possible. These same ideals resonate in Bgreen Today. \"We wanted to stay in retail after closing Ethnic Creations and Kayu Furniture,\" Daniel said. \"We had the overhead covered and we had the storefront; all we needed was the product to fill the space.\" Like the former business, Bgreen has two sides: one side is dedicated to wholesale restaurant supplies, while the other side is dedicated to retail building supplies. The two fit together nicely, because they are both focused on energy efficiency and reducing consumption. On the restaurant supply side, all of the products they sell are 100% biodegradable and compostable, which helps reduce landfill consumption. Consumer choices include bioplastic products made from corn polylactide acid and food containers that are made from sugar cane and bamboo. \"We would like to see the complete elimination of polyethylene and polystyrene from the food consumption chain,\" Daniel said. \"Polystyrene is known to leach styrene and benzene into hot food that comes in contact with the polystyrene. Benzene and styrene are known carcinogens.\" Most food containers from popular food chains are made from polystyrene, commonly referred to as Styrofoam. Bgreen Today carries products to replace all of those used in the food packaging and distribution chain. Additionally, Bgreen carries a line of cleaning products that contain no harmful toxins like bleach, chlorine, or cyanide, while using as many natural ingredients as possible. This Greening the Cleaning\u00ae line consists of laundry detergents, floor cleaners, bathroom cleaners, and dishwashing detergents, and is developed and sold by the Dierdre Imus Hospital for Pediatric Oncology in Hackensack, New Jersey. \"We have thousands of customers on the restaurant supply side,\" Daniel said. \"We provide products for two-hundred-plus weddings, graduations, and office parties per year. This is one area where people can make a positive impact on the environment quickly.\" Bgreen also hosts science camps and classes, where kids can come in and be educated on \"greening\" the environment. Bgreen plans to work with the City of Ann Arbor, the University of Michigan, and the private sector on a new initiative called the Zero Waste program. The initiative works to eliminate the amount of trash going into landfills by making everything recyclable or compostable. This is a project that has been used in some Ohio universities, with a good deal of success. On the building materials side, the focus is on indoor air quality, and offering materials that are as low as possible in formaldehyde and methane, which are volatile organic compounds. Commercial paints and stains are the worst offenders for emitting such gasses long after they have dried. Bgreen carries the AFM line of paints and stains, which is VOC-free or low-VOC, and has no toxins at all. \"The paint also creates a safe-coat that seals in the compounds to eliminate the release of toxins.\" With building supplies, Daniel and Delphine take the idea of \"green\" much further than energy-efficient lighting. There's flooring, cabinetry and countertops, wood-burning stoves, and high efficiency toilets. \"Your level of 'green' depends on the product,\" Daniel reminded us. \"A marble countertop is a marble countertop and can only be so green. It's going to emit gasses and toxins throughout its lifetime. Flooring is only as sustainable as the wood or other product used to make it. Our wood flooring meets the Forestry Standard Council's requirement, which is a standard for how wood products are made. And did you know that linoleum is 85 percent linseed oil and is a wonderful alternative to vinyl?\" Considering that their previous business was selling two different types of merchandise, and that \"green\" building and renovating is still a rather new concept, it's admirable that Daniel and Delphine chose to forge ahead on a new path in this economy. But both are extremely passionate about what they do, and that may make all the difference. With their restaurant supply business increasing, they feel they can wait for the building/home improvement side to slowly catch on. The reality is that Bgreen Today often serves to simply educate people. As discussions of greening the environment and ensuring sustainability continue, expand, and improve, more and more people will begin to green their own environments, and that will have a resounding impact on the global community. \"Some customers come in to be educated and to find out what their options are,\" Daniel said. \"That's okay, it's our job to help consumers realize that they do have choices.\"The biggest factor in choosing to remain with an older, less eco-friendly way of living is economic. It's cheaper to lay vinyl flooring or to use paints that will leak toxins over the years. \"It's really a question of cost versus health,\" Daniel said. \"My question to the consumer, then, is: How do you put a cost on the health and well-being of your children?\" On the building materials side, the focus is on indoor air quality, and offering materials that are as low as possible in formaldehyde and methane, which are volatile organic compounds. Commercial paints and stains are the worst offenders for emitting such gasses long after they have dried.

It was the worst possible time to open a business, because of the economy and because Sandy hadn't been in Ann Arbor long enough; nobody knew her or knew anything about her. It was a high-risk business venture, to be sure, but for Sandy it was worth the risk, because it allowed her to help so many people. Originally from the Washtenaw County area, Lisa Wiley studied at Eastern Michigan University and earned her degree in occupational therapy in 2001. She worked alongside Sandy at St. Joseph's Hospital in Ypsilanti, before Sandy opened Healing In Motion. Then Lisa came on board at Healing In Motion in the fall of 2009. So when Sandy had to give up the business because her husband, an Army man, was given a different assignment that took them out of state, it only made sense to pass the business on to Lisa, who purchased it in 2010. Lisa became a certified hand therapist in 2008 and, shortly after, attended two myofascial release classes. \"I suffered from back pain,\" Lisa said. \"It wasn't horrible, just more annoying than anything. But, after only two days of hands-on work in the myofascial class, my back pain was gone.\" She was convinced of the validity of the treatment and went on to do extensive training in myofascial release through the John Barnes Myofascial Release Institute in 2009. The Healing In Motion Center specializes in issues that other therapy centers don't want to, or are unequipped to, deal with. Some of these issues include bowel and bladder function, sexual dysfunction, and menstrual and pelvic pain, as well as TMJ Leaps of Faith: Tales of Newer Local Businesses Continued from page 25 syndrome, migraines, and fibromyalgia and chronic pain. The clinic also specializes in recovery from breast cancer and other inflammatory issues, through the use of lymphodema techniques. The clinic offers occupational, physical, and massage therapy services, and all of their therapists are extensively trained in myofascial release. \"Most people think of occupational therapy as being simply job-related therapy,\" Lisa said. \"But it's also about how you occupy your time. It's about making self-care a part of your everyday life. I like to think of it as the old American Occupational Therapy Association slogan: 'Skills for the Job of Living'.\" People seem to understand physical therapy better or differently, and sometimes give it more validity than occupational therapy. \"Physical therapists and occupational therapists can work from the same diagnosis,\" Lisa explained. \"We just approach it differently and from different aspects.\" \"A lot of people who come here have tried many treatments and surgeries, only to still have the same pain or more,\" Lisa said. \"They come here last and find out that what we do helps. Since it's a whole-body treatment, we look for the problem, rather than just the symptoms. Looking and listening to the body is what we do. Our fascia is consciousness and our consciousness flows through our fascia. People find that, after treatment, they feel better both physically and mentally. This is thought to be due to the releasing of stress we hold in our bodies.\" Two or three years ago, I was working on several articles that had to do with alternative modes of healing and was able to experience the work that Lisa and the staff at Healing In Motion perform. This was during a time in which I was between shoulder surgeries. While not experiencing a great deal of pain, I found that (in comparison to post-therapy), my body had experienced more pain on a daily basis than I'd realized. After the treatment at Healing In Motion, my body was much more limber and seemed able to move with a fluidity I hadn't really experienced since I was much younger. My entire body \u2014 muscles, bones, and all \u2014 felt enlarged and expanded; it felt like they could truly breathe. Sandy and Lisa both explained that this was what your body is supposed to feel like every day. \"We all feel compelled and passionate about what we offer here,\" Lisa said. \"I think the work we do is important and worthwhile. To see the transformations in the lives of the people who come here is amazing. When they have that 'ah ha' moment when they understand that they can feel better, move better, and have some control over a \"Most people think of occupational therapy as being simply job- related therapy,\" Lisa said. \"But it's also about how you occupy your time. It's about making self-care a part of your everyday life. I like to think of it as the old American Occupational Therapy Association slogan: 'Skills for the Job of Living'.\"\"To see the transformations in the lives of the people who come here is amazing. When they have that 'ah ha' moment when they understand that they can feel better, move better, and have some control over a once 'unruly' body when it comes to pain and dysfunction \u2014 that's the amazing part for us.\" once 'unruly' body when it comes to pain and dysfunction \u2014 that's the amazing part for us. When patients come in and tell me that something was bothering them and that they did their self-treatment \u2014 or, as one patient calls it, 'self-soothing' \u2014 and the condition improved, that's not only encouraging, it's empowering!\" Because the clinic operates on an out-of-network basis, meaning you pay out of pocket for services rendered, a patient gets to spend the entire hour with their therapist, unlike other physical therapy facilities, where the therapists are so overbooked that you get about half that time. However, it's not Lisa's desire to keep a patient coming back for several months or more. \"My hope is that, along with the treatment they receive here, my patients will learn self-care, rather than spending months of their lives in therapy.\" Also, because the clinic is pay-for-service based, some of their business has dropped off over the last couple of years. Much of that is due to the economy. It's a tough time right now to spend the extra money in such a tight economy, especially here in Michigan. \"What we do here really does work,\" Lisa said. \"It's worthwhile and it's a non- traditional form of therapy, so it's a perceived value. If you're willing to be inconvenienced upfront, it's worth it. In the words of John Barnes, 'The worst that can happen is nothing.' It won't hurt you, but it could help. The question people must ask themselves is: Are you worth it? When feeling good becomes fashionable again, I'll be in just the right place.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 27 \"Since it's a whole-body treatment, we look for the problem, rather than just the symptoms. Looking and listening to the body is what we do. Our fascia is consciousness and our consciousness flows through our fascia. People find that, after treatment, they feel better both physically and mentally.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 28 By Aura Glaser Years ago I came across this quote by Saraha, one of the great forerunners of Buddhist Tantra: \"All the sacred places in the world are in my body, and the most profound pilgrimage I can ever make is in my own body.\" This understanding that our body is a place of pilgrimage and discovery, that our body might actually be a wise and trustworthy teacher on our spiritual journey, resonated deeply. It sparked a personal process of exploration into the relationship between embodiment and awakening. The Tantric vision of life is a revolutionary and radically positive life-embracing vision \u2014 the whole of reality is an expression of the Divine. The world is not divided into \"higher\" and \"lower,\" \"pure\" and \"impure,\" \"spirit\" and \"matter\"; the world is one piece, undivided, and sacred in its entirety. Everything we need in order to be whole and awake is within us at this very moment. Too often we engage in spiritual practice as a way to free ourselves from the messiness of ordinary human experience. We imagine that spiritual awakening is something separate from and other than life itself, when, in fact, the deeper we enter life, the more spiritual we become. The root and essence of our nature is spiritual \u2014 to become a full human being is also to spiritually awaken. When we hear about \"meditation,\" \"mindfulness,\" and \"mind-training,\" we may assume this means working with our minds alone. This assumption may also inform our understanding of enlightenment, of spiritual awakening. Nothing could be further from the way it really is. If meditation, mindfulness, and mind-training are to be effective and transformative, they must be whole-being endeavors. They need to include our whole body and all of its levels. When we open to the body, we begin to directly experience that this physical, solid body of bones, organs, and flesh is actually an overlay. We see that the apparently solid body is a continuous flow of sensations. At a deeper level, we enter the body and experience a flow of pure energy. And at an even more subtle level, we experience the body as space. We can begin to work with the body in this most simple way \u2014 sit upright and feel your inner alignment; pay attention and notice where you are tight and then gently relax; breathe into your body and notice sensations and feelings; inhabit any part of your body and find a place of ease. Descending into the sense field naturally opens your awareness further. At first it may feel like we are putting our awareness into the body. Over time we realize that we are attuning to the awareness that is already there. The more we bring our attention to the body, the more we come to know that this very body that we were born with is at the heart of the mystery of human life \u2014 it is at the heart of spiritual life. We live in a body-obsessed culture but our fixation is with the surface. We're consumed with the appearance of things. How we look, how thin, how fat, how youthful, how old, how fit. Our bodies do our bidding, but we don't actually inhabit them. Living on the surface keeps us feeling chronically cut off, fragmented, dislocated, disconnected. It keeps us from ourselves. My awareness of our collective disembodiment goes back thirty years to my experience of returning to the United States after travelling overland through central Asia (with dear friend and intrepid travel companion, Sandy Finkel), and after living for two years on the Indian subcontinent. Landing in New York City jolted me with the culture shock of the tall skyscraping buildings, fruit and vegetables that looked unnaturally large, the intense buzz of modern-life busyness, and a general sense of everything feeling speedy and threaded with agitation. I recall walking down Fifth Avenue, in my best Indian clothing and flip-flops, seeing the beautifully coiffed and fashionably dressed. I sensed a palpable undercurrent of unhappiness, a flatness, sadness, and stress that was so visceral it stunned me. I had been living in a place teeming with poverty \u2014 beggars lining the streets and railway stations, lepers sitting on doorsteps, cows and water buffalos wandering about, open sewers flowing by the roadsides, and families living in cardboard box homes on traffic islands. And yet, amidst all the rawness was a seamlessness to life, a feeling-presence and vitality that was notably absent on the streets of New York. Beyond the clear and immediate realization that wealth, comfort, and modern conveniences don't generate happiness, I came to a more gradual awareness that I was witnessing the painful consequence of our collective disembodiment. Living so much in our heads and in our thoughts about things cuts us off from the substance and fullness of life. It has been a personal journey to understand the impact that this disembodiment has on our sense of connectedness and well-being, and the way it impedes a process of spiritual awakening. In traditional cultures people didn't lose connection to their body sense. They stayed connected. And from that base of connection, they could open into deeper and subtler levels of consciousness and embodiment. As modern people we face a unique challenge \u2014 we are attempting to awaken while in a disembodied state. This simply won't work. Yet we are so conditioned to the flow of this habit that even those of us who intuitively grasp the dilemma can still find ourselves caught in its current. The modern world privileges the conceptual mind to such a degree that for many it is the only valid and reliable source of knowledge. Other ways of knowing, such as intuition, sensation, feelings, or dreams, are considered inferior. But when we talk about awakening and embodiment from the point of view of the world's wisdom traditions, this view is reversed. The conceptual mind, while important and necessary, is considered an indirect source of knowing. From a wisdom-mind perspective, concepts are not the way things are; they are abstractions pointing to our direct experience. Reality itself can never be fully known or communicated through words and concepts. It is through non-conceptual awareness alone that we are able to directly experience the mind's openness. As it says in the opening lines of the Tao Te Ching , \"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The unnamable is the eternally real.\" Our conceptual mind is like the menu at a restaurant and the direct experience is like the meal. There's a big difference between reading the menu \u2014 no matter how mouthwatering \u2014 and actually eating the meal. Our hunger will never be satisfied by reading a pile of menus! A wonderful story in the Zen tradition illustrates this distinction between direct and indirect knowing. A dedicated young practitioner arrives for an audience with his teacher. His teacher looks at him and asks, \"Tell me, what is the basic human problem?\" The student thinks for a moment and says, \"The basic human problem is that we're not awake.\" The teacher responds, \"Well, yes, but that is just a thought.\" So the student goes away, feeling a bit perplexed. A month later he returns for his next audience, when the teacher asks, \"Tell me, what is the basic human problem?\" The student, feeling more confident, replies, \"The basic human problem is that we think too much. We believe our thoughts. We take our thoughts to be reality.\" Again the teacher says, \"You are still just thinking,\" and dismisses him with the ring of a bell. Now the student is completely confused. So he does what many of us do in these situations. He reads everything he can. He reads from East to West, North to South. He really, really, wants to have the right answer. The next month he meets his teacher, feeling completely prepared when asked, \"What is the basic human problem?\" Without hesitation, he answers, \"There is no problem.\" The teacher looks at him intensely and says, \"Then what are you doing here?!\" The student crumbles in his seat. Upon seeing this, the teacher softly asks, \"What is happening right now?\" The student answers, \"I feel like a miserable failure and a fool. I just want to crawl into a hole and disappear.\" To this his teacher replies, \"Enter directly into this experience, and you will understand the basic human problem.\" What happens when we do what the teacher is suggesting? What happens when we drop the storyline, the conceptual narrative, and enter directly into the underlying energy of experience? What happens when we stop trying to figure it out, explain it to ourselves, or find someone to blame, and just feel it? However painful the emotion, be it grief or rage, loneliness or shame, the underlying energy is one shared by all humans since the beginning of time. Touching it directly, staying with it, opens our awareness and our heart. It opens our world. And in order to access this direct contact, we need to enter into the body. Touching the Earth: Embodiment and Awakening \"The deeper we enter life, the more spiritual we become.\" \"I recall walking down Fifth Avenue, in my best Indian clothing and flip-flops, seeing the beautifully coiffed and fashionably dressed. I sensed a palpable undercurrent of unhappiness, a flatness, sadness, and stress that was so visceral it stunned me.\"\"I had been living in a place teeming with poverty... And yet, amidst all the rawness was a seamlessness to life, a feeling-presence and vitality that was notably absent on the streets of New York.\" \"As modern people we face a unique challenge \u2014 we are attempting to awaken while in a disembodied state. This simply won't work.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 29 Our bodies carry deep history. We have habitually walled off experience in order to dull the impact of pain, or to fit in, or to receive approval or love. We discover in the process of working with the body that the constrictions on our awareness are not only conceptual, they are deeply cellular. Every time we prevent ourselves from feeling something our body contracts in response. For example, we can't keep ourselves from crying without tightening our throat and lungs. If we have a long history of holding back tears, or a particularly traumatic event related to this experience, our body will be frozen in these patterns of holding. As we gently release the bindings of painful memories and emotions, energy moves more freely and a vaster awareness emerges. The Buddha's early teachings were deeply somatic, grounded in sensations, feelings, emotions \u2014 the stuff of life. The first of the four foundations of mindfulness is the \"Mindfulness of the Body.\" And the later Tantric teachings considered the body the locus of enlightenment, holding and revealing interpenetrating layers of reality. In Tibetan Buddhism, awakening itself is described as the fulfillment of the three bodies of a Buddha, with each of these bodies corresponding to the full expression of a subtler dimension of awareness. Our body is an instrument of direct contact, of openness to experience. As soon as we make contact with our sense field and move out of the conceptual field, our awareness widens. Making deep inward contact with ourselves and not exiting into our opinions and judgments is also central to love of our own humanity, and by natural extension, to the love of others. Even beginning to open into the body brings a deeper sense of well-being, of relaxation. And that deeper sense of well-being and relaxation allows us to engage the conditions of our lives with much greater clarity and compassion. It deepens our sense of inner knowing. It's through this inner contact that we come to know what is true. We find the strength to live our values, to live our truth in the world. Being embodied is being undivided. We are at one with ourselves, with our emotions, with our experiences, with our entire life situation, with all of our conditions. The conceptual mind is always separated, always at a little bit of a distance. Inward contact helps heal the fragmentation between our thinking and our feeling, between body and mind, between ourselves and our world. As human beings we yearn for a direct experience of who and what we are. Most of us long from the depths of our being to drink the fresh, ever-flowing water of our true nature. We want to know and experience directly the immeasurable reality of our existence. As we touch into the earth of our body and gradually inhabit ourselves more deeply, we uncover our authentic Self and how we are one with this life \u2014 how our being is not separate from the being of the world. We come to know the free, unbound dimension of our nature and the fully human, emotional and relational being as one seamless totality. An embodied approach to spiritual awakening unfolds the uniqueness of our person and our oneness with all of life at the same time. Rest Inside Yourself: A Brief Embodiment Meditation (This meditation weaves in elements of Realization Process\u00ae, a method developed by Judith Blackstone to support embodied nondual awakening. I trained with Judith and am certified to teach Realization Process\u00ae Meditation and Subtle Self Work.) Sit upright and close your eyes. Bring your attention to your breath. Instead of following the movement of your thoughts, follow the movement of your breath. Begin to make inner contact with your body and body sensations through your breathing... Bring the breath in through both nostrils gradually expanding your inner presence. Feel your presence in your chest, your abdomen, your pelvis, your back. Feel your inner presence in the deep core of your body just in front of your spine... Expand into your legs, your feet, including your toes... Feel your presence expand into your shoulders, arms and hands, out to your fingertips... Expand your feeling presence into your neck and head... Now feel your presence inside your whole body, all at once, from the top of your head to the tips of your toes... With your eyes still closed find the space outside your body, the space in the room. Feel that the space inside your body and outside your body is the same continuous space; it pervades you. You are still inside your body but your body is pervaded by space. You are that space... Now find a place within your body where you feel at rest or at ease. It could be in your hands, in your heart, in your feet, anywhere in your body. It could be in your whole body. Wherever you feel a sense of ease, an absence of tension, let yourself rest there. Find a place of welcome in your body, a sense of home... Slowly open your eyes, while staying in contact with your body, with the feeling of ease and inner presence. ### Aura Glaser, Ph.D., is a dharma teacher and clinical psychologist integrating spiritual, psychological, and embodiment work.

It widened to a damage width of a mile and a quarter, with peak winds of up to 210 m.p.h., and leveled the town of Hackleburg. Then, destroying thousands of trees in its path, the tornado moved on toward the small town of Phil Campbell. Sandra Robinson was at home watching the television weather report in Phil Campbell. Four minutes before the tornado hit, her television went out. Her husband, Jeff, started for the door because he wanted to see the storm approach. She told him to stay inside. \"Then my ears started to pop from the sudden change in air pressure,\" he said, \"and I heard this roaring that just got louder.\" Like many of the homes here, their house was built on a cement slab. They didn't have a basement, so they ran into the laundry room near the center of the house. They lay down on the floor and braced their legs against the door, which felt like it might blow in on them. They were terrified. When it ended, Jeff opened the door and glanced to the left. \"A couple of windows had blown out. I thought, this isn't so bad.\" Then he looked to his right. \"Where the roof was, I could see the sky. Half the house had blown away.\" Dazed, they left the wreckage of their home and headed toward the First Baptist Church. \"I'm glad we went toward the church,\" Jeff said. \"I found out later there were dead people \u2014 our neighbors \u2014 in the other direction.\" The storm roared through Phil Campbell in 45 seconds. At least 100 structures were destroyed, a 25-foot section of pavement was sucked up, debris was found as far away as Mississippi and Knoxville, Tennessee, and 26 citizens from this small town of under 1,000 people died. Phil Campbell received its improbable name as the result of a deal the town made with a railroad engineer. They told him they would name the place after him if he routed the train tracks through town. For the past five years, the Rev. Bob Livingston, pastor of the First Congregational Church of Ann Arbor on State Street, has led a delegation of his parishioners down South to work on building projects at various disaster sites. I'm not a member of Bob's church, but I've worked with him in an Ann Arbor downtown neighborhood association. He is one of the most decent people I know, a man utterly without pretense. This year he has gathered a group of just under 30 people to travel to Phil Campbell. \"A number of the people in my congregation are interested in a ministry of service, which is what I think Christianity is all about,\" he tells me. This is consistent with what Millard Fuller, the founder of Habitat for Humanity, called \"the theology of the hammer.\" Fuller believed it is imperative that people put their faith into action to serve others by building and renovating simple, decent houses for people in need. In mid February, I drove south with my friend Jim Kern, a retired Ann Arbor psychoanalyst, to join Bob Livingston's team in Franklin County, Alabama. I've always wanted to do this. I'm very interested in talking with folks who want to move outside their own comfort zone, beyond 'the banality of consumption,' to help those in need. Local Writer Karl Pohrt Joins an Ann Arbor Church Group to Help with Disaster Relief in Alabama Rebuilding the World in Northern Alabama Pastor Bert quotes 1st Corinthians 13, v. 12: \"For know we see through a glass darkly.\" This passage acknowledges the mystery of suffering, which is where I'd stop if I were giving the sermon. The storm roared through Phil Campbell in 45 seconds. At least 100 structures were destroyed, a 25-foot section of pavement was sucked up, debris was found as far away as Mississippi and Knoxville, Tennessee, and 26 citizens from this small town of under 1,000 people died.At 3:05 in the afternoon on April 27, 2011, a category five tornado, which is the most powerful rating, slammed into Franklin County, Alabama, just southwest of Hamilton near Highway 19. Ann Arborite Karl Pohrt joined Rev. Bob Livingston's team in Franklin County, Alabama, to do disaster relief.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 31 I'm also interested in meeting people who have survived natural disasters. What do they make of an experience like this? And last, but certainly not least, I'm hoping to pick up some home repair skills that will dazzle my wife, who doesn't dazzle easily. Day 1: We bivouac at the Hotel Jesus, meet John Raymer, and hear about the Miracle of the Shiny Man Late in the afternoon on Sunday we arrive in Russellville, Alabama, a town about 10 miles north of Phil Campbell. Eight thousand people, a quarter of them Hispanic, live here. By the look of things, Russellville has seen better days. At one time there was a factory here that made mobile homes. Then it was a center for furniture. Both industries went bust, and the local economy tanked. Now the main business in the area is a large poultry processing plant. The First Baptist Church, which is hosting our group, occupies a city block in downtown Russellville. We are bivouacked in classrooms on the second floor above the church gymnasium. A former occupant of the room, someone from Wedowee, Alabama, has written \"We call this the Hotel Jesus!\" on the blackboard. After pizza and salad, Bob introduces us to John Raymer, a large, shy, somewhat rumpled man who looks like a biker, which he is. \"I heard God speak to me when I was in Lake Charles, Louisiana,\" he tells us. \"I've received a calling from God to help people who've been through catastrophes, and I've been a full-time volunteer traveling around the country since September 2007. I've been living in Phil Campbell since June and I fell in love with the Baptist Church here. I'll stay until God tells me to go someplace else.\" John is the liaison person between the community and our group. Whoever assigned this earnest, open man to steward us around Phil Campbell has made an excellent choice. \"We've given away clothes and furniture. We do rebuilds and fixes, and we've built three houses. A lot of it is paid through FEMA grants. This is a tight-knit community. These are country people. They are very resilient, but it takes years to recover from something like this. Very few people had home insurance. Sixty percent of the town was wiped out.\" John says that, in addition to our group from Ann Arbor, there is \"an encampment of Midnights just south of town.\" I immediately think of the Dark Legions in The Lord of the Rings . What are they doing here? But we have misheard him. He said Mennonites. It is clear that John Raymer is in awe of the Mennonites; as well he should be given the skill set they possess after raising so many barns in their own rural communities. We mingle with the other volunteers and local people in the church gym. There are 12 families in our group from Ann Arbor. The youngest person is 11 and the oldest are a couple in their eighties. A local man tells us one of the stories circulating through the community about a three-year-old boy who was found unharmed inside a cooler a half mile from his home following the tornado. When asked how he had the presence of mind to get into the cooler, he is said to have replied that \"a shiny man told me to do it.\" The person who was telling us the story dropped his voice and said softly, \"The Shiny Man must have been Jesus.\" This was the punch line, and there was a collective intake of breath among the small audience. At this point, Jim, a lifelong skeptic who is not predisposed to give this sort of thing a pass, said that \"Shiny Man\" sounded like China man to him. The child could have been saying China man. \"But there aren't any Chinese people around here.\" \"I saw a Chinese buffet down the road,\" Jim says, his voice trailing off. He lets go of it at this point, but I'm afraid he has sown the seeds of disbelief among us. At 8:00 our group assembles in a room off the gymnasium for a debriefing called Roses and Thorns. People are asked to share the positive and negative things that have happened to them during the day. The emphasis is on \"roses\" events. Each evening we repeat this exercise. Day 2: I acquire on-the-job drywall skills at Sandy and Jeff Robinson's house A little after 7:00 a.m. we gather in the Church gym for breakfast. I am greeted by a man wearing a large black cowboy hat, who introduces himself as Bobbie Neal Smith. He is a volunteer in charge of setting up chairs in the gym and, we are told later, is beloved by the people at First Baptist. Unfortunately, he has a very thick Alabama accent, he has a tendency to cut the final syllable off each word, and he speaks fast. I don't understand a thing he says to me beyond his name. After breakfast we make brown bag lunches and gather in one of the church rooms for Devotionals. Today, under the talented musical direction of Rev. Bob, who plays guitar, we begin with the song \"They Will Know We Are Christians By Our Love.\" We will work with each other We will work side by side And we'll guard each other's dignity And save each one's pride. This perfectly expresses my deepest wish. Jim and I have been assigned to Group 1 and our task today is to do drywall work, which involves covering screws with a mud-like compound, taping the drywall seams, sanding, and priming. I do not have the slightest idea about how to do any of this, and I fear being exposed for what I am \u2014 someone who lacks any home repair skills whatsoever. After the song, Bob delivers a short sermon/pep talk, reading from Philippians 4, in which the Apostle Paul urges the Philippians not to worry about anything and \"to stand firm in the Lord.\" Bob talks about the importance of attitude, the impact it can have on the way we work. It's time to man-up . I attempt to appear resolute. We drive out to the Dry Wall House, which belongs to Jeff and Sandy Robinson. As Jeff earns money, he rebuilds their house. Like many people here, they didn't have their home insured. In the mean time, he and Sandy are living in a FEMA trailer next to the house. \"I've received a calling from God to help people who've been through catastrophes, and I've been a full-time volunteer traveling around the country since September 2007. I've been living in Phil Campbell since June and I fell in love with the Baptist Church here. I'll stay until God tells me to go someplace else.\" -John RaymerJohn Raymer \"A number of the people in my congregation are interested in a ministry of service, which is what I think Christianity is all about.\" - Rev. Bob Livingston, pastor of the First Congregational Church of Ann Arbor on State Street, who has led a delegation of his parishioners down South to work on building projects at various disaster sites.Rev. Bob Livingston Bob reads from Acts 9, v. 36, about Dorcus, a member of an early Christian community who is mentioned only once in the Bible. She is described as \"devoted to good works and acts of charity.\" This is how she is remembered by her community, and Bob asks us to be mindful of the way we would like to be remembered. Continued on page 32 He chooses a verse from 1st John: \"To you whom I love, let us go on loving together. Love your brother and sister.\" It is a fitting coda for the week. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 32 It turns out I needn't have been anxious about my nonexistent dry wall skills. John Porter, one of the leaders of our group, appears to know everything about the field of home repair. In addition, he is a talented and patient teacher. He shows us how to properly apply a mud-like paste over the screw holes. He uses a hard plastic spatula, quickly turning it clockwise when it touches the drywall. This requires a certain finesse, but I gradually catch on. We learn how to tape over wall joints and do the corners of walls using tape that is folded down the middle. The work is fun up to a point, but then it isn't so much fun. After two hours my body starts to lock up. I'm using muscles I haven't used in a very long time, and by the end of the workday I think I need some powerful pain medication. But this evening I am healed by a dinner of soft tacos, refried beans, and salad that Holly Porter and Shirley Adams have magically conjured up. Day 3: We demolish the rickety carport frame in Shalecia Bonner's yard and attach sheet metal skirting around the base of her mobile home This morning we sing a rousing \"When the Spirit Says Move\" and \"If I Had a Hammer,\" two songs that energize everyone in the room. Then Pastor Bert Fowler, Minister of Music and Senior Adults at First Baptist, gives a short talk. He tells us about a man who sought pastoral counseling following the tornado because he was experiencing suicidal thoughts. He had been thrown about 600 yards from his house. He survived, but his mother and his mother-in-law, who were in the house with him, died. \"Why did I survive?\" the man asked. Pastor Bert quotes 1st Corinthians 13, v. 12: \"For know we see through a glass darkly.\" This passage acknowledges the mystery of suffering, which is where I'd stop if I were giving the sermon. Then he talks about the Parable of the Prodigal ( Luke 15 ), about a man who loses his possessions and is brought low, which brings him to repentance and redemption. \"We should rejoice in our trials,\" Pastor Fowler says. \"They mirror the spiritual battles in the heavenly realm. Perhaps our adversities are actually blessings. And how do we define blessing? What does it mean to be blessed?\" \"For the Christian, holy and blameless in the eye of God, death is the ultimate victory. He is secure and sealed away. This is a blessing.\" I'm certain it all makes theological sense, but I wonder if this kind of talk helped the depressed man. I want to know how he is doing. It is a beautiful morning. The temperature is in the mid sixties and wild daffodils are scattered in the ditches next to the road. Rev. Bob, Dr. Jim, John Raymer, and I drive two miles south of Phil Campbell on 237 and turn right on a dirt road, roll slowly past a burnt-out house and pull up a few hundred yards later in front of a large mobile home. Shalecia Bonner, a graceful young woman wearing a faded army cap, emerges from the trailer. John asks her to tell us about her experience during the tornado. She was in another town when the tornado hit, at her daughter's karate class. When they got back to Phil Campbell, her house and her mother's place were gone. \"My daughter just jumped out of the car and ran down the road crying for my mother. Fortunately, mom was okay.\" She is a single mother, back now two years from Iraq. She tells us she trained as a diesel mechanic in the army but was transferred into a Special Forces unit that went out on night patrols. \"That must have been very difficult.\" \"I kind of liked it,\" she says and smiles. Ms. Bonner drives a motorcycle and owns a truck. Like most of the people here, she enjoys fishing and hunting. She has three dogs and a cat. Our task today is to rip out the skeletal frame of a carport next to the mobile home. We are joined by John Porter and, after some discussion, we lasso the main beam. John Raymer climbs up a ladder holding a Sawzall and cuts the beam. No one is injured, except that just before lunch, Jim Kern steps into a huge pile of dog feces. After lunch we attach sheet metal skirting to the mobile home. The trailer rests on concrete blocks about four feet off the ground, and the skirting will provide insulation against cold seeping through the floor in the winter and the heat during the summer. The pieces of sheet metal are light corrugated panels with sharp edges. If we aren't careful, we get cut. We use a battery-powered drill to drive the screws into the skirting and the base of the mobile home. Tonight it's fried chicken, baked potatoes, and salad, which hits the spot after an afternoon rolling around in the dirt. Day 4: A quick tour of the worksites, more work at Shalecia Bonner's, supper at the Russellville First Baptist Church, and a Prayer Meeting Bob reads from Acts 9, v. 36, about Dorcus, a member of an early Christian community who is mentioned only once in the Bible. She is described as \"devoted to good works and acts of charity.\" This is how she is remembered by her community, and Bob asks us to be mindful of the way we would like to be remembered. On the way to Shalecia's, Bob wants to briefly check on the progress at our four other worksites. First we visit the Church Storage Facility. Neil Adams estimates that he and his crew have done $6,000 to $8,000 worth of electrical work on the building. At the Dry Wall House, most of the rooms have been taped and sanded. One bedroom is ready to prime. We drop by the Trim House, where Barb Clough and other team workers are painting. Carlos, the owner, is thrilled that his home is almost finished. At the Front Porch House, Chris Diccion has been working on a cement porch that was dislocated by the tornado, which shifted the beams supporting the roof over the front door entrance. He and his crew have almost completed this technically difficult job. We've finished installing the top layer of sheet metal around the mobile home, and now we need to attach the layer next to the ground. This is more difficult because we have to attach the second layer to the upper panels. The job requires that one of us must get under the trailer to brace the top layer from the back so that the bottom panel can be screwed to it. The ground underneath the trailer is dark and wet. It is home to various insects and, perhaps, small animals that bite. There are about four feet between the ground and the bottom of the trailer. In the highly unlikely event that the small concrete blocks shift, the person working would be flattened like a pancake. Yesterday Shalecia told us she'd be glad to work under the trailer, but (aside from our sense that it wouldn't be right to ask her to do this most unpleasant task) she's not home. Bob, bless his heart, volunteers for the job. He cuts up some plastic sheeting to lie on and moves under the trailer.

This is a sentimental, emotionally raw song that works as a result of the hard-edged earnest voice of Ms. Bevis. It's an example of what music critic Greil Marcus called \"the old, weird America.\" If you purchase \"Sweet Lullaby\" on iTunes, the proceeds go to the Alabama Tornado Relief funds. Rebuilding the World in Northern Alabama I've never understood the 'Born Again' theology. I think religious understanding is a form of knowledge that requires a great deal of practice and attention. It is almost a biological unfolding. I once heard a Zen teacher say that when we meditate we ripen. Ripening is a slow process. I suppose if the Southern Baptists were Japanese Buddhists, they would be in the Sudden Enlightenment (Rinzai) School. The Gradual Enlightenment (Soto) School makes more sense to me.Continued from page 31After the storm damaged their home, Sandra and Jeff Robinson headed to the First Baptist Church.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 33 This evening our hosts at the Russellville Baptist Church produce a wonderful dinner for us that includes meat loaf, corn bread, coleslaw, white beans, macaroni and cheese, sweet tea, cake and ice cream, and decaf coffee. I sit across the table from a retired couple who had been in the poultry business. They tell me that at one time the plant here supplied all the Chicken McNuggets in America. After dinner, there is a Prayer Meeting in the chapel. Jim Kern and I both attend, along with around fifty other people. When we enter, we're given a list of people who have requested prayers along with the reasons for the prayers \u2014 cancer, shingles, a knee replacement, burns rehab. Births and deaths are also noted. After our prayers are offered, the minister delivers a short sermon where he tells us, among other things, that unless we are born again, we cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven. I've never understood the 'Born Again' theology. I think religious understanding is a form of knowledge that requires a great deal of practice and attention. It is almost a biological unfolding.

I suppose if the Southern Baptists were Japanese Buddhists, they would be in the Sudden Enlightenment (Rinzai) School. The Gradual Enlightenment (Soto) School makes more sense to me. Day 5: A warning from Rev. Bob, we finish up at Shalecia's mobile home, and Jim and I sit across the table from a group of Mennonite women at the Church potluck dinner in Phil Campbell During Devotionals this morning Bob reads from 1st Corinthians 13, v. 4, a sentence that begins \"Love is patient.\" He tells us he chose this passage because it stresses patience and \"this is the day when we start to get on each other's nerves,\" although he quickly adds that everybody seems to be getting along fine. I glance furtively around the room. Everyone looks tired, but I detect no wavering on the part of our brave crew. We return to the mobile home and are joined by Robert Schirmer, a middle school student, and Bubba, a U.P .S. pilot. Bubba, despite his nickname, lives in the Ann Arbor area. He tells us that he once flew 28,000 Barbie Dolls \u2014 which are made in China \u2014 out of Singapore to the U.S. in time for the Christmas rush. Bubba and Jim Kern begin work at one end of the mobile home, Bob and I continue from the other end, and Robert digs a shallow trench around the base of the trailer. Bubba is understandably reluctant to get under the trailer, so Jim Kern signs on for this gnarly job. By late afternoon, the two crews meet. Not to inflate this relatively insignificant (in the larger scheme of things) job, but it feels to us like the coming together of the transcontinental railroad. This evening the good people at the First Baptist Church in Phil Campbell throw a huge church supper for the Ann Arbor volunteers and the Mennonites. We are advised before dinner by John Raymer that the Mennonites do not like their pictures taken. Jim and I would like to talk with the Mennonites. The men are recognizable by their white suspenders and similar haircuts, but there are no unoccupied chairs near them in the gymnasium. The women wear long calico dresses and small white bonnets. They sit together across the room and there are some open seats at their table. As we move to join them, an older Alabama lady laughs and says, \"You all better behave yourselves now!\" I tell her I certainly will, but that I can't speak for Jim. Conversation proves to be quite difficult. When I ask one of the Mennonite women a question, she replies with as short an answer as possible. And then silence. There is no reciprocity. It doesn't feel like we're talking to people who are hostile. Rather, I suspect they are just not used to speaking to outsiders. A man sitting on the other side of Jim presses the women. \"Where you Mennonites from?\" \"Switzerland.\" \"You come all the way from Switzerland?\" No, they are from the Finger Lakes area of New York state and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. \"Do you read the whole Bible?\" They nod. \"Do you read the King James version?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, I think you girls are as conservative as I am!\" he announces. Fortunately, this awkward situation ends when someone passes over a cute baby to one of the Mennonite women. Everyone focuses on the baby, breaks into ecstatic smiles, and what passes for conversation grinds to a halt. Day 6: The empty tea cup During our final Devotional together this morning, Bob reminds us that he began the week with Matthew 25, v. 40: \"Just as you did for the least of these, you did it to me.\" He chooses a verse from 1st John: \"To you whom I love, let us go on loving together. Love your brother and sister.\" It is a fitting coda for the week. Later this morning I'm standing in the cemetery, which is on a rise next to the Baptist Church in Phil Campbell. The land is mostly rocks, mud, and small clumps of grass. Some junk from the tornado is scattered into the gullies below the cemetery, with sheet metal and other debris still entangled in the bushes, and I see mobile homes and wrecked trees in the near distance. Despite the sunny morning, this is a desolate and depressing scene. Given the problematic economy in northern Alabama, I'm not sure why anyone would rebuild here after the tornado. At first glance, it appears to me that life in Phil Campbell is far more difficult than it is where I come from. How much of the Southern Baptist imagination is a reflection of this? Their religion is certainly more Manichaean than my own. Everything is either light or dark. There doesn't appear to be any room for nuance, but perhaps nuance falls by the wayside when people have fewer resources. How much of our world view is shaped by circumstance and by what we believe we need in order to survive? I don't think I understand the religious and social commitments of these resilient people. I do know if I can't learn to withhold my preconceptions and projections, I'll probably misunderstand everything. And then it's like Leonard Cohen's line about Jesus in his song \"Suzanne\": He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone. I recall a story Paul Reps tells in Zen Flesh, Zen Bones about Zen Master Nan-in (1868- 1912), who invited a university professor who wanted to discuss Zen with him to tea. Nan-in poured the professor's cup to the top and then kept on pouring. \"No more will go in!\" the professor shouted. \"Like this cup you are full of your opinions,\" Nan-in said. \"How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?\" The other night the Baptist preacher said this another way: \"To be meek means to be teachable.\" This is the gift I received in Phil Campbell. This is what I learned here. Karl Pohrt was the founder and long-time owner of Shaman Drum Bookshop, an Ann Arbor literary institution for 29 years. Shalecia Bonner was in another town when the tornado hit, at her daughter's karate class. When they got back to Phil Campbell, her house and her mother's place were gone. \"Like this cup you are full of your opinions,\" Nan-in said. \"How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?\" By Kate Durda \"After having personally practiced shamanism, shamanic healing, and shamanic journeying for more than half a century, I can say that there is nothing I have encountered in reports of the spiritual experiences of saints, prophets, psychedelic drug experimenters, near death survivors, avatars and other mystics that is not commonly experienced when following classic journey methods using a drum.\" - Dr. Michael Harner I begin with a quote from one of my teachers, Dr. Michael Harner, who created the Foundation for Shamanic Studies (FSS), as it suggests the power and breadth of this ancient spiritual practice. This article can only serve as an invitation to explore the vast, mysterious, and amazing practice of shamanism and shamanic healing. Shamanism is the oldest known spiritual practice in recorded history, going back 40,000-100,000 years in existence. It has been found in all pre-technological cultures and is still practiced today around the world. The word \"shaman\" itself is Russian \"saman\" (Tungus) in origin and, according to Mircea Eliade in Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy, refers to one who \"specialized in a trance during which his soul is believed to leave his body and ascend to the sky or descend to the underworld.\" Dr. Michael Harner, author of The Way of the Shaman , refers to this trance state of consciousness as the \"shamanic state of consciousness\" (SSC). While in the SSC, you journey into what is called \"non-ordinary reality\" (NOR), the shamanic cosmology composed of the \"upperworld,\" \"middleworld,\" and the \"lowerworld.\" This realm is also known variously as the \"universal field\" in quantum physics, the \"Dreamtime\" to Australian aboriginal society, and by other terms. The shaman is someone who has a strong relationship with the spiritual realm and can act as an intermediary between the energy realm and human realm to restore balance, health, and vitality where it is needed. Shamanic healing and practice is seemingly endless in scope, utilized to address the spiritual/energetic causes of illness. Traditionally, shamans serve complex and multiple roles in their communities, which over the centuries have included divination, healing, spiritual counseling, and leading ceremony, among others. They perform soul retrievals (restoration of our essence and soul energy), psycho pomp (helping spirits cross over after death), power restoration, extraction (removal of spiritual blocks in energy); work to restore balance (spirits of weather, the earth, even businesses); and access information (divination, augury) when needed. They also work outside of time (journeying to heal issues of the past so they don't continue to have energetic effects) and outside of \"space\" (long distance healing). Shamanic Journey to Non-ordinary Reality Non-ordinary reality, the spiritual energy realm, is where the shaman \"journeys\" to commune with spirit and receive guidance. It is here that one meets with individual teachers, guides, and \"power animals\" (totems) for the purpose of gaining knowledge and healing, both for oneself and for others. It is good to note here that the term shamanism has come to generically refer to this near universal spiritual practice, which can be distinguished from other healing methods by the practice of \"journeying\" or \"spirit flight.\" Shamanism originated independently in indigenous cultures around the world, but most people these days are no longer living in their \"tribes\" or cultures of origin. For this reason, many shamanic healers refer to themselves as shamanic practitioners to differentiate themselves from indigenous shamans. Although some cultures used entheogenic (plant based, root meaning -\"of God\") substances such as peyote, amanita mushrooms, or ayahuasca to enter in to the shamanic state of consciousness, the majority of cultures typically used a drum and perhaps other rhythm instruments, as well as dancing, chanting, and movement. Our ancestors knew what now has been proven scientifically, that a steady, rhythmic drumbeat facilitates a transformative shift in consciousness (from beta to alpha and theta brainwave activity). This shift into the \"shamanic state of consciousness\" allows personal truths and guidance to be readily accessed and helps to strengthen one's spiritual abilities and to awaken those that are dormant. Another distinguishing aspect is that shamans practiced through the principle of direct revelation. No formulas, methodologies, or dogma need be followed. The shaman receives what is needed through accessing NOR, the spiritual realm. S/he must strive to purely be the \"hollow bone\" through which the needed spiritual energies and information flow forth in response to the intention of the shaman. Personal preparation and training are continual in order to achieve this emptiness of ego as much as possible. Allies in the Spirit World In order to access spiritual guidance and information, shamans work very closely with their spiritual allies. There are two major types of spiritual energies that shamans develop deep helping relationships with; power animals (variously called guardians, totems, guardian angels, naguals, familiars, or other terms) found in the The shaman is someone who has a strong relationship with the spiritual realm and can act as an intermediary between the energy realm and human realm to restore balance, health, and vitality where it is needed.Stephanie Tighe and Kate Durda are the founders of Spirit Weavers, and have been offering shamanic healing and training in this region for many years.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 34 Shamanism, Power Animals, and the Stretched Mind Non-ordinary reality, the spiritual energy realm, is where the shaman \"journeys\" to commune with spirit and receive guidance. It is here that one meets with individual teachers, guides, and \"power animals\" (totems) for the purpose of gaining knowledge and healing, both for oneself and for others.\"shamanic state of consciousness\" (SSC) lowerworld; as well as tutelary figures called teachers or guides more often found in the upperworld. These energies in non-ordinary reality partner with the shaman and provide guidance, insight, protection, and vital information that the shaman is seeking. Shamans develop deep working partnerships with these helping spirits; the strength and power of their healing and divination work is reflective of the quality of these relationships in non-ordinary reality. Most of us are familiar with the concept of archetypes and the vast holdings of the unconscious. It is beyond the scope of this article to delve into an explanation of the amazing power of these spiritual allies, whatever their source and existence. In this article, I will focus on lowerworld helpers only. However, having led hundreds of people on shamanic journeys, I find it simply a fact that we all respond to the spirit realm in similar ways, and power animals and teachers are always met! Role of Power Animals In the shamanic belief system, it is generally held that each one of us comes into this world with at least one power animal, a being from \"non-ordinary reality\" (NOR) which serves to protect us and shares its power with us. It is believed that this protection allows us to survive and keeps us safe. Without this connection we fail to thrive. It is generally believed that through the energetic connection of our power animal, not only physical energy and ability to resist contagious disease increases, but also one's mental alertness and self-confidence. In our contemporary culture, we have lost this immediate and accessible awareness of staying in touch with our power, in the form of these spirit animals and their gifts to us. But whether or not we are aware of our power animals, the energy connections and underlying processes of health, protection, and vitality are ongoing and active in supporting our life force and lives. Shamanism powerfully and clearly provides a metaphor, or way of understanding, how we are connected to the life force, the energy field, in order to not only survive, but thrive! Through the practices of shamanism, we are able to consciously maintain our life force and are guided to act and live in accordance with deep spiritual laws of life. If we don't live in harmony and in \"right action\" in life, we may lose our spiritual connection. Symptoms of power animal loss include: depression, weakness, being prone to illness, chronic misfortune, or problems of a chronic and ongoing nature. On an individual level, if a person experiences these symptoms, they can request a shamanic practitioner to work on their behalf to intervene with the spirits to have their power animal returned to them. In shamanism, it is believed that it is a more powerful act to enlist the aid of Spirit for someone else. In addition, as humans in close relationships with our families and others, we may find it near impossible to achieve the detachment required of the shaman always. Therefore, shamans would enlist the aid of another shaman if possible when they had need of personal healing; they would not ask their spirits for an important healing on their own. Journeying to Meet Your Power Animal Interested individuals can learn the practice of shamanic journeying and meet their own power animal. In an introductory class, one is invited to learn the practice of shifting one's consciousness through the use of the drum and to explore and experience the spiritual realm of energy. You are provided with guidance as to how to contact any helping spirits that are present to help you. You may be surprised that your power animal isn't the animal you would have guessed, or then, it sometimes is! It is typical to have more than one power animal over time, although some may stay with you for life. Power animals provide us with a source of power or energy, if you will. They provide us with support, knowledge, and guidance in areas of our lives that are in need. Thus, a power animal might come to us when we are facing the illness of a loved one, or if we are in fear and feeling abandoned. A power animal may come to us when we ourselves are ill and afraid. Or a power animal may come to guide us when we are in the peak of our career or life's work, helping us to move to that next level of achievement, guiding us with the energies and insights to help us break through. If their purpose is fulfilled, they may seem to leave, but likely they are dormant. For example, one client I worked with had developed cancer and asked for a healing. Along with a soul retrieval, I found Lion as power animal for her. It turns out she and Lion had a close relationship during her painful childhood; along the way, she lost her connection to it before I found it and returned it to her in her time of need. Power Animal as an Ally/Helper Sometimes we develop these helping relationships with so-called \"imaginary\" animals or friends, but these relationships are often true spiritual helpers rather than childhood whimsy or something imaginary. You know the difference by the truth or accuracy of information you are given, or the gifts your power animal shares. A quote from Carl Jung seems helpful here: \"Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.\" We are accessing real truths and knowledge when we journey. This shift into the shamanic state of consciousness allows personal truths and guidance to be readily accessed and helps to strengthen one's spiritual abilities and to awaken those that are dormant. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 35 Continued on page 36 Most beginners really don't trust themselves, yet it is commonplace for even a first time journeyer to discern power animals. There is nothing like experiential learning! In an introductory class I was teaching, I had an uneven number of students, so I paired up with a young man in a power animal exercise. In his effort to retrieve a power animal for me, he discerned that two types of big cats were present, but only one wanted to be brought back for me. Very interesting was the fact that the big cat that didn't need to be \"retrieved\" for me was already one of my primary power animals! Thus, the student \"saw\" the energy (power animal), but correctly discerned through the journey that it was not in need of retrieval. The other cat was a new power animal for me! Working with power animals and teachers/guides is one way that the individual can identify what might need to change or be created in his/her life, as well as receive insight, guidance, and support. All of the guardians of the lowerworld or upperworld are true helpers, existing for our highest good. In the middleworld, however, there is a mix of spirits who simply have not \"crossed over\" after death. Discussion of this realm is beyond the scope of this article. Suffice it to say here that working with middleworld spirits requires deep power of discernment achieved through much practice journeying and developing relationships with true helpers. However, working in the spiritual realm (upperworld and lowerworld) with spiritual allies is very safe, supportive, healing, and always provides an exquisitely sweet and deep sense of \"coming home\"! Power Animals and the Shaman Shamans were very eager and grateful to obtain as many spiritual allies (power animals and teachers) as would appear to them, but the truth is that real power comes from working closely with and developing deep relationships with these allies in order to understand what gifts and guidance they offered to the shaman's work. The shaman develops these relationships in a disciplined practice that includes journeying to the SSC, honoring ceremonies for the spiritual energies, respecting and utilizing the teachings obtained, and working on behalf of others, not for personal power. The end result, with each new \"energy\" engaged, is that the shaman can move within a more complete personal universe \u2014 understanding more and working more harmoniously with the great oneness. Being able to enter into the pure realm of energy and truth, and to be familiar with those energies that make up the whole, allows for more powerful healing and divination. As I indicated earlier, this article can only serve as an invitation to explore further. Shamanism is a complex spiritual practice and provides a useful body of understanding and practices that allows us to work within the truths of the energy fields. It may be ancient, but the understanding that the shamans had of reality is slowly being manifest again for us through quantum physics, reminding us of what we have always known! The practice of shamanism, which opens us to our own truths and power, cannot help but change your life for the better. Luckily, \"a mind once stretched by a new idea never regains its original dimension.\" (Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.) Our world needs all of us to come up with better ways of living and solutions to our many issues. If you find yourself curious, I suggest that you follow \"the way of the shaman,\" and sign up for some direct revelation. Find a teacher of shamanic practices and try it for yourself. Please see our website for articles on shamanism, book recommendations, and other resources in addition to our complete training schedule. Kate Durda, M.A., and Stephanie Tighe, M.S.W., together founded Spirit Weavers, a partnership focused on creating healing and spiritual community. They have taught locally and internationally, and offer shamanic healing and training. Their efforts focus on increasing the understanding of and access to shamanism as a spiritual practice as well as a healing modality. To this end, they have worked with young and old, in various places including prisons, homes for the aged, and hospitals. They also serve as ceremonialists and spiritual ministers, offering grief ceremonies, memorial services, and seasonal celebrations (solstice). Finally, they are involved in an emerging movement \"Shamans Without Borders,\" initiated by the Society for Shamanic Practitioners (SSP). Kate and Stephanie will be leading one of five national inaugural trainings for SSP at the Pierce Cedar Creek Institute in Hastings, Michigan, from October 19-21, 2012. For more information, email SpiritWeavers@gmail.com or visit www.SpiritWeavers.net. A friend of mine took an introductory shamanic workshop with Dr. Harner in 1987 and discovered that one of her power animals was Bear. The second day of the workshop participants were paired up in a divination exercise and were told to journey to find an answer to a partner's question. My friend was randomly paired with a physicist who was a professor at the local university. He asked something like, \"Which of two satellite systems should I devote my career to?\" My friend, very much a beginner, engaged in this exercise with trepidation, not knowing if she would even \"speak the language\" of the physicist or understand what she might find. As with all journeys, she stated her intention, asked her power animal for help with the answer, and nervously watched as Bear just sat and played with a stick, dragging it around in the sand. She was sure she'd failed when the drum \"call back\" came, ending the journey. She thought she'd have to tell her partner she didn't get any answer, but in desperation, she did the right thing: she shared the image the Bear seemed to be drawing in the sand. Eureka! The physicist was amazed and said that the drawing depicted an identifying part of one of the satellites, therefore indicating to him which direction he might follow. Such amazing revelations of information are frequent, and you soon let go of any mistrust you had and accept that there is deep power in this practice. I, however, want to take a moment here to caution that it is important to treat such spiritual inquiries cautiously and carefully. In serious matters, if not seeking several methods or sources for information to make the decisions, one would at least take time to make decisions. Further, even the most experienced practitioner is still human. We must always strive to assure that we are not falling into the trap of self-fulfillment or ego-needs. For example, in the case of illness, we might deeply want to help our client or loved one be \"cured\" and free of illness, but that is our own human need. Actually, the healing that is needed might instead take the form of allowing the ill person to accept and prepare emotionally and spiritually for end of life. The outcome of spiritual healing is indeed out of the human practitioner's hands or ego. It is under the direction of the inner spirit of the client/patient. As with all spiritual practices, the shamanic practitioner, too, must simply serve as a \"hollow bone\" through which energy flows.Sometimes we develop these helping relationships with so-called \"imaginary\" animals or friends, but these relationships are often true spiritual helpers rather than childhood whimsy or something imaginary. Shamanism, Power Animals, and the Stretched Mind Continued from page 35 The shaman must strive to purely be the \"hollow bone\" through which the needed spiritual energies and information flow forth in response to the intention of the shaman. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 36 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 37 \"The condensing of time and the focus on the \"here and now\" surfaces people's needs for care and warmth, rivalrous and competitive feelings, and the worry there is not enough attention to go around. People begin to feel childlike. If they can put these thoughts and feelings into words, it is a mature expression of what is universally experienced by all.\" Brian Ashin on the Richness and Rewards of Therapy Groups Interview by Bill Zirinsky Photography by Susan Ayer Most of our readers consider themselves to be on psychological or spiritual journeys to greater self-awareness and interpersonal clarity. One of the profound tools for deepening one's life is participating in a therapy group. There was a time in Ann Arbor when therapy groups were abundant -- flyers for Gestalt groups, T-Groups, women's groups, encounter groups, and support groups of different stripes were plastered on bulletin boards everywhere. There are fewer offerings in recent years, but, still, one can participate in well-run therapy groups led by a number of experienced and compassionate group leaders who specialize in group work. One of the solid and capable group therapists in town is Brian Ashin, 59. He was raised in Michigan, and received his MSW at Wayne State University in 1979. He has done post-graduate training at the Family Institute in Philadelphia, and was licensed as a Marriage and Family Therapist. He is also a Certified Group Therapist. He currently leads four therapy groups, and is passionate and articulate about the satisfactions and nuances of group therapy. He and his wife, Judy, have been married for 31 years, and they live in Ann Arbor. She is a social worker and therapist at Chelsea Hospital. Continued on page 38Bill Zirinsky: Brian, it's clear you love doing group therapy work. Why? Brian Ashin: I enjoy working with people and trying to help them live with resilience and self confidence. Years ago, I read the most accessible book for group therapists at that time, The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy, by Irvin Yalom. Yalom offered a new way of working with groups. This appealed to me because this focus on the \"here and now\" brought patient's difficulties in living to the surface, leading them to act out their early conflicts and struggles for all to see. Being witness to this re-experiencing of difficulties right there in the room with one another is both powerful to observe and powerful in its capacity to heal. Being in a group allows for these self defeating patterns to arise where they can be observed by others, experienced by the person and finally given up for healthier and more adaptive satisfying behavior. It's invigorating for group members to be part of each other's psychological growth. Bill Zirinsky: Brian, please trace your educational background, and your background as a psychotherapist, a family therapist, and a group therapist. Brian Ashin: My first major was anthropology. It didn't last long but I was interested in the relationship between people and their environment. I soon found my way to Wayne State University and the School of Social Work. We all read Freud but I also had exposure to the works of Margaret Mahler and other object relations theorists. I was interested in how experiences with early significant objects contributed to ongoing psychological development. After graduate school, I moved to Philadelphia to do post-graduate training in Family Therapy. I picked supervisors who had trained as psychoanalysts who also had an interest in systems theory. I was interested in the interplay between the internal objects (how past experiences with others are internalized) and how this plays out in real relationships. During my family therapy training, I began analysis with someone who was influenced by Mahler and spent the next five years on the couch. At the time I was working as a psychiatric social worker at Cooper Medical Center in New Jersey. I led the daily inpatient group on the Adult Psychiatric Unit. To learn how to lead these groups, I read Irvin Yalom. He was innovative in that he stressed having group members explore their relationships with each other in real time. Bill Zirinsky: You've told me there are three ways of running groups. Please describe the three ways, and which one is your way? Brian Ashin: There are two basic styles of leading process groups (where the focus of the group is on the process, i.e., here and now). In the first, the therapist is primary. The group is used to stir up an issue and the therapist does individual work with the rest of the group looking on. This will stir up memories or feelings in the others and the therapist will then work with the next person. The other members observe, may contribute something and have vicarious learning, but the main interaction is between the therapist and each patient. The other way is what we The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 38 call \"group as a whole.\" The therapist makes group wide interpretations about why the group members are silent or just chit chatting and otherwise avoiding real emotional contact with one another. I'd say my training is a sub group of the \"group as a whole\" approach. Rather than making group wide interpretations, I am interested in helping them understand their resistance to building emotional bridges to each other. BZ: You're currently associated with Louis Ormont's Center for Group Studies in New York; the Center's work is focused on one of the three ways, is that correct? Tell us about your association with that Center, and how you're planning to bring that work to Ann Arbor. Brian Ashin : I started training with The Center for Group Studies about seven years ago. In October of 2010, I went to St. Petersburg, Russia as part of the Center for Group Studies International Training Program. It gave me the idea to bring faculty from CGS to Ann Arbor to expose therapists here who might not otherwise have the opportunity to travel regularly to New York City. Our inaugural training institute will be held in the fall of 2012... BZ: So, what has Ormont's influence been on you? Brian Ashin: Lou Ormont has helped shape my work with groups. He explores the myriad forms of resistance to immediacy. He has also developed creative ways to help group members resolve the resistances that interfere with authentic and open contact with others. BZ: At another point, you ran PAIRS groups -- the Practical Application of Intimate Relationship Skills. What was that based on, and how did that play a role in your evolution? Brian Ashin: Lori Gordon, Ph.D., developed this psycho-educational course based on the work of Virginia Satir and other pioneers in the family therapy field. I trained with Lori and began running couples groups. Having that many people in a room together taught me how to pay attention to the interpersonal dynamics of the couples and of the larger group as well. I became interested in how groups progressed emotionally and the inevitable forces that also hindered the progression. I'd have to say that this helped me develop skills as both a marital therapist and as a group therapist. BZ: Group work is, of course, experiential, and difficult to capture in words. Even so, let's try a bit. What are the signs of a group that's working versus one that's stuck? Brian Ashin: All groups have inherent in their make-up both destructive and creative forces. A group that is progressing has members experiencing warmth and the desire to connect with one another. Or, they are openly exploring their competitive or angry feelings towards one another. Anger, feelings of envy and other negative emotions are not repressed or avoided. At other times, when these negative feelings begin to develop and there is resistance to open expression, the group could bog down in protracted silences or other forms of avoidance. This anger usually arises from feelings of being hurt, rejected or ignored. When this is surfaced and expressed, the group begins to move forward again. A group that is moving forward is having what we call \"progressive emotional communication.\" Group members are talking openly and honestly about their \"The relief comes when you speak up. Usually, others share the same thoughts and then one feels less alone, less different and less shame.\" \"It's oftentimes safer to express anger and aggression towards the leader than towards one another.\" Brian Ashin on the Richness and Rewards of Therapy Groups \"Being witness to people being open and vulnerable with one another and developing a more mature way of relating to others is very exciting.\" Continued from page 37thoughts and feelings towards one another. One person's emotional honesty leads others to become vulnerable and self disclosing. BZ: Ormont's group work is very much to stay focused on what's happening within the group, in present time. Is that correct? Brian Ashin: Absolutely. Although group members understand that is the focus, we expect that they will at times do anything but. And this resistance to immediacy is really what is important to the growth of the group and the growth of the individual members. BZ: There's a lot of \"resistance to immediacy\" generally, and it sounds as if t h at i s co n sta nt l y s u r fa c i n g i n t h e g ro u ps yo u l e a d ? Brian Ashin: Yes. The therapist who expects their group members to adhere to that part of the contract will be frustrated by their groups The therapist that understands this is to be expected will be more helpful to group members. If everyone was able to stay in the present with each other, there would be no need for therapy and no need for group therapy. As therapists, we're less interested in compliance and more interested in the forces that inhibit people from fulfilling the contract to \"put your thoughts and feelings into words.\" An example of behavior that illustrates resistance to the contract is when Joe withdraws into silence instead of telling Sue he feels hurt by her criticism of him or when Dan puts Adam down rather than saying he's jealous of the attention he is receiving from Stuart. BZ: Trying to get group members to \"stay present\" is exciting, yes? So much power in immediacy... Brian Ashin : It really is. Being witness to people being open and vulnerable with one another and developing a more mature way of relating to others is very exciting. It's moving and touching when group members make new connections that were not previously there. BZ: Are you a provocative leader? Brian Ashin: I could be. When the group gets bogged down with long silences and there is a halting heaviness in the air, I am assuming that there are negative or positive feelings and powerful shame or guilt around these feelings that is creating the resistance to meaningful interactions. If a more benign inquiry like, \"everyone is so quiet today, Joe, what's your idea about this\" falls flat and the heaviness goes on without break, I may say something more provocative like \"I've been thinking about this quietness, it seems you think I've been working too hard with you and want to give me a rest.\" This usually annoys someone and leads to the freeing up of people's resistance to open and honest expression. BZ: Are you, generally, a model for compassion and warmth, or not necessarily? Brian Ashin: That's a good question. I think I model compassion and warmth when someone in the group complains about me or criticizes me and I don't get defensive but instead am interested in hearing more. For example, Shari says to me, \" Brian, you look bored and I'm angry with you.\" I might say, \" Shari, I'm glad you're speaking up, Why do you think I might be bored?\" I want people to explore their reactions, not just explain themselves. I also try to protect people's egos from feeling injured or shamed. BZ: You told me that group members need the leader \"to love them, to c o m p e t e w i t h t h e m , t o p l a c a t e t h e m , \" a n d s o o n . P l e a s e s a y m o r e . Brian Ashin: I think I said people sometimes react to the therapist as a parent. They will love, want to be loved, will compete and placate, essentially act out all the same needs and tensions they experienced in their family as children. And this is the beauty of group. Not only are the transference feelings towards the therapist but to one another as well, as sometime siblings and sometimes parents. This provides a rich environment for people to rework their old and persistent difficulties. BZ: Does the group turn on you sometimes? If so, what might that be about? Brian Ashin : It's oftentimes safer to express anger and aggression towards the leader than towards one another. Or someone is angry with me because they feel ignored or dropped by me in some way. It's not necessarily the feeling of anger to me that is important as much as the possible block to expressing it. In groups, we want people to experience and express the full range of human emotions, not just the ones they were taught to feel or express to gain acceptance. This is the path to fuller self acceptance, better self esteem and emotional resilience, and a greater capacity to enjoy intimacy with others. BZ: Please talk about counter-transference in a group setting. And about objective counter-transference.

Subjective counter transference is the experience I had with a female client just a bit older than me whom I immediately experienced some anxiety with. I realized that she unconsciously reminded me of my older sister who used to boss me around and apparently still have some resentment about. So these feelings came from my more or less unresolved past. Objective counter transference are the feelings that the client may consciously or unconsciously want me to feel and are not generated from unresolved conflicts. For example; The sexy and provocative group member will generate both sexual interest in some and annoyance in others. The reasons for this behavior may be out of the person's awareness. They might not even be aware they are acting in such a way. Unconsciously, the behaviors may be meant to generate interest all the while pushing people away. So, if I'm feeling interested and annoyed, this is what the other is wanting me to feel, for whatever the reasons may be. We call this objective counter transference because it is provoked and not having the origins inside of me. The beauty of this is that my feelings are telling me something about the person that the person is not yet able to tell me about himself or herself. BZ: And what about lateral transference within the group? Brian Ashin: So lateral transference is the distorted feelings group members have towards one another. Adele feels annoyance towards Aaron for his criticism of her. The feelings of annoyance are real and expected to the circumstance. But if she reacts with rage, this might represent a deeper earlier hurt, or if she can't express her annoyance towards him then she might be making him more powerful and fearful (like a parent) then he really is. In addition to \"transference\" there is something more destructive in people's lives. This is what Harry Stack Sullivan called \"parataxic distortion.\" This is the individual's persistent tendency to distort his or her perception of others in ways that are damaging to healthy sustainable relationships. This is something that group therapy is particularly helpful in surfacing and resolving.BZ: A lot is going on in a group at any given moment, be it verbal or non- verbal. How do you sort it out, when you're part of it? Brian Ashin: Well, I realize I can't possibly know all that may be happening at any given time. I just try to be aware of what strikes me, I pay attention to others in the group and try to pay attention to what I might be experiencing myself. This oftentimes gives me some more information about what may be unspoken in the group. BZ: Talk about the power of group therapy. Brian Ashin: We say that the group recreates the original family and also becomes the second chance family where the difficulties arising from childhood can be reworked. Having people explore their relationships in the here and now in some way makes group members very important to each other. This allows for the surfacing of old destructive patterns arising out of childhood experiences. It's very powerful to have one's history come alive without even talking about history. BZ: How does one's family dynamic get recreated in a group setting? Brian Ashin: For example, John's father left his mother when his brother was born. John was eight at the time. His mother, a warm and caring person had to go to work to support the family. John was called upon to take care of his brother more than he really wanted to. But he was an obedient child and rose to the occasion. Over time, he took over the parenting while his mother went off to work to support them. John's resentment was hidden even from himself. John became a very giving and selfless father and employee. He could always be counted on to go the extra mile. John came to therapy and then to group because he felt depressed and emotionally depleted and was frequently turning on himself. In the group, other members felt a lot of warmth and gratitude to John, he was so caring of everyone. He took on the role of comforter and the balm that soothed every one's pain. Here we see John taking care of all his little brothers. Over time, others felt resentment towards John because they realized he never shared anything about himself. He would also fall into bouts of self attack in the group. John was not allowed (by himself) to be angry or to ask for anything for himself, so when other's began to express their resentment, rather than being angry with others, he would turn on himself. BZ: You said to me, \"Group therapy work is not about connecting per say, but understanding better how you connect in the world; not about having better relationships with others, but having a better relationship with yourself.\" Please explain what you mean, and give us some specifics. Brian Ashin: Group therapy, like any depth therapy aims to help people become more emotionally resilient, more able to take responsibility for oneself and one's choices and be more honest in their relationship to themselves and with others. What makes group different than individual therapy is that there are many more people in the room to have impressions about and reactions to. The increasing ability to reveal and explore your thoughts and feelings toward group members allows for greater self awareness. Alex is a placater, a people pleaser. She's afraid of and anticipates disapproval. Hidden beneath the need to please is a sadness and resentment. As other group members help her see she has other reactions than being \"nice\", she can develop the ability to be more honest and less self sacrificing. BZ: \"Group therapy is regressive -- you either tighten up and clamp down, or you begin to see your essential similarity to others.\" Say more. Brian Ashin: The condensing of time and the focus on the \"here and now\" surfaces people's needs for care and warmth, rivalrous and competitive feelings and the worry there is not enough attention to go around. People begin to feel childlike. If they can put these thoughts and feelings into words, it is a mature expression of what is universally experienced by all. If one feels too ashamed of these thoughts and feelings and can't speak of them, there's a tendency to deny them, wanting to banish them from awareness. That is the\" tightening up and clamping down.\" You probably know yourself what it's like when you have a strong feeling and want to say something to someone important but we have some fear, it causes inner turmoil. The relief comes when you speak up. Usually, others share the same thoughts and then one feels less alone, less different and less shame. BZ: People in groups can \"feel needy and greedy\"....more on that, also. Brian Ashin: I think I said people in groups can feel \"needy and greedy\" if they are ashamed of their desire for contact with others, for attention and particularly when early dependency needs get activated. Hopefully, they see others have the same needs and desires and the feelings get normalized. When people decrease their need to protect themselves from perceived criticism or rejection from others, they become free to make deeper connections and contact with others.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 40 Brian Ashin on the Richness and Rewards of Therapy Groups Continued from page 39 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 41 BZ: Revealing oneself is the most crucial part of the therapy process, yes? Brian Ashin: Yes, correct. If one can't be known, real intimacy, real connections with others can't happen. BZ: How does group work help a person go up the \"maturation ladder?\" Brian Ashin: Well, John has the opportunity to see how he's in some way frozen in the role of his brother's keeper, and everyone else's for that matter. His attempts to be loved by being a selfless person have led to depression and feeling depleted. In his group, with the feedback of others, his needs for being cared about, which he hides, can be expressed. He can develop the capacity to both give and receive, a more mature and fuller way to love and be loved. BZ: What's challenging in groups for you? Brian Ashin: I want my group members to have as worthwhile and powerful experience as I have had in my training groups. So, sometimes, I am challenged to be more patient and let things unfold at the group's pace, not how I want it to go. BZ: When you do run across a group that's resistant, what are some specific ways you might shift that? Brian Ashin: Greg may be sitting there morosely drumming his fingers. I might ask Adele what she thinks Greg is telling us with his drumming. He is putting thoughts and feelings into behavior and Adele's response may motivate Greg to speak his mind or her own, for that matter. BZ: What are the most important ingredients in creating a group that feels safe?Brian Ashin: A contract where all agree that attacking is not productive and the shared desire for exploration and understanding.BZ: What's in your contracts? Brian Ashin: The two most important points are that people put their thoughts and feelings they are having towards one another and the leader into words and not behaviors and that confidentiality is protected. All else is commentary. BZ: Who shouldn't one be in a group? Brian Ashin: People in the midst of a crisis, whether it be a psychiatric crisis or an emotional crisis like a divorce or other loss need the initial support of an attentive therapist. While groups are supportive at times, they are not support groups and someone in a crisis needs more individual attention. Also, people with addictions that are still active, i.e., not yet in solid recovery (they have their own style of helpful groups) and people who have impulse control difficulties. BZ: How many groups are you currently leading? Brian Ashin: I currently lead four groups. BZ: You mentioned to me that group therapy is less popular than it was at one time, and there are fewer groups currently taking place in Ann Arbor. Years ago, I used to lead T-Groups through Project Outreach at U-M, and students would get credit in the psychology department for being in the T-Groups. In any given trimester, perhaps a total of a hundred students would be enrolled in any one of 10 or 12 groups. While the T-Groups were not group therapy, they were groups in which the members were focused on what was happening within the group, in present time, and they were dynamic and powerful. What's now keeping people from joining therapy groups? Brian Ashin: Bill, those were the good old days. The seventies were a time of exciting experiential education. I remember taking part in T-Groups while a student. It was both scary and exciting at the same time. It really brought me face to face with my anxieties and provided an opportunity to be bold. But back to your question. For starters, there are economic reasons. When people want to use their insurance, they find there is a limit to sessions allowed. So they choose individual therapy, a model they are most familiar with. Most of my clients use their insurance with their individual therapist and pay out of pocket for \"Group therapy, like any depth therapy, aims to help people become more emotionally resilient, more able to take responsibility for oneself and one's choices, and be more honest in their relationship to themselves and with others.\"group therapy. It is also difficult to keep optimal critical mass up in groups. I think a lot of therapists got tired of trying to fill their groups so they gave up on them, and groups slowly disappeared from the scene. The group therapist also has to convey to potential group clients the efficacy of group therapy. This means working with the client's expected resistance. It is typical for a client to have resistance to joining a group out of fears of being seen in a negative light, or not wanting to share the therapist with others. A group therapist has to be confident in her or his group skills as well as believe in the power of group therapy. Without this confidence, it's difficult to encourage a prospective member to explore his or her resistance to entering group therapy. And, for a group to continue over the long haul, the therapist needs to have a firm grasp of group dynamics and skills specific to group therapy. This usually means a commitment to additional training. BZ: Brian, a couple of personal questions. Are you from Michigan, originally? Do you have children? If so, how old are they now, and tell us about them, briefly. Brian Ashin: I'm originally from New Jersey but l grew up in Michigan. We moved to Philadelphia in 1979 and returned in 1990. My son just finished up his masters in Sports Management and is living in the east, and my daughter is currently studying abroad. She talks of becoming a social worker like her mom and dad. BZ: What do you love about the Ann Arbor area in the fall? Brian Ashin: Ann Arbor is a great four season city. We're fortunate to live in the Huron River Valley. I love to kayak on the Huron during the fall when the leaves are changing color and the air is brisk. BZ: Thank you, Brian.

Vitals.com, the physician's rating website, has awarded him their Patient's Choice Award every year since 2008 (\"Of the nation's 720,000 active physicians, only 5 percent were accorded this honor by their patients\") and their Compassionate Doctor Recognition Award.Sickels, 44, was raised in Chicago. His father was a business manager at the University of Illinois, and his mother was a social worker. He received an undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Illinois, in 1991, and an MD from the University of Michigan in 2001. He is married to Amy Harris, and is the father of two daughters, Uma, age 20, and Linnea, age 14, and an 18 year old stepdaughter, Melanie. The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Malcolm Sickels, M.D. Integrating Alternative and Conventional Medicine to Find the Best of BothThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 43 Conversing with Dr. Sickels, one gets the simultaneous impression of a quick, lively intelligence, yet one that expresses itself in a laid-back, thoughtful manner. He is the opposite of a high-pressure salesman, yet he has strong opinions, is passionate about his work, and is very reassuring. Tall, slim, and relaxed in his body, Dr. Sickels clearly \"walks the walk,\" as well as \"talks the talk\" of healthy living. He lives not too far from his office on the west side of Ann Arbor, and arrived for our interview there on his scooter, on a chilly autumn night, sporting a colorful hat and accompanied by his aging dog, Sprout. Sandor Slomovits: How would you describe your work? Would \"holistic doctor\" be a good term? Dr. Malcolm Sickels: \"Holistic medicine\" tends to be more about looking at mind- body stuff, looking at the entire person, which certainly is encompassed in what I do, but does not really capture its essence. There's \"complementary medicine,\" where the idea is we're doing conventional medicine and we're adding additional things that are not normally in the realm of medicine: massage, music therapy, sometimes acupuncture, maybe some yoga \u2014 those are all complementary to the conventional treatment. But they do not interfere with, nor replace, the conventional treatments. \"Alternative medicine\" is, generally, things you would do instead of regular medicine, so instead of taking aspirin for a headache, you might do acupressure. I remember walking around in my old house on Seventh Street one day, trying to come up with a term to capture the essence of what I do. And I came up with \"integrative medicine,\" because it's not like we're throwing out conventional medicine, but we're trying to integrate the two things. We're going to try to find the best of both. And then I was dismayed later when I heard on the radio, I think it was Andrew Weil, talking about integrative medicine. I thought, \"Dang, I didn't come up with that.\" (Laughter) Sandor Slomovits: Is there medicine in your family? Dr. Malcolm Sickels: No, not at all.Sandor Slomovits : So, what led you to this? Dr. Malcolm Sickels: When I was in college, I got interested in herbal medicine because my roommate brought home a book of herbal stuff. Looking through that book was sort of a revelation, that there were other ways of treating people. Sandor: But you weren't on a doctor track at that point. Dr. Sickels: No. I was a psych major, which is sort of what you go into if you don't really know what you're going into. (Laughter) It's funny, because I'd never really gone to doctors much. I could probably have counted on one hand the number of times I'd been to a doctor. But that sort of planted the herbal bug in me. Then I did a study abroad in my last semester of college, in Vienna. And while I was there, I happened to go to a doctor because my toe had gotten stomped on at a concert. In Vienna, there was no big distinction between conventional medicine and herbal medicine. That was another revelation: Oh, there doesn't have to be this big schism between these things. Then I came back home and needed a job, and I started working at the Rudolf Steiner School here in Ann Arbor. There were parents who were doctors, but I got to know them as parents first and then later found out they were doctors, and that sort of ruptured the idea in my head that doctors are this breed apart. They were just regular people. You didn't have to be some come-down-from-the-sky-to-be-a-doctor and deign to be with regular people. Also, at the Steiner School it was not unusual for people to use homeopathic remedies, and they had Rescue Remedy in the office, so that helped reinforce things. And I was also working at Crazy Wisdom at that point. Sandor: Doing what? Dr. Sickels: You know, you just do everything at Crazy Wisdom. (Laughter) This was when they were on Fourth Avenue, in the little store.Sandor: And at the Steiner School? Dr. Sickels: I was doing after-care. I was there from when the kindergartners got out before lunch, till the end of the day. It was during this time that I started thinking I wanted to go into some kind of natural medicine. So, after one year here, my first daughter was born. My partner had to finish up school, so we spent another year here, and then we went to Madison, Wisconsin. There were no jobs, but I managed to get work at the natural food section of a big grocery store. That was when I really said, \"OK, I gotta try to find a way to bring these two things together,\" because people would come in and say, \"Oh, my doctor is doing this, my doctor didn't understand what I [wanted]...\" And I realized the problem was that doctors had no idea of what any of these alternative things are. They didn't know how to respond when their patients said, \"I don't want to do this, is there something more natural to do?\" So I said, \"I guess somebody has to do it,\" and I didn't see anybody else doing it ( laughs ), so I said, \"OK, I guess I gotta do it!\" We came back to Ann Arbor in 1994, and I started taking the pre-reqs for med school and then started doing the things I had to do to apply. You have to take the MCAT and I actually took it before I took some of the classes [for the subjects] that were on it, like organic chemistry, and still did pretty well. I guess that impressed the U of M Medical School enough to let me in. The key thing is that I went to medical school specifically to do both sides. A lot of doctors who are doing what I do were originally conventional docs, and often either they or a family member had some kind of health crisis that was not addressed adequately, and that was when the veils were removed from their eyes and they started looking at other things. Sandor: You studied conventional medicine at U-M. Dr. Sickels: I figured if I was going into medicine, I had to learn the medicine side of it because, number one, I don't want to kill anybody. I don't want to have somebody die through me not knowing the conventional things. But I was still keeping a toe in the other stuff. There was a small group of students who were vaguely interested in alternative medicine and, once in awhile, there would be a talk about something alternative. Second year, we did systems. We'd go over an entire system of the body, like the endocrine system, or the pulmonary system, and then we would have a final for that system. I thought it would be interesting for people to see the other things that are out there, so I'd send out an email after the finals (so I wouldn't screw up their tests) about other approaches to that system, which were mostly just pulled out of this big book called Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide , because I didn't really know that much about it at the time. And all the feedback I got from students was positive, and I never heard anything negative about it from faculty \u2014 except for one faculty guy who, during a talk, mentioned shark cartilage disparagingly. During the fourth year we had electives, and I managed to pull two electives on alternative medicine stuff. There was one with a doctor who is still at the University, and the other was in a North Westland clinic where there were a couple of doctors doing alternative medicine stuff. Bill Zirinsky: Are there some areas that you tend to specialize in, working with particular medical problems or maladies? Dr. Sickels: I was trained in family medicine, so I'm comfortable in dealing with a broad range of problems. The reason I went into family medicine was to be able to treat anyone walking in the door. Any other specialty restricts who the appropriate patients are: internal medicine only treats adults, gynecology only treats women, etc. But, yes, there are things that I take more of an interest in, as well as things that I feel I have had more success with. Recently, I have been taking more of an interest in cancer. Cancer is one of the most heartbreaking conditions to treat. The stakes are high, the treatments are appallingly expensive and unpleasant, and very little progress has been made in conventional treatments, despite all of the money spent and new drugs that have come out. It turns out that there are ways to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy using natural agents, as well as ways of using those same chemotherapeutic agents at lower doses, to reduce the toxicity and to achieve good outcomes.I went to medical school specifically to do both sides...I figured if I was going into medicine, I had to learn the medicine side of it because, number one, I don't want to kill anybody. I don't want to have somebody die through me not knowing the conventional things. But I was still keeping a toe in the other stuff. Thyroid is another hormone that can be a frustrating problem for many people. Unfortunately, the orthodox approach to thyroid disease is to base all treatments on a single lab test, called TSH. However, keeping the TSH in the \"normal range\" doesn't always alleviate the patient's symptoms...I've been using an approach that seems radical compared to this: Getting the patient's thyroid hormones to the point where the patient feels good. Continued on 44 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 44 Unfortunately, using these methods doesn't earn a hospital any more money, and may substantially reduce their charges. So, there is a financial disincentive for them to do anything like this. Then, since these methods don't involve the potential for large payouts, there is very little research being done. So, insurance doesn't cover them and they are considered \"experimental.\" So, the irony is that even though these methods are less expensive than conventional routes, the patient may end up paying more, since insurance doesn't cover them. Bill Zirinsky: Are there other conditions with which you've had success where traditional medicine has failed, or has not been as effective as it should be? Dr. Sickels: I find that taking care of hormonal issues is important, because there is so much misinformation and misunderstanding. I have been seeing a concerning amount of low testosterone levels in men. The Massachusetts Male Aging Study in 2004 showed that not only does testosterone normally decline in men as they get older, but also each generation's testosterone levels are lower than the previous generation's. So, clearly, there is something in our environment driving down men's testosterone. I've seen many men with low testosterone, some as young as their late 30s. When we replace the testosterone to normal, physiologic levels, they get a return of the energy and mood that they should have. After the Women's Health Initiative Study demonstrated that women taking Prempro had a higher risk of breast cancer and blood clots, the reporting on the actual results was so poor that even now, ten years later, women are still scared about treating their menopausal and other hormonal symptoms. I was in residency when the Women's Health Initiative hit the news. I have to admit, I was a bit perplexed as to why all the doctors were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Prempro consists of the horse estrogen Premarin and the synthetic progestin Provera, a progesterone-like compound. What I had learned in medical school, and what was in the Physician 's Desk Reference, was that Provera increases the risk of breast cancer and blood clots. What did they expect? Apparently, doctors had become so used to handing out Prempro like candy that they forgot that it's not a very safe drug. In the ensuing media frenzy, the reporting generalized Prempro to hormones in general, and so women became scared of using any hormones at all. In the original study, there were three groups: Placebo, Prempro, and Premarin only. When the news broke of the risks of Prempro, the Prempro arm [of the study] was stopped, but the other two arms continued to completion and did not show the risks that Prempro had. Clearly, the risk was all from the synthetic progestin in Prempro. This nonsense even went so far as to confuse the legislators in California, so that they declared progesterone as a carcinogen rather than the true culprit, the synthetic progestins. Other researchers demonstrated that the synthetic progestins are, indeed, the culprit. A study in France with nearly 35,000 women showed that using synthetic progestin increased the risk of breast cancer by 40 percent, while using real progesterone did not increase \u2014 and may have decreased \u2014 the rate of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The women who took real progesterone, along with estrogen, had a 10 percent lower rate of breast cancer than women who took no hormones at all, but it wasn't considered \"statistically significant.\" Finally, in addition to the male and female hormones, thyroid is another hormone that can be a frustrating problem for many people. Unfortunately, the orthodox approach to thyroid disease is to base all treatments on a single lab test, called TSH. However, keeping the TSH in the \"normal range\" doesn't always alleviate the patient's symptoms. So, the patient may come in with all the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, but if their TSH test appears normal, they will simply be sent home still feeling miserable. I've been using an approach that seems radical compared to this: Getting the patient's thyroid hormones to the point where the patient feels good. It's strange that treating a patient to the point where they feel good seems an exception to the standard approach, rather than the rule, but that's the way things are done these days. Bill Zirinsky: Will you talk about a few common chronic medical conditions \u2014 and how you frame these issues within the broader context of an \"integrative\" approach? Dr. Sickels: Abdominal pain and reflux can be really interesting to treat. One common cause of abdominal pain and reflux can be a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori . This bacterium was described in the 1980s, when it was discovered to be the major cause of gastric ulcers. Now, this was 30 years ago, and five years ago the discoverers got the Nobel Prize for this. That same year, I saw patients who had [been diagnosed with] gastric ulcer disease and yet none had ever been checked for Helicobacter pylori . The treatment for this is fairly straightforward and fairly effective. There are ways to enhance the conventional treatment of H. pylori to improve the effectiveness of the medication and reduce side effects while improving healing. So, I would say that just about everybody with abdominal pain or reflux deserves to be checked for H. pylori with a simple lab test. Otherwise, a physical exam to identify the location of tenderness on the patient's abdomen is crucial for helping narrow down the causes of abdominal pain. Reflux can be related to weakness of the lower esophageal sphincter (between the stomach and esophagus), often due to low stomach acid production. The lower esophageal sphincter closes in response to acid. So when acid production is low, the lower esophageal sphincter doesn't close all the way, and what acid is present can come up the esophagus and bother the patient. Normally, stomach acid production decreases with age and with stress, and these are the same circumstances under which reflux tends to appear. For some patients, food sensitivities cause reflux, abdominal pain, gas, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation. Isolating disease sensitivities can take some work, but ultimately are a huge payoff as the patient can safely avoid the offending foods, as well as avoid the acid-blocking drugs that are so often prescribed. These drugs are not very safe, as they can cause bone loss due to decreased calcium absorption, pneumonia, and a host of other problems. Unfortunately, many of these medications are available over-the-counter, so people suffering from these problems are self-medicating with these drugs and missing the real problem. Finally, another often-ignored cause of reflux is sleep apnea. When somebody has sleep apnea, the upper airway is blocked. The body is trying to pull air into the lungs and so creates a vacuum in the chest. While no air is coming down the windpipe, this vacuum in the chest will pull stomach contents up into the esophagus and cause reflux. This is another situation in which a condition that is relatively straightforward to address can cause symptoms that are not commonly recognized as being connected. In my experience, nearly everybody with a hiatal hernia has sleep apnea. (A hiatal hernia is where part of the stomach has been pulled up past the diaphragm into the chest, which is also another common cause of reflux.) I first made this realization in residency and later did a literature search and noticed there were supporting articles demonstrating the connection between sleep apnea and hiatal hernias. As long as we're talking about gut issues, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is another frustrating yet interesting condition to treat. I say \"frustrating\" because in orthodox medicine there is no good treatment for it. However, there are a few things that can provide long-lasting improvements. The first is avoiding food sensitivities, as I discussed previously as a cause of abdominal pain and reflux. The second is treating bacterial overgrowth, which can disrupt the normal flora. This can be treated in a couple ways. The simplest way is simply to give probiotics, or \"good bacteria.\" There are a number of probiotic formulas on the market and many of them will be helpful. Recently, I have been taking more of an interest in cancer... It turns out that there are ways to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy using natural agents, as well as ways of using those same chemotherapeutic agents at lower doses, to reduce the toxicity and to achieve good outcomes.The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Malcolm Sickels, M.D. Continued from 43 One common cause of abdominal pain and reflux can be a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. This bacterium was described in the 1980s, when it was discovered to be the major cause of gastric ulcers. Now, this was 30 years ago, and five years ago the discoverers got the Nobel Prize for this. That same year, I saw patients who had [been diagnosed with] gastric ulcer disease and yet none had ever been checked for Helicobacter pylori.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 45 However, sometimes the problem can be a little more deeply seated. When bacteria live in a human system, they will form what is known as a \"biofilm.\" This makes it harder for the bacteria to be destroyed by antibiotics, as well as helping them to avoid being washed away in the normal tides of the body. So, last year, there was a study that showed that a new antibiotic called Xifaxan, which doesn't get absorbed and just stays in the gut along with food and such, can be effective in reducing the symptoms of IBS. However, it looked like the study showed that the symptoms would improve only for a month or so. In my early experience with this new medication, that seemed to be the case as well. Once I put the pieces about biofilms and this medication together, however, I realized that if we treat the biofilm at the same time that we treat with the antibiotic, we could probably get a more effective result. So, by combining this medication with natural agents that break down the biofilm, as well as supplementing the patient with good bacteria and other natural substances, I've gone from getting a one-month reprieve from IBS in these patients to a long-lasting improvement. Sandor: What is the best thing about being a doctor? Dr. Sickels: Some of the best things are when I get people better; people who have had chronic problems that no doctor has been able to solve. Once in awhile you get someone where, after the first visit, they're like, \"Oh my god, this is better!\" I had somebody a couple of days ago who said that, since the treatment I gave her, she had a period without cramps \u2014 which was unheard-of for her. That's really nice, that makes me feel like I'm doing some good. I think any doctor is going to say [that the best thing about being a doctor is] when they find that they've helped somebody; those are the things that make it all worthwhile. But one of the things that keeps me going for the long run is knowing that I'm offering people options that they wouldn't have had if I wasn't here. A lot of the time they would never have known about it otherwise and they might never have had such a good outcome. I also think it's important to empower patients to find the things that work for them, to find a way of taking things or a treatment that works for their ethics and their mode of operation. I feel like I'm more of a facilitator of their health than a shepherd of their health. I say, \"Here are the options you have, these are the pros and cons of them as I see it, and it's up to you which way you want to pursue this. If you want to do something that's more natural, we can go this way; if you want to do something more medically oriented, then we can go this way; [or] we can take a middle path...\" BZ: What is most difficult for you about being a doctor? Dr. Sickels: I think the problem that all health care providers have is taking care of themselves. Over and over I've seen people who are involved in health care, or anyone who is caring for others, whether it is parents caring for children, adult children caring for parents, or whatever, that the care providers put themselves last. They end up burning out. The thing I have to remind myself, and I find myself telling other care providers, is that if you don't take care of yourself, you can't help others. For these people, taking care of yourself is taking care of others. So, for me, being able to put aside medicine and to wipe medical things from my mind can be a struggle. I often find myself thinking about patients' issues while I'm away from the office. Sometimes I come up with a solution to a patient's problem while I'm in the shower. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can be bothersome at times! Sandor: Anything else that's worth noting, in terms of what's challenging? Dr. Sickels: Keeping up with all the new information. There used to be maybe two journals on alternative medicine; now there's a whole pile of them. Plus all the conferences; at this point I go to maybe four conferences a year. I could go to way more than a dozen. To try to learn how to best approach all the different things going on with my patients can get overwhelming. I only have so much time in the day to learn this stuff; I only have so much energy and brain space. I try to do the best I can. That's the hard part, when I don't feel I can help somebody, and I have to say, \"I've run out of ideas.\" The nice thing about what I do is that there are usually many alternatives that the person hasn't tried. BZ: What are your strengths as a physician? Dr. Sickels: When I see patients, I spent a lot of time with them. My new patient visits are usually two hours and can last even longer. Patients with complicated problems, or patients who have problems that have never been adequately addressed, will have a hard time ever getting a good solution to their problems until somebody understands the entire problem and all of its different aspects.I had somebody a couple of days ago who said that, since the treatment I gave her, she had a period without cramps \u2014 which was unheard-of for her. That's really nice, that makes me feel like I'm doing some good If you want to do something that's more natural, we can go this way; if you want to do something more medically oriented, then we can go this way; [or] we can take a middle path...

When I spend enough time with patients, I get the full picture of the problem, and I can then tease apart the symptoms to see what the underlying pathology is and address the problem in a more systemic fashion. So, having the persistence to find out the entire scope of the patient's symptoms and how they started and what contributes to them is important to finding a solution, but equally important is having a broad range of therapies available to be able to address the problem. Pharmaceuticals have their place, and can be very helpful for certain circumstances. However, we have to realize their shortcomings. While they may be very effective for acute problems, their suitability for chronic problems is often diminished by their side effects. Having additional options for treatment, such as nutritional support, herbs, dietary changes, and other therapies, can be essential for finding a good solution to a patient's problems. One other thing my patients have said they appreciate about me is that I treat them as equals. I tend to give my patients information: What I think is going on with them; what the possible solutions are, both orthodox and otherwise; what the potential risks and benefits are of the different solutions, etc. Then, they can make an informed decision about what they want to do. Every patient has a different approach to life and only they can decide what is going to fit with their life. I've had patients refer to me as more of a coach or consultant. Sandor: Do you get frustrated with patients who don't do what you advise them to do?Dr. Sickels: If you read the magazines for regular docs, like American Family Physician , there is all this talk about patient compliance: \"How can we get our patients to do what we tell them to do?\" and that the patient compliance rate for taking medications is atrocious. But in my practice, that has completely not been a problem, because I take the time to explain to my patients what their condition is, how this medication or other treatment will influence it, and give them other options. So, if they end up taking the medication, it's because they have made a decision to do that. My patient compliance is pretty close to 100 percent. When somebody comes back and says they haven't taken something, they usually have a good reason. But I don't take it as a failure of mine or of the patient's. If the patient doesn't do what we talked about, what was the issue? Was it that it didn't work for them? Or didn't I explain it right? We negotiate to find out where the problem is and what we're going to do. Every patient is unique, you can't expect to take a cookie-cutter approach and just hand the same thing to each person. The orthodox paradigm for how to treat patients is this dictatorial thing where, if you don't do what we tell you, then we have to leverage something into making you do the thing that we're prescribing. [But] the idea that \"medicine knows best\" is not always true. I've seen people who did things other than what either I, or regular medicine, prescribed and found better ways of getting themselves better. There's something that's been said in medical school for a long time: \"Half of what they're teaching us in medical school is wrong \u2014 they just don't know which half.\" (Laughter) Doctors seem to forget that by the time they get out. BZ: Patients tend not to tell their conventional doctors when they're going to non-traditional medical practitioners, or using herbs, or trying non-conventional remedies, because that means their conventional approach has failed. Do you find that your patients will tell you when your less traditional approaches don't work? Dr. Sickels: I agree that sometimes patients will try to please (or at least not offend) the doctor; however, I haven't found that to be much of a problem with my patients. Generally, when I see a patient on a return visit, I specifically ask about everything we've changed since the last time, to see whether it's working or not. I encourage them to tell me either way.I don't want to be right; I want to know what's working for this person. Since everybody's unique, I don't expect that a particular treatment must work for all patients. Even when a patient can be shy about admitting that something I offered didn't work, I usually can ferret it out by pressing them, and letting them know that it's okay if it didn't work. It's true that practitioners can often be resistant to hearing that their treatments didn't work. However, I think that's a large part of the reason that patients are driven away from conventional doctors, who are convinced medications will always work and that, if they don't work, it's the patient's fault. I don't think that blaming the patient for the failure of a medication is a constructive avenue. And, it is true that alternative practitioners are subject to the same conceits. I've seen descriptions of people saying that they know their therapies worked because the patient didn't come back. To me, that doesn't tell you anything. It could be the patient didn't come back because it didn't work. I always want evidence that something worked. I wonder if the reason that practitioners are resistant to hearing that their therapies did not work is that they have run out of other ideas. If they only have one or two therapies, they don't want to hear that none of their ideas have worked. I find that by having a large supply of possible treatments, it makes it easier to reassure the patient that there are other possibilities in case this treatment doesn't work. In addition, as a physician, I can refer the patient to specialists who might have ideas that I don't. BZ: Are you willing to work with patients who also like to see other doctors and practitioners? Dr. Sickels: Of course! I would be pretty arrogant if I thought I was the only doctor who had the solution to my patients' problems. There are many roads to Rome. Frankly, I have many patients who continue to see their regular physician and only see me for solutions to their deeper problems that their regular physician has had no success with. In addition, sometimes there are issues for which they're seeing a specialist that are being managed perfectly reasonably and I don't need to intervene. Sandor: How would you run the health care system?Dr. Sickels: I don't want to run the health care system! (Laughter) The fundamental problem is that the paradigm is wrong. We don't have a health care system; we have an illness care system. We don't have a health promotion system. There are too many moneyed interests that want to protect their interests and will \"game\" the system to work in their favor. The bottom line of what I would like to do would be to have more alternative things in the mix: more focus on improved diet, better eating and exercise, and reducing costs by reducing expenditures \u2014 by doing preventative stuff. If instead of putting money into dealing with obesity and diabetes, we put money into educating kids properly on how to eat, and having people selling unhealthy food not do that (laughs ), I think we'd have much better outcomes. We know for sure this isn't working, because people are getting worse; obesity rates are skyrocketing, diabetes rates are skyrocketing. BZ: Are you associated with one of the area hospitals, and if not, why not? Dr. Sickels: No, I don't work at any of the hospitals. Inpatient (hospital) medicine is a different beast from outpatient (office) medicine, and I have to keep on top of both conventional as well as alternative outpatient medicine as it is. This is already an enormous job and staying on top of the inpatient medicine, in addition to everything else, would mean that I would not be able to maintain the quality of care that I want to. There are hospitalists who specialize in inpatient medicine and are readily available to deal with the inevitable things that arise during the hospitalization. Office physicians are busy with [office] patients during the day, so care of hospitalized patients that comes up during the day is going to be compromised. Acute care is the thing that brought conventional medicine to the fore. When somebody is having a heart attack or an overwhelming infection, they need medicine, and the hospital is the appropriate place for them. Now that's not to The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Malcolm Sickels, M.D. Continued from 45 Being able to put aside medicine and to wipe medical things from my mind can be a struggle. I often find myself thinking about patients' issues while I'm away from the office. The idea that...alternative [medical interventions] are completely made up and unsupported by research is wrong. A lot of the stuff I do has very good research behind it. I have many patients who continue to see their regular physician and only see me for solutions to their deeper problems that their regular physician has had no success with.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 47 say that there aren't things that conventional medicine could be doing better for hospitalized patients. Recent research has shown that postsurgical patients are universally deficient in vitamin C, and that vitamin C improved the mood of acutely hospitalized patients. So, is vitamin C being given to hospitalized patients routinely? Not that I know of. I tend to give my patients information... Then, they can make an informed decision about what they want to do. Sandor : Has it been difficult to make a case for alternative medicine? Dr. Sickels: A lot of the older doctors who have been doing alternative medicine for a long time are nervous and very paranoid, because they've been raked over the coals by conventional medicine. They are, and frankly rightly so, nervous and paranoid because they were unfairly targeted by conventional medicine. Conventional medicine was pointing at alternative practitioners as a way of distracting people from their own [conventional medicine's] problems. The idea that the things that are alternative are completely made up and unsupported by research is wrong. A lot of the stuff I do has very good research behind it. It may not be a double-blind, placebo control trial, because that's expensive, and nobody is going to pick up the tab for it. But there is data supporting it. That's something that isn't well understood: There is research supporting a lot of what we do. That's not to say that all alternative medicine is supported by research. Some of the stuff that has no research behind it I don't feel comfortable doing, even though I've had patients go and do this stuff and have good results. I've also had patients go and do some of this stuff and had nothing happen. I don't feel like I can do things that don't have any plausible scientific basis, but I know doctors who do things like that and get good results. The one thing that I know for sure is that I don't know everything. And the one thing that science knows for sure is that we don't know everything. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people in medicine who do think they know everything and, by doing that, they are limiting what people can do to get their health better. Sandor: Do you feel concerned about becoming overly cautious or paranoid? Dr. Sickels: I think the sands have shifted quite a bit. Even conventional doctors are starting to mention alternative things. So, I think that it's not as hostile as it used to be and we don't have to constantly watch our back, but it's entirely dependent on the makeup of the medical boards. The medical boards of some states are incredibly hostile to alternative medicine, even to the point of neglecting going after clearly bad doctors who are handing out narcotic prescriptions, and having sex with patients, things like that, and instead committing the resources of the state to going after alternative practitioners who never had a complaint lodged against them by a patient. Sandor: The Ann Arbor community is probably pretty friendly to alternative medicine.Dr. Sickels: Yes, Ann Arbor is, but the make-up of the state board is determined by the governor, and the people on the state medical board are often political appointees of whoever is in power. With big, moneyed corporations like drug companies getting more power these days, that may influence who is on the medical boards and what path they want to take in terms of pursuing practitioners. In the past, medical boards have been very hostile to alternative medicine. They do not seem to be quite so hostile as they used to be, but that that could change at any time. Doctors who are going off the beaten track are putting themselves at risk by doing so. It's not a decision we make lightly. The standard of care for actually caring for patients has dropped dramatically, where patient visits can be measured in the number of minutes the doctor spends with you. When you're trying to get patients in and out in five to ten minutes, there is no time to understand what's going on with the patient. And if you don't spend enough time with the patient, you will not know what is going on with that patient, and you cannot treat that patient appropriately. I call that poor care. The business of medicine has such tight margins that outpatient clinics have to get as much money out of their doctors as possible and make them see untenable numbers of patients. That's why we see people unhappy with their doctors, and why doctors are unhappy. They're not pleased with the outcomes either, but they feel like they don't have any choice, that they have to see this number of patients. And I think that doctors are taking the easy way out, saying they don't have any choice. (Laughter) I'm making a lot less than the average doctor; I'm probably making half what a conventional doc gets. But I think I'm a lot happier than they are, and a lot more satisfied with what I'm doing. BZ: Who are medical role models for you?Dr. Sickels: I have to admit that I don't know that many doctors. One doctor who I have a lot of respect for is Jonathan Wright, who is one of the early nutritional doctors and is still in practice out near Seattle, Washington. He pioneered many of the therapies that we are still using today, and has been very good about sharing his knowledge and continuing to investigate promising therapies. He has also been through tremendous hardships and attacked for using unconventional therapies, had his office raided, and had his license threatened.In that vein, there have been many other doctors who have paved the way, including the doctors who discovered Helicobacter pylori , who were ridiculed and disparaged by the surgeons who were doing ulcer surgery at that point. They persevered and were eventually proven correct and, as I said, in 2005 they received a Nobel Prize. There are others who have gone through similar trials to give us the medical knowledge that we have today. BZ: Are you married? And do you have children? If so, tell us who they are and how old they are. Dr. Sickels: Yes, I'm married. [My wife and I] often think of marriage as one of the best-kept secrets. It's wonderful to be able to come home and feel comfortable with somebody who is supportive and makes me look forward to coming home. I have two children. One is 20 and the other is 14. The older one put me through the wringer, but seems to have come into her own, and the younger one is developing wonderfully. I also have a stepdaughter who is 18 and is doing fabulously, enjoying a year exploring new places between high school and college. Her horizons seem limitless. BZ: What do you love to do with your family most, in the springtime, in the Ann Arbor area? Dr. Sickels: My daughter and I keep bees, so the spring is a time when we get to see how the bees made it through the winter and get things prepared for the new year. It's always nice to see them busying themselves seeking out the new blossoms. The spring honey is often the most delightful, as it brings some of the nicest flavors to the honey. We also enjoy new produce in the spring. It's nice to go to the Farmers' Market and to see, and cook with, the new arrivals. Also, spring is when I can bring out my electric scooter \u2014 locally made at Current Motor Company \u2014 and my daughter and I, or any of the other family members I can entice onto it, can go around town on it. BZ: Where would you love to travel, that you haven't been to? Dr. Sickels: I would like to go visit Machu Picchu sometime, but it seems a long way off and like it would be an extravagant trip. Australia would also be a wonderful place to visit, but it's also far away. BZ: What do you like to read for pleasure, when you're not being inundated with medical journals, and paraphernalia from pharmaceutical companies? Any favorite books of the last few years? Dr. Sickels: Hold on there \u2014 I don't get any paraphernalia from pharmaceutical companies! I don't allow drug reps at all in my office. Nor supplement reps either, for that matter. I think it's important to be beholden to my patients, not to company representatives who try to buy my allegiance with trinkets and food. Would you feel confident about going to a lawyer who has learned legal information from ads? That's what doctors are doing when they get \"detailed\" by drug reps. The reps are walking advertisements, and I have kept them at arm's length ever since I caught them lying while I was in residency. I've had this policy in my office for a long time now. When I found a website called NoFreeLunch.org, which lists doctors who pledge not to accept visits from drug reps, I was the only doctor in the area who was listed. Since then, I have been joined by many others, and the University of Michigan has apparently also decided to keep the drug reps away from the hospital. Now as far as books go, I'm currently in the middle of a book called I Dreamt of Sausage, by Corinna Borden. It's the personal account of her experience being treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma with conventional and alternative therapies while she was here in Ann Arbor. I have to admit that I have a hard time getting away from medical things, even when I'm reading on my own time. I also read a lot of little things here and there, the science section of The New York Times, and bits of magazines that I get around my office, such as Ode, Mental Floss , Good, the BBC Knowledge Magazine, and the Christian Science Monitor. When I was in residency, I was appalled at the magazines in the waiting area. So I decided that when I had my own office, I would have magazines that are uplifting and stimulating. BZ: What do you do for recreation, sports, pleasure?Dr. Sickels: Didn't I mention that health care providers have a hard time doing things for themselves? (Laughter) Malcolm Sickels, M.D., P .C., practices medicine at 210 Little Lake Drive, Suite 10, in Ann Arbor. He can be reached at his clinic at 734-332-9936 or through his website, drsickels.com. The fundamental problem is that the paradigm is wrong. We don't have a health care system; we have an illness care system. We don't have a health promotion system.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 48 By Jen Eberbach and Maureen McMahon People from all over the world come to Ann Arbor to live, work, and learn. We have a reputation for being a cultural destination in the Midwest, something we take pride in, but what is the proof that Ann Arbor is a welcoming place for immigrants and temporary international residents? What are some of the impressions and experiences of people who have come to settle here? Our approach to this feature arose from a belief that our community is stronger because of its diversity. To illuminate this, Jen Eberbach set out to profile a sample of groups and resources serving immigrants and visitors to Ann Arbor and Maureen McMahon spoke to a range of people to get their impressions of what it's like to move here and how it compares to their places of origin. Of course, when talking about people from all over the world \u2014 with different backgrounds, beliefs, needs, and expectations \u2014 generalizations cannot be made. So it is with a spirit of interest and appreciation that Jen and Maureen connected with this small sample of groups and people and asked them to share their impressions, all the while understanding that this feature could never fill out the complete picture of immigration in Ann Arbor, but that it could hopefully engage our readership in an interesting one of how people are connecting and what their impressions are of coming here. Hello World, Welcome to Ann Arbor Members of the International Neighbors' hiking group at the Nichols Arboretum Peony GardenThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 49 I'm Here, Now What? Organizations and Businesses Help Internationals Access Ann Arbor By Jen Eberbach In my estimation, the more a community can offer international populations, the more likely it is going to be a comfortable place to land and get acclimated to life in a foreign country. As I set out to explore some local organizations and institutions that are helping immigrants and international people feel welcome in town, some best practices began to emerge. I found many amazing groups working to increase people's access to city life and resources, encourage community engagement and friendships, provide educational opportunities, inform people about their rights (and help them if there is trouble), or help people acclimate in other ways. These groups are working to build strength through diversity and have ample opportunities for more people to get involved in their work. International Neighbors Make Nice House Guests \"Making people feel welcome is at the heart of our mission,\" says Martha Bhatia, the president of local women's social activity group International Neighbors. The group centers on a number of socially oriented activities that foster friendships among women. Currently, about 800 women from 50 countries, including U.S. \"hostesses,\" participate in the volunteer run non-profit. \"No matter where you are from, the common experience is that you are in this new place together \u2014 that's key,\" Bhatia explains. \"In social situations, women will discuss what their questions or concerns are with each other. They share a lot of advice amongst themselves about life in Ann Arbor \u2014 from things like where to buy certain products and what grocery stores carry food from their country, to how to sell a car, to being homesick. The international women treat the women from here like we are their American family and ask us for advice. It becomes a self-engaging group.\" What started as a small \"Tea Group\" in 1958, based around American women inviting spouses of international U-M scholars and students to their homes, has expanded beyond its university affiliation and into a full-fledged program of social activities for large and small groups of women throughout Ann Arbor. Activities like knitting, cooking, hiking, and other \"special interest\" groups give women something fun to do that does not require any English skills. And casual English conversation and discussion groups allow non-native speakers to practice everyday conversation skills. \"It's not textbookish ESL training. It's not about perfect grammar, but rather how to use English in practical ways,\" Bhatia explains. For example, they take women out to buy groceries together and practice the English names of the foods they are buying. Bhatia also hosts a film discussion group that provides a casual opportunity to practice English. Mariko Suzuki, a young Japanese woman who followed her husband to U-M and already has a good grasp of the language, recently attended a monthly \"International Day\" celebrating the hats of the world so that she could practice speaking with other English language learners. \"The difference between being in an international community and just an American community is that we feel comfortable listening to English that is slow. If you go directly into an American community, they speak really fast! Here, we don't get intimidated because everyone is struggling to get their words out,\" she says. Natasha Sheera, a young Indian woman who also followed her husband to town, makes the point that \"it's really nice to meet people from different places rather than just staying in a group from your own particular country.\" Adding, \"I don't just want to hang out the whole time with only people from my own country, I have that at home.\" Martha Bhatia, president of International Neighbors The International Neighbors Fall Reception is open to the public and will be on Thursday, September 20, 2012, from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. at Westminster Presbyterian at 1500 Scio Church Road in Ann Arbor.

It becomes a self-engaging group.\" -Martha Bhatia, president of International Neighbors Second-generation Chinese American writer and activist Frances Kai-Hwa Wang serves as the Outreach Coordinator for Ann Arbor Chinese Center of MichiganPhoto by Andrew Fang of photasa, photasa.comNot Getting Lost in Translation Acquiring language skills is a big part of acclimating to a new place, and depending on a person's level of comprehension, he or she might need help translating and understanding all sorts of important documents \u2014 from legal documents to letters from a child's teacher. Luckily, Ann Arbor has a number of different types of ESL classes and tutoring groups, including some that offer test preparation and programs geared toward the business community and translation services. Some are even free of charge, like the Ann Arbor Public Schools adult ESL program at Stone School and Washtenaw Literacy, which is based in Ypsilanti and offers free ESL tutoring and conversation practice one-on-one and in groups. Others like Rec & Ed, Washtenaw Community College, and Ypsilanti Public Schools charge tuition for ESL instruction. More intensive ESL programs are available through places like Access International and the Michigan Language Center. Language Link also offers ESL and test preparation for all different age groups. A Little Something from Everywhere Part of what draws immigrants and visitors to Ann Arbor is that they know they can find pieces of home in a foreign land. Our town boasts many cultural organizations, religious communities, ethnic restaurants and groceries, and culturally specific arts and entertainment offerings. With a major university here the presence of multiculturalism is a given \u2014 simply take a glimpse over the list of student groups at the University of Michigan and it's like reading a roll call at the U.N. Still, the town holds its own in terms of how many non-university community partners are coming together to celebrate and encourage diversity. One person who is particularly clued into the diverse range of cultural organizations and community-building activities in town is Frances Kai-Hwa Wang, a second-generation Chinese American writer, speaker, educator, and social justice activist. Kai-Hwa Wang regularly writes a column called \"Adventures in Multicultural Living\" and says keeping an ear to the ground for what is happening in the multicultural community \"is easy these days with the Internet. You just get on mailing lists and you know exactly what's going on all the time, especially with groups promoting events. I get hundreds of emails, so I know what's going on with the Malaysian community, the Arab community, and so forth,\" she says. \"There is a network of people asking people, passing along information through word of mouth. It's always been done that way, but now with the Internet, it's even easier,\" she explains. What people need to feel welcome can \"depend on where they come from, why they're here, what age they are, what their expectation level is, and where they are settling, and different preconceived notions about immigrants,\" she says. She notes it is important to have a diverse array of groups, \"and the more different cultural groups are covered by a single group, the harder they are to run.\" One active group in town she mentioned is the Chinese American Society of Ann Arbor (CASAA), which provides opportunities to learn American customs and to share and participate in Chinese cultural traditions. Among many programs focused on creating friendships and providing community education is a yearly Thanksgiving dinner intended to introduce Chinese and Taiwanese Americans to what is for them generally an obscure holiday. Kai-Hwa Wang is the Outreach Coordinator for a different Chinese cultural group, the Ann Arbor Chinese Center of Michigan. This group provides a Chinese school where children of any background can attend classes and extracurricular activities on Friday evenings at Northside Elementary. Part of her outreach is to \"take kids out into the community to perform and share their cultural traditions.\" Participating and sharing their heritage is a source of \"pride and confidence\" for the children. During the Chinese New Year celebration, \"You could just see a sense of pride in their culture and heritage on their faces when they realized that other people who came out for the event were so interested in learning about their culture,\" she explains. We discussed how finding a place to practice religion is another big factor when it comes to feeling comfortable and engaging in community life in Ann Arbor. \"Take people from Asian countries as an example. There are so many different nationalities and religions. The Korean churches are really strong here and internationally. There is a Chinese Christian Church. Jewel Heart is there for Tibetans, and there are other Buddhist places, and so on,\" she says. Ann Arbor's religious institutions and spiritual communities cover many of the world's religions, like Judaism, Islam, Catholicism, different types of reformed Christianity, Hinduism, and we are also known for being a place that fosters uncommon or alternative spiritual practices. Other things Ann Arbor's international community can find here are many diverse arts and cultural events, programming that explores world cultures, and a good variety of grocery stores and restaurants with cuisines to suit international pallets. Ligia Ivanco, a young woman from Romania, says, \"It's easy to find groceries and food here. I found a small store, Copernicus, that has a lot of Europe-style food I eat. Even the bigger places like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's are places you can find food that is similar to home.\" Getting Started GuidesMany people figure out new customs by informal means or just by spending more time in a new place, but if you've ever traveled or lived abroad, you know that a good guidebook also comes in handy when you're trying to function in a new country. A number of groups in town publish information for newcomers. International Neighbors publishes a hard-copy and online version of their \"Living in Ann Arbor: A Guidebook for International Families,\" based on the questions that women in the group commonly ask. It covers topics like common social customs in Ann Arbor, shopping, transportation, how to use the post office, where to look for healthcare services, and how to convert measurements from the metric system to the strange way we Americans have of measuring things. Everyone Has Rights, Whether They Know Them or Not It would not be prudent to examine the immigrant community here without at least touching on a couple of local organizations that respond to the situation of undocumented people living or working in and around Ann Arbor.

It's a problem of public safety, because a lot of people are afraid to call the police when they need help.\" -Federico, an undocumented man from MexicoWhatever your stance is on the controversial and highly politicized topic of illegal immigration, it is interesting to consider how groups in town respond to the needs of undocumented people from the perspective of maintaining social justice and ensuring public safety. An undocumented man from Mexico, who asked to be referred to as \"Federico,\" says it is \"very common for undocumented people to not know their rights and get taken advantage of. Lately, people are getting more aware, but most people don't know what to do in certain situations,\" he says, referring to the right to remain silent, the right to a lawyer, or asking to see a warrant. \"Some get intimidated and end up incriminating themselves because they didn't understand their rights. It's a problem of public safety, because a lot of people are afraid to call the police when they need help,\" he says. Federico also wants undocumented workers to know that even though they are not legally supposed to work here, they should be treated fairly by people who choose to employ them. \"People don't always stand up for themselves when their boss is treating them unfairly.\" Federico mentioned two groups that are making a difference: The Washtenaw County Worker Center, which addresses \"workplace issues\" and the \"fight for economic justice\" for low-wage workers in the private service sector (for example, domestic workers) no matter their legal status, and The Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights, a social justice and political action group that undocumented people can turn to when immigration issues arise. The Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights The Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights was \"founded in direct response to a crisis in our community in March 2008: a major immigration raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\" explains co-chair Laura Sanders. The organization has an \"urgent response team\" that has taken over 300 phone calls over the last three years. 97 percent were from Latino people. \"80 percent are actual detainments and deportations. Over 100 of those cases involve the separation of children, primarily U.S. citizen children, from their parents. And the other 20 percent are prevention calls looking for immigration attorneys or those kinds of resources and referrals,\" she reports. When detainments happen, trained volunteers respond by helping people locate their loved ones. They do things like subsidize initial attorney consultation fees (about $200-300 a case), \"and help and counsel them through the process,\" she explains. The group's activities also include community education. \"We go into the targeted community and teach people what their rights are. And a lot of it is preventive things, such as having an emergency plan and having power of attorney or dual citizenship for your children so they can go with you if you get deported.\" They also \"educate the mainstream community to be aware of sensitive immigration issues and develop a network of allies,\" she explains. There is also a political action piece to the organization, \"which is how we try to implement policy and change policy,\" Sanders explains. Although it was mostly a \"symbolic gesture,\" they helped push forward a local resolution adopted by City Council in 2010 opposing Arizona's controversial Senate Bill 1070 requiring local law enforcement to police people's immigration status upon any \"reasonable suspicion\" they might be here illegally. Sanders says the passing of the resolution shows Ann Arbor's openness to the complex social justice issues to which the Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights responds. ConclusionIt is impossible to find a single litmus test that can gauge how well Ann Arbor is doing to be a welcoming community to people from all over the world. However, after surveying examples of how people can get information, education, and support, and engage in community life, it seems like Ann Arbor covers a lot of bases. Even though I myself was born here in Ann Arbor, it was interesting to attempt to put myself in the shoes of someone coming from abroad and learn from people who are closer to the topic than I am. I leave this exploration with a new awareness of some of the concerns and experiences of immigrants and international people. In the words of Ms. Bhatia of International Neighbors, \"it's good to put different eyes in your head.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 51 \"We go into the targeted community and teach people what their rights are.

Breast Cancer Fibrocysts Lumps Hormonal imbalance imbalance Spotlight on The Ecumenical Center and International Residence The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 52 Feature Continued from page 51 By Maureen McMahon A World Under the Same Roof A mix of U-M students and visiting scholars from all over the world share a unique living arrangement in an apartment community on Church Street. The Ecumenical Center and International Residence (ECIR) is a \"living-learning\" community that American and international students can apply to live in. The biggest house rule is that you come there with the intention of engaging with the other residents, whether in the building's common areas, sitting down for a meal together, or by joining service-learning educational programs. Another house rule is that apartment mates must come from different places. \"Since I've been here, part of the goal has been to introduce international students to the diversity within American culture itself,\" says director Dr. Bruce Martin. \"International students often come with a perception of what it's going to be like \u2014 usually from the movies. And then they spend most of their time within the university bubble. One of my goals is to get them outside of that bubble and introduce them to more marginalized communities, whether that's a socioeconomic kind of division or cultural barriers,\" he explains. ECIR students have taken \"immersive\" visits to the Ojibwe Native American community and have witnessed mountaintop removal mining while traveling to repair homes in Saint Paul, Virginia. \"It's interesting to watch them because they don't know there are these parts of America. It's eye-opening to them. They leave with an important addition to their formal education,\" Martin says. Beyond fostering friendships and cultural exchange, the ECIR sees itself as filling another important niche \u2014 short-term housing near campus. \"When you are being sent here for school or to teach, what you most often encounter is a 12-month lease, but they may only be here for 7 months of the year or shorter \u2014 although the longest someone has stayed is 11 years!\" Martin says. The ECIR is currently developing its \"Global Friendship Program\" to better link up international residents with locals who want to reach out to people far away from home. \"Basically it's about pairing local American families, individuals, or couples with international students and scholars from the university. We want it to be an ongoing friendship to give them more support. The feeling of being welcome and just knowing someone in town is there for advice is important,\" explains Rebecca Roland, an ECIR intern and U-M masters of social work candidate working on the project. - Jen Eberbach A Glimpse into the International Student's Experience What is it like to live in the Ecumenical Center and International Residence (ECIR) and what are some of the impressions foreign residents have of Ann Arbor? I visited their \"living-learning\" community on Church Street in January 2012 to hear from some current residents. Mixed in with a general appreciation for the city was the message that international students and scholars stay close to campus and typically aren't engaging with the greater Ann Arbor community \u2014 something the ECIR's Global Friendship Program is designed to address. I also met up with a local Global Friendship Program volunteer hostess to understand what it means to support an international visitor, why she finds it rewarding, and why you should consider getting involved. \"International students often come with a perception of what it's going to be like \u2014 usually from the movies. And then they spend most of their time within the university bubble. One of my goals is to get them outside of that bubble and introduce them to more marginalized communities, whether that's a socioeconomic kind of division or cultural barriers.\" -Dr. Bruce Martin, director, ECIR Director Bruce Martin organized and led a group of over forty residents, students, and community members on the Anishinaabeg Cultural Engagement Trip to the Bay Mills Indian Community in the Upper Peninsula during spring break 2012. Huang Lijun \"Stella,\" a visiting scholar from Chengdu City, China, represents the millions of brave people who come here without their partner and children to participate in the vast opportunities of America \u2014 people who think of it as just that, not a sacrifice but an opportunity.Huang Lijun \"Stella\"Dr. Bruce MartinThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 53 A Conversation with Huang Lijun \"Stella\": A Scholar, Mother, and Wife Talks about Life away from Chengdu City Huang Lijun \"Stella,\" 39, is a visiting scholar from Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, China. Her husband and 12-year-old son are still in China, where she has spent many years as an English teacher and is getting a Ph.D. in Linguistics. She moved to Ann Arbor in August 2011 to study euphemisms in English and Chinese for a year. My first impression of Stella was that she seems very youthful. She had a gentle way of speaking, even as she told me how she was shocked upon visiting Traverse City and realizing she might be the only non-Caucasian there. For me, Stella represents the millions of brave people who come here without their partner and children to participate in the vast opportunities of America \u2014 people who think of it as just that, not a sacrifice but an opportunity. Maureen: What drew you to Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan? Stella: As I'm a college English teacher in China, I want to learn more about American culture. Language and culture are so interrelated that we can't learn one without learning the other. Living one year in the States and being exposed to native speakers of English is really a wonderful experience for me. Fortunately, I was matched up with an advisor here at University of Michigan. U-M is really a wonderful school where I'll have a fruitful and enjoyable year. Maureen: What are your impressions of Ann Arbor, especially since you come from a much bigger city? Stella: Ann Arbor is a small and quiet city, but it's also dynamic with lots of activities and events going on. People here are very nice to us foreign visitors. Ann Arbor is different from Chengdu, the city that I come from. My city is a very big city with a population over 10 million. It's overcrowded and busy. Ann Arbor is a university town with a pleasantly slower pace. As there are many international students and scholars, local people tend to communicate with strangers more. It's so nice. Now I'm living at ECIR, which is a living and learning community. I would recommend living here to other foreign visitors. Maureen: You recently went to Traverse City, Michigan, which you say helped you appreciate that Ann Arbor has more than just white people and is less conservative. Can you say more about what it was like to visit there? Stella: It's kind of an eye-opener experience [making her eyes wide]. I got to know how a city is like dominant with Caucasians. People there are more reserved, but also quite interested in knowing more about other cultures. Maureen: How well have you gotten to know Ann Arbor and its local residents? Have people been outgoing and welcoming? Stella: I often hang out with my friends around Ann Arbor, though we only go to Main St. about once a month and tend to stay closer to campus. Still, we often eat out and appreciate the diverse food cultures here. We eat not just American food, but also Chinese, Thai, Korean, Indian, Italian, and so on. It's amazing. Yes, local people here are outgoing and welcoming, though I'd like to know more townspeople. Through the Global Friendship Program initiated by ECIR I've gotten to know an undergraduate American host. We spent time going to dinner and coffee together. What's interesting is she is now considering teaching English in China. I recommend my university to her. If she is able to teach English in my school, our friendship will surely extend from America to China. That will be fun. Maureen: Do you cook Chinese food and what's the best grocery store for Chinese ingredients in your opinion? Stella: Yes, if I need to cook, I'll cook Chinese food. I've been to several Chinese grocery stores here and the best one, in my opinion, is Hua Xing Asia Market on Washtenaw Avenue in Ypsilanti, where I can buy most of the ingredients for making Chinese food. Maureen: Are you connected to a spiritual community? How aware are you of Ann Arbor's body, mind, and spirit community? We recently featured acupuncture in our journal. Are you aware of the availability of Traditional Chinese Medicine here? Stella: No, I am not connected to any spiritual community. Mostly I stay in my apartment or the school library. Sorry, but I've got little idea of Ann Arbor's body, mind, and spirit community. I'm surprised there's Chinese acupuncture here. That's great!\"I often hang out with my friends around Ann Arbor, though we only go to Main St. about once a month and tend to stay closer to campus.\" -Huang Lijun \"Stella\"\"My city is a very big city with a population over 10 million.

How has that been and has it been worth the sacrifice to live here? Stella: Yes, it is hard to live far away from my family. Anyway, we talk on the phone everyday and I know how they're doing. They joined me for two weeks in California for a family vacation. We had a great time visiting different places in California. They are going to come visiting me again in the summer. Yes, I think it has been worth the sacrifice to live here, if we call it sacrifice. By staying here one year, I'll get my Ph.D. dissertation done and have one or two journal articles published.

A Conversation with Amanda de Moura Souza: Loving a Quiet Town with a Slower Pace Amanda de Moura Souza, 26, is an Epidemiology Ph.D. student from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a visiting scholar in the Environmental Health Sciences division of the U-M School of Public Health, and an ECIR resident. Amanda is vibrant with a beautiful smile that emerged as she pieced together answers to my questions. She was still gaining confidence in her English when we met and came off as shy. An aspect of her story that stood out for me is that, while she admitted to not knowing many American students, early on in her stay she was assertive about connecting to a branch of her Brazilian Christian church and has made many meaningful connections to people in Northville. This means of experiencing American community points to the powerful way that churches are havens for foreign visitors and have the potential to strengthen their faith. Maureen: How long have you been learning English and how did you find the University of Michigan?Amanda: I studied English for four years. My advisor in Brazil spent a year in Harvard School of Public Health and helped connect me to an advisor at U-M. Maureen: What are your impressions of Ann Arbor? How does it compare to life in Rio? Amanda: Compared to Rio, I love that it's quiet and peaceful. The weather is very different, not so hot, there are less cars and noise, and it's without the stress of a big city. My previous commute to school was a two-hour train ride each way; now it's a fifteen minute walk. I admit I have only been to Main Street a few times since August and mostly stay near campus. Maureen: How much do you interact with Americans? Amanda: I don't interact very often with American students outside of my program and know very few townspeople. I spend time with the other international students at ECIR. I belong to the Christian Congregation of Brazil and, before I came, I used their directory to connect with a related congregation in Northville called Christian Congregation North America early into my stay. Each week brothers from church pick me up to go to service. The people there are very friendly. Through the ECIR I spent Thanksgiving with a local family. It was more than I imagined. Janice Thorup hosted me, and even though they did not know me, Janice's family was ever the gracious hosts. I am truly grateful to Janice for allowing me to spend my first Thanksgiving in the company of her warm family. I believe this is the best way to learn more about a different culture. Maureen: Have people asked you about Brazilian culture and life?Amanda: People are very interested to know about Brazilian food and also big celebrations like Carnaval.Maureen: Are you involved with the Brazilian Student Association?Amanda: Ah, yeah, I've heard of them, that they host parties, like for Carnaval, but I've never been.Maureen: When you moved here were you aware of Ann Arbor's notably evolved body, mind, and spirit community? Amanda: No, I wasn't. Really, that's a big thing here? I'm a little surprised to hear about it.Spotlight on The Ecumenical Center and International Residence Feature Continued from page 53The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 54 Amanda de Moura Souza, 26, an Epidemiology Ph.D. student from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a visiting scholar in the Environmental Health Sciences division of the U-M School of Public Health, and an ECIR residentAmanda de Moura Souza \"My previous commute to school was a two-hour train ride each way; now it's a fifteen minute walk.

She met her husband, Sean Panikkar, an internationally touring opera singer, while they were in undergrad at the University of Michigan School of Music. They remain very involved with the university community and are volunteer hosts through the ECIR Global Friendship Program. I met Jane and her children at their home in Saline. Jane is very warm and welcoming and was genuinely enthusiastic about the work of the Global Friendship Program. She mentioned that her involvement stems from the values instilled in her by her parents; values she wishes to pass on to her young children. Jane gave me an insider's perspective on what it means to host and encourages all local families to consider it. Maureen: How did you become interested in hosting international students?Jane: My family has lived internationally and my husband is of Sri Lankan descent. I wanted to foster global community at home, to expose my children to similarities and differences. I grew up with a value that you should look for someone who maybe doesn't have a friend or a family and bring them in. When I came back the United States, I became involved with a similar program at University of San Francisco and enjoyed it. We hosted dinners with students at our home and socialized with them. When we resettled in Saline, I found ECIR through the Internet and got involved. Maureen: What kinds of students have you hosted and what activities have you shared with them? Jane: We've hosted undergraduates, graduates, and post docs, including three students from Malaysia who have joined our family for holiday celebrations like decorating Christmas cookies and eating Thanksgiving dinner, and other outings. While many people are more familiar with hosting students for Thanksgiving or December holidays, the opportunities of the Global Friendship Program can go beyond this. We've taken students to concerts, sporting events, and out to eat. Sean and I go to a lot of School of Music events and it's great to bring students with us who might not otherwise interact with that school. Many students don't leave campus. They keep to a small group of friends from their home country and eat their traditional cuisine, and yet are curious and open to experiencing American friendships, customs, and culture. They appreciate visiting places off campus, being in an American home, sharing meals, and discussing similarities and differences, especially related to family customs like marriage age and raising children. We have small children and the students we've connected with enjoy seeing them grow and feel comforted by being around many generations in one home. Maureen: Would you recommend getting involved in ECIR and the Global Friendship Program? Is it simple to sign up? What is the commitment like? Jane: I'd recommend it to anyone. It's very simple to register; you just join through the ECIR website. Some people sign up for just one semester. Hosts attend one meeting and then it's up to them how often they meet with students. Sometimes scheduling and transportation have to be negotiated, because most students don't have cars, but being involved is a low-pressure commitment that's highly rewarding. We're having a great experience and hope more families join the program.

Immigration accounts for more than 60 percent of the county's population increase, a percentage that's growing (The Federation for American Immigration Reform, 2008). While the university is a common draw for many, what are some of the impressions and experiences of people who came here for other reasons? I spoke to two such people who shared fascinating comparisons of their cultures of origin and illuminated some of the challenges and rewards of adapting to life here. One, Elisabeth Gilles, of France and Switzerland, like me, followed a university- affiliated spouse to town, but is not otherwise involved with the campus. Charming and a keen observer, she had me laughing about how she mostly sees Ann Arborites relating through small talk as they pass each other walking their dogs, and how, unlike Europeans, they treat the caf\u00e9 like a quiet, private office. The other, Shiva Asrari, of Iran, was very open to my questions comparing her Persian culture to Ann Arbor's and poignantly shared how she misses her family and appreciates the religious and political freedom she feels here. Intelligent and soft-spoken, Shiva is one of the many immigrant parents embracing the job of raising Ann Arbor kids who are knowledgeable and proud of their heritage. A Conversation with Elisabeth Gilles Elisabeth Gilles, 57, is an editor and journalist from Paris, France, who lived for many years in Geneva and Lausanne, Switzerland. She recently married a physics professor at University of Michigan, and, after five or six years of shorter visits to Michigan, is now living on the northwest side of Ann Arbor for nine months of the year and in Europe during the summers. Maureen: You are a journalist, but you seem to have a broad background. What kind of work were you doing in Europe? Elisabeth: In Switzerland I worked at a night clinic, at a zoo helping in the cafeteria and also with feeding the animals. I also worked as a taxi dispatcher, taught French as a Second Language at the University of Lausanne, and later mostly as a journalist. Maureen: What were your first impressions of the United States?Elisabeth: When I first visited the U.S. in the early 1980s, I came for one year to Santa Barbara, California. There was a myth about America understood by Europeans that was influenced by the Summer of Love, the open road, ideals of freedom and space; it was a place where the past doesn't weigh on your shoulders and people were inventing a new way of living. I experienced some of this and liked Santa Barbara and San Francisco. Over the past decade, as I visited the States more and eventually relocated here, European impressions of America were more influenced by notions of America as the superpower and predator, invading other countries and killing people. My friends thought my moving here was wrong. But no place is good and none is bad. Maureen: What are your impressions of Ann Arbor? Elisabeth: The first time I arrived it was January and bitterly cold. Ann Arbor feels like a bubble. The city lives on the university and hospital and there are so many students. It's very homogenous, and you either belong or don't belong. I'm sure this \u2014 to belong or not to belong \u2014 is also true of Paris or Geneva. Adjusting to one place takes time and efforts. I miss the stimulation of cities with more diversity, where you can see many generations on the street, people of many occupations, backgrounds, and classes interacting. Ann Arbor seems to just have coffee shops, cafeterias, and bars. I am very sad Borders closed and wish there were more magazine and bookstores. I live on Newport Road. It feels monastic compared to where I lived in Europe, which is good for being focused on work, but challenging also. I've noticed that people on my street relate through their dogs; they seem to only make small talk sometimes when they walk their dogs. The sense of privacy in the United States is very different. People are friendly on Main Street \u2014 they smile or even talk to you, which would never happen in Geneva! \u2014 but close their curtains when they get home, and home is a more private space here than in Europe. Yet, Americans do what Europeans would consider private things in public spaces, like treating a caf\u00e9 table like their private dining room where they catch up on correspondence and bills. Caf\u00e9s are often not for briefly meeting and chatting with friends, but for working on laptops and sitting alone. Maureen: Are you or were you aware of the relatively evolved body, mind, and spirit community here? For example, had you heard of Crazy Wisdom before, shopped at the People's Food Co-op, or worked with an integrative care provider? Elisabeth: Actually, Crazy Wisdom Tea Room was the first place I came to on Main Street. I shop at the Co-op many days of the week. I am interested in acupuncture, body, mind, and spirit, and many of the titles at Crazy Wisdom, and was very into preventive medicine in Europe, but haven't pursued it much here and miss it. Maureen: So if you shop at the Co-op often, do you interact with the shopkeepers the way I imagine you might in Europe, getting to know the people that work there and talking about the community? Elisabeth: No, I keep to myself mostly. It's not clear to me how people make friends here, especially if they are not young or in school. It's hard to gauge what depth of conversation is normal when talking to Americans, partly because English is a second language and partly because it's harder to read people. I think if I worked outside of my home it would be different, but for now, I enjoy my work as a journalist writing book reviews for a French language publication and editing French manuscripts, and I am curious to know other ways to better understand Ann Arbor and Americans. Elisabeth Gilles, an editor and journalist from Paris, France, lived for many years in Geneva and Lausanne, Switzerland, and relocated to northwest Ann Arbor\"There was a myth about America understood by Europeans that was influenced by the Summer of Love, the open road, ideals of freedom and space; it was a place where the past doesn't weigh on your shoulders and people were inventing a new way of living.

She was raised in Tehran, Iran, where she completed a bachelor's in chemical engineering. Her husband, Abbas Saadat, is an Iranian who came to the United States in 1977 and settled in Dayton, Ohio. Shiva and Abbas met during one of his brief visits to Iran during Christmas of 1995, when Shiva was 24 and still in college. Within weeks of meeting, they were engaged, and married in the summer of 1996. Shiva then finished college and came to live with him in Ann Arbor, where he had settled after taking an engineering position at Toyota Technical Center. Abbas is now a Vice President at Toyota, in charge of the Vehicle Performance Development & Quality Promotion divisions, and the family lives in the Stonebridge community of southwest Ann Arbor. Maureen: Did you have any impressions of Ann Arbor before you arrived? Did you know how to speak English when you got here? Shiva: I didn't know much about Ann Arbor, but it made a good impression on me when I arrived. I understood more English than I spoke, because in school we practiced grammar more than conversation. Soon after I moved here I took ESL classes at Washtenaw Community College, which helped a great deal, but I struggled to understand the American accent. I did make some good international friends, though. Maureen: Did you continue with school or work after you arrived?Shiva: In Iran, though I studied chemical engineering, specifically as it relates to the food industry, I had also played piano and have a strong interest in music. I took music classes at Washtenaw Community College, eventually transferring to EMU's music therapy program. Then I had my son, plus I was unsure about my future in music, so I left the program. Two and a half years after my daughter was born I became interested in Montessori. Five years ago I completed a Montessori Certification at the Adrian Dominican Montessori Teacher Education Institute. Now I'm a teacher at Go Like the Wind Montessori School in Ann Arbor, where my kids attend. I have loved developing \"peace curriculum\" and teaching peace lessons. I'm not interested in politics; I'm not political. I have experienced how politics and religion can be destructive, and I am much more drawn to studying peace. Building this curriculum and passing it on to children has been a great joy in my life.Maureen: I know you from the Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth, but were you raised Muslim? And how did you find Interfaith? Have you been aware of the body, mind, and spirit community here? Shiva: Yes, I grew up in a Muslim family and culture, but now I consider myself more Interfaith. I actually went to the Interfaith Center for the first time to attend a funeral of the Japanese wife of our Iranian friend. When I saw the peace pole and the prayer flags, I immediately became interested in the place. Then I heard Rev. Dave Bell speak and appreciated what he had to say. I have enjoyed being a part of that community. As far as body, mind, and spirit and Ann Arbor, over the years I often picked up Natural Awakenings and was interested in these topics. Now I study Science of Mind . I think when your heart is looking, you find these things, you attract them to yourself. Maureen: What language do you speak at home? Shiva: I grew up speaking Farsi, which is also called Persian. My husband and I speak Farsi at home and our children understand it, and although they often answer us in English, they can speak it, too. Our son went to the Persian school in Ann Arbor on the weekends to learn to read and write Farsi and I am teaching my daughter now. They are very excited about Farsi. We try to go to Iran every other year and my son drops his English completely when we are there. It's amazing. Maureen: I see that you do not wear rupush and rusari, the overcoat and head covering worn by Iranian women in public. Did you grow up wearing rupush and rusari and did you choose to wear them when you moved to Ann Arbor? Was there a time of transition? Are you more comfortable one way or the other? Shiva: I was a young child, 5 or 6, during the revolution, and it's because of the revolution and religious extremism that women are required to wear rupush and rusari. So, yes, I wore that, but because that was a demand from government, not a choice. In Iran, it's an Islamic Republic, but it also has people in the minority religions, like Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrian (ancient Iranian religion), and Ba'hai, and even they have to wear it. At home you didn't have to, like I didn't have to in my home, but it depends on the family and how religious they are. When I was home I dressed like I am now, but when I was outside and at school I wore rupush and rusari. The schools are gender segregated because of religion. In the past ten years, the girls and the women have turned the rupush and rusari into more a modern and fashionable style. Although at times they get into trouble by police, but they keep pushing the limit to see what they can get away with. I was used to it when I was there, but prefer not to have it, though I still wear it when I visit. Some Iranians visiting the U.S. still wear rupush and rusari because of their religious beliefs, but I didn't when I moved here. Maureen: What was your experience of gender segregation like growing up? Shiva: In the past ten years, things are changing. In the past, the girls didn't have to work. Now girls work as much as boys, more girls go to college than boys. Even with government demands, they can do more. In college, the girls sat on a different side of the classroom than the boys. Before college, schools are gender separated. They do this because of the religious view that boys and girls that are not engaged or married should not talk to each other. My family did not think that though, because they weren't that religious. Maureen: Since your children are Iranian American, do such cultural expectations intersect with their lives? When they visit Iran, are they expected to conform \u2014 be it dress, gender roles, or behavior in public? Shiva Asrari, a Montessori teacher and Ann Arbor parent, moved here from Tehran, Iran \"I have loved developing 'peace curriculum' and teaching peace lessons. I'm not interested in politics; I'm not political. I have experienced how politics and religion can be destructive, and I am much more drawn to studying peace. Building this curriculum and passing it on to children has been a great joy in my life.\" -Shiva Asrari \"My husband and I speak Farsi at home and our children understand it, and although they often answer us in English, they can speak it, too.\" -Shiva Asrari It's not always clear to people when they first arrive, and even after years of adjusting to being here, that they were encouraged to connect to the broader community Feature Continued on page 58The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 57 Shiva: No, because we do not expect that from them. They are not really expected to conform. At 10 or 11, when my daughter's in Iran, she might wear rusari in public, but when they are very young it's not necessary. Maureen: Does your family in Iran have \"traditional\" expectations for how your kids will grow up, like will you follow the custom of male suitors meeting the family before spending time with the daughter? Shiva: No. The tradition in Iran is for suitors to meet the family, who then approve or disapprove of the couple beginning to date, but with our children it will be different. It wasn't even really like that for me. While my husband was formally introduced to my family, I had socialized with him before, like we went to a concert with friends and had been to a party, and then he came to my house later. I chose my husband freely and my family did not say yes or no to our being together. They supported my choice, even though it meant I would be leaving for America. My husband and I will be aware of our children's dating, but our family won't decide for them. Maureen: When your kids visit Iran do they ask you about cultural differences? Or are they mostly around family and don't question it? Shiva: No, they don't see that. The dress, they understood that's a rule dictated by the government. They see that in the houses and at parties it's different. My son understood that this is part of the government rules. Mostly it's been the government in the past 30 years imposing these rules, and these restrictions should not be attributed to the culture and the traditions of Iran. The government dictates what the people can do. In the last four years there have been many uprisings and people are tired of the government and working on change. Remember how I mentioned I don't like politics? But, still, my son is interested in the rich culture and history of Iran and we are very glad about that. My husband and I were both pleased when he told us that in school he had chosen to write reports on the Persian Empire and on the country of Iran. We got to share Iranian food with the children at the school. It was great. My kids are proud of their heritage. They love it when we have Iranian ceremonies at home and appreciate learning from their grandparents, who visit us often. Closing Thoughts Having my own impressions as a recent transplant, and after talking to ECIR students and especially to Elisabeth Gilles and Shiva Asrari, I believe the answer to whether Ann Arbor is diverse and welcoming is mixed. It is diverse, yet compared to many places, as Elisabeth points out, there is not a wide range of backgrounds visible on Main Street. Ann Arbor is welcoming and the liberties we enjoy here and in America in general are exceptional, yet it's not always clear to people when they first arrive, and even after years of adjusting to being here, that they were encouraged to connect to the broader community. In both conversations, alongside feelings of enjoying and appreciating Ann Arbor were recognitions of how isolating it can feel if you are not in academia, do not have children, are not working outside of your home, or aren't affiliat ed with a church or other formalized social group. These categories are obvious inroads for assimilation, but such observations have been a common thread in many conversations I've had with Americans and internationals since I arrived here three years ago from Chicago. Isolation is an important part of this conversation \u2014 something we can all respond to \u2014 and it's worth it to point out that those who felt welcome were often assertive about joining. As Elisabeth says, \"No place is good and none is bad,\" but the invitation is there to connect outside of your regular circle and experience for yourself why diversity can make our community stronger. We send our gratitude to all the people who spoke to us. These aren't simple questions and their willingness to share adds great dimension to the picture.Isolation is an important part of this conversation \u2014 something we can all respond to \u2014 and it's worth it to point out that those who felt welcome were often assertive about joining. Global Exchanges, First Hand A European Journalist and a Middle Eastern Teacher Share their Personal Histories of Settling in Ann Arbor The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 58 Feature Continued from page 57 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 59 The New Left of the 1960s Turns 50 An Interview with Howard Brick, Louis Evans Professor of History at the University of Michigan Interviewed by Richard Gull University of Michigan's Louis Evans Professor of History Howard Brick is \"allergic\" to the idea of identifying an historical time with an essence. \"I see historical situations always as contradictory, always with contrary trends.\" In his book about the 1960s, Age of Contradiction, individual autonomy and engagement in society are shown to be both antithetical and yet wedded to each other. An influential political document from this era dealing with this contradiction is The Port Huron Statement, the founding manifesto of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which was completed at a meeting of 60 student leaders at the U.A.W. camp outside Port Huron, Michigan, in June 1962. Professor Brick has organized a conference on the Statement and its meaning this October, in Ann Arbor. (The schedule for the conference is on page 67.) The core of the Statement is the idea of participatory democracy. Participatory democracy is a challenging form of political participation, working for social justice in solidarity with others with the goal of \"finding a meaning in life that is personally authentic.\" Says Brick, \"Al Haber, a founder of SDS, and others around him insisted that democracy should be recognized as a radical idea, one that challenged all the undemocratic features of what was in fact a very conservative society.\" The civil rights movement in the South inspired SDS. But the Statement says nothing about women's rights or gay rights, even though these movements eventually originated on the left. Males dominated the early New Left, but by 1967 leftist feminists decried the masculinism of the movement. The October conference will highlight important contributions of women of the New Left. Looking back 50 years later, the largest contradiction is between the progress in civil rights, women's rights, and gay rights on the one hand, and the fact that the established structure of wealth and power has not changed in spite of these important advances in personal freedom. Yet, as Professor Brick explains, the arts and thinking of the 1960s, like Ornette Coleman's \"free jazz,\" offered up a creative surpassing of the blunt contradictions between autonomy and engagement that limit us. \"They'd be going off on their own improvisatory element, but then they hear something and they choose it, and then they come back into the ensemble and there is a constant interweaving of motifs and rhythms, of departures and returns.\" Free jazz, like The Port Huron Statement, offers us a more vibrant idea of participation in a democratic society. - Richard Gull, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, University of Michigan Students for a Democratic Society National Council Meeting, Bloomington, Indiana, 1963.

The Statement became the defining document of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), a group founded two years earlier in Ann Arbor. SDS was the most well known organization of the American New Left in the 1960s. By 1965 there were chapters of SDS on eighty college and university campuses. By 1968, just before SDS fragmented, there were about 80,000 members. Historian Michael Kazin recently wrote that The Port Huron Statement \"is the most ambitious, the most specific, and the most eloquent manifesto in the history of the American Left.\" Howard Brick: The Port Huron Statement is, of course, a kind of manifesto for SDS. SDS stems from an older organization, the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID), which can be traced back to 1905. By the late 1950s SLID was a stagnant organization with an unfortunate name: it slid into obscurity. At the University of Michigan, Al Haber joined the local chapter in 1958 and tried to revitalize it; by 1960 he proposed the new name. The phrase \"Industrial Democracy\" itself had great resonance in the years roughly from 1914 to 1924; it implied extending democracy from the realm of suffrage and elected government into the realm of industry, that is, making social and economic life democratic, and governed by the great majority, workers. By 1960, \"democracy\" even more in \"Students for a Democratic Society\" had a very contemporary meaning. In the Cold War, the U.S. claimed to be a democratic society, leader of the \"free world,\" in contrast to totalitarian societies; this rhetoric was so pervasive and insistent that the term \"democracy\" might be reduced to an ideology defending the status quo. Al Haber and others around him insisted instead that democracy should be recognized as a radical idea, one that challenged all the undemocratic features of what was in fact a very conservative society. Returning to the ideals of the American and French Revolutions and the revolutions of 1848, the left would now reassert itself as the champion of authentic democracy, a standard the U.S. had not yet achieved, by far. At the same time, SDS shifted the locus of change from industrial labor, where older radicals had concentrated their energies more or less, to the universities and the action of discontented students. Richard Gull: There was a debate at Port Huron over whether to seat someone who was a declared communist. SDS wanted to separate itself from the oppressive anti- communism of the 1950s. Howard Brick: That, of course, was one of the most debated issues on the left: whether democratic radicals ought to work in broad coalitions possibly including communists. The Communist Party (CP), you have to remember, was at its height around 1943-1944 amid the wartime Popular Front, the name of the CP's political strategy in support of the war effort and the Roosevelt administration, while the U.S. was allied with the Soviet Union. The CP had something like 80-100,000 members at that time. The number of members fell after the war, especially as the Cold War and the Red Scare \u2014 what was soon known as \"McCarthyism\" for the anti-communist politician Joseph McCarthy \u2014 grew most intense from 1947 to 1954. At the start of 1956, even after 10 years of Cold War, the CP still had about 20,000 members \u2014 and compared to any single left-wing organization today, that looks pretty big. Then came the famous speech by the Soviet premier Khrushchev conceding many of the gross crimes of Stalin's regime; by 1958, party membership fell to about 6,000 members. That was sort of the end of an era on the left, and it was the same year Haber joined SLID. Al Haber says that when he was a beginning student at the University, he heard about three U-M faculty members under attack in 1954 \u2014 two were fired by University president Harlan Hatcher \u2014 for refusing to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), one of the key bodies carrying out the anti-communist witch hunt after World War II. The most politically active of the three suspected professors, mathematician Chandler Davis, had helped write and distribute a pamphlet on campus that condemned the McCarthyite suppression of free speech and free thought; that alone might have brought him to the attention of university officials \u2014 I suspect the congressional investigators had him in their sights already.In any case, when the professors were dismissed after the HUAC hearings, a good number of faculty and hundreds of students protested the firing as a violation of free speech and academic freedom. After all, all three were respected researchers and teachers. Haber got wind of the protests. That's one of the reasons why Haber and other SDS founders \u2014 even though they were anti-communist in the sense that they recognized the Soviet Union as profoundly undemocratic \u2014 took what was called an \"anti-anticommunist\" line in domestic life. They saw McCarthyism as part of the repressive character of American life. So, by the time they met at Port Huron to draft their manifesto, they were willing to host a young member of the Communist youth organization as an \"observer.\" To exclude him would be to play McCarthy's game. On the other hand, Michael Harrington, a 34-year-old democratic socialist who had just become famous for writing The Other America about poverty in the U.S., was also at Port Huron, and he assailed the young SDSers for being \"soft\" on the Communist issue. Harrington represented SDS's parent organization at the time, the League for Industrial Democracy, which was full of hardened Cold Warriors. SDS's anti-anticommunism would be a constant irritant between the two organizations until they finally separated for good in 1965. Richard Gull: What was the attitude toward socialism at Port Huron? Howard Brick: It was very mixed. It was understood that the Statement was in no way professedly a socialist document. On the other hand, there were quite a few members at that time who regarded themselves as socialists. Actually what The Port Huron Statement said SDS wanted was a broad-based movement uniting liberals and socialists. It was supposed to be ecumenical. So the Statement steered away from overt socialist rhetoric such as evoking the idea of socialist revolution that would supplant capitalism and establish a different order. At the same time, what would make the New Left new is that it would not be based primarily in a labor-oriented movement, but saw college students as agents of change in their own right. Even so, the basic program supported the labor movement and criticized anti-union corporate power. When the Statement discussed economic matters, it talked in terms of expanding the welfare state, taking the New Deal order further. Clearly they had a notion of a society with a greater range of public social services available to all, as well as some means of coordinating economic activity that is more balanced, more equitable, and involves a degree of redistribution of wealth. They talked of some kind of planning to assure that basic human needs are met and that power is not concentrated in an irresponsible business elite. These are roughly social-democratic aims, that is, mildly socialistic. You could say that, given the times, SDS's politics were not far left. Perhaps we should call it \"near\" left politics.

The idea is to make that movement so powerful that it does actually help transform other people's minds.\" 1958 Campaign Poster ~ Alan Haber Runs for a position on the Student Government Council at the U of M. Slogan \"The Man with an Ear for Ideas\"Continued on page 62The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 62 RG: How would you characterize the liberals they were trying to appeal to? HB: SDS was searching for a new rhetoric that had purchase on a broader public of liberals and socialists taken together. When they said liberals they meant the most ardent liberals, those committed to substantial reform. Many of the people who we've come to call liberal were not among those they had in mind. Lyndon Johnson, for instance, did not call himself a liberal and SDS did not call him that either. They certainly had questions about whether John F. Kennedy was a liberal of the sort they could ally with. In the span of the Democratic Party, Kennedy was not on the left of that party. When SDSers at that point said liberal, they meant a kind of reformer who had an expansive view of New Deal, who supported labor and criticized business power, defending civil liberties and actively promoted desegregation and racial equality. The Statement was what some leftists would call reformist. It's not revolutionary and its tone is moderate. Its purpose was to call on current society to live up to its professed ideals. At the same time, Tom Hayden said the Statement was intended to be a living document, something that was open to change through experience. That's a very potent New Left idea in itself: not to be bound by dogma. That would include the dogmas of what they called the \"Old Left\" \u2014 both communists and strict anti-communist socialists; it would also include dogmas of the status quo. RG: So is The Port Huron Statement reformist or revolutionary or can it be both?HB: I would say that there are elements in the Statement that are considerably more radical than the prevailing reformist tone of the document overall. It's probably safe to say it didn't talk about \"overthrowing\" anything, aside from Jim Crow segregation, of course. And yet, there's a lot there that was daring and far more challenging than piecemeal reforms. To take the Statement's notion of participatory democracy seriously, I think, means recognizing its revolutionary connotations. Here we get to the key notion \u2014 participatory democracy or \"a democracy of individual participation.\" A key passage ten pages in says: \"We would replace power rooted in possession, privilege, or circumstance by power and uniqueness rooted in love, reflectiveness, reason, and creativity. As a social system we seek the establishment of a democracy of individual participation, governed by two central aims: that the individual share in those decisions determining the quality and direction of his life; that society be organized to encourage independence in men and provide the media for their common participation.\" That is the core right there. Now, if you emphasize the individual part, it sounds like the freedom to make your own life. More radically, it calls for common participation in a democratic social system. We're not talking about a narrow economic individualism. That's clear in the document when they disparage power and possession. They are talking about individual fulfillment, the development of an authentic self and its creative possibilities, and a society that encourages that independence. RG: What are examples of this authentic fulfillment through creativity? HB: Let's consider the story of Sandra [Casey] Cason [who later married Tom Hayden and became known as Casey Hayden]. She was involved as a student in Christian groups in the late 1950s in Austin, Texas. She was a young white woman of the South devoted to Christian idealism and to desegregation, who then joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to fight for racial equality. And she participated in building SDS in its early years.

They saw themselves as individuals searching for a kind of fulfillment. That meant discovering an authentic meaning in life, something that would touch their souls and spirits instead of sending them into middle- or upper-class careers, marriages, and lives pinned on the advantages of money. Their deeper yearnings led to political action and the solidarity of struggling for racial equality, which gave their lives purpose in pursuit of great ideals. They broke with convention and found that the struggle for justice expanded and enriched their lives. In this sense, individual fulfillment and solidarity were not opposite to each other but tightly wedded together. That experience is at the heart of the participatory democracy. The ideas of cooperative life and of collective action and solidarity made this a left- wing movement. These things \u2014 individual freedom and solidarity in action \u2014 are historically at the root of campaigns for racial equality going back to the abolitionists. Those two principles stand together in the best of the left tradition from abolitionism and women's rights through the labor and socialist movements and beyond; taken together, they should resist and reject the authoritarian strains that have also appeared on the left. RG: You are saying that this idea of solidarity runs through all of these leftist movements? HB: Yes, though SDS provided a new language for it, a kind of existential language of fulfillment and enrichment. The early organizers were roughly familiar with French existentialism, which asserted, simply put, that a human being \"is not a thing to be manipulated.\" The Statement asserted: \"We oppose the depersonalization that reduces human beings to the status of things.\" Humans instead were by definition free beings, and to act as if you couldn't escape pressures to conform was to act \"in bad faith.\" In the Statement's language, man's \"unfulfilled capacities\" \"reason, freedom, and love\" were the foundation of \"majority participation in decision-making.\" It's interesting that the Statement repeatedly referred to the \"unfulfilled capacities\" of \"man\" instead of \"human being.\" They were certainly tone deaf to the issues of gender-neutral language we've become so familiar with more recently. In fact, males predominated in the organization and often lorded it over women, who generally took more obscure and subordinate roles. By 1967-1968, radical feminists were attacking the masculinism on the left, which was particularly galling in a movement that supposedly stood for social equality. Yet the historian of feminism Alice Echols insists that radical feminists by 1970 were still motivated by the ideals of participatory democracy and solidarity that defined the New Left, even while attacking the New Left for its pretty heavy-handed male bias. And we are continually learning how much impact young women \u2014 even if they did not get the most face time in the media \u2014 had on shaping the new radicalism of that time. Maria Varela, a Latina who attended the Port Huron convention, is an example. She documented the civil rights movement in the South in her photographs of the early 1960s. Then, in 1967, she began 35 years of helping to create sustainable communities in the Southwest promoting economic and cultural self-determination. \"Now, if you emphasize the individual part, it sounds like the freedom to make your own life.

Casey Hayden, Maria Varela, and Alice Echols will all speak at the conference along with other women who were activists in the 1960s and since, or who study the history of these things today. In any case, the idea of freedom and equality for all \u2014 breaking down hierarchical relations that gave the rich, the powerful, and racially privileged groups control over others \u2014 went hand in hand with the emphasis on solidarity. And the idea that the individual is fulfilled through the experience of solidarity was one of the most decisive indicators of this as a left-wing vision. The idea of freedom as utter self-reliance, an individual outside community, going your own way regardless of social bonds to others: that's a libertarian concept that stands on the right today. Many people look back on the New Left and mistakenly think those rebels were individualists above all, breaking the bonds of convention, a counterculture that simply wanted sexual freedom and the ability to \"do their own thing,\" whatever that may be. Yes, there was a sort of bohemian individualism among these young people; they wanted to live in new ways, creative and innovative ways. But in the end, as they were part of a movement that was always rooted in solidarity, that was their idea of individual fulfillment and it was continuous with the historical left, what I call the \"long\" left. If you take this idea of participation as the basis of a social system in which individuals, acting together, make the decisions that determine the direction of their lives, then that really is a revolutionary idea. It means remaking all social institutions so that there is genuine engagement in self-government. And it's linked in the history of the long left to socialist ideas of workers democratically running industries in common. RG: But that doesn't necessarily mean that participatory democracy requires rule by consensus, as some think. HB: By no means does it imply any fantasy of absolute harmony. Of course, the idea of democracy requires debate, and debate leads to decisions with the widest participation possible, but without necessarily everyone agreeing. Some descendants of New Left thinking take \"consensus decision-making\" to be the foundation of democracy. That may work for small action groups, and derives probably from old Quaker traditions of nonviolence, but personally I've always supported decision by majority vote. Certainly, when we imagine a whole society, consensus can't define radical democracy, for consensus on such a scale would imply a future where a common will is so consolidated that it could be represented by a single party. That smells of party-state dictatorships like the old Soviet Union, and New Left democracy at the start surely opposed that notion. Any idea of an absolutely consolidated popular will doesn't fit well with the spirit of participation. It doesn't fit well with political action, in common, that avoided dogma, sought flexibility and constant revision. So participatory democracy meant opposing authoritarianism on the left, while also implying, I think, opposition to capitalist society rooted in great property held by a small wealthy elite. That's why the idea of participatory democracy is implicitly revolutionary. Some of the veteran SDSers today like to look back and say, \"Well, we were very moderate and not very revolutionary.\" Supposedly they respected the \"two-party system.\" In some respects, this kind of retrospective talk serves to distinguish the early organizers from the later 60's, when SDSers became more vocally \"revolutionary,\" and for some that meant an acceptance of violence and sectarian ideological dogmas \u2014 just what the Statement had opposed. Actually, in the late 1960s, New Left radicals did some inspired and inspiring things, as well as some crazy, horrifying things \u2014 but that's no reason to deny that the early organizers of Port Huron also had some admirably radical ideas that were not about being \"moderate\" or \"working within the system.\" The document as a whole, I think, shows a great deal of ambivalence about \"working within the system.\" RG: Would you say something briefly about the violence that characterized the late 1960s? HB: Sure. Above all, that could be seen in the mass violence of the U.S. war machine in Vietnam and the continued violence of racial oppression at home. Yes, some radicals disastrously played around with ideas of commencing guerrilla warfare in the U.S. in order to bring the war to a halt. Generally, however, the growth of the mass demonstrations against the Vietnam War should be applauded as a great achievement of dissent. Nonetheless, the U-M conference this fall focuses on the period up to 1965, the year of the first large-scale anti-Vietnam War protests in Washington, DC, and in Ann Arbor itself. RG: What were influences from the late 1950s on The Port Huron Statement? HB: The kind of worldview SDS carried forward had already been roughed out in the 1950s. By the mid-fifties you see a number of forces and new movements that are afoot. What motivated the Statement besides the heritage of social democratic ideas was the civil rights movement. No question. It had a long history, but particularly with the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1956 you see a mass movement of agitation for change based in community mobilization. It is important never to neglect the significance of Montgomery. It was a city of 120,000 with an African-American population of around 50,000. They maintained a 13-month boycott of city buses, begun for the modest demand of reforming discriminatory seating arrangements. For 13 months, African-Americans did not ride the buses. It is remarkable to maintain that kind of commitment by tens of thousands of people over so long a time \u2014 resulting in the end of Jim Crow buses in Montgomery, period. In retrospect this was a demonstration, not only of solidarity, but also of grassroots democracy. And the movement fanned out to other cities of the South and northern cities as well, sparking community mobilization and gaining public visibility. In the 1950s, you also had on the left the new priority of pacifism in opposition to the nuclear arms race. You have radical pacifists undertaking acts of civil disobedience. These were small actions: 10 people go and climb a fence so that they can get arrested for trespassing on the nuclear testing range in Nevada. Or they would sail a small boat into area of the Pacific test bombing range, only to be arrested by the Navy. The point was to gain public visibility and to show their commitment to ending an ever-present threat of war and annihilation.

All of which was greeted as the sign of a new time, beckoning towards a new order. It was generally felt that, in what was yet to be called the Third World, these were movements toward racial, social, and economic equality, from the independence of India and Indonesia, to the Cuban revolution, to the Vietnamese revolution. All of this is related to the rise of the New Left and its championship of popular democracy. What you don't see in The Port Huron Statement is women's liberation, gay and lesbian liberation, or environmentalism \u2014 although there is a line in the Statement about despoliation of the environment by unbridled economic forces. RG: You argue in your book, Age of Contradiction , that the civil rights, women's rights, and gay rights movements, despite their great achievements in expanding personal freedoms, did not basically change the established structure of power and wealth. HB: The 1960s brought achievements in civil rights, the advancement of ideas of racial equality, not only for African-Americans, but a series of other movements like Chicano rights, Native American rights, and equality for Asian Americans. These movements have changed American life. They have reshaped American society in ways that have left us with a society that to a much greater degree recognizes diversity and inclusion. Since that time, gays and lesbians have achieved a degree of self-assertion, pride, and a recognition of basic rights that had no place in public life of the 1950s. These are enormous changes. They have been so provocative that they have met considerable opposition. Movements of conservatives would like to stop such trends and restore older ways of life. The Left should always value this expansion of personal freedom entailed in these achievements. But there is a divergence of trends here. One trend has been expansion of the boundaries of personal freedom for many individuals who belong to historically oppressed groups. At the same time, there has been a converse trend toward increasing social and economic inequality, toward an ever more stratified society. So these movements expanding personal freedom have failed to change the underlying shape of American society based on concentrated power, ongoing exploitation, and injustice \u2014 exactly what The Port Huron Statement sought to oppose. It is a real paradox of our times that we face these two contradictory trends. My argument is that this kind of expansion in personal freedom cannot be safeguarded, over the long haul, unless we succeed in promoting social justice. Despite the greater scope of possibility for individual personal freedom, great numbers of people outside the affluent and powerful classes never even get a start at real self-determination. Many live in circumstances of great deprivation, lacking chances for personal fulfillment and lacking a political voice. Still, there is no good reason for invidious distinctions between these two trends. Some liberals and leftists in the 1980s and 1990s complained that what they called identity politics, like women's liberation and gay liberation or agitation by more specific groups within those movements, had fractured a common vision of social justice. Critics of \"identity politics\" suggested that challenging particular discriminations took too much attention away from the cause of uniting most Americans in a campaign for greater economic equity for all. In contrast, I see all of these movements, for rights and for economic justice, as essential. When they began all the so-called \"identity\" movements were committed to social justice. Radical feminists saw themselves fully in line with a left vision of a future cooperative society. Gay liberation, at least a substantial component, was clearly on the left and was part of the drive for general social change. Identity politics, as such, is not responsible for the established order of wealth and power remaining unchanged. RG: You write in Age of Contradiction that The Port Huron Statement was written in an era of relative economic abundance. HB: The Statement emerged in a period, generally, of strong economic growth. The Statement begins by acknowledging this: \"We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.\" They are part of what John Kenneth Galbraith in 1958 called the affluent society. Periods of growth sometimes lead to bounding aspirations. But the whole capitalist world shifted into low growth and crisis with the recession of 1973-1975. And we are now in an entirely different world. What came roaring back, of course, by the 1980s was the market ideology of the Reaganites. And that dominates our social world now. In the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, some people liked to say that now there is a universal consensus that liberal capitalism is the necessary form of modern society. Social movements anticipating a new society have generally withered, except for these bursts we've seen like the anti-globalization \"Battle of Seattle\" in 1999 and now the Occupy movements. RG: You have written a great deal about the terms postindustrial, sometimes called postcapitalist, society. From the 1950s into the 1990s these terms implied the coming of a better society. But now postindustrial means the disappearance of manufacturing and postcapitalist society seems impossible given the new consensus that liberal capitalism is the necessary form of modern society.HB: When people started to use the term postindustrial in the late 1950s and early 1960s, they often envisioned a more social service oriented, a more cooperative society, more of a planned economy. Many thought that in a postindustrial economy, in which manufacturing has a smaller place and high tech and information technologies are more significant, organized knowledge would be a common resource. We have knowledge in our minds and share it with each other so how are you going to put a price on that? Initially people just assumed that if knowledge were going to be a resource, cultivated in universities, then we would need to create a society with more collective planning. Knowledge was understood to be a common good. So when postindustrial society was first discussed, it was assumed that it would not be a society dominated by the ubiquity of market exchange. Certain things just couldn't be traded in the market, or so they thought. Now we know that Microsoft, Apple, and all sorts of e-business easily put a price on information. It's often presumed now that we buy and sell \"knowledge.\" Many of us faculty like to think that education is not a matter of such market exchange; but then, we're told that students and their parents are \"consumers\"; that a degree is an \"investment in human capital\" that its \"return\" is reaped in higher salaries. Those early ideas of postindustrialism were echoed in some radical circles during the 1980s and early 1990s, when some left-wing visionaries talked about \"the end of work\" as we have known it, due to the advance of labor-saving technology. These were vaulting aspirations that were, I think, very liberating. But now when people talk about postindustrial society they talk about things like postindustrial Detroit, where postindustrial really means ruins . Postindustrial has come to mean the decimation of the manufacturing economy and well-paid jobs. So there we saw a fundamental distinction between the idea of postindustrial society, when it began in the 1960s, and the deindustrialization that has taken place since the 1970s. This is yet another example of divergent trends, the road to inequality and injustice that runs on another track from gains in personal possibilities. Roughly around the time of The Port Huron Statement, Tom Hayden, Todd Gitlin, and others signed a document called the Triple Revolution Manifesto that talked about automation. The idea was that with automation there will be fewer jobs, so you have to think about how work is going to be distributed. If people are working less then maybe the whole idea of working for a wage is not going to sustain people in a society like ours where people need income. So you get into ideas like a guaranteed income and opening larger areas of useful activity, to put a priority on human social services, health care, people-to-people interactions and community building. RG: Would you say a word about writing history by portraying interweaving contradictions? HB: As a historian, I'm allergic to the idea of identifying a particular period of time with a singular stamp or style. I see historical situations always as contradictory, always showing contrary trends. So I reject the idea that you could unify a whole period and say this or that is what the 1960s was about. There is a rather old idea that each historical moment is unified, that there is an essence that makes it just what it was. Instead, I see multiple levels of change. One of my colleagues talks about \"complexly cascading histories\" \u2014 I love that phrase. Things change at different paces; courses of events, each with their own rhythm, overlap with each other. You're often dealing with contrary trends in the same moment, just as we talked before about the liberalizing of personal self-development coupled with growing social inequality. That's why I talked about contradiction. In the 1960s you have, for instance, these two potent ideas of autonomy and community. I wanted to show how they seem to be antithetical but they're also wedded to each other in many ways. RG: In Age of Contradiction you use the 1960s jazz of Ornette Coleman or John Coltrane to illustrate the interplay of individual autonomy with the community of the \"Actually, in the late 1960s, New Left radicals did some inspired and inspiring things, as well as some crazy, horrifying things \u2014 but that's no reason to deny that the early organizers of Port Huron also had some admirably radical ideas that were not about being \"moderate\" or \"working within the system.\" \" \"By the mid-fifties you see a number of forces and new movements that are afoot. What motivated the Statement besides the heritage of social democratic ideas was the civil rights movement. No question.\" Continued on page 66Al Haber (50 years later) is the director of the Megiddo Peace Project, and lives in Ann Arbor.

You didn't quite explicitly say this, but is Coltrane's jazz a metaphor for the ideal of participatory democracy? There is autonomy that is creatively connected to the unity of what's going on. HB: In a sense, that was my point. Autonomy and engagement might seem antithetical, but what is richest about that time were discoveries about how to join them. That's what Ornette Coleman did in his \"free jazz\" \u2014 almost unbridled improvisation by individual players, while each is also listening intently to what's happening in the ensemble. They'd be going off on their own improvisatory element, but then they hear something and they choose it, and then they come back into the ensemble and there is a constant interweaving of motifs and rhythms, of departures and returns. So you have the experimentalism of a single free spirit, like composer John Cage, now combined with the communal. My argument in that book was that some of the richest thinking of the 1960s appears to escape its contradictions. In building on and surpassing blunt contradictions that limit us, that's where real creativity comes in. That is what free jazz was doing. It was a metaphor for a more vibrant idea of democracy. RG: How was Coleman's free jazz a metaphor for harmonizing autonomy and engagement for left-wing activists? HB: For radicals, there is always a tension between alienation or autonomy, on the one hand, and community or engagement, on the other. I call it the dialectic of margin and mainstream, a creative tension that's run through the history of the modern left. To be on the left is to be on the fringe, to occupy a position as a social critic, to embrace ideas that don't have wide resonance. Part of the existential condition of being a radical like that is to be willing to accept that position of being on the margins, an outsider, even facing repression, as many people did. Pushing the envelope for desegregation and racial equality, for instance, meant encountering great risks. You had to steel yourself and maintain solidarity in the face of danger. You had to accept the risk of marginality. But you don't want to remain there; you want to change society. The goal is to get back in touch with the mainstream. It doesn't mean joining the two-party system and adapting to those limits, but it does mean building a mass constituency for transforming society, making it far more equitable, just, and cooperative. To be a radical is to understand the tension between building a movement and living on the margins. The idea is to make that movement so powerful that it does actually help transform other people's minds. You're alienated but you strive to be engaged in a movement that imagines a different future; otherwise you don't authentically fulfill the purpose of being a radical. If you just stick with marginality, you are a prophet in the wilderness. That may have its honor, but the ultimate goal is to change the order of things. Go back to the abolitionists of the 1830s and 1840s. They were a tiny minority but the greatest of them said: We don't want to be a moralistic minority; we're not telling you we're more righteous than thou. We want to build a movement that will abolish slavery. And for that we need to imagine that in the future you are going to be with us. And then you get to emancipation in 1863, a remarkable, radical change taking place just a few years after a time when abolition had seemed so far off, an \"extreme\" demand with no place in mainstream politics. RG: What I think most people associate with the 1960s, the counterculture, does not emerge until around 1967-1968. But was an earlier form of it evident in the 1958-1965 period we're talking about? HB: Yes, what came to be called the counterculture didn't really burgeon until around 1967-1968. But there is something of a bohemian sensibility in the early New Left. There is a sense of not being hung up on conventions. There is talk about expanding the possibilities for personal fulfillment that involves nonconformity. These are the sentiments that anticipate the counterculture of the late 60's. Young radicals of the early 60's certainly knew the Beat poets. Some of them were familiar with avant-garde arts, \"happenings,\" or events that came later to be called street theater. Already by the late 1950s, young radicals at the University of Wisconsin challenged the arms race by mounting a kind of theatrical \"Anti-Military Ball\" (mimicking the dances held for R.O.T.C. cadets). All of that was in the air. The iconoclastic sociologist C. Wright Mills was not only an important thinker for the New Left, but also an inspirational nonconformist. By the time SDS was setting up its community organizing adventures in area of northern cities like Newark and Cleveland, there was spirit of unconventional living arrangements and communal households. There was already a greater sense of sexual freedom, although you hear quite different stories and people take different perspectives. Many women activists of the time would say that sexual freedom in the 60's typically meant greater scope for male prerogative, and hardly real freedom for women. On the other hand, you have people who say that those communal households of SDS organizers arranged household duties on a basis of gender equality, even before people made a point of such things. There is a lot of contrary testimony, but both were going on, I think. RG: I wanted you to say something about Ann Arbor. You went to school at the University of Michigan and later came back here to teach. HB: I started school here in 1971. I met my wife here. We were students in the same dorm. In high school I was involved in some anti-war activism. I came to the University of Michigan because I wanted to be a newspaper reporter. I'd written editorials in my high school newspaper against the Vietnam War, defending the Chicago Seven, welcoming the signs of Black Power in my school. I came to the University of Michigan because I wanted to work on the Michigan Daily . It had a heritage, a reputation, and a current practice when I was working there as a left-wing student newspaper. When I came here there were still protests about classified military research on campus, and one of the Daily 's great crusades was ending it. Although I wasn't here in the 1960s, I came here with some vague sense of what made Ann Arbor special in that respect. When I worked at the Daily they still had the print shop downstairs, the editorial offices upstairs. We sent copy down to printing by a dumbwaiter. Posted inside the dumbwaiter door was a yellowed, ten-year-old letter of resignation from the print staff to the editors. I think it was from when Tom Hayden was editor in the early 60's. The letter said something like, \"We, the undersigned members of the print staff, hereby resign.\" And then, and this is a very close paraphrase: \"We wish you the best of luck in continuing to publish one of the best, though most communist, student newspapers in the country.\" Apparently they were ticked off by some editorial, the politics of which they didn't like. Of course, they came back to work immediately. When I got here, it was a year or two after the Black Action Movement (BAM). I understood that to be a scene of turmoil and the effectiveness of dissent: so here I am in a place where these things happen. BAM seemed to be successful getting a commitment by the University to increase black student enrollment \u2014though the goals affirmed at that time have yet to be met. This was all present as a legacy I was delighted to be part of. John Sinclair's Rainbow People's Party was active in the early 1970s, too. I reported on the Free John Rally in 1971. I was in the press section and spent the whole day in press conferences featuring Allen Ginsberg, Bobby Seale, Father James Groppi [the civil rights priest of Milwaukee], and others. John Lennon and Yoko Ono arrived, and that was the big excitement at the time. Afterwards I interviewed Sinclair when he got out of jail. RG: What was that like interviewing him when he got out of jail?HB: It was a pleasure. I just remember him as very cordial and gentlemanly \u2014 quite unlike his reputation for wildness. He helped me off with my coat, it was the middle of winter, and then he hung it up, and then when I was about to leave, he helped me into my coat again. We had a nice talk. He was going through some kind of Maoist or quasi-Maoist phase at the time that I didn't share. But I admired what the group did in terms of community institutions. They were running a free people's clinic at the time providing free medical care. Human services provided for free, while people fashioned new community structures of free collaboration: that appealed to me. It should be a vision for the large scale. As a model of social organization, that would be a great fulfillment of The Port Huron Statement.

Lee will be speaking about his new book, Smoke Signals , at a special Crazy Wisdom Salon on Thursday, November 8th at 7 PM in the Tea Room. Lee is a brilliant, poetic and sharp-witted author and speaker, and he is one of the leading social historians of the counter-culture. Lee is the director of Project CBD, an information service that reports on cannabis science and therapeutics. He is the associate editor of O'Shaughnessy's, the journal of cannabis in clinical practice. Lee is the author of several books, including Acid Dreams -- The Complete Social History of LSD: The CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond and The Beast Reawakens. Acid Dreams is considered to be the classic social history of LSD. Lee is also co-founder of the New York-based media research group FAIR (Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting) and former editor of FAIR's magazine Extra!. His articles have appeared in many publications in the United States and abroad, including the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Rolling Stone, Harpers, The Nation, Le Monde Diplomatique, Christian Science Monitor and Mother Jones. He has been a guest on CBS' 48 Hours, CNN, CNBC, C-Span, the History Channel, NPR's Fresh Air, and has lectured at numerous colleges and universities. Historian Douglas Brinkley said of Smoke Signals : \"Every American should read this landmark book!\" Smoke Signals was published by Scribner in August of this year. In Smoke Signals , Lee traces the dramatic social history of marijuana from its origins to its emergence in the 1960s as a defining force in a culture war that has never ceased. Lee describes how the illicit marijuana subculture overcame government opposition and morphed into a dynamic, multibillion-dollar industry. In 1996, California voters approved Proposition 215, legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes. Similar laws have followed in more than a dozen other states, but not without antagonistic responses from federal, state, and local law enforcement. Lee draws attention to underreported scientific breakthroughs that are reshaping the therapeutic lanscape. By mining the plant's rich pharmacopoeia, medical researchers have developed promising treatments for cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, chronic pain, and many other conditions that are beyond the reach of conventional cures. Colorful, illuminating, and irreverent, Smoke Signals is a fascinating read for recreational users and patients, students and doctors, musicians and accountants, Baby Boomers and their kids, and anyone who has ever wondered about the secret life of this ubiquitous herb. Lee also has Ann Arbor roots. He came to college in Ann Arbor in 1971, and immersed himself in Ann Arbor's politics and culture of the time. He won four Hopwood Awards while here, and he also organized a well-publicized teach-in here in 1975, which was called \"The Bicentennial Dilemna\" and which was focused on technology and social control. A Sampler from: Smoke Signals From Chapter 2: A key aspect of cannabis as a social phenomenon has been its boundary-crossing quality, how it leapt like a flame from one culture to another. So did jazz. The music and the weed were fellow travelers, so to speak, joined at the juncture of hip. Even after the onset of federal prohibition, when viper lyrics were distinctly out of favor, contraband cannabis could be procured at jazz clubs such as Minton's Playhouse on 118th Street in New York City. That was where the great saxophonist Lester (\"Prez\") Young gave Jack Kerouac, the fledgling writer, his first taste of marijuana in 1941. It would prove to be a seminal, flame-leaping moment. Kerouac and his cohorts got high together in small groups, much like the bohemian writers who congregated at the Hashish Eaters club in mid-nineteenth century Paris. The beats were conscious of their link to this great stoned lineage of European artists, which included the Dadaists, Surrealists, Symbolists and others who defied convention. Kerouac's cabal loved the associational fluidity engendered by cannabis, how it loosened the powers of analogy and unleashed the spoken word. They stayed up all night smoking fat marijuana bombers, listening to jazz, reciting poetry and confiding their deepest secrets, their hopes and fears, in protracted, stoned rap sessions. Marijuana was a truth drug, of sorts, for the beats. As beat poet Allen Ginsberg recalled: \"All that we knew was that we were making sense to each other, you know talking from heart to heart, and that everybody else around us was talking like some kind of strange, lunar robots in business suits.\" From Chapter 3: On August 28, 1964, the day Bob Dylan lit up and handed the Beatles their first joint in a New York City hotel room, Dr. Raphael Mechoulam was working intently in his laboratory at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The young Israeli chemist and his research partner, Yechiel Gaoni, would soon become the first scientists to fully isolate and synthesize delta-9-tetrahy- drocannabinol, or THC, marijuana's principal psychoactive component. Mechoulam's groundbreaking research was subsidized by the U.S. National Institutes for Health (NIH), which had suddenly become desirous of more objective information about the herb. As the use of marijuana soared among middle class youth, officialdom started to get anxious, especially when the sons and daughters of prominent politicians were caught smoking it. Queried by members of Congress as to whether pot caused brain damage, the NIH scurried to gather basic scientific data. But hard science was difficult to come by in large part due to the stubborn refusal of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to sanction laboratory research. For a long time, the illegality of cannabis acted as a deterrent to research in the United States. From a scientific perspective, the riddle of THC was not easy to unravel. The small number of researchers who studied cannabis over the years found the herb difficult to work with because many of its 421 distinct compounds are \"lipophilic\" (soluble in fat but not in water), which means they can't be separated and scrutinized without sophisticated equipment. Scientists would eventually ascertain that at least 100 of these lipophilic compounds \u2014known as \"cannabinoids\"\u2014 are unique to the marijuana plant. In addition to the cannabinoids, a term coined by Mechoulam, marijuana contains various alkaloids, flavonoids and terpenoids (essential aromatic oils). The isolation and synthesis of THC would prove to be a highly significant event in the history of psychopharmacology. Mechoulam, then 34, announced his discovery in a letter to the editor of the Journal of the American Chemical Society on July 20, 1965. Although he didn't realize it at the time, Mechoulam had lit a slow-burning fuse that would detonate a revolution in medical science. From Chapter 3: \"Hoover University,\" located at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia, specialized in teaching spooks how to penetrate left-wing networks in the 1960s. Students who attended this elite FBI academy were instructed not to wash for several days in order to project the appropriate counterculture image when they approached radical groups. The more astute spies recognized that if they insinuated themselves into the radical wing of the antiwar movement, they might be expected to share a joint now and then with their newfound comrades.Smoke Signals A Social History of Marijuana - Medical, Recreational, and Scientific Marijuana was a truth drug, of sorts, for the beats. As beat poet Allen Ginsberg recalled: \"All that we knew was that we were making sense to each other, you know talking from heart to heart, and that everybody else around us was talking like some kind of strange, lunar robots in business suits.\" On August 28, 1964, the day Bob Dylan lit up and handed the Beatles their first joint in a New York City hotel room, Dr. Raphael Mechoulam was working intently in his laboratory at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 69 Smoking marijuana during an undercover assignment \"required a much higher degree of training than merely smoking a cigarette,\" acknowledged former FBI agent Cril Payne, who wrote about his time as an undercover leftie. During breaks between lectures on the New Left, drug abuse and FBI procedure, Payne and several G-men would sneak away to get stoned. \"We were definitely a happy group as we floated over to the dining hall,\" Payne recalled. \"Just as we had suspected, the food did taste better, especially the second helpings.\" Payne could hardly keep from laughing as he watched his classmates \"systematically appropriate ever-increasing portions of the official Bureau stash.\" Payne fooled his surveillance targets by posing as a pot dealer. This way he could easily explain how he was able to support himself without a regular job and why he split the scene for brief interludes. \"And since there was a certain aura of mystery and intrigue surrounding marijuana dealers, many of whom were viewed as modern day folk heroes, I wouldn't be expected to divulge extensive information about myself,\" Payne later explained. The fact that he supplied, rolled, and smoked reefer further enhanced his credibility as a dealer and a counterculture radical. \"My undercover experiences brought me to the point where I considered marijuana use a normal social occurrence,\" said Payne, who confided that he found the altered state of awareness brought on by cannabis to be \"both pleasurable and relaxing.\" He eventually left the FBI disillusioned with the suits who ran the Bureau and somewhat sympathetic to the earnest young radicals he consorted with during his days and nights undercover. From Chapter 5: When Carolyn (\"Mountain Girl\") Garcia, the matriarch of the Grateful Dead, started cultivating marijuana in her backyard in the early 1970s, making money wasn't part of the homegrown equation. For Mountain Girl and her husband, Jerry Garcia, cannabis was always more sacrament than commodity. Their home in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, attracted a steady stream of visitors and world travelers, including some who brought marijuana seeds from exotic places. Mountain Girl, the daughter of a botanist, had a way with plants in general and cannabis in particular. She planted a few pot seeds from Vietnam in a secluded spot in her outdoor garden and by summer's end the Dead and their extended family were getting blitzed on MG's \"Marble Buddha\" weed. It was stronger than any pot they had smoked. \"Two hits of this stuff and you were gone, you'd turn into a marble Buddha,\" said Mountain Girl. Mountain Girl shared her growing techniques with other eager gardeners. \"I had a whole circle of friends who were doing it . . . this whole group of women growers who started in Mendicino,\" she recalled. As more would-be pot growers turned to her for advice, Mountain Girl put her thoughts down on paper. Primo Plant, the first cannabis cultivation handbook written by a woman, included homespun tips on com- posting, ground preparation, greenhouses, soil mixes, pruning and cultivating a deeper relationship with one's plants. She felt that a grower's personal vibe became part of the plant's vibe. \"Thai farmers pray and meditate in their gardens,\" MG noted. One of Mountain Girl's infamous associates from the psychedelic Sixties had his own ideas about how to augment a marijuana crop. Augustus Owsley Stanley III, the legendary underground chemist who produced some 12 million doses of LSD before running afoul of the law, also got into growing reefer. He studied Rudolph Steiner's writings on biodynamic gardening and applied them in a rather idiosyncratic way to marijuana horticulture. Owsley maintained the herb grew better if you made love in your pot patch. Cannabis cultivators had something else in mind when they spoke of \"sexing the plants,\" a practice that entailed identifying and uprooting all the males to prevent the female marijuana plants from being pollinated. The sexually frustrated females produce bigger flower clusters with more sticky, aromatic resin in an attempt to catch pollen that never arrives. Known as sinsemilla (Spanish for \"without seeds\"), the unfertilized females buds, oozing psychoactive THC and other phytocannabinoids, are the most prized part of the marijuana crop. This ancient method of cultivating potent, seedless reefer was rediscovered and resurrected by American horticulturists in the 1970s. Sexing the plants was simple - all you needed to know was what the male and female flowers looked like in their earliest stages. Mountain Girl wrote about it. So did Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal in The Marijuana Grower's Guide. Cannabis, a hearty, adapt- able plant that almost anyone could grow, also lent itself to sophisticated breeding and cultivation techniques, such as cloning and crossing strains, which were explained scientifically in Robert Connell Clarke's Marijuana Botany. These books would influence an up-and-coming generation of ganja gardeners who quickly picked up on the rule \u2014if you want great stuff, snuff the males. From Chapter 6: Cheerful, feisty and legally blind, Elvy Musikka was the third person approved for the Compassionate Investigative New Drug program, the second glaucoma patient to qualify, and the first woman to get prescription pot from Uncle Sam. Born with congenital cataracts, she credited cannabis with partially restoring and preserving her sight in one eye after several botched surgeries. \"If you smoke or eat marijuana, your whole system gets so much better,\" said Musikka, who became a federal patient When Carolyn (\"Mountain Girl\") Garcia, the matriarch of the Grateful Dead, started cultivating marijuana in her backyard in the early 1970s, making money wasn't part of the homegrown equation. For Mountain Girl and her husband, Jerry Garcia, cannabis was always more sacrament than commodity. Martin A.

Lee is a brilliant, poetic and sharp-witted author and speaker, and he is one of the leading social historians of the counter-culture.Photograph by Quincey Imhoff in 1988 shortly after a Florida judge declared her innocent of marijuana charges on the grounds of medical necessity. (She had been busted for growing a few plants in her backyard.) Musikka felt compelled to speak out for people in need of medicinal cannabis. She had the time of her life touring the country with the Cannabis Action Network (CAN) in the early 1990s. \"Those kids were wonderful. They worked their little fannies off - that's for sure,\" Musikka reminisced. \"They were determined to put everything aside and go out and educate people. They had the same idea as I did. We've got to tell people! If people knew the truth, they would not keep this prohibition.\" Musikka gave CAN instant credibility. She was a walking, talking repudiation of the official fiction that cannabis had no therapeutic benefit. Her very existence exposed the knotted lie at the heart of marijuana prohibition. \"The medicinal aspect was crucial \u2014that's what the press wanted,\" said CAN founder Debby Goldsberry. \"And we had Elvy. It seemed like everywhere we went Elvy appeared on the front page of the newspaper the next day. She toured with us constantly for several years. She lived in the van with us. It was like having your grandmother along.\" There was no generation gap on this caravan. They were all united by their devotion to cannabis. \"It's a holy weed. I thank God for it every day of my life,\" said Musikka. Whereas some medical marijuana advocates were squeamish about conflating recreational and therapeutic consumption, Elvy didn't mince words: \"It's a very positive, mind-altering experience. enhances creativity . . . I enjoy the high.\" From Chapter 7: Cannabis-smoking was not uncommon among world class athletes \u2014soccer stars, swimmers, skiers, boxers, football and baseball players, the gamut\u2014 who found marijuana, a pain-management and stress-reducing medicine, to be well suited for the injurious lifestyle of an athlete. Canadian Ross Rebagliati, the first snow- boarder to win Olympic gold, was almost stripped of his medal after he tested positive for marijuana in 1998. He said he had inhaled secondhand pot smoke at a party. Within extreme winter sports circles \"marijuana culture is widely accepted and is not something looked down upon,\" according to Rebagliati. In bygone days, a marijuana bust might have torpedoed a promising athletic career. But this was '98 \u2014 year of \"the Dude,\" the pot-smoking slacker played by Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski. Throughout the wide world of sports and celebrity entertainment, it was indisputable \u2014 the Weed, like the Dude, abides. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 70 The Homemade Pantry: 101 Foods You Can Stop Buying & Start Making By Alana ChernilaReviewed by Sarah Newland Homemade toaster pastries?

If you have a mindfully-stocked pantry of staples and some time to spend in the heart of your home (your kitchen), then you can create any of these wonderful mealtime foods or snacks from scratch. Your family will love you for it. I can't wait to try the veggie burgers (along with homemade buns and ketchup!) served with rhubarb ginger soda, as well as several of her car snacks for the ride home from school. Chernila created the blog EatingFromTheGroundUp in 2008, and includes many wonderful photos within this debut cookbook of cooking, eating, and family life. She also writes about mishaps in the kitchen and what it's like to cook with small, hungry, and sometimes crabby children underfoot - for which I was grateful! There aren't too many whole grains included in this cookbook, but I loved it anyway. $24.99, Clarkson Potter Publishers. Your Brain on Nature: The Science of Nature's Influence on Your Health, Happiness, and VitalityBy Eva M. Selhub, MD & Alan C. Logan, NDReviewed by Karen A'Llerio Some people believe humans are evolving away from nature. In Your Brain on Nature, Eva Selhub and Alan Logan write that, in fact, we are an integral component of the natural world, and that part of us is being lost in our fast technical/gadget culture. The denial of our nature leads to both mental and physical stress. The way to de-stress and restore us to full health is ecotherapy, or what they call \"Vitamin G\". A prescription for Vitamin G taps into the \"medicinal force\" of nature. The authors compile an amazing number of studies to support their argument-- studies showing the detrimental effects of lengthy screen-time, preference for nature-scapes over city-scapes, benefits from tree-assisted therapy, etc. If you're like I am, you'll find it disconcerting that there are no notes or bibliography. I also wish their editor could have convinced them that less is more. Their main point gets lost when they include common \"nature\" relationships - the plant in the office, getting a pet, etc. Much could have been put in an appendix making the book more focused and readable. The authors' wider concern: \"[O]ur turn away from nature is associated with less empathy and attraction to nature and, in turn, less interest in environmental efforts related to nature.\" This can be mitigated if we experience an intimate relationship with nature. I agree. To care about something we have to know it, to feel empathy with it, but I was disappointed with their conclusion . We so often need to use something to make it valuable to us. Selhub and Logan miss the opportunity to focus on the intimate respectful relationship we need with the earth and living world, instead they give us another example of how we can use nature to our advantage. Nature is a medicinal force we tap into to make ourselves healthy\u2014our Vitamin G. $19.95, John Wiley & Sons. Timeless: Protectorate NovelBy Gail Carriger Reviewed by Carol Karr After reading Soulless, I immediately purchased the remaining 4 books in this series by NYT bestselling author Gail Carriger. This series is a fantastic read if you like mysteries, intriguing plot twists, Victorian England, steampunk, parasols, quick-witted heroines, the supernatural and preternatural! Timeless is the fifth book in this series. I am very much enjoying the company of Alexia Tarabotti. She is sharp in thought and tongue while still managing to be very well-mannered. The series starts off with Alexia as a spinster who is half Italian and living with her nonsensical mother and two stepsisters all of whom do not share Alexia's olive skin, dark eyes and black hair. As if her heritage and marital status are not enough of a social challenge, Alexia prefers libraries and good tea to shopping, and is totally fascinated with the gadgetry of the time. Oh yes, did I mention she has no soul? No, literally, she is soulless. It is this state of soullessness which gives her some interesting advantages in a London filled with politically correct vampires and werewolves, dirigibles and other incredible mechanical inventions of the era. In Timeless, book five of the series, Alexia is now Lady Maccon, wife of Lord Connell Maccon, head of the B.U.R (Bureau of Unnatural Registry) and alpha to London's Woolsey werewolf pack. She continues on her adventures with a precocious toddler (previously referred to as 'the infant inconvenience', and who is prone to turning supernatural willy-nilly) in tow. These comedic mysteries are page turners. The characters and plots are well thought out and developed. I highly recommend this series to anyone who is looking for an escape into another place and time. The Parasol Protectorate books are: Soulless, Changeless, Blameless, Heartless, and Timeless. $7.99, Orbit.CW Staff Book Reviews Books available at Crazy Wisdom and shopcrazywisdom.com We pay writers We are looking for good articles about the holistic scene...reportage, personal journaling and essays, profiles, interviews, journalistic explorations, and other feature writing.

The field is open to the public so that people can see what's growing. \"The fields are beautiful,\" says Tsomo, \"since we plant our gardens to have flowers right through into the fall.\" By request, families can also tour the greenhouses and other fields, and, depending on timing, can take a tour of the animals' areas. In the coming seasons, Tsomo said White Lotus Farms plans to offer additional programs for children. One idea is a \"lifecycles\" program that will teach kids about where our food comes from and how it grows, from seed to harvest. A second option would allow kids to meet the farm's animals to help them learn how they are cared for and how they produce food for people. Next spring, White Lotus Farms plans a monthly program for children to teach them how food is produced and how a farm progresses throughout a growing season. Once-monthly activities will include learning about soil and how it's prepared for planting, planting time, caring for plants and watching how they develop, and, finally, sharing a harvest meal with kids and their families, to enjoy the produce they The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 72 New, Fun, and Just Plain Cool If you'd like to be considered for inclusion in the next Crazy Wisdom Kids column, please contact our columnist at: cwkidscolumn@crazywisdom.net. The deadline for submissions for the January thru April 2013 issue is November 1, 2012. By Nieka Apell White Lotus Farms Located west of Zeeb Road on W. Liberty Road, White Lotus Farms offers families the opportunity to purchase the freshest possible produce, breads, and baked goods, while learning about plant and animal life cycles and sustainable agricultural methods. \"We want to provide the experience of really good, fresh produce,\" says Katheryn Tsomo, manager of the farm cart. \"Here, families can buy wonderful, fresh produce, and children can actually see the plants that grew that food for them.\" White Lotus Farms began selling their fresh produce, breads, eggs, goat's milk, and other products in April 2012. The farm is operated by the Buddhist community known as Tsogyelgar (named for the great Tibetan female Buddha, Yeshe Tsogyel). Founded in 1990, the community began farming for the Ann Arbor Food Gatherers' Faith and Food program several years ago. Faith and Food is a campaign to provide fresh produce to supplement area canned and packaged food drives. Each \"faith garden\" devotes at least 50 percent of their harvest to Food Gatherers, while any additional food they raise can be donated, shared, or sold. \"Our farm, which is called Wishing Tree Gardens, was very successful,\" says Tsomo. \"We have been donating over 3,000 pounds of fresh produce for the past several years. It turned out we were growing so much food that we decided to start a small farm cart. That led to the creation of White Lotus Farms, our farm cart that is open for the public to buy our foods.\" On Wednesdays, the cart is open from 4 to 6:30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. \"On Wednesdays, people can stop by on their way home from work and, on Saturdays, families can make a trip of it,\" says Tsomo. \"We have worked hard to provide a family atmosphere. The farm cart is located in a spacious, fenced area with a large play structure for children,\" Tsomo explains. The play structure is made from untreated, sustainably grown cedar wood. Baby pigs and goats are often available for children to interact with, and people involved with the farm can help the children hold the animals and to talk with them about how they provide food for people. \"We really wanted to create a beautiful, safe space to shop in,\" says Tsomo. White Lotus Farms' produce is currently only available at their property, not sold in other stores. \"We want people's food to be as fresh as possible, harvested right as we open the cart,\" explained Tsomo. \"We also don't want to harvest more or less than we need on any given day. There's more to it, too. Even at a farmers' market, there's still a disconnect between the customer and the farm itself. Even though it's local, there's still a disconnect with the actual plants. Here, families can buy wonderful, fresh produce, and the children can see the plants that grew that food for them.\" On the last Saturday of the month, White Lotus Farms offers a special, free Kids' Day during business hours. Children can learn about and hold baby animals, including chickens, goats, and piglets; make a craft project; have their faces painted; and play in sand and water tables and on the play structure. Live music that appeals to kids sometimes sets a festive mood on Kids' Days, too. \"Our Kids' Days have been enormously successful,\" says Tsomo.On the last Saturday of the month, White Lotus Farms offers a special, free Kids' Day during business hours.

At the same time, my father was dying.\" Louis entered into a lot of soul-searching and prayer. \"I was also just learning to meditate, and did that to find answers while I struggled through my college coursework.

I was asking, asking the universe to show me, guide me, and help me, and 'music' was the response I received.\"have watched grow. Other plans for children and school groups include birthday parties and field trips. On a summer Saturday, farm cart shoppers chose from freshly harvested kale, zucchini, beans, peppers, tomatoes, lettuces, Swiss chard, carrots, beets, onions, garlic, and fresh flowers. Tsomo predicts that fall will bring potatoes, squash, Brussels sprouts, melons, broccoli, head lettuce, baby lettuce, and sugar snap and snow peas. White Lotus Farms is currently GAAMP (Generally Accepted Agricultural and Management Practices) certified and Tsomo explained that all farming and food production at White Lotus Farms follows organic practices. \"We're working to go beyond that, too,\" says Tsomo. \"We want to use completely sustainable methods.\" The farm has a worm composting (vermiculture) system in place and plans to expand their aquaponics system. According to Tsomo, aquaponics is a \"closed loop system,\" in which fish produce waste that is used as nutrition for feeding plants grown in water. As the plants grow, they remove the waste and clean the water, which is then returned to the fish. \"We used this system to grow lettuce in the spring and the food is absolutely delicious!\" says Tsomo. In addition to produce, White Lotus Farms offers a variety of fresh baked goods, baked by Katheryn Tsomo's husband, Trinl\u00e9 Tsomo. Breads baked in the farm's stone ovens include two whole wheats (one five-grain), Parmesan pepper, cranberry walnut, sourdoughs, and baguettes, along with croissants and cookies. Pastry Chef Pria Momo Starr, a recent graduate of the French Pastry School in Chicago, creates confections including pat\u00ea de fruit (chewy fruit candies), lollipops, and caramels. Chicken eggs and a limited number of duck eggs are also available, along with goat's milk soaps and cajeta (caramel sauce). Raw goat's milk is available to customers enrolled in a milk share program that currently has a waiting list (contact White Lotus Farms for more information). Tsomo says they plan to expand their goatherd in the spring, to accommodate the demand for milk, and to provide milk for the goat's milk cheese they hope to sell. \"We want to be known as a farm using organic, sustainable methods while teaching people the connection between the plants and animals and the food,\" says Tsomo. \"We want people to know us for donating lots of food to the community and for providing delicious and fresh food to families.\" White Lotus Farms will remain open for the growing season through October and will re-open in April 2013. The farm is located at 7217 W. Liberty Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48103.

Guy Louis and Chautauqua Express When musician Guy Louis Sferlazza was a young man, his father passed away from cancer. \"I really felt that his illness was caused by the fact that he never liked any of his jobs,\" said Louis (he's known professionally as Guy Louis). He explained, \"He never found his path in life. I realized that I had better figure out what would feed my life, feed my soul. What should I be doing?\" What Louis found is music, especially hands-on musical celebrations for children and their families.Chautauqua Express [is] named in honor of the Chautauqua Movement, which encouraged itinerant and mobile artists, performers, and intellectuals to bring high-quality performances to rural America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 73 Continued on page 74 \"At that age, they are still so ready to receive these positive messages. They still see life as a journey, that life is fun. I want to engage their minds and take them on a trip.\" Part of this trip is learning about instruments, cultures, the environment, and our world. Guy Louis the folk music circuit\u2014and none of them felt quite right. \"I was still worried about being part of a group that could dissolve at any time. Then suddenly, I thought to myself, 'I can do this. Here is my avenue, where I alone can play my music and speak to children about what is important in life.' \" By 1986, Louis realized that if he could write and produce a quality product to perform in schools, he could \"live his passion in music.\" He founded the Chautauqua Express, which he named in honor of the Chautauqua Movement, which encouraged itinerant and mobile artists, performers, and intellectuals to bring high-quality performances to rural America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. \"I began with one single show about musical instruments and their histories,\" says Louis. \"From the very beginning, my show was always very interactive. Kids got involved, sang, danced, touched instruments, and learned, while having fun!\" By 1991, Louis' school assembly schedule was filling. In the summer of 1991, Louis was also invited to perform at a summer arts festival in Plymouth. He noticed that adults\u2014even older adults\u2014were enjoying his music. \"I realized that I could also do family concerts,\" he said. Family concerts at venues throughout the state and in the Chicago area remain an integral part Louis's current schedule as well. Louis, who has no children of his own, says, \"One of the main things kids taught me was to have fun with what I'm doing. One of the many, many blessings I've received from my work with children is that I can make a living while presenting my messages of upliftment, hope, and love while creating a positive, fun, learning space for everyone.\" As schools saw their students' reactions to Louis's programs, they often wanted him to return, but only if he had new music and themes to offer. This led to the creation of many thematic programs, including World Music Tour (which allows kids to hear and handle instruments such as a sitar and Renaissance lute), Discover Your Dreams (character development), Environmental Awareness, Black History in Music, Reading, Native American Music, and Latin Music Celebration. In 1993, Louis was selected to be part of the Michigan Arts and Humanities Touring Program, which not only validated his work, but also allowed him to use grant monies to provide discounts to his clients. By the mid-1990s, Chautauqua Express had booked over 400 shows per year, and Louis hired a full-time assistant, Kim Gouin, to handle the administrative part of the business. \"We made Chautauqua Express into a solid business. Together, Kim and I... provided the very best service to schools and allowed me to keep my focus on the product\u2014quality performances and important messages,\" said Louis. In 2000, however, everything changed with the economy and schools quite suddenly had no money for field trips or assemblies. \"When monies get cut, the arts get cut. I kept hearing, 'There's just no money for you this year,' \" said Louis. By 2010, things reached a low point for Louis. Kim Gouin left Chautauqua Express to go back to school to get a teaching degree and Louis's wife was injured and lost her job. Louis continued to seek ways to keep his business afloat, despite the bleak economic times. During Obama's inauguration, Louis said he felt as if someone whispered in his ear, \"Try Chicago.\" \"I was trying to find a way to keep my business together and I started marketing for school assemblies there and got a great response.\" Louis continues, \"Now, my wife is improving, the economy is improving, and things once again just look so bright! I feel like we've made it through the wilderness. Praise God, we've made it through! Praise be to God that I have a full performing schedule ahead of me. Having come through the hardships of the last several years makes me even more thankful for what I am allowed to do to fulfill my passion.\"Despite a lack of formal musical training, Louis left college and moved to Philadelphia, where in 1980 he started a band, creating original, adult contemporary music. \"Our music felt like a source of upliftment, healing, and love flowing into the world,\" said Louis. The band remained together for two years. \"It was hard for me when the band broke up. I had dedicated my life to it... I thought about starting another band, but realized that bands are notoriously hard to keep together.\" So Louis decided to go back to college in Michigan, where he could help his now-widowed mother. He enrolled at Oakland University to study music full-time. \"I loved my time at Oakland University,\" he said. \"I was like a sponge, soaking up every bit of musical training I could.\" It was during his time at Oakland University in the early 1980s when, in a jazz guitar ensemble class, he met a man who was part of an ensemble group that performed for school children. Comprised of dancers, theatre students, and musicians, they wrote their own shows to perform at school assemblies throughout the area. \"He was the guitarist, but couldn't go back for the next year. He told me how to express interest in the job and I got it. It was absolutely a turning point for me,\" explains Louis. Although the ensemble group dissolved at the end of the following year, Louis said the experience affected him profoundly. During this time, he had continued to perform his music at a variety of other venues\u2014clubs, fairs, Continued from page 73The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 74 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community \"One of the main things kids taught me was to have fun with what I'm doing.

Fri November 30th: During the coming school year, Louis will perform nine different assembly themes at area schools, as well as numerous family concerts. What does he hope kids will learn from his performances? \"Most important,\" he said, \"kids intuitively recognize that here is an adult man doing something that he just passionately loves. They feel that just through osmosis. How many adult men do they see jumping around on a stage and playing music and having that much pure fun?\" During a recent elementary school concert, Louis held the crowd entranced for over an hour. \"That is a gift that I have,\" he explained. \"I can come into a room of 200 or 300 elementary children and by the grace of God, I have some magnetism that allows me to hold their attention. It's like a vibration. At that age, they are still so ready to receive these positive messages. They still see life as a journey, that life is fun. I want to engage their minds and take them on a trip.\" Part of this trip is learning about instruments, cultures, the environment, and our world. In addition, Louis said he wants children to feel their own empowerment. \"I engage them in performances not only because it is fun, but because I want to show them how much I respect their ideas, that I respect their persons, and what they can do to be part of my performances.\" The lyrics of many of Louis's current songs reflect these themes of love, empowerment, and being connected with the world through music.

Shaman Kidz Parents of young children often notice that their kids share stories of \"imaginary friends\" or animals that come to them, seemingly to protect or befriend them. Sometimes, parents minimize these relationships, brushing them off as a simple form of creative play. Instead, according to Kate Durda, M.A., it is important to understand that this is not \"just\" imagination. Rather, it is true spiritual activity in which the child is involved. Sometimes children have intuitions, \"funny feelings,\" or even prophetic dreams, or report seeing deceased relatives or pets. Durda explains, \"Children are often spiritually 'in tune' from a very early age. Rather than undermine this, hopefully more parents and teachers will come to understand that supporting their children's spirituality is one of the biggest gifts they could give.\" To help facilitate children's spiritual development, Durda and Stephanie Tighe, M.S.W., founded Spirit Weavers, a partnership offering shamanic healing and training for children and adults. Their Shaman Kidz program for children ages 6-10 has been enthusiastically received in Lansing, and will be offered soon in the Ann Arbor area as well. Dates have not yet been set, but Durda is accepting names from those who want to be on the email announcement list. A developmental psychologist, spiritual healer, teacher, researcher, and consultant, Durda has offered spiritual healing and advising for over 16 years. Her interest in creating the Shaman Kidz program arose from her deeply held belief that we must teach our children about the interconnectedness of all life. \"I believe it is ours and our children's birthright to recognize and feel at home in the circle of life. Let us help our children hold onto their birthright and walk together with them and all our relations,\" she says. The Native American phrase mitakuye oyasin , or \"all my relations,\" helps us remember everything is connected and we are not alone, nor are we the most important inhabitants of the world. Rather than dismissing children's observations of unseen persons or animals, as well as their feelings or intuitions, Durda's work encourages children to explore these relationships and spiritual abilities, and the ways they can enrich and empower children's lives. During the Shaman Kidz gatherings, children draw, sing songs, and dance to become familiar with their animal friends and with all life on Mother Earth. Durda explains that the children also \"journey\" to help them discover their power animals or totems. Journeying could very simplistically be described as a form of meditation to a drum beat. \"Drumming is an essential part of the journey, since it helps a person get to a state of mind called 'theta.' This is a measurable pattern of our brainwaves associated with a level of consciousness supporting feelings of peace, belonging, joy, and creativity,\" explains Durda. \"The drum helps create a state in which one can perceive energies in the universal field. Kids can see the animals they are meant to see and can communicate with them.\"Durda adds that children often get to the theta state more easily than adults during a shamanic journey. \"Their minds just go to that state when they are out playing in nature,\" she says. \"Unstructured play, especially involving activities that 'quiet' the left brain, are conducive to shifting consciousness to the place of peace, joy, healing, connectedness, creativity,\" she says. \"This is not the state of being created by competitive activities, electronic war games, video games, and television. There is a balance that is important to maintain. If the spiritual side is neglected, it affects the child's overall life and well-being.\" In the spiritual journey type of meditation, different children may see the same animal. Durda explained that these power animals offer different things to each person. A certain animal may help a child learn how to share his or her own particular strengths, abilities, and wisdom. A spider, for example, might share her ability to weave or create beautiful artwork, while a bear may offer strength and protection.

Jessica and Daniel with PrayerTrees Continued on page 76Children involved in Shaman Kidz workshops say that the experience of meeting their animals empowers them. Nine-year-old Bella commented, \"I felt happy, strong, brave, and felt like I could do anything I wanted that was fun and good...It felt like the animal was inside me and was coming through me and dancing in the real world...It helped me feel safe and protected.\" Eight-year-old Megan said, \"By doing my work [shamanic journey] I can believe I can do it. My math, my subtraction. It made me safe around my whole body and no one can touch or hurt me...They [power animals] could help me by protecting me and keep me safe. With homework and my family, too.\" Durda noted that improving kids' performance in school subjects like math is not an explicit goal of the Shaman Kidz program, but said that the experiences children have during their shamanic journeys inevitably have positive effects on other aspects of their lives. \"We are focused on what kids need in order to feel strong and to do well in life,\" she says. \"Children feel empowered when engaging in spiritual activities, and, when you are in touch with yourself, you can do anything and feel very good about yourself. If you can build a sense of confidence and self-esteem, it will allow children to do everything better.\" Durda reflected on Einstein's statement, \"We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.\" The feelings of confidence, strength, and protection nurtured by a child's power animal often help them think differently in difficult situations. \"Let's say, for example,\" she explains, \"that someone kicks your child. If the child is not strong, they may go to that place of anger or of doubting themselves, thinking they are not well liked, or they are 'bad.' \" Durda continues, \"If, a child is able to know, 'I am strong. I know I am not a bad person,' they can react differently. They will likely choose a healthier response, where they understand that they did not cause or deserve this treatment, but maybe the hurtful child needs some help and love. They can't solve the problem from the place of angry retaliation or sadness, but may be able to respond healthily if they have the self-confidence to use different thinking.\" Learning about one's power animals also helps Shaman Kidz participants feel more connected to the Earth and to all the beings that live here. She said she often sees children very disconnected from the natural world. \"There's too much texting, too much focus on electronics. Kids are getting very detached from nature and the natural world. There's something very important about kids being outside and taking care of a bunny or a puppy in the yard.\" This disconnectedness with nature is often evident when children encounter wild creatures. Durda explains, \"You see a child at the park catching a frog in a jar or stuffing a snake into a plastic bag. You know that kid is a good kid and the parents are watching and smiling and thinking, 'Isn't it great that my child loves nature so much.' But what about that snake or frog? Many kids are so detached from the natural world, and that carries over into a lack of sensitivity for dealing with their playmates, friends, and family members.\" Durda said that connecting with one's power animal can help kids become more sensitive toward all living beings. As eight-year-old Megan explained, \"I felt safe with my power animal. I felt it in the middle of me. I felt I was my animal most of the time.\" This feeling of interconnectedness can help children feel safe and confident in their interactions with other people, which can lead to empathy and respect for the animal world. Parents and other family members of children involved in the Shaman Kidz gatherings praise Durda's and Tighe's skills and the experiences their children have. The mother of ten-year-old Jessica commented that her daughter is approaching the age at which \"kids are starting to judge each other and I am hoping that I can show her the shaman way of Light and Love...I loved seeing the kids excited about this and am hopeful that Jessica will want to continue to 'journey' and look for her power animal.\"Other parents commented that one of the most important things their children gained from the program is the understanding that they are not alone in their approach to spirituality. Nicole, mother of Oradel, age seven, said, \"My children are around so many people, adults and children alike, who do not believe in the mystery and interconnectedness of life, so they are open with me and within themselves \u2014 but a little closed with the rest of the world, as they have been made fun of when they have shared with non-believers. This class was a blessing, for Oradel saw that we are not alone!\" Most importantly, said Durda, the children love being part of the group. One grandmother, who brought her three grandchildren, commented, \"The children loved the atmosphere and energy... They kept asking when the next one was going to be. 'Can we go back?' Later, at only the second gathering they attended, they walked in and the youngest, six-year-old Ethan, said, as he walked into the yoga center, 'It feels like home!' \" After the first Shaman Kidz gathering, mother of six-year-old Aiyana wrote, \"Aiyana had a great time at the gathering. She actually has taught my husband, her little sister, and both of my parents how to 'journey' since then! I couldn't believe how much she got out of the class!\" Durda said that, currently, all of the children involved in Shaman Kidz come from families \"who are already spiritually involved and can support kids quite easily. What is more difficult is learning where to go in terms of the more mainstream population to introduce these ideas there.\" She will be exploring over time more spiritual activities for children in different settings, in order to offer this opportunity to more children and families. Although the program is called \"Shaman Kidz,\" Durda emphasizes that this is a program simply supporting spirituality in children. Children whose parents are not involved themselves with shamanism will still benefit from Shaman Kidz. \"The most important thing with children is listening to them. We can't know exactly what they are experiencing in their spiritual life or in any other aspect of their lives, so the most important thing is to just be willing to listen to them and to talk to them about their experiences.\" Shaman Kidz will be offered in Ann Arbor as soon as there are enough interested families. If you would like to get on the mailing list for the Ann Arbor program, or know of another community interested in providing this kind of spiritual support to children, please contact Kate Durda at 517.667.0694 or SpiritWeavers@gmail.com or visit www.SpiritWeavers.net. Susan Barrow, L.M.S.W., Infant Mental Health and Play-Based Therapies When most people hear the words \"infant mental health,\" they are puzzled. However, \"It's not about crazy babies,\" assures Licensed Master Social Worker Susan Barrow. Instead, her private practice aims to help parents build relationships with their infants and toddlers from birth to age three and to continue enhancing relationships with older children through play-based therapies. Barrow explains that the idea of infant mental health grew out of the Child Development Project, directed by Selma Fraiberg at the University of Michigan in the 1970s. Fraiberg was one of the founders of the field of infant mental health. Her work on the intergenerational transmission of trauma was described in her landmark paper entitled, \"Ghosts in the Nursery,\" which explores how parents' own experiences, including difficulties from their pasts, are brought into relationships with their young children. Fraiberg and some of her contemporaries went one step further, proposing that infant mental health counseling is of benefit not only to families in crisis, but to nearly everyone. Barrow says, \"She thought everyone brought a 'history' to their parenting and that everyone could benefit from infant mental health counseling.\" Barrow takes this approach with her clients at her office, located at 328 S. Ashley (above Lexi's Toy Box). She says many parents feel comfortable with their parent-child relationships when the baby is very dependent, but that feelings sometimes grow more complicated as the child becomes less dependent. For these families, Barrow works with the young child and parent together (often, but not always, the mother), watching floor play and feedings. \"I watch the parent to see if it seems to be a pleasurable experience to play with their baby, and we might watch during nursing and feeding times to see if this seems to be a joyful time or if it appears to be tense,\" she says. Parents can then talk with Barrow about their feelings toward parenting and \"What we heard from so many parents was that the paper game was making kids read less...The whole point of the new game is to keep kids' minds active and to keep them excited about reading and learning all summer long.\"Continued from page 75The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 76 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Communitytheir own personal histories. She explains,\"What you bring with you affects your parenting, your attachment with your baby, and the development of that relationship. Issues from your own childhood, associations with food or discipline, or any number of things can affect how you parent.\" Currently, Barrow describes herself as \"working in two worlds\": her \"day job\" doing in-home counseling with at-risk families for Washtenaw County Community Support and Treatment Services CSTS) and her private counseling practice. Barrow says she came to counseling in \"non-direct\" ways, first earning a bachelor's degree in classical guitar from Eastern Michigan University and then attending a year of graduate school at Bowling Green in Ohio. \"I liked music because it was creative,\" says Barrow, \"but music history was not creative enough.\" She left the program and began teaching at a preschool in Ohio. She felt a deep connection to children and, when she moved to Ann Arbor, she began teaching at the Children's Center. \"Joan Rehak was a mentor to me,\" says Barrow. \"She taught me about understanding children, about seeing children from children's perspectives, and honoring children.\" Barrow later founded an in-home daycare when her own children were small. During her time as a preschool educator and daycare provider, she says she was \"always really attracted to the kids who were having problems.\" She later earned her master's of social work degree at the University of Michigan, so that she could continue to help children and families facing challenges. Just as watching parents play with their infants and toddlers can help Barrow understand and enhance those relationships, she believes that both play and animals can be beneficial parts of therapies for older children and their caregivers. \"Play is so important in my work,\" says Barrow. \"Often when you think of therapy, it's very clinical. I try to get families to experience a playful spirit during therapy sessions. I find that trying things out through play develops regulation skills and also helps minimize negativity.\" She finds that many parents are simply not comfortable playing with their children, so she offers sessions for parents on how to connect with their children through play. One very simple idea Barrow suggests is to engage in \"special time\" with your child. \"For just 20 minutes, you follow the child's lead. If they just want you to sit close to them while they watch TV, you do that, but also try to engage in other activities they choose. They will come to know that you will get into the activity and do what they want to do for that time, and that can be very meaningful to them.\" Barrow shared a story from her own childhood of a special time with her father that left a lasting impression. Her father wanted to make kites together. \"It was very important to him to make them the way he did as a boy,\" says Barrow. Her father would bend wood to make the structure of the kite, and then they would use newspaper dipped in flour and water paste. \"I remember wondering, 'Why in the world can't we just go get some Elmer's glue?'\" she recalls. \"I now realize that that was the way he did it with his dad, and he wanted to give that experience to me. He wanted to teach me that you can make your own things. Our relationship was enhanced by that. Sure, we could have gone to the five and dime and bought a kite, and we did do that, but it's not the same memory. This is a memory of being physically close to my dad and creating something together. It was a deep and meaningful connection.\" Still, Barrow notes that children may not fully grasp the meaning and affect of activities like this until they reflect on them much later. \"And that's okay,\" she reassures. Like play, working with animals in therapy can be very powerful. Many visitors to Lexi's Toy Box have met Nathaniel, the friendly shop rabbit. \"I find that Nathaniel can be very helpful in many types of imaginative and pretend play,\" says Barrow. For example, a child with intense school anxiety may benefit from having Nathaniel \"be\" a fellow student, acting out difficult moments through the rabbit. In addition, Nathaniel can be useful in her work with adopted and foster children. Nathaniel was adopted from a rabbit rescue and, as she tells these children his story, they often exclaim, \"That's just like me!\" Barrow hopes to build on her own love for animals and their beneficial roles in therapy with children. Her own golden retriever recently received the Canine Good Citizen Certification and she hopes to complete Therapy Dog Certification soon. \"Working with and caring for an animal can be such an important part of therapy for a child. When working with a larger animal, it's necessary to give up control. You cannot have total control over a large animal, and learning this can be very useful in therapies for children,\" Barrow says. \"In order to be successful with a dog, you have to be regulated. Kids can learn to calm and regulate themselves in order to get the dog to play with them, and this can be extremely gratifying.\" In addition to her private practice counseling, Barrow offers occasional workshops at Lexi's Toy Box on topics ranging from discipline, to playing with your child, to food and sleep issues.

I had a great time and think that everyone had a bit of fun with my program of head to toe functional stretching and strength training. Over a few days, I taught all three shifts of factory employees and enjoyed working with such a wide range of people. In several of the classes, I asked whether people had a regular fitness routine and what it was. It was revealing when only a few admitted to exercising regularly. When I asked about their challenges with bringing exercise into their daily life, they responded with some very familiar thoughts, including not having enough free time, feeling too tired at the end or beginning of the day, it being too hard, aches and pains preventing them from exercising, and wanting to avoid pain from exercising. Then I heard something that made me stop and think. A few people said they wanted to spend the little free time they had with their kids. They explained that their lives are so full of responsibilities and stress that it's difficult to find extra time to devote to fitness. In this difficult economy and with all the challenges we face in our daily lives, I appreciate it when I hear that people are trying to stay focused on family priorities and celebrating time spent with their children. However, we must actively promote a culture of wellness within our family so that our children will thrive and live healthy active lives as adults. It is the easiest way to ensure that you, the parent, live a vibrant, full, and healthy life and so do your children. What I think is at issue is that many people don't know how to develop their own personal wellness or that of their family. Below, I've outlined a few steps that will start you thinking about a plan that works for you. Put Your Oxygen Mask on First You've heard it on airplanes. The flight attendant's comment about putting your own oxygen mask on before you put it on your children. We all know why. If we can't breathe, how are we going to take care of our kids? This idea holds true with our fitness and wellness. Creating a vision and plan for yourself will positively impact your family, but you need to take the time to think about what wellness means to you and paint the picture in your mind of you as your \"best self.\" You can write it, draw it, or just think about it, but taking the time to define this for yourself is the first step. Later, you can think about your individual children and family members, but for now, focus on you. This will help you define your goals, seek the support you need, and identify potential challenges and key motivators. For me, wellness is living to my fullest in body, mind, and spirit. That vision is not a static one, but has had to be fluid since becoming a parent. Finding ways to stay fit and healthy, find peaceful nourishing moments, and tend to my own health issues requires attention and focus. At first it felt like something else on my long \"to do\" list, but after a while this step became more natural. What I found was that if I trusted my own process of development by setting up a manageable program for myself, as I moved toward my wellness goals, it became less like work and more enjoyable as I saw results and felt better. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 78 Conscious Parenting Imprinting a fit and healthy lifestyle on our kids may or may not change what happens at the dinner table each night (I'm here to tell you), but it will help affect their outlook as they grow. Conscious Fitness and a Path to Family Wellness Elaine Economou, her husband Patrick Conlin, and sons John Conlin, Patrick Conlin and Thomas Conlin (in front) The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 79 Slow and Steady Wins the Race Once you describe your vision of your best self, it's time to set goals and create a plan. Think through some reasonable goals and begin to integrate these activities into your daily life. Add these in slowly and schedule them in ways that are workable for you. If you are not an early morning person, don't think you can get up at 5:00 a.m. to exercise. Whatever you choose to do, make sure that you are 100 percent sure you can do it for that week. Staying active all day will bolster your fitness routine and add to your cardiac health. It's part of cultivating a \"lifestyle fitness\" that can apply to you and your kids regardless of their age. That way, you are developing your family wellness culture and bolstering everyone's fitness level. A hectic job, sick kids, worries and stress can make it difficult to even put a plan into place, and we all have times when we feel that way. Don't give up. Keep in mind that baby steps are the key to making the process manageable and are the only way to create lasting change. Do What You Love When you are creating a plan to help you move toward your vision, be sure to think back over your life to your best experiences with fitness and wellness. What activities have brought you joy in the past? What was your life like when you felt great? Creating a plan around activities that you enjoy will help you stick to it, keep you inspired, and positively affect your moods. Develop SupportBring family and friends on board to help you. You might enlist a spouse, a friend, or older child to help remind you about your plan for the week. Finding professionals to support you as you move toward your vision might be necessary as well. Fitness professionals, like Pilates trainers, can help you build strength and unravel any movement patterns or aches and pains that might hinder your joyful exercise or lifestyle fitness plan. In STOTT Pilates, we look at muscle balance in the body, and through exercises on specialized equipment, we connect clients to their deep abdominal muscles to help stabilize the spine, then help develop mobility and strength throughout the body. In my GYROKINESIS class, a kind of fluid yoga class, I hear a lot about how hard people have worked, yet how great they feel afterward. After all, isn't the goal of fitness to feel good? The coaching model is one that might offer you support for a time. Wellness coaches help you through the process of defining your vision, setting goals, and then helping you work through challenges and obstacles along the way.Name Your MotivationFrom a parent's perspective, a key motivator is our children, no matter what their age. One of the many magical parts of parenting is how our positive views and attitudes impact our children. Imprinting a fit and healthy lifestyle on our kids may or may not change what happens at the dinner table each night (I'm here to tell you), but it will help affect their outlook as they grow. I see that already in my boys, especially with my 13-year-old son. As a seventh grader, he enjoyed sports and made a connection between what he ate and how it made him feel. It is something that we have talked about for many years, but one day, he packed and ate an apple with peanut butter after school, before his practice. He noticed that by the time he looked at the clock to see how much longer he had at practice, it was almost over. Usually, he said, he found himself looking at the clock much more often. For a kid who is growing taller by the day and who feels frustrated sometimes that his skinny friends eat chips and drink pop and he is getting fresh, homemade meals and snacks but yet still doesn't have the body he wants, this is a victory and I'll take it as a step in his own journey to wellness. I love that the seeds of his self-awareness are beginning to grow. It Is a Marathon, Not a Sprint As a wellness coach, I know that fostering self-efficacy or the essential belief that you are able to achieve your goals not only helps you succeed with your wellness vision, but will snowball into developing and enjoying a full, fit, and happy life. And as a Pilates trainer, I repeatedly see that happen when people reach their fitness goals and, quite often, surpass them through focused effort and a plan. Lasting change comes from a steady pace, but sometimes life throws us off track. If you can trust the process and know that there will be times that you might not be able to stick to your plan, promise yourself you will come back to it. You'll see that you really will be able to make the changes you seek and can become your most vibrant, best self. The gift is that as you focus on your own wellness, it will positively impact all those around you, including your children. Everyone wins! Elaine Economou is a teacher, trainer, and wellness coach.

It is the site of their Blue Turtle Nature Awareness and Wilderness Skills Program and Day Camp, which they launched six years ago. They are a three-minute walk from the Mitchell-Scarlett Woods, which they use for hikes and games. Their expansive backyard has raspberry bushes and apple trees, with paths winding through them. A fire circle, composed of upright logs for seating around the central fire pit, is visible from the kitchen window. Beyond the fire circle is a tipi. It is Frank's handiwork: 16 feet high, 12 feet in diameter. Completing the camp environment are: a shelter made of twigs and branches, a screened in gazebo, a rock circle, and a sand-filled tracking box \u2014 which Frank baits in order to view the tracks of whatever ani-mal has come by. A jungle gym and picnic tables complete the picture. It is a child's paradise. Larissa, an avid naturalist, gardens for pleasure and purpose. Some of her plants are used for cooking and craft projects, which include making salves with kids at camp. She also teaches weaving and basket making. I visited on a sunny day last winter. We sat at the dining table in front of sliding glass doors that open onto the yard. Sunshine flooded the room as we sat sipping tea. A low wall separated us from the living room, where handsome bookcases testify to Frank's carpentry skills. A few scattered toys, a piano, hand drums of various sizes (the assortment includes congas, djembes, ashikos, bongos and doumbeks), piles of books, and travel artifacts complement the cozy feeling one gets in this home. To An Ann Arbor Couple Integrates their Interests in Nature Awareness, Wilderness Skills, and Breathwork into a Program and Day Camp for KidsThe Spark that Started Blue Turtle Nature Program ~ Frank Levey and Larissa Czuchnowskyand their son, Isaacwatch the couple's easy, soft-spoken give-and-take, and experience the warmth of their hospitality, is to sense true partnership. Their seven-year-old son, Isaac, appears during my visit. They call him over to say hello. While it is clear he would rather return to his playmates down the hall, he maintains a polite presence and waits to be dismissed before running off. Like his parents, Isaac is lean and rangy. I ask whether Isaac has been introduced to the prac-tice of meditation. No, they say, not formally. But he spends a great deal of time with his dad outdoors, in nature, which they deem a meditation encounter. Isaac has also attended the Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple Peace Camp and several Zen Buddhist Temple's children's services. These services, says Larissa, are \"developmentally ap-propriate\" and promote \"mindfulness and breath awareness.\" Larissa takes pleasure in noting that Isaac likes to drive in silence to and from school. It is a fifteen-minute drive each way. She appreciates that her son \"is easily able to be in stillness; children naturally fall into mindfulness.\" She adds, \"sometimes, he sits on my lap when I am meditating.\" When Larissa and Frank met in a meditation class seventeen years ago, she had left her Catholic-Polish upbringing behind. Raised in Windsor, Canada, she began meditating in her late teens, when she also began to do yoga, which she taught herself, from books. In her early 20s, she began studying with teachers and going to retreats. Her first formal yoga training was in Rishikesh, India. \"I have been more seri-ous about meditating than yoga, but I appreciate both practices in terms of keeping physical and mental balance.\" She points out that these exercises complement her teaching. She is a Spanish teach- er at Forsythe Middle School in Ann Arbor. Many kids, both at school and at camp, start out not knowing each other. \"I work at creating harmony; at creating connec-tions and community in loving ways. I do this in my classroom, and I get to do it in my own backyard \u2014 with Blue Turtle!\" Larissa's embrace of life is impressive. She is thankful for everything. \"I feel so grateful for the opportunity to interface with young people all day long. I get such joy from being around their vibrant energy. After Isaac was born, it struck me that all of my students are someone's baby and I should open my heart to them as I do to Isaac.\" Frank, too, is thankful for what he has. Born to Jewish parents, he was raised in Nanuet, a New York hamlet three miles north of the New Jersey border and 30 miles north of New York City. He spent a great deal of time in the family's large backyard and the woodland beyond \u2014 an area similar to the one he and Larissa now inhabit. He loved climbing trees. \"As a child,\" he says, \"I would set up a scenario, pretend-ing that I was either an alien, observing our natural world in a way as if I had never seen such beauty and wonder in my entire life, or as if I was an ape, powerful and agile, thoroughly at home in nature \u2014 and typically naked, wearing only boots in the winter.\" As a young man, Frank read The Tracker, by Tom Brown, Jr., then studied with the man at his tracker school in Manahawkin, New Jersey, not far from Frank's childhood home. Soon Frank was assisting in classes and practicing wilderness skills on a daily basis. Frank recalls: I started a daily practice of tracking and practicing wilderness living skills. Many of these skills focused on developing keen observation skills as well as learning to trust one's intuitive, felt sense. This meshed perfectly with my meditation and mindfulness practice, where one can bring this attention to whatever is present, eyes open or closed. And, primarily, my time with Tom gave me the ability to feel safely at home and at ease on our planet; being able to provide for one's basic needs can be quite liberating, especially during these turbulent times. Frank teaches his campers the skills learned from his mentor: carving, shelter-building, fire-making techniques, safe procurement of water, making cordage (rope) from natural materials, trap-building, camouflage, plant studies, and tracking. He speaks with reverence of Brown, who has long been admired by outdoorsmen and revered by his students. Thousands of wilderness enthusiasts have passed through his tracker school, which is still going strong after 34 years. Brown tells stories of his own teacher, \"Stalking Wolf,\" an Apache elder, shaman, and scout, known to his prodigy as \"Grandfather.\" Some have questioned the veracity of Brown's tales, but there is no disputing his skills. Law enforcement officials now enlist him to track missing persons, fugitives, and dangerous animals. He served as movie consultant on a Hollywood movie, The Hunted, with Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro. He is the stuff of legend. Frank met his next mentor at a week-long gathering of herbalists in southern Maine. This was Ryan Drum, Ph.D., a chemist and botanist who pioneered the use of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December Page 81 Tom Brown, Jr. \u2014 The Tracker Tom Brown, Jr. is an acclaimed American outdoorsman, renowned tracker, teacher, and author. In addition to founding the Tracker School in New Jersey, he has written 17 books on tracking, awareness, nature observation and survival, including, Grandfather, The Vision , The Way of the Scout and a series of field guides, many of which are available at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore. \"To the scout, the wilderness had to be his home. He had to live in perfect balance and harmony with creation and follow its laws. His skill had to keep him safe and secure in all elements and landscapes, where he would need for nothing. His self-sufficiency would give him the ultimate freedom to go as long and as far as he needed, without depending on anything but the earth. Until the scout at-tained and exceeded this level of skill and ease in living, he would stand out on the land and become a liability. Classic survival skills were not enough; they were just the begin-ning of that perfection and ultimate invisibility.\" - The Way of the Scout (Berkley, 1997) \"Grandfather never answered any of our questions the way most people would answer a question. He would either point us in the direction of the answer, or ask us a series of questions, all designed to make us think. A \"coyote teacher\" makes every learning experience excit-ing, something we desperately want to know. He planned each lesson like a chess game or jigsaw puzzle, where one teaching led to another. But he never forced any teach-ing on us; instead, he maneuvered the situation so we had to know, had to go on. \"How do we build a shelter?\" we would ask. He would answer, \"Ask the squirrels.\" We would ask, \"How does a bow-drill fire work?\" and he would answer, \"Rub your hands together.\" Or we would ask, \"How can we track foxes better?\" and he would reply, \"Track mice.\" He made each teaching special, exciting, and something we desperately needed to know. And as always, the lessons would go far deeper than just the superficial, reaching to all realms of our lives.\" - Field Guide to Nature and Survival for Children (Berkley, 1989) \"Grandfather spoke again, saying, \"Trying to live a spiritual life in modern society is the most difficult path one can walk. It is a path of pain, of isolation, and of shaken faith, but that is the only way that our Vision can become reality. Thus the true Quest in life is to live the philosophy of the Earth within the confines of man. There is no church or temple we need to seek peace, for ours are the temples of the wilderness. There are no spiritual leaders, for our hearts and the Creator are our only leaders. Our numbers are scattered; few speak our language or understand the things that we live. Thus we walk this path alone, for each Vision, each Quest, is unique unto the individual. But we must walk within society or our Vision dies, for a man not living his Vision is living death.\" - The Quest (Berkley, 1996)\"The true Quest in life is to live the philosophy of the Earth within the confines of man.\" - Grandfather To the scout, the wilderness had to be his home. He had to live in perfect balance and harmony with creation and follow its laws. Continued on page 82\"Primarily, my time with Tom gave me the ability to feel safely at home and at ease on our planet; being able to provide for one's basic needs can be quite liberating, especially during these turbulent times.\" - Frank Levey reflects on his mentee relationship with Tom Brown, Jr. seaweeds in an alternative approach to thyroid health. Frank describes him as \"a bril- liant man, great storyteller, and teacher.\" Drum taught Frank about wildcrafting, the practice of harvesting uncultivated plants from their natural, or \"wild\" habitat, for food or medicinal purposes, and offered Frank a wildcrafting apprenticeship in Wash-ington State. Drum lives on the remote Waldron Island, off the coast of Washington, in a rustic, hilltop cabin with no indoor plumbing or refrigeration. Frank recalls: He provided a little shack to live in, two sparse meals a day, and long hours of harvesting and preparing (separating, drying, and storing) both sea and land plants. His understanding of the importance of not overharvesting an area as well as causing as little disturbance to the area we worked in during harvest The Spark that Started Blue Turtle Nature Program ~ were both valuable lessons during our time together. I also came away from my time with him knowing that I did not want to make a living as a wildcrafter, a most difficult though rewarding livelihood. Before meeting Ryan Drum, Frank studied drumming with Steven Deats in New York. Deats taught the \"voudoun\" style of drumming, from Haiti. It is exacting. Frank be-came proficient, but he was pleased to find the \"anything goes\" drum circles of Ann Arbor. \"Here,\" he says, \"I have opportunities to play with some amazingly talented drummers. It's a nice balance.\" In crisscrossing the country, searching for his path, Frank honed his many skills. He taught nature awareness and survival techniques to adults and children in both New York State and Michigan. He lived for a while in Boston and Atlanta, but, he says, in cities he felt \"disconnected with the natural world.\" He sought refuge in city parks. Seven years ago, he discovered transformational breathing, became a certified facilitator and trainer, and now teaches conscious connected breathing at the Lotus Center on Carpenter Road and Harmony Yoga on Pauline Boulevard. \"Carpentry and other physical skills deepen our connection with the world around us; provide a sense of self sufficiency.\" - Frank Levey\"After Isaac was born, it struck me that all of my students are someone's baby and I should open my heart to them as I do to Isaac.\" - Larissa Czuchnowsky To watch the couple's easy, soft-spoken give-and-take, and experience the warmth of their hospitality, is to sense true partnership. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December Page 82 Continued from page 81I ask Frank to explain \"transformational breathing.\" He tells me: Transformational breathwork is a self directed energy healing system which is designed to open up our breath through fully utilizing our entire respiratory system. This brings greater amounts of oxygen into our bodies, allowing for a deep sense of well being on all levels of our being, physical, mental, emotion-al, and through a deeper connection to Source. Not only do we open to the great blessings that our lives truly are, but this form of breathwork is extreme-ly effective in the release of toxins in all these levels of our being. Breath can be used to calm us down, rev us up, bring us focused attention, as well as calm our overactive mind, so the conscious use of the breath is perhaps the great-est skill we can develop to navigate our way skillfully each day. Breathwork is one of our most powerful allies in making our way through life with a certain grace and ease. Today Frank is what Larissa calls a \"JewBu\" \u2014 a Jew who follows Buddhist practices. He and Larissa have found ways to integrate their interests, talents, and practices at Blue Turtle. Music is integral to its curriculum, and drumming starts each day. Fun activities include Larissa's homespun crafts and culinary projects, and kids learn wil-derness skills and the rudiments of woodworking from Frank. He says: Carpentry and other physical skills deepen our connection with the world around us; provide a sense of self-sufficiency. In any challenging situation \u2014 in the woods or in our daily life routine \u2014 the most useful tool we can develop is the ability to calm our minds, relax our bodies, and look within for guidance and insight. We don't teach formal meditation at camp, but we do practice certain exercises which help develop this open and receptive approach to any difficult situation. This sense of self-sufficiency and well-being is what both Frank and Larissa strive to instill in their campers. It is also their goal in their respective professions outside the home: Frank in his breathwork practice, Larissa in her teaching. Married 13 years, Frank and Larissa do not take each other for granted, which may contribute to the ease and grace of their partnership. That he is 55 and she 38 ap-pears irrelevant. Each has energy to spare, and their lives are marked by a profound mutual respect. Frank says he was \"smitten at first sight\" when they met. \"I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.\" Their guiding principles are love and careful consideration for people and for the planet. Larissa points out that when she met Frank she had already satisfied the travel bug in her life. She had studied in Windsor, Montreal, and Vancouver, traveled through Guatemala and Mexico, and now, she says, \"I am very content to live in our home, to do the work that I do, to be a mother to Isaac and partner to Frank. I find it very rich and fulfilling.\" Asked how the difference in their backgrounds affects their lives, Frank says, \"it has allowed us to appreciate our own traditions in a more open light, with less attach-ment to the dogma and ritual, and more fondness for the joyous and cultural rich-ness they can provide.\" Larissa adds: \"We share the same core values. One of our marriage vows was to use our shared interests as fodder for spiritual and psychologi-cal growth.\" For more information about Blue Turtle Nature Awareness and Wilderness Skills Program and Camp, visit www.BlueTurtleNatureCamp.com.

When a pet seems out of sorts, we know that it can be very difficult to know whether you should wait to see if things improve on their own, or whether you should immediately rush your pet to a veterinarian. In some circumstances, sadly, waiting too long can mean the difference between life and death for your pet. Mos t exotic pets (birds, ferrets, rats, hedgehogs, rabbits, reptiles, etc.) are considered \"prey animals.\" Their natural instinct is to act as healthy and normal as possible so that predators will leave them alone. Even dogs and cats still retain this ability to appear healthy when they are sick, which of course makes it even more challenging to know when they are seriously ill. Cats can be particularly adept at hiding their illness. Very often, dogs and cats don't eat normally for a day, or aren't acting like themselves, and then seem to quickly return back to \"normal\" without us ever knowing what was wrong. If you ever have a question about whether your pet needs to see a veterinarian right away, feel free to call our clinic at (734) 929-4071. We can let you know whether your pet's condition constitutes a medical emergency and help you determine the next best steps to take. Following are some general guidelines to help you make a decision. Pet Situations Typically Requiring Immediate Veterinary Attention (Regardless of whether your dog, cat, or exotic pet \"seems\" sick or not) Respiratory Difficulty: Any sudden change in breathing effort or sound (gasping, panting, labored breathing, open-mouthed breathing) is an emergency in any animal. Possible causes include choking, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, heart disease, ingestion of toxins, and injury. Pets in respiratory distress should be seen by a veterinarian immediately. Weakness/Lethargy: Weakness can also be triggered by multiple causes, some of which must be addressed right away. Emergency causes may include: anemia (blood loss), high or low blood sugar, heart disease, injury, ingestion of toxins, or seizures. Any pet that is suddenly weak/lethargic (i.e., much less active than usual, very low energy, or unsteady when walking) may require emergency care and should be examined as soon as possible. Vomiting: Occasional vomiting in dogs and cats may or may not be cause for concern. Cats will vomit to bring up hairballs, and dogs sometimes vomit after they've eaten something inappropriate. However, if your dog, Small Animal and Exotic Pet Emergencies: How to Determine When Immediate Medical Attention Is Needed By Stacey Weinrick, DVM and Gretchen Hui, DVMStacey Weinrick, DVM Most exotic pets... are considered \"prey animals.\" Their natural instinct is to act as healthy and normal as possible so that predators will leave them alone. Even dogs and cats still retain this ability to appear healthy when they are sick, which of course makes it even more challenging to know when they are seriously ill.

Dr. Monica Turenne welcomes Giuliana Scott, Veterinary Technician, to the Four Paws Veterinary Wellness Team! The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 88 All creatures great and small cat, or exotic pet suddenly starts vomiting multiple times in one day or is unable to hold down their food, they should be examined by a veterinarian immediately. Vomiting may be caused by the ingestion of poisonous plants or other toxins, or a pet may eat something that can lead to a life-threatening intestinal obstruction (i.e., socks, toys, towels, string, beads) and may require emergency treatment. Long-term, intermittent, chronic vomiting behavior, while typically not an emergency, can also be a sign of an underlying health condition that should be evaluated by a veterinarian. Diarrhea: Diarrhea in exotic pets (birds, rabbits, guinea pigs, etc.) can very quickly lead to severe dehydration, due to their small size. Many factors can cause diarrhea, including infection (viral or bacterial), stress, ingestion of foreign material (carpet, toys), or toxins. Call the clinic for further advice. Diarrhea in cats and dogs rarely constitutes an immediate emergency, unless they are also acting very sick (lethargic, vomiting, etc.). You can try offering your dog or cat a bland diet, but if the diarrhea persists for more than 24 hours, the pet should be examined by a veterinarian. Not Eating: Not eating truly constitutes an emergency situation for most birds and small mammals (including rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas, rats, mice, gerbils, hamsters). It can become a vicious cycle once it starts and can be life threatening even in the first 24 hours. Offer some favorite treats and call the clinic immediately for further advice. If your dog or cat is not eating, but is otherwise acting normal (happy, playful, still interested in what's going on around them), you can try offering canned food or treats and watch them for 24 hours. If they are refusing all food for more than a day or two, then they should be examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Not Defecating: Not defecating is usually an indication that your pet is not eating (unless they are straining, which could indicate constipation). Check their cage, litter box, or the yard for any signs of diarrhea. Offer special treats to help determine if their appetite is down. Call the clinic immediately for further discussion. Straining: If your pet is straining, it may be difficult to tell whether they are straining to defecate, urinate, or pass an egg (birds, some reptiles). Any of these reasons qualify as an emergency. Birds that are egg-bound can very quickly become stressed and critically ill due to infection. Straining to urinate can be caused by bladder stones lodged in the urethra, a urinary tract infection, or even prostate enlargement (more common in ferrets). Straining to defecate can be due to constipation, which may indicate a more serious disease process (dehydration, kidney disease, etc.). If your dog or cat is straining to urinate, this is a medical emergency and he/she should be examined by a veterinarian immediately. Bleeding: Most exotic pets are smaller than the average cat or dog, so even small amounts of blood loss can have a significant impact on their health. If possible, locate where the bleeding is coming from. Apply pressure or a bandage to the area if appropriate. If the bleeding is coming from a nail, try styptic powder (sold at pet stores) or cornstarch. Then call the clinic as quickly as possible, so that we can help you determine if your pet needs further medical attention. Dogs and cats with a bleeding wound should be examined as quickly as possible. Apply pressure to the wound until you can get them to your veterinarian. Use caution if you try to bandage the wound; very often dogs and cats will chew at and ingest bandage material, or may try to scratch or bite you if they are in pain. Pain: It can sometimes be very difficult to tell if an animal is in pain. Often, they do not display pain in situations that must obviously be uncomfortable. Watch for a variety of signs, such as lethargy/depression, loss of appetite, panting or gasping, crying or whining. Exotic pets will often hide for long periods of time if they are in pain, as well as display some of the aforementioned signs. If you think your pet is in pain or uncomfortable, the best course of action is to have him/her examined as soon as you can. While not all pet emergencies fall under the above-listed categories, we hope these tips will help you better understand what signs to watch for when your pet may be sick or injured. If you suspect that your pet is seriously ill, then he/she should be examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Even if the changes you are noticing with your pet are not a true \"need-to-be-seen-now\" emergency, treatment is often much more effective, much less expensive, and less invasive when addressed early. If you have any questions, feel free to call City Pets Veterinary Clinic to find out what we recommend. We love helping our animal friends and the people that care for them! Dr. Stacey Weinrick and Dr. Gretchen Hui both graduated from MSU's College of Veterinary Medicine in 2003. After graduation, Dr. Weinrick and Dr. Hui worked together in a small pet and exotic animal practice in Ann Arbor for six years, after which Dr. Weinrick worked at the Humane Society of Huron Valley for another several years before they opened City Pets together. Outside of the clinic, Dr. Weinrick enjoys spending time with her husband and young son, as well as with their Doberman and three cats. Dr. Hui's family includes her husband, five-year-old daughter, two-and-a-half-year-old son, and their animal family: two mixed-breed dogs, two cats, and a turtle, all of which have come from various rescue groups.

Where Do We Distribute The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 94 By Sue Salaniuk Photos by Susan Ayer had tried yoga and liked it. I haven't stopped since that first class, although it was difficult finding babysitters after we had three kids. Later, it became difficult fitting my classes around their busy schedules, as they grew and as their activities and school claimed my attention. Yet at one point, I was taking three classes a week. There has always been something about the subject and the necessity of doing yoga that has kept me focused on the daily need to practice and the continual need to learn. I've been to countless classes and workshops and I've made 10 trips to Pune, India, to study for a month, as well as one two-month sojourn when our smallest was only about four years old. Looking back now, I can't say what prompted me to go away for so long \u2014 except a desire to know more. I started teaching in 1988 and that added another layer of organizing around everyone's activities. There is something special about this kind of yoga that builds slowly, that helps you to peel away the layers and understand what makes up who you are, even as you are growing and becoming yourself. You work with your physical body: your muscles, your bones, your joints. You work with your mental body: your endurance, your focus, your willpower. A Transformational Class There is something special about this kind of yoga that builds slowly, that helps you to peel away the layers and understand what makes up who you are... The power of the method is that it allows you to work through whatever comes your way, be it fussy children who don't sleep well, tight joints that don't allow you to move as well as you want, sudden high blood pressure, or sudden uncontrollable vertigo episodes. All it took was one class to catch my interest. The first 90-minute Iyengar yoga class I took was enough to change me, although I didn't know it for many years. Thirty-five years ago seems like yesterday, but also like a different life. I was a young mother then, with a two-year-old toddler who absolutely delighted me, while consuming my every waking moment. I had a husband whose job kept him at home for several days and then took him away for several, so I was on my own for long periods time. For some reason I no longer remember, I signed up for a yoga class at the Ann Arbor Y. I know part of the reason was that they had a drop-in day care that coordinated with the time of the class. I vaguely remember that one of my mother's friends Yoga Teacher Sue Salaniuk is the long-time owner of Yoga Space, which is located on Little Lake Drive.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 95 In this Iyengar method, the instructions are precise and accurate. You learn how to be sensitive, to reflect and readjust yourself physically. In doing this, you learn how to do it mentally and emotionally and psychologically. This simple practice, done on the mat, transformed itself into a real-life tool that has proven to be invaluable to me. It is a method that works when you are in your twenties or in your sixties or beyond, regardless of when you begin to experience it. It is a method that is adaptable regardless of your abilities or what seem like limitations. I had no idea about all of this when I started out all those years ago. It has unfolded slowly. But something in the very method itself caught me at the very beginning and has carried me through to where I now own a yoga studio -- and can teach and practice and be delighted each day at what I learn. Sue Salaniuk teaches at and owns The Yoga Space, 180 Little Lake Drive, suite #1, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. Find out more at www.yogaspaceannarbor.com or 734-622-9600. In this Iyengar method, the instructions are precise and accurate. You learn how to be sensitive, to reflect and readjust yourself physically. In doing this, you learn how to do it mentally and emotionally and psychologically. And you work with your psychological self: your emotions, your reactions, your feelings. The power of the method is that it allows you to work through whatever comes your way, be it fussy children who don't sleep well, tight joints that don't allow you to move as well as you want, sudden high blood pressure, or sudden uncontrollable vertigo episodes. You learn how to get through, to evaluate, to reflect, to cope, and to act and work on changing. You learn this because working in your practice on simple (or complex) yoga poses teaches you how to do this.

By Vic Divecha Photography by Joni Strickfaden Origins of Sahaja Meditation For a little more than 10 years now, Sahaja Meditation has been the basis of my meditation practice and outreach. Sa-haja Meditation, which began in 1970 as a social spiritual movement on the west coast of India as Sahaja Yoga, has its origins in the philosophies of Kabir (1440-1518 C.E.), who was the first to define the term Sahaja, which means spontaneous. Patanjali (150 B.C.E.) provides the Yoga aspect, which in the Sahaja context means a connection to the divine (not the physical exercise). The third major influence is Shankaracharya (788 C.E.-820 C.E.), who clarified the role of vibratory energy in spirituality and \"yoga as connection, chakras, and channels.\" From 1970, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi transformed the theory of Sahaja, incorporating the connection aspect of yoga and vibratory energy awareness explained by Shan-karacharya to create a tangible practice that can be taken up and sustained as a part of a middle class life. Through the pivot of periodic peer contact, one no longer needs to leave society for extended periods of time or make time consuming changes in their appearance or daily routine. On the practice side, Gandhi was a major influence. Young Nirmala spent many summer vacations at Mahatma Gandhi's ashram, observing her parents and other freedom fighters using non-violence as a political strategy as India struggled against the British Rule. In it's 40 th year of existence, Sahaja Yoga Meditation shortened its name to Sahaja Meditation to reduce a repeated mis-communication that it provides physical exercise. At the center of the practice is the concept of paying-it-forward, which ensures that instruction in Sa-haja Meditation is always free of charge. Learners are encouraged to become teachers by developing a basic set of competencies that allow them to transfer the experience of self-realization \u2014 a process of awakening the inner energy called Kundalini. My JourneyI tried out Sahaja Meditation about 12 years ago as a stressed out under grad. To continue my development as a meditator, I started sharing the experience of self-re- alization, initially supervised by practitioners, then independently . Over the past 10 years as a teacher, I have seen fellow meditators, both beginners and experts, and my own self sabotage a perfectly good daily meditation practice through avoidable mistakes \u2014 mistakes that can recur and turn into habits that take us further away from meditation. We seem to return from retreats or weekend workshops feeling inspired, only to have the realities of life bring us back to a less meditative routine. A large number of people experience meditation, however many choose to shelve it for later in life or outright give up on it. There are several common challenges that stand in the way of sustaining a daily meditation routine. Challenges are to be embraced and turned into stepping stones. Mistakes are to be made quickly and outgrown so that our meditative practice keeps giving us the peace and balance it promised in our ancient scriptures. Let's examine a few thought patterns that can derail a meditative lifestyle.This Counts as Meditation, Right?In Sahaja true meditation is silence. It can be approached through a variety of ways, like mantras or attention exercises, but unless silence is achieved, medita-tion has not happened. Sahaja Meditation encourages one to establish a connection (yoga) before expecting to enter silence. Many times I catch myself concluding my sitting because I have successfully approached silence. Ending the daily medi - tation session because the timer goes off, or the music finished playing, or the steps to meditation were done, is a sure way to miss the real benefit of meditation. Staying in silence for at least a few minutes after reaching it is essential for the meditative state to settle within us. Aiming for Twice, Happy with NoneOften times people, myself included, skip a meditation due to a pressing situation or prolonged interruption. The results are never good for the soul. Two medita- Sahaja Meditation: Seven Lessons from a Personal Journey ...Instruction in Sahaja Meditation is always free of charge. Learners are encouraged to become teachers by developing a basic set of competencies that allow them to transfer the experience of self-realization \u2014 a process of awakening the inner energy called Kundalini.

They need not be lengthy, but their purpose needs to be actualized for sustained balance. The morning meditation acts as a buffer to bring our awareness gently into the day's speed. The evening meditation helps us to ramp down our active awareness toward a restful sleep. Like warm up and cool down are essential to a good physical workout, lessening the risk of injury or soreness in the muscles, morning and evening meditations are essential for handling ourselves with care in this fast paced world. Skipping one of these on rare occasion is probably okay. Letting it become a habit means los-ing our touch with the self. You may find yourself thinking, \"But can I just meditate longer the next time if I skip one meditation?\" Individual meditation sessions are scaffolds to your activity, so putting two scaf-folds together does not compensate for a missing scaffold earlier in the day. Portion ControlI have found it beneficial to spread the day's meditative experiences into practical, yet effective portions. In the previous section, I shared the significance of morning and evening meditations. Unless you have retired on a tropical island paradise with nothing to worry about, it is likely that stress levels keep rising as you go through the day. The two daily meditations will eventually give you the depth to instanta-neously get into meditation and cut the momentum of stress as it starts building. I like to call these micro-meditations. They are when I take a short timeout, just a few seconds to close my eyes, go deep, and contemplate a higher principle of life. These let me face the stressors with better mastery and centeredness. I Am SpecialSuperficial meditations, where the deepest parts of our beings are not touched, are usually preceded by thoughts like, \"I don't need to meditate anymore, I am in meditation always\" or \"I am an expert now, I can skip the dedicated meditations \u2014 I can get into meditation whenever I want!\" These feelings do take root, as the meditative state one might have built for years is deep seated. A long rope is given to a meditative yogi, and it takes some time to burn through it when we stop medi-tating. It's best to keep our long rope for emergencies only and continue a daily practice as the norm. Meditation Props I love collecting books, meditative objects that adorn the altar , and little items I carry to meditation retreats, thinking they will be essential if I have to overcome a spiritual crisis. Then I unpack in the middle of my weekend away to realize the burden of the stuff I carry. The real joy and jump in awareness stems from stories and vibrations exchanged with fellow practitioners, rather than impressive little widgets that promise to im-prove my meditation. Travel light, live more. Cocktail PracticesI spent a good fifteen years mixing various practices. No surprise that the results were no better: mixed! Only when I picked one path, which al-lowed for a fair degree of freedom, exploration of the self, and access to spiritual knowledge, did real change happen and stay. This is why I advise prospective medita-tors to insulate their practice of meditation from other influences for a short period of time. This allows their in-ner being to experience the effects of Sahaja Meditation independent of other practices with the intent of making the call, \"Is Sahaja right for me?\" Insular Learning versus Herd Learning Learning meditation is most efficient when learning with peers. Joining a community of practice where you can learn from other practitioners is recommended. It is espe-cially beneficial if the community has a wide range of experiences within the same style of meditation. While self-study allows exploration of different styles, practices, and approaches, it can often lead a person to become a great librarian of knowledge without consistent experience of deep meditation. This kind of insular learning has taken up many pro-ductive years of some seekers. The other extreme is signing up for a mega-movement where there is little authentic learning and a lot of emphasis on conformity and ritual. I like to call this herd learning. A balanced approach would be to find a community of practice and, if you can, find a mentor within the experienced practitioners. This mentor is not a spiritual master, but more like a counselor who can point to the right resources and prevent reinventing the wheel as you progress in your spiritual path. If you are new to meditation, I invite you to the wondrous journey that it can be. If you are experienced, I invite you to introspect and benchmark your progress. The only way to verify true learning is by attempting to share it. To those who are experi-enced, please mentor others into your practice \u2014 there is no better way to rejuvenate your own experience. I would be delighted to partner with people and institutions in the area towards the goal of more people using meditation as a daily practice.

Call Deb at 248-702-7064; lightworkscenter@att.net or integrativewellbeing.com.I now have a studio in my home and I set aside time to let my artist play. I tell people that my life isn't \"beige\" anymore. I love my healing work; however, without the bal - ance of the artist in play, I am not as effective in my work. Without the artist arche-type active and empowered, I become burned out. Identifying archetypes in oneself is an illuminating experience and one that does take time and reflection. Some archetypes are obvious, but most are not. When working with clients, I assist them in their process with questions such as: How do other people see you? Do they use words like geek, princess, or hermit? How do you describe yourself? Have you used descriptions such as clown, healer , queen, or rebel? What words would you use to describe the people you are attracted to over and over again? Are they addicts, artists, heroes, storytellers, or damsels? Often people will mirror to us what is hidden within ourselves. In my practice, I assist individuals with the identification of their archetypes, the cast - ing of an archetypal wheel into the 12 houses of the zodiac, and the interpretation of their wheel as it relates to their life path, as well as how to use the 4 survival arche-types and the 12 houses for guidance on particular issues. There is an additional layer that includes casting a fate/destiny chart on an issue for an entire year. Working with archetypes is a life-enhancing endeavor. When we can embrace our archetypes, we also begin to embrace the archetypes that influence others. As our awareness and acceptance deepens, we open to an unbelievable compassion. What a beautiful gift of grace we can then offer to the world, as we live our most luminous lives! Paula Neys is a Certified Archetypal Consultant through the Caroline Myss Education (CMED) Institute of Chicago and can be reached at 248-982-5971. By Paula Neys How would you live your life if you knew that, prior to your birth, you were given a script that contained your divine mission, or sacred contracts \u2014 a script complete with agreements you were to honor in this lifetime? And what if you knew you had a team of personal companions, called archetypes, whose purpose was to bring events, situations, and relationships to you that would help you experience your life path and maneuver the terrain of this lifetime \u2014 in order to fulfill those sacred contracts? According to Wikipedia, an archetype is a symbol universally recognized by all. In psychology, an archetype is a model of a person, personality, or behavior. It is believed that the concept of archetypes first originated from the Greek philosopher Plato. In the early 1900's, Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychologist and author, intro-duced his beliefs that archetypal images and ideas are imbedded in each individual' s unconscious and are inherited. He maintained we are born with our archetypes. Building on the work of Plato and Carl Jung, in 2001 Caroline Myss, a renowned pioneer in the field of energy medicine and bestselling author, published Sacred Con-tracts. Her book illuminates the language of archetypes and gives us tools to identify and work with our personal archetypes. According to Myss, we each have a team of 12 archetypes, out of a possible 75-plus that she has identified. Four are \"survival\" archetypes that each person shares: the victim, child, saboteur, and prostitute. The remaining eight archetypes are uniquely ours. I began my study of Myss's work in 2001, shortly after the publication of Sacred Contracts. The subject of archetypes and their shadow aspects had intrigued me for many years, as I had dabbled in the work of Carl Jung in my late twenties. His work was my initial exposure to our shadow aspects, hidden deep within the psyche. At first, I used Myss's book as a tool to cast my archetypal wheel and begin working with my own archetypes. However, it wasn't enough for me; I wanted to go deeper with this work. When the opportunity was presented, I began my studies with Myss at her Caroline Myss Education (CMED) Institute in Chicago, resulting in certification as an Archetypal Consultant in 2009. We cannot escape our archetypes, as they are innate, creative forces within us. When we become conscious of them and \"listen\" to their wisdom, we can stand strong in this world. We become empowered, congruent, authentic, and free to make choices that are not influenced by anyone else, unless we choose. This is power. If left unconscious, however, our archetypes become our shadow, leaving us to won- der how we ended up in our jobs, relationships, or other situations. This can be a very frustrating life, seemingly without purpose. Carl Jung stated, \"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.\" Each archetype contains a light (empowered) side and a shadow (disempowered) side. For example, Myss says that each of us has the victim archetype. If we are acting from the empowered side of the victim, we can more easily recognize when we are about to allow ourselves to become victimized. If we are acting out of the disempow-ered victim side, we may, unknowingly, manipulate others into feeling sorry for us, or stay in a state of being victimized by others. Becoming conscious of our archetypes, and letting them have an active role in our lives, will help us live healthier, more purposeful lives. I can provide an illustration from my own life. As I young child, I experimented with \"healing\" injured insects by wrapping their bodies in wet tissues. My curiosity and desire to heal led to a career in occupational therapy and, ultimately, into my current healing arts practice using archetypes. I am very clear that I have the healer archetype and it has been active in my life in an empowered way. However, when the shadow side of this archetype was expressed, it looked more like rescuing. I also have an artist archetype, which has been in the shadow for most of my life. There had been intermittent times when I let it come into the light by taking art class-es, but then back in the shadow it went. Exploring this side of me seemed frivolous; I had been convinced it had no practical use in my life. Yet the artist archetype would not let me go, and the desire to create haunted me. I bought art supplies and kept them in the basement or garage (in the dark). I was attracted to creative people, longing to be one of them. I encouraged my children to draw, paint, and \"make\" things. Shoving the artist deep inside came with a price. In my early twenties, I began having problems with ovarian cysts. In my thirties, there were precancerous conditions in my cervix and, in my forties, I developed a fibroid tumor that eventually resulted in a hysterectomy. These issues were located within the creative center of my body. The \"wisdom\" of the fibroid was that I was not birthing my creative ener gies.Archetypes: Our Empowering Companions If left unconscious, our archetypes become our shadow, leaving us to wonder how we ended up in our jobs, relationships, or other situations...Carl Jung stated, \"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.\" What words would you use to describe the people you are attracted to over and over again? ...Often people will mirror to us what is hidden within ourselves.

His first book, Krishna in the Sky with Diamonds, explor es the guidelines for psychedelic enlightenment woven into the eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. He offers a radically different interpretation that treats the Gita as a work of science and psychology with an extremely progressive slant, \"utterly and spectacularly open-ended.\" Scott lives with his wife in Portland, Oregon and will discuss his new book in the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room on Tuesday, October 2nd at 7pm. Rachel Pastiva: What drew you to study the Bhagavad Gita as a guide to psychedelic experience? Scott Teitsworth: I studied it as a spiritual guide, for which it is unsurpassed. For the past seven years I have been writing a commentary on the whole thing, to clear up some serious misunderstandings and record the unique interpretation handed down to me by my gurus. The psychedelic angle appeared by accident. Once I recognized it, I was compelled to include it, and because of the interest in psychedelics within the reading public, the one chapter dealing with tripping and what it means became a book. Fortunately it touches on many of the most important issues found in the rest. RP: Your book states that psychedelic experience is \"an essential and ancient path\" for a practicing student to \"turn theory into direct experience, and bring the written teachings to life.\" Do you believe that using mind-altering substances is the only true way to reach enlightenment? Scott Teitsworth: Of course not, but it is one of the best. Used wisely\u2014and the Gita provides a very intelligent context for exploring in this way\u2014there is a very high likelihood of success in what Maslow calls self-actualization. Psychedelics act as a springboard to the other, more sedate, spiritual practices, as they reveal with certainty that we are much more than we previously imagined. Guided use produces positive changes over a broad spectrum of psychological issues. Less paranoid societies in the past used them to produce good citizens, who learned their lessons and then integrated them into their lives. RP: How do spiritual paths based on theory and those based on direct experience complement and contradict each other? Scott Teitsworth: The recent past exemplifies how random use without a theoretical context can be dangerous. Though surprisingly few disasters have occurred, each one that did was an avoidable tragedy. An untethered mind entertains both true and untrue ideas, which is fine up to a point, but in the long run the false ones are not healthy. A sound philosophy helps keep direct experience within reasonable bounds. Theory alone is dry and lifeless, whereas spirituality aims for vivid experience. We can share what we learn, and try to help others evolve, but most seekers of truth demand to be viscerally convinced. RP: What do you hope to impart to students of the Bhagavad Gita by presenting it as a guideline for the spiritual use of entheogens? Scott Teitsworth: The Gita is well suited to intrepid seekers who have used psychedelics. My book presents a philosophy that is nontrivial and steers clear of the religious baggage that is piled on in other interpretations. Psychedelics instantly reveal the idiocy of many socially accepted beliefs, and the Gita shares that vision. It is the story of someone who refuses to do his duty and instead turns to a teacher for wisdom. One small part of his training is a really amazing trip. We should learn the lessons psychedelics offer, but then apply them to creating a terrific and satisfying life.

And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,\"You owe me.\"Look what happens with love like that.It lights up the sky. RumiThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2012 Page 121By Andy Seiler Contact Improvisation began in the early 1970s in New York City. Dancer and martial artist Steve Paxton worked with others to explore \"communication between two moving bodies that are in physical contact and their combined relationship to the physical laws that govern their motion \u2014 gravity, momentum, inertia.\" ( Contact Quarterly , Fall 1979) It has been referred to as an \"art/sport\" because of its dual focus on athleticism and artistic expression. Contact Improv is usually practiced between two people, but can involve solos and larger groups. It can be slow and meditative or very quickly moving and acrobatic. The \"practice includes rolling, falling, being upside down, following a physical point of contact, supporting and giving weight to a partner.\" (Ibid) One of the main principles of the form is that there can be a point of contact between two people that rolls between them and is the source of communication about where the other person is in space, where their center of gravity is, and how they are moving. It can even be practiced with eyes closed or blindfolded once one learns how to read their partners through the point of contact. Since its inception, it has evolved more through participation than formal teachings, so no certification or specific set of steps or instructions exist. It is entirely co-created each week, in each dance. Growing up, I had a fun early exposure to dance learning to polka with my mom in northern Michigan at weddings and community fairs. Once I was old enough to realize that most people in the room were watching, often scornfully, I, like many kids, stayed away from dance of any kind for a long time. As an adult, I tried some contemplative dance for a while and always felt that the partnering was missing, even feeling lonely in a room full of people dancing together. I discovered Contact Improv at a big summer festival and thought, \"Oh! This is where the people touch each other!\" I haven't looked back since. I think Contact has many benefits for me. It's a healthy, non-sexual way to connect physically with people; a great incentive to stay in good shape; and a way for me to stay informed about my body and how to keep it soft, flexible, and responsive. As we learn lessons about letting go of specific forms and outcomes, trusting other humans and our own abilities, and saying and hearing \"no\" in dances, I find myself applying them as mental and emotional lessons as well. I can relax in a unique way as I sink into a dance in which my linear thinking turns off and I travel with the perceptions of my body, becoming disoriented but completely aware of my surroundings. The Ann Arbor jam (that's what we call our sessions) is really thriving. Many large metropolitan areas have jams that are smaller than ours, though some areas of the world have huge jams. I've heard that Buenos Aires has five jams per week and gets over 100 people at some of them. We usually begin organically, with people warming up their bodies on their own some, then entering dances with others. Sometimes we have a little music, but mostly we jam in silence \u2014 the form itself gives so much sensory input that music tends to distract people from their bodies and dances so that they feel more at risk for injury. Some people have one dance with one partner for the entire two hours, while most have 5 to 15 minute dances, somehow silently deciding they're complete (or tired or thirsty or need a mental break), then rest a bit to enter another dance later. We usually end with a closing circle, hearing each other's names, sometimes for the first time! If there are new people, more experienced dancers love dancing with them, letting them know about safety and technique, and helping them get into it a bit. Occasionally someone will feel inspired to lead a more focused activity or lesson, but most of us feel that jumping in and doing it is the best way to learn the form. Our jam is part of a larger community of jams in the Great Lakes area, with others in Chicago, Madison, Minneapolis, Toronto, and West Lafayette. Each of those communities hosts events through the year, so that every other month or so we have the opportunity to travel and dance with new people and old friends and foment growth in each other's cities. Once a year, we Falling Into Contact Improvisation One of the main principles of the form is that there can be a point of contact between two people that rolls between them and is the source of communication about where the other person is in space, where their center of gravity is, and how they are moving.Andy Seiler (in the maroon shirt) is a local pediatrician and one of the organizers of the Sunday Contact Improv Jam at The Phoenix Center.

It's five days of instruction, jams, great food, and socializing at a gorgeous, quiet retreat center in the woods. I'm always torn between whether I love the big events more or the continuity of our weekly jam. I'm so glad I don't have to decide. I sometimes can't believe how Contact Improvisation has enriched my life. I'm incredibly thankful that I discovered it. Please feel free to join us at our Sunday jam any time.
