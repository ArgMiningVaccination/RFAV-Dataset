The right crystals can provide \"holistic well-being of mind, body, and spirit,\" she says. Los Angeles-based [Elizabeth medicine specialist - [Mariah K. Lyons](https://astaracollective.com/pages/about-astara), crystal healer and founder of ASTARA - [Shanise Spruill](https://www.johariandlou.com/pages/meet-the-owner), founder of Johari & Lou Uses for healing crystals Therapeutic uses for crystals goes way back, too. [Elizabeth Trattner](https://elizabethtrattner.com/about/), a Florida-based licensed acupuncturist and integrative medicine specialist who performs [crystal- and acupuncture-infused facials](https://www.wellandgood.com/gemstone-acupuncture-facial/), says crystal healing was practiced by ancient Egyptians and during the Roman Empire. And, she adds, crystals are still used today in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). So, how does therapy with different types of crystals work? The atoms in healing crystals have unique vibrational motions that determine how the stones will behave in the presence of heat or light. In fact, everything in the universe\u2014including the atoms that make up us mere mortals\u2014vibrates in this manner, says Lyons. \"When we work with particular vibrations, they have the capability of balancing and harmonizing our own energies within our body, and this helps to create well-being within our energetic field and physical body,\" Trattner says. In terms of scientific evidence that proves the effectiveness of healing crystals, well, there really isn't much. \"This is because current science is materialist. You need to have something physical to measure for a scientific study,\" says [Azalea Lee](https://place8healing.com/about/), a crystal healer based in Los Angeles and designer of the metaphysical fine jewelry line, As Above So Below. \"But crystalline healing energy is metaphysical and has no physical density to measure. It is therefore incongruent with the scientific method.\" But Trattner points out that there is [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047252/) showing that crystals may be medically beneficial. And the belief that they work can be very powerful (just look to [studies](https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a1938) on the placebo effect). Crystal curious? Keep reading to learn how to find the right crystals for you. How to find the right types of crystals for you and your needs Find an ethical source First and foremost, Trattner advises buying from a reputable seller who stocks crystals that were mined in an environmentally friendly manner using ethical labor practices. This may require some Googling, but it's worth the effort. Don't choose simply based off a crystal's description A common mistake when it comes to choosing stones for healing, Lee says, is selecting them based on their description. This is because, often, the information doesn't come from authentic experience. \"Though crystals do have metaphysical properties that will lend themselves to certain situations, summarizing crystals into abbreviated sound bites of their properties does more harm than help in helping people work with them,\" she says. \"You are a unique individual, so how you respond to a crystal's energy may have a different specific effect than it would for someone else.\" So while crystal descriptions can be helpful to get a general understanding of a crystal, that shouldn't be the only deciding factor. Ask for help and use your intuition If you're unsure where to start on your healing crystal journey, [Shanise Spruill](https://www.johariandlou.com/pages/meet-the-owner), chief wellness curator and founder of [Johari & Lou Artisan Soul Stones](https://www.johariandlou.com/), recommends consulting an energy practitioner who specializes in crystals to serve as a guide; they'll typically give a personal assessment to pinpoint which types of crystals are the best fit for you. If a consultation isn't possible, she recommends browsing crystal shops in person or online and \"do a [visual meditation](https://www.wellandgood.com/visualization-meditation/) to guide your energy to the best choice.\" Because your intuition is supreme when it comes to choosing the right types of crystals for you, Lyons recommends choosing the healing crystals you feel the most drawn towards. If you're shopping IRL, hold the crystal in your hand and notice how you feel. If there's an energetic connection between you and the crystal that you can't quite explain, you've found the one.

Some crystal proponents even place black tourmaline near their electronic devices, because it is thought to reduce the effects of electromagnetic energy on the body.

Spruill says it's one of the most popular healing crystals. The takeaway on the different types of crystals Remember that you can't go wrong when it comes to choosing the \"right\" types of crystals to work with. \"More important than choosing the 'right' crystal is your willingness and dedication to work with a crystal, understand its true energies, and work with it with consistence and presence,\" Lee says. It's important to get a feel for your crystals and to pick the right ones for you, whether you're using them for healing or in a [pendulum](https://www.wellandgood.com/how-to-use-a-pendulum/) for guidance and clarity. In other words, while [crystals for protection](https://www.wellandgood.com/crystals-for-protection/) and [healing crystals](https://www.wellandgood.com/7-crystals-and-gemstones-and-how-to-use-them/) are wonderful healing companions and for [relieving stress](https://www.wellandgood.com/calming-stones/), they're not going to magically do the work for you. This is why Lee compares healing crystals to braces for teeth. \"Over time, crystals can help you straighten things out, but you have to use them consistently, maintain good energetic hygiene, and be willing to go through some pain to get to the end result\" she says. \"There is a lot of work on your end, but if you're serious, the crystals will definitely help you.\" Frequently Asked Questions After you've picked out a healing crystal, do you have to do anything to it before using it? Cleansing your healing crystals before using them will help them work better, according to Spruill. \"Crystals generally absorb and expel energy, so cleansing your crystals can help ensure it is ready to be used for you specific needs,\" she says. She recommends cleansing them before each use, or at least once monthly. How do you cleanse healing crystals? There are several ways to cleanse stones for healing, according to Spruill. She suggests: laying them out overnight in the moonlight to absorb its regenerative properties; placing them in a bag overnight with carnelian, a crystal known to remove energies; running water over them; or soaking them in saltwater, depending on the stones. Another way is to visually or verbally cleanse them. \"Visualize a ray of cleansing light or speak cleansing words to rid lingering energy,\" she says. How do you use a crystal for healing? You can different types of crystals wherever you want in your space to facilitate healing. Spruill says the most common way to use them is by focusing on specific chakras during a meditation; they can also be used as energy hubs, or even just as decorations. \"Placing crystals throughout our spaces can help keep the flow of energy aligned,\" she says. What is the best way to care for healing crystals? Your crystals are meant to be used, so no need to be precious with them. However, Spruill recommends storing them in a protective pouch when they're not in use to prevent scratches. What is the most popular crystal? According to Spruill, amethyst is one of the most popular healing crystals. Known to relieve stress and strain, \"it is easy to source and is commonly know to help soothe stressful environments or emotions,\" she says. What is the rarest crystal for healing? Spruill says moldavite, which is believed to help with emotional healing because its \"healing properties are associated with transcending time,\" is one of the rarest crystals for healing. She said this is because it's difficult and expensive to source in its true form. How many healing crystals should you have at one time? There's no set right or wrong number for how many crystals someone should own, but Spruill says it's important to consider how the ones you have interact. She mentions that Carnelian can serve as a cleanser for other crystals, which may deprogram your other ones. Rather than focusing on the number, she advises getting clear on each crystal's use.
