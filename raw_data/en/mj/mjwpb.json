Given the complex interaction of physical and social factors on fast spreading infection, there have been increasing calls for comprehensive efforts using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. CBPR partnership composed of representatives from community-based organisations, health and academia actively developed the present study. Specific aims were (1) to assess the efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic combination, Giloy (Tinospora Cordifolia) and Pippali (Piper longum) in the management of mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 and (2) to determine the effect in relieving COVID-19 symptoms and preventing the onset of severe infection. |Condition Pilot Study on Efficacy and Safety of Ayurveda Combination in Patients With Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19: Community Based Participatory Research| |Actual Study Date :||October combination of Guduchi (Tinospora Cordifolia; 300 mg) and Pipli (Piper Longum 75 mg) twice daily. - Time to COVID-19 symptoms relief [ Time Frame: Up to 14-days ]Clinical improvement was recorded by AiM COVID-19 App using numeric rating scale - Prevention of severe stage of Covid19 [ Time Frame: Up to 14-days ]Deterioration in clinical status from mild/moderate to severe/critical during the study period assessed by AiM COVID-19 App - Side effect/ adverse events [ Time Frame: Up to 14-days ]Number of participants with intervention-related side effect/ adverse events as assessed by AiM COVID-19 App - COVID-19 severity worsening [ Time Frame: Up to 14-days ]Number of participants requiring hospitalisation - Time to negative saliva [ Time Frame: Up to 14-days ]Time to positive-to-negative RT-PCR conversion Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
