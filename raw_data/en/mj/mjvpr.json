In the present study, Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database was used in obtaining data for study subjects 55 years and older diagnosed with hypertension (n = 59,251; 25,266 vaccinated and 33,985 unvaccinated subjects) from 2001-2012. Propensity scores were calculated using a logistic regression model to determine the effects of vaccination by accounting for covariates that predict receiving the intervention (vaccine). A time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) for stroke in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Influenza vaccination was associated with a 42%, 40% and 44% stroke risk reduction in the entire cohort for all seasons, the influenza season and the non-influenza season, respectively (Adjust hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-0.61; aHR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.56-0.63; aHR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.52-0.60, for all seasons, the influenza season and the non-influenza season, respectively). The effect of risk reduction by vaccination also revealed a trend of dose dependency. Among subjects between 55 to 64 years old with four or more vaccinations during the study period, there is a 73% risk reduction for stroke during the non-influenza season (aHR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.20-0.34). In conclusion, the influenza vaccination exerts dose-dependent and synergistic protective effects against stroke in individuals 55 years and older with hypertension.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-04-18", "cleaned_text": "The Association between Influenza Vaccination and Stroke Risk in Patients with Hypertension: A Nationwide Population-Based Study [https://doi.org/10.3390/app12084074](https://doi.org/10.3390/app12084074) [Novel Insight into Mechanisms of Bioactive Compounds and Its Use in the Prevention and Thromboinflammation]( Stroke patients encounter high medical expense burdens and also a low quality of life as many of them face long-term disability. Strokes are more common in elderly individuals and their occurrence will substantially increase as the elderly population is rapidly growing worldwide due to a lower birthrate, higher living standards and better medical care than in the past [ [2](#B2-applsci-12-04074)]. [3](#B3-applsci-12-04074), [4](#B4-applsci-12-04074), [5](#B5-applsci-12-04074), [6](#B6-applsci-12-04074)]. Various studies revealed that influenza infections could also increase the risks of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death [ [7](#B7-applsci-12-04074)] as well as the incidence of [9](#B9-applsci-12-04074), [10](#B10-applsci-12-04074)]. [11](#B11-applsci-12-04074), [12](#B12-applsci-12-04074), [13](#B13-applsci-12-04074)]. [14](#B14-applsci-12-04074)] and the probability of stroke was calculated. Initial observations from the Framingham study found casual SBP as a good predictor of stroke as various components of BP, including diastolic and mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, as well as lability of pressure [ [15](#B15-applsci-12-04074)]. Analysis of data from the elderly with isolated systolic hypertension from SHEP (Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program) study demonstrated an 11% increase in stroke risk and a 16% increase in risk of all-cause mortality for each 10 mm Hg increase in pulse pressure [ [16](#B16-applsci-12-04074)]. [17](#B17-applsci-12-04074), [18](#B18-applsci-12-04074)]. Antithrombotic therapy is one of the main risk factors for strokes in individuals with AF. A major safety concern regarding the use of antithrombotic agents is the increased risk of bleeding, paagentrticularly major bleeding, which includes events that necessitate hospitalization, transfusion and surgery, as well as situations that involve particularly sensitive anatomical locations [ [19](#B19-applsci-12-04074), [20](#B20-applsci-12-04074)]. 2. Methods [21](#B21-applsci-12-04074)]. All of the NHIRD data which can be used to identify patients or care providers, including medical institutions and physicians, are encrypted before sending it to the National Health Research Institutes for database construction; records are further scrambled before being released to researchers. Thus, no approval from the institute's review board was necessary as there were no private data of any individual used anywhere in this study. Researchers or anyone using the NHIRD and its data subsets must sign a written agreement declaring that they are not obtaining or using any information that could potentially violate the privacy of patients or care providers [ [22](#B22-applsci-12-04074), [23](#B23-applsci-12-04074)]. 2.1. Study Population and Data Collection [24](#B24-applsci-12-04074)]. We obtained the data from Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (n = 1,000,000) and selected all patients diagnosed with hypertension (n = 178,315) from January 2001 to December 2012. Those excluded from the initial selection were individuals without a subsequent outpatient or inpatient diagnosis of hypertension or subsequent prescription of any antihypertensives (n = 35,772), individuals younger than 55 years old (n = 72,240), individuals with diagnosis related to stroke before the index date (n = 6374) and individuals already vaccinated within the 6 months prior to index date (n = 4678) ( [Figure 1](#applsci-12-04074-f001)). The endpoint was the incidence of stroke (ICD-9-CM 430-437) in the vaccinated or unvaccinated patients with a subsequent outpatient visit, emergency department visit or inpatient hospitalization for stroke within 12 months; the unvaccinated patients served as the reference arm. The protective effects of the vaccination are specific to the influenza season; therefore, evaluating patients in the non-influenza season can indicate the possible contribution of bias to estimates obtained during the influenza season. Thus, we analyzed the relationship between the seasonal effects of the vaccination and risk of stroke. [27](#B27-applsci-12-04074)]. A stratified analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of vaccination according to age and sex ( [Table 2](#applsci-12-04074-t002)). All analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.4, SAS, Cary, NC, USA); 2-tailed P b 0.05 was considered significant. In the sensitivity analyses, external adjustments clarify the effects of drugs and other covariates in epidemiological database studies [ [28](#B28-applsci-12-04074)]. Most of the statistically different variables between groups were adjusted in our analyses. 3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics [Table 1](#applsci-12-04074-t001). The mean age for entire cohort was 66.2 (standard deviation, SD 8.2) years for entire cohort, 69.1 (SD 7.4) years for the case group and 64.1 (SD 8.2) years for the control group. The prevalence of preexisting medical comorbidities, which include diabetes (p = 0.600) and dyslipidemia (p < 0.001) was higher in the unvaccinated patients than in the vaccinated subjects. Additionally, a higher number of vaccinated subjects in the study cohort were taking medication such as diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin antagonists, as well as co-medications (statins, metformin and aspirin) as compared to the unvaccinated subjects. A lower number of vaccinated subjects had a monthly income of NT$30,301 and resided in urban areas as compared to unvaccinated subjects ( [Table 1](#applsci-12-04074-t001)). 3.2. The Association between the Risk of Stroke and the Influenza Vaccination for Different Age and Sex [Table 2](#applsci-12-04074-t002). Propensity scores were calculated after adjusting for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, diabetes, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, renin-angiotensin antagonists, statins, metformin, aspirin, residential area and monthly income. The adjusted HRs (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of stroke in vaccinated subjects were significantly lower during all seasons when compared to those in the unvaccinated subjects (aHRs [95% CI] of all seasons: 0.58 [0.56, 0.61]). During non-influenza season, the risk reduction was potentially more profound than during the influenza season (aHRs [95% CI] = 0.60 [0.56, 0.63] and respectively). [Table 2](#applsci-12-04074-t002)). [Table 2](#applsci-12-04074-t002)). 3.3. Sensitivity Analysis of Stroke Risk Reduction after Different Times of Vaccination during Influenza Season, Non-Influenza Season and All Seasons [Table 3](#applsci-12-04074-t003), [Table 4](#applsci-12-04074-t004)and [Table 5](#applsci-12-04074-t005)contain the aHRs of vaccination in the risk reduction of stroke during the influenza, non-influenza and all seasons. There is a marked trend of lowering aHRs in subjects obtaining one to four vaccinations as compared to those unvaccinated, either in the whole cohort or in every stratum ( [Table 3](#applsci-12-04074-t003), [Table 4](#applsci-12-04074-t004)and [Table 5](#applsci-12-04074-t005)). Regardless of the underlying co-morbidities and medication history, the risk of stroke decreased after receiving the influenza vaccination more than two times and the trend was significant during the influenza season ( [Table 3](#applsci-12-04074-t003)). The neuroprotective effect after multiple times of influenza vaccination was also observed during the non-influenza season and all seasons ( [Table 4](#applsci-12-04074-t004)and [Table 5](#applsci-12-04074-t005)). 4. Discussion [17](#B17-applsci-12-04074), [29](#B29-applsci-12-04074)]. The infections and associated inflammation were determined to lead to the progression of atherosclerosis, plaque rupture and formation of thrombosis through various mechanisms, thereby increasing the incidence of stroke [ [30](#B30-applsci-12-04074), [31](#B31-applsci-12-04074)]. Additionally, high metabolic demands due to changes in sympathetic activity and hyperdynamic cardiovascular response increase the risk of strokes. The findings of this study support the protective effect of the influenza vaccination on the incidence of stroke in older individuals with hypertension. A 42% risk reduction was observed for the entire cohort throughout all seasons with stronger effects seen in the 55-64-year-old group and in effect of the influenza vaccination could stem mainly from the prevention of infection and inflammation-induced sequelae. [6](#B6-applsci-12-04074), [7](#B7-applsci-12-04074), [32](#B32-applsci-12-04074)]. There have been reports of increased risk for hospital admissions and a high rate of mortality in elderly men during the influenza season [ [33](#B33-applsci-12-04074), [34](#B34-applsci-12-04074), [35](#B35-applsci-12-04074)]. As high mortality during the influenza season could mask the incidence of strokes, individuals with various diseases and health conditions (e.g., AF, hypertension) may die before encountering a stroke [ [17](#B17-applsci-12-04074)]. However, during the non-influenza season, the mortality rate usually decreases and the actual effect of the influenza vaccination can be observed. This likely explains why the influenza vaccination exerted marked protective effects against stroke during the a previous study [ [23](#B23-applsci-12-04074)]. [17](#B17-applsci-12-04074), [23](#B23-applsci-12-04074)]. Epidemiological evidence from influenza outbreaks and pandemics reveals that morbidity and mortality are often higher for women than men. Females generate higher proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses and experience greater morbidity and mortality than males. Males and females also respond differently to influenza vaccines, with women initiating higher humoral immune responses but experiencing more adverse reactions to seasonal influenza vaccines than men. Sex-hormones, including estradiol and testosterone, as well as genetic differences between the sexes may play roles in modulating sex differences in immune responses to influenza virus infection and vaccination [ [36](#B36-applsci-12-04074)]. The present study demonstrated the consistent neuroprotective effect of influenza among male and female patients. [3](#B3-applsci-12-04074)]. Our study indicates the importance of the influenza vaccination in elderly individuals, particularly males with hypertension in the 55-64-year-old group, and the overall relatively high risk of stroke. Hypertension is known to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke [ [37](#B37-applsci-12-04074)], whereas diabetes increases the risk of ischemic stroke but not hemorrhagic stroke [ [38](#B38-applsci-12-04074)]. Additionally, the protective effects of the influenza vaccination are likely to be related to the prevention of acute infection, which can elicit both systemic and local vascular inflammatory responses [ [23](#B23-applsci-12-04074)]. [Table 4](#applsci-12-04074-t004)and [Table 5](#applsci-12-04074-t005)). Furthermore, studies show that prevention of vascular remodeling by metformin can reduce hemorrhage and improve functional outcomes, emphasizing the importance of vascular protection in cases of hemorrhage stroke [ [39](#B39-applsci-12-04074)]. Our findings suggest that the influenza vaccination exerts dose-response and synergistic protective effects against strokes in patients with AF (i.e., male sex, age 55-64 years, CCI 3, hypertension, use of statin or warfarin) and reduces the incidence of strokes. The current rate of the influenza vaccination in Taiwan is approximately 35% [ [40](#B40-applsci-12-04074), [41](#B41-applsci-12-04074)]. The results of our study are comparable with those obtained in the general population in Taiwan. 5. Limitations [42](#B42-applsci-12-04074), [43](#B43-applsci-12-04074)]. Hospitals with conspicuous diagnoses and practices are audited and heavily penalized for documented malpractice or discrepancies. Another limitation is that data on several unmeasured confounders, including body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake and other over-the-counter drug use (associated with dementia), are unavailable in the NHIRD. Moreover, all subjects in this cohort are Asian, therefore ethnic susceptibility is unclear. As this study was not a prospective randomized blinded study, a cause-effect relationship was not established. These findings imply significant protective effects of the vaccination; however, additional randomized studies are necessary to further validate these findings. 6.
