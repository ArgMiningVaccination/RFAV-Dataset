Phyllomedusa Bicolor (the giant leaf or monkey frog), otherwise known as \"Kambo\" is a natural vaccine derived from the waxy secretion on the skin of the green tree frog that lives in northwestern parts of the Amazon jungle and is used traditionally by the indigenous tribes of Colombia, Brazil, and Peru as a medicine and spiritual aide. Kambo has a range of traditional and potential therapeutic applications, both medical and psycho-spiritual. Commonly described as an 'ordeal medicine', the secretion is known for its powerful emetic or purgative effects. Despite its initial unpleasantness, kambo is widely sought out to revitalize body and mind. Possible Benefits of KamboResearch conducted since the 1980s has shown the chemical makeup of kambo to contain short chains of amino acids, known as peptides, that affect gastrointestinal muscles and blood circulation as well as stimulate the adrenal cortex and pituitary gland in the brain. While there are no clinical studies that definitively back up kambo's efficacy, the properties of kambo peptides suggest it may be a promising treatment for the following conditions: Depression, Migraines, Blood circulation problems, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, Vascular insufficiency, Organ diseases, Cancer, Fertility problems, Deeply rooted toxins, Chronic pain, Addiction to opiate or prescription painkillers, Fever and infections, Negative energies (traditionally known as \"panema\") How is it administered?Kambo is applied to the participant through making quick small burn mark openings on the skin referred to as \"gates\". As the medicine is administered onto the gates, it enters the lymphatic system and not the bloodstream. One gate is administered first to introduce the medicine into the system and to gauge the participant's reaction. After a few minutes, more may be applied to however many gates have been opened or to the participant's needs. Generally anywhere from 3-8 gates may be applied on the side of arm, inside ankle, spine or where both intuitively agree upon. What does it do?Some of the initial onsets of kambo may be increase in heart rate, temperature, perspiration, shivers, nausea and dizziness. Blood pressure may also rise or fall dramatically. Some may experience swelling of lips which wears off post ceremony. After some minutes sitting with the medicine, the body will begin purging the water and expelling blockages and toxins that may be stored energetically and physically down to organs and to the cellular level. Kambo involves a deep physical and energetic cleansing that can be an intense but manageable experience. It is required to consume a large amount of room temperature water (2-3 liters) at the procession of the ceremony in the presence of the facilitator. This assists the process in order to flush the lymphatic system, liver, kidneys, gall bladder, and other organs. How long is it?The whole ceremonial process can last 2-3 hours which may include meditating, breathing techniques, Hap\u00e9 etc. However the purging session can last anywhere from 15-30 min. Recovery and integration is generally quick within 45-60 min and participant can drive and carry on with regular functionality same day. Your experience may feel enhanced following the kambo purge. You may feel great physical strength, sharpened senses, and heightened mental alertness. Desirable after-effects like these may take a day to materialize or they could be immediate. They also tend to include a consistently elevated mood, increased physical and mental energy, decreased stress, and enhanced focus. What is Bufo? Bufo aka Bufo Alvarius is a toad species is devried from. 5-MeO-DMT is a naturally-occuring entheogen that is found in several species of plant, and most popularly in the venom of the Bufo alvarius toad. Also known as the Sonoran Desert Toad, Colorado River Toad, Bufo, and El Sapo/Sapito. 5-MeO-DMT is a relative of the classic psychedelic DMT (dimethyltryptamine), and like DMT it also induces an intense experience when ingested. Typically, it is smoked as a powder or dried plant material. Many find that smoking Bufo venom produces a stronger experience than taking 5-MeO-DMT alone. The dried venom of the Bufo alvarius toad contains both 5-MeO-DMT and another psychotropic substance known as bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), and so the Bufo experience is different from a pure 5-MeO-DMT or a \"DMT Trip\" experience. Although some 5-MeO-DMT-containing plants have a history of traditional use, there is no evidence of any indigenous Bufo alvarius practices. Modern ceremonies using either 5-MeO-DMT plants or Bufo alvarius venom are growing in popularity, and are used for healing or spiritual purposes. Effects of Bufo Alvarius and 5-MeO-DMT5-MeO-DMT is a potent naturally-occurring entheogen. Its effects can kick in around 15 seconds after smoking it, and 5-MeO-DMT produces an intense and sometimes overwhelming psychedelic experience. Although it is over within about half an hour, people describe experiencing an overpowering ego-dissolution that often leads to a feeling of being connected to everything in existence. The psychedelic effects of smoking Bufo venom typically last about 15 minutes, and will totally subside after around 40 minutes. The usual psychedelic \"afterglow\" may last a few more hours, or weeks following the session. Healing with Bufo Alvarius and 5-MeO-DMTAs a profound and intense entheogen, Bufo toad medicine has the therapeutic potential to treat a number of conditions such as depression, anxiety, and opioid addiction. Bufo experiences are primarily sought out for personal development reasons. Seekers hope that the powerful mystical experience brings them the complete ego dissolution and the release of old traumas.
