Anearly wave of RSV activity and circulation of other respiratory viruses has led to increased hospitalizations among children and has contributed to stresses in the pediatric healthcare delivery system in California and across the US. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, resulting in emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and even death, especially for infants and older adults. Except for RSV -associated death in children under 5 years of age, RSV is not a reportable condition in California; therefore, individual cases of RSV are not reported to public health agencies. 23RSV Treatment and Prevention Currently no vaccines available, although some are under development. There are no specific treatments indicated for most patients. Palivizumab ( Synagis ) is a monoclonal antibody given monthly to certain high- risk children forimmunoprophylaxis during RSV season. For most people, the best ways to protect against RSV: frequent hand washing, staying home when sick, covering coughs and wearing a mask in crowded indoor gatherings. CDPH released a health advisory on November 12, 2022, alerting health care providers to the increase in RSV activity. 24RSV Resources CDPH RSV CAHAN 10/3/22 CDC Respiratory Virus HAN 11/4/22 CDC RSV Information & Resources AAP Guidance on Use of Palivizumab 251.
