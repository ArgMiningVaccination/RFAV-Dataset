The estimated prevalence of the disease is 1-2% worldwide and approaches 5% in women over age 55. Modern medicines can only alleviate some of the symptoms associated with the disease but cannot cure the disease. On the other hand, alternative medicine practitioners (AMPs) of various countries claim to cure this diseases with formulations prepared from a single or a combination of medicinal plants. RA is widely prevalent in Bangladesh and is present in both rural as well as urban segments of the country's population. The objective of the present study was to conduct an ethnomedicinal survey amongst the AMPs of two northern districts of Bangladesh, namely Dinajpur and Panchagarh to collect information on medicinal plants used for treatment of RA. Interviews with AMPs were done with the help of a semi-structured questionnaire and plant species pointed out by them were collected and identified at the Bangladesh National Herbarium. A total of 17 plant species were found to be used by the AMPs to treat RA. These species included (with family name given loss of natural habitat, a number of the above plants are rapidly becoming endangered. It is imperative to conduct scientific studies on these plants towards finding a better cure for RA. "}
