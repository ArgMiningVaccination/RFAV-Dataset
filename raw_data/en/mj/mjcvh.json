Vedic Astrology Consultation - $210 Rooted in the Vedas, India's ancient system of knowledge, Vedic astrology is based on the belief that the stars and planets have a powerful influence on our lives. Beyond its technical aspects, Vedic astrology is ultimately a spiritual science, and therefore requires a certain level of intuition that is generally only present in those who maintain certain standards of spiritual practice. In order to read horoscopes and then give advice on how to best approach life's obstacles from a spiritual perspective, an astrologer should be living a life in which a strong standard of spiritual discipline is maintained. Originally known as jyotish, or \"the science of light,\" Vedic astrology is considered by many to be the eye of the Vedas, because it is meant to provide guidance to individuals who feel lost or confused on their life's journey.. Vaidya Swati Mhaske has studied Vedic astrology under her Guru Mr Alok Jain famous vedic astrologer, author from Delhi India. Vaidya Swati is a professional Vedic astrologer with more than 7 years of experience, and has successfully integrated Ayurveda and Vedic astrology in her practice. A Vedic astrology consultation with Swati will be a one on one session of 1.5 hrs focused on a detailed explanation of the birth chart, planetary distribution, monthly and yearly predictions and more. Swati will be able to guide you for the upcoming yearly predictions and help bring awareness for the appropriate actions. This is an 1.5 hrs of consultation. Testimonials Thank you! Swati Mhaske (D.

Benefits of Ayurveda Ayurveda - Charya (Way of Life) Our modern life has become more complicated. There is a lot of stress and even more expectations from ourselves and those around. In this hurricane of challenges we tend to neglect taking care of our bodies, and assume taking care our body is also very difficult. Just eating a healthy lunch or a snack is not enough. A single healthy food may not give our bodies the complete nutrition as well as keep our body cycles in balance. Ayurveda recommends a way of life for different times of the day as well as seasons. These are small activities that form healthy habits.
