Prior to 1906, there had existed in Bowling Gr een the Southern Normal School and Bowling Green Busi- ness University, whose president was Dr. Henry Hardin Che rry. In 1907 the Southern Normal School was transferred to the state, and Dr. Cherry was selected as the first pr esident of Western Kentucky State Normal School. In 1922 the Kentucky Legislature changed the school's name to Wester n Kentucky State Normal Sc hool and Teachers College and empowered the College to award degrees to its graduates. In 1930 the sc hool's name was changed to Western Kentucky State Teachers' College, and in 1948 to Western Ke ntucky State College. The Kentucky General Assembly in 1966 designated Western as a University and cha nged the name to Western Kentucky University. Western began offering the Master of Arts degr ee in 1931. This program was discontinued in 1936 but was resumed in 1941. The granting of university status in 1966 ga ve the Graduate School (rename d the Graduate College in 1969) increased opportunity both to strengthen existing programs and to offer an even wider choice of programs. In 1992 the Graduate College was renamed Graduate Studies. The school's first president, Henry Hardin Cherry, e xpressed a theme for Western's e ducational commitment that is a constant inspiration to faculty, students a nd alumni: \"The Spirit Makes the Master.\" As a university, Western has produced educationa l opportunities to more than 110,000 alumni who proudly call WKU \"the home of the Hilltoppers.\" WKU's campus crowns a hill overlooking th e city of Bowling Green and is proclaimed as one of the mo st beautiful in the nation.

Registration and housing fees must be paid on the date a student registers or on other dates as specified by the Office of the Bursar. Students who do not make payment of required fees are not registered students. The University offers a deferred payment plan, which is available for the fall and spring semesters. Fifty percent of the amount due for tuition, fees, housing and meal plans, plus a $20.00 contract service fee, must be paid by the due date indicated on the bill. The student must sign a Deferred Pa yment Contract in the Bursa r's Office or obtain the form from the WKU Tuition and Fees website. The remaining tuition a nd fees will be billed with the due date of October 15 for the fall semester or March 15 for the spring semester. A late fee of $100 will be charged for failure to pay the balance by the due date. Students who fail to pay the balance will be obligated and not allowed to register for another semester or receive a transcript. A payment plan is not offered for the summer term. The University expects the students to be financially re sponsible and not be delinquent in financial obligations to the University or to any department or division of the University . A student who fails to meet a financial obligation within ten (10) days after the date of notice from the appropriate uni versity official will be subject to regulations promulgated by the University. If the student does not settle the obliga tion by the date designated on the notice, the appropriate business office shall notify the Registrar. After the Registrar has been notified that a student is delinquent, the Registrar shall not allow the student to register or obtain an official transcript until the Registrar has been notified that the obligation has been settled. The University expects all students to register for classes and pay tuition prior to the first day of class. Class schedules will be cancelled for students who fail to pay or ma ke arrangements to pay by the due date on the statement rendered by the University. A late payment charge of $100 may be assessed. Failure to receive a bill does not relieve the student of the obligation to pay tuition and fees by the due date. In the event that any tuition, fees and/or expens es are not paid when due, and the University undertakes collection of any unpaid portion, the st udent shall also be assessed and be responsible for any collection costs incurred by the University. Tuition and Fee Refund Policy Tuition refunds or reductions in outstanding fee liabilities for students who officially withdraw through the Registrar's Office or TopNet , or who change their status from full-time to part-time or further reduce their part-time status through drop/add, will be made according to the sche dules below. The refund percentage is applied to the number of credit hours dropped, not the dollar amount of the tuition and fees assessed. To calculate a refund: Multiply the refund percentage by the number of hours dropped. This number is subtracted from the student's current liable hours. For more information visit http ://www.wku.edu/bursa r/refund.html 12 RESIDENCY The determination of residency for admission and tu ition assessment is governed by state regulation 13 KAR 2:045. The regulation can be reviewed on the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education website at www.cpe.state.ky.us/policies/ policies_student_residen cy.asp. Enrolled students ma y contact Undergraduate Admissions for additional information. ADMISSION Application and Fee Students seeking a graduate degree must obtain an A pplication for Admission (Form A) from the Office of Graduate Studies or on the Graduate Studies website at http://www. wku.edu/graduate /. The completed form, along with a non- refundable $35.00 application fee (this fee is subject to change without prior notice), must be returned to the Office of Graduate Studies and Research. Students may also apply online at https://acsapps.wku.edu/pls/prod/tw bkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=w kumenu.P_AdmUnsecMnu . All students seeking admission into a graduate degree program should submit the Graduate Studies application by the following dates: Fall Semester: June 15 Spring Semester: November 15 (Some programs have earlier date s for application submission.) Application and all supporting materials (i.e., transcri pts, GRE/GMAT, teaching certificate) need to be received in Graduate Studies by the above dates to ensure adequate time for departmental review. To be eligible for any type of financial aid or a graduate assistants hip, students must be admitted in good standing to a degree program. Non-degree seeking students are ineligible for financ ial aid and graduate assistantships. Transcript Record Graduates of accredited institutions other than Western Ke ntucky University must request that one official transcript showing the completed undergraduate degree be sent to We stern Kentucky University. The transcript must be forwarded from the college or university registrar directly to the Office of Graduate Studies and Research . Applicants who have not completed the undergraduate degree ar e required to submit one offici al transcript at the time of application and one official transcript upon completion of the degree. Transcript records should be submitted for any graduate and undergraduate courses taken at any institution other than WKU. Transcripts sent to Graduate Studies become the property of the University and will not be returned to the student und er any circumstances nor will a copy of the transcript be given to the student. Standardized Examination Scores All degree-seeking students must submit appropriate sta ndardized test scores regardle ss of their undergraduate grade point average. With two exceptions, all degree programs require the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test. The exceptions are the Master of Business Administ ration, which requires the Gr aduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and the Master of Arts in Administrativ e Dynamics, which accepts either the GRE or GMAT. As of October 1, 2002 the GRE General Test is compri sed of the verbal and quantitative sections and an analytical writing assessment. Standardized test scores must be receive d by the Office of Graduate Studies and Research prior to admission. The admission decision will be based upon both the undergraduate transcript grade point average and the GRE score in its entirety. Registration materials for the GRE and GMAT are available at the Counseling Service Center, the Office of Graduate Studies and Research, http://www.gre.org, or http://www.gmat.org, or by calling 1 (800) 473-2255. If students have a master's degree from an accredited ins titution in a related field to their area of study, they may use this in place of the GRE General Test. Each department has the discretion to approve this exception to the GRE requirement. GAP Score Admission decisions are based upon both the undergraduate grade point average and the GRE General Test score. The GAP score is the sum of the GRE Verbal & Quantita tive scores times the overall undergraduate grade point average. For example, a GRE score of 800 (Verbal + Qu antitative) and a grade average of 3.5/4.0 would produce a GAP score of 2800. Because GAP is a product of both the GR E score and undergraduate grade point average, both the GRE and transcript record are essential for making an ad mission decision. The GRE General Test also includes a writing component. The required GAP score is 2200 (individua l degree programs may be higher). Previous graduate course work does not have any beari ng on admission requirements, i.e., GAP score calculation. Students who took the GRE General Test prior to October 1, 2002 must have a GAP score of 3500 or bette r. This GRE General Test consisted of verbal, quantitative, and analytical s ections. The GAP score is generated by the sum of the three parts of the GRE times the overall undergraduate grade point average. 13 GMAT Score Admission decisions to the Master of Business Administration are based upon the scores of the Graduate Management Admission Test. The require ments for general admission to the MB A program are a 500 total GMAT test score and a GAP score of 1050 (undergraduate grade point average times 200 pl us GMAT score). ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Individual programs may have more stri ngent requirements than the Office of Graduate Studies, but all students must meet the minimum Graduate Studies requireme nts to be considered for admission. Master's Degrees Applicants for a mast er's degree program must have: A. The completed application, along with a $35.00 (non-refundable) application fee by the admission deadline; B. A bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university (Applicants from non-accredited institutions see Applicants from Non-Regionally Accredited Institutions ); C. An adequate preparation in the field of specialization; D. All students who hold teacher certification or have a statement of eligibility must submit a copy of the current teaching certificate or statement of eligibility; and E. A GAP score of 2200 for master's programs requiring the GRE. MBA students must have a GMAT score of 500 and a GAP score of 1050. Specialist Degrees Applicants for a speci alist degree program must have: A. The completed application, along with a $35.00 ( non-refundable) application fee by the admission deadline; B. Hold a master's degree from an accredited college or university (Ed.S. in School Psychology does not require a applicants to hold a master's degree); C. Have adequate preparation in the proposed field of specialization; D. All students applying for the Ed.S. in Elementa ry Education, Secondary Education or School Administration must submit a copy of the current teaching certificate; E. Score not less than 850 on the GRE General Test Verb al and Quantitative sections and a Writing Score of 4.0 or have a grade point average of not less than 3.5 on the course work for the master's degree program (The specialist degree in School Admini stration requires a 3.5 GP A and 850 GRE score); and F. Present to the Office of Graduate Studies three letters of recommendation from graduate faculty and professional associates. Graduate Certificate Programs Students may apply to a graduate certificate program; however, admission or completion of a graduate certificate does not guarantee admission to a graduate degree program. Admission to pursue a graduate certificate is based upon a bachelor's degree and adequate prepara tion in the area of study. A maximum of 12 hours of graduate certificate course work, if appropriate, may subsequently be a pplied toward graduate degree requirements. Applicants from Non-Regionally Accredited Institutions Graduates of non-regionally accredited, four-year e ducational institutions may be considered for admission to a master's degree program with a minimum GAP score of 2200 a nd writing score of 3.5, an adequate preparation in the field of specialization, and a minimum of 40 hours of general education course work including the following: 1. At least 6 semester hours (or the equivalent) in each of the areas of communication, humanities, and natural science. 2. At least 12 semester hours (or the equivalent) in social and behavioral studies, including history. 3. At least 2 semester hours (or the e quivalent) in mathematics or logic. Transient Students Students working toward a degree at other institutions mu st complete an Application for Admission and pay the required application fee, but are not required to submit tran scripts. Instead, they must obtain a Visiting Student Form (Form H) from the Office of Graduate Studies. This form must be completed by the student and the graduate dean of the degree-granting institution, where th e student is in good standing, and retu rned to Graduate Studies at WKU prior to enrollment. Non-degree Seeking Students Students not seeking a graduate degree must complete an Application for Admission and, if not a Western graduate, submit all transcripts from colleges attended to the Gradua te Studies Office. Should the non-degree seeking student later apply for and be granted admission into a degree pr ogram, no more than 12 hours taken while in the non-degree 14 category may be used to fulfill degree requirements. Non-degree seeking students are not eligible for financial aid or graduate assistantships. International Students Applicants who are not U.S. citizens must submit the following materials for admission: 1. Properly completed International Application for Admission (Form I), 2. An official transcript indicating completion of a baccalaureate degree (or the equivalent), 3. GRE General Test Score or GMAT (i f seeking admission to the MBA program), 4. Evidence of ability to communicate in English, (A minimum of 550 on the paper based TOEFL, a minimum of 213 on the computer based TOEFL, or a minimum of 79 on the iBT TOEFL), and 5. Evidence of adequate financial resources. After the international student has submitted these app lication materials, evaluation is made within the department offering the degree program. Official transcripts sent to WKU will not be returned to the student for any reason. Students wishing to keep an official transcript shoul d request two copies from the undergraduate institution. International students must participate in orientation and testing of English prof iciency three days prior to the beginning of the regular registration period. Stude nts found to be deficient in English skills must take remedial course work. Health insurance must be purchased upon arrival at the Univ ersity. For additional information, contact the Office of International Programs at (270) 745-4857. Senior Citizens A senior citizen (65 years or older) who holds a bachel or's degree may be admitted to Graduate Studies as a Special Student. Upon completion of 12 hours of course work in a de gree program with a minimum grade point average of 3.0, the student may be admitted to that degree program. Alternate Admission for Master's Degree Applicants who do not meet GAP requirements may pursue alternate admission. In that process, the admission decision may be based upon consideration of accomplishments and qualifications as evidenced by a professional portfolio consisting of the record of vocational attainment and recognition; a statement of goals indicating commitment to pursue graduate education; letters of support from instruct ors, co-workers, or work s upervisors; scholarly papers and/or projects; and any other supportive materials. This additional information is cons idered by the alternative admission committee and may result in one of three recomme ndations: full admission to Graduate Studies; conditional admission (full admission to be based upon performance in specifi ed undergraduate/graduate course work); or denial of admission. Some departme nts may have more specific guidelines on alternate admission materials. Appeal requests for admission requirements for the specialist degree program should follow the procedure outlined above for the master's program. Second Master's Guidelines The student who wishes to earn a second master's degree from Western Kentucky University must apply for and gain admission to the new program and satis fy all requirements (specific course work , research tool, thesis, etc.) for the new degree. No more than 12 hours of previous course work, whether transferred from another university, from the previous master's degree at Western (or a combination of the two) or as a non-degree seeking student at WKU may be used to fulfill program and research tool requirements. An y course work used must be earned within the six years allowed for the second master's degree program. Seeking Dual Degrees Students may not seek two degrees (master's or specialist) simultaneously nor can they pursue a master's or Rank I at the same time. A student can, however, pursue a certificate (i.e., Women's Studies Certificate) along with a master's program. Academic Common Market Kentucky, along with 12 other southern states, pa rticipates in the Academic Common Market\u2014an interstate agreement for sharing non-duplicative academic programs. Selected graduate programs are included in this cooperative arrangement. A Kentucky resident who has gained admission in to one of these selected out-of-state programs can enroll and pay the respective state's resident tuition. A listing of the programs is available from the Director of Undergraduate Admissions. Program Residency Graduate Studies and Research does not have a reside ncy requirement for completing a master's/specialist degree. WKU courses offered by distance educa tion are considered resident credit. 15 GRADUATE PROGRAM INFORMATION Graduate Studies & Research Wetherby Administration Building 207 (270) 745-2446 Office (270) 745-6950 Fax Additional information about degree programs may be obtained from the department offering the degree. Privacy Policy Graduate Studies and Research will not disclose inform ation to a third party regardless of association to the student (e.g., spouse, parent, friend, or other family member). This is to protect the st udent's identification and ensure student information is not misused in any way. Course Load In general, the number of semester hours of credit that may be earned during a given term may not exceed the number of weeks of instruction. During a regular semester, the course load for a full-time graduate student is 9-15 hours with 9 being the minimum and 15 the maximum. The Dean of Graduate Studie s will not approve enrollment beyond the maximum of 15 hours. Graduate assistants may carry a course load of 9-12 hours during each semester while holding an assistantship appointment. Course Numbering 500 to 800 Courses numbered 500 and above are open to graduate students only. 400G Upper division undergraduate courses numbered at the 400-level a nd have a \"G\" designation (e.g., ENG 401G) may be taken for graduate credit. In these courses, graduate students are expected to complete additional course requirements as prescribed by the inst ructor. However, a student who has taken a particular 400-level course may not repeat that same course for 400G level credit. A maximum of 12 hours of 400G courses may be applied to the ma ster's degree. Specialist degree ca ndidates may not use any 400G-level courses to fulfill degree requirements. 400 and below Courses numbered at the 400-level or below cannot be taken for graduate credit. Courses of this nature will remain in a student's overall GPA, but will not affect the student's degree GPA. Course Descriptions Course descriptions can be found in the back of th e Graduate Catalog and are ava ilable through Western's TopNet online registration system. To view a course description, go to TopNet from Western's homepage Quick Links. Once at the TopNet Registration homepage, select Course Catalog then View Course Descriptions . To choose a course, locate the department in the drop-down menu and select Go, then choose the course number and select Go. Time Limitation for Completion of Degree All requirements for the master's and specialist degrees must be completed within six years from the date the first course is taken. Failure to complete a degree in six years will result in the loss of all credits taken outside of the time limit. Students may request an extension to be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Reserach. Extensions are considered on a case-by-case basis, and a student is not guaranteed approval. All records are purged after six years from the date of last enrollment at the university or degree completion. Credit Prior to Program Admission The total number of credits students may apply to th eir degree program from credits earned prior to admission to the program (courses taken during the senior semester, unclassified status courses, transfer courses, previous master's courses, previous certificate courses) may not exceed twelve (12) hours. Transfer Credit A maximum of 12 transfer credits may be used in any degree program. However, some programs have more restrictive policies regarding the number of hours that will be accepted in a particular program. In any case, the following requirements must be met: 1. The credit(s) must have been earned at an accredited graduate institution. 2. The course work to be transferred must be properl y designated as having been taken for graduate credit. 3. The grade point average must be at least 3.0 (4.0 scal e) on all graduate course work appearing on the transcript before specific courses can be transferred. 4. Additionally, the courses to be transferred must carry a grade of 3.0 (4.0 scale) or better. 16 5. Credits earned during a given term must not exceed th e number of weeks of instruction and must have been earned within the six-year time limit for degree completion. 6. Any course(s) to be transferred must be appropriate for degree completion. 7. At least 12 hours in the major area and at least 6 hour s in the minor area must be taken at Western. The \"Transfer Credit Practices\" report published by the American Associa tion of Registrar's and Admissions Officers is the reference us ed in evaluating credits. Transfer credits taken during the final semester of a progr am will delay program completion until official transcripts have been received in the Office of Graduate Studies a nd Research. In cooperative or joint programs with other universities, credits earned in the program at these institutions are not considered transfer credits. A majority of credits applied toward certificate requirements must be earned at Western. Independent Study Courses A maximum of 6 hours of workshops, independent studies , special problems, individual special topics, and readings in the discipline may be used on any degree program. Graduate Advising Upon admission to a graduate program, each student is assigned a major advisor from the graduate faculty in their respective department. Although student a dvising at Western Kentucky University is specifically designed to assist students as they progress through degree programs, it is the responsibility of all st udents to be th oroughly familiar with all rules, regulatio ns, and requirements pert aining to graduate study . Readmission If graduate students are not enrolled in the semester in which they initially applied or have not enrolled in more than three semesters, a Readmit Form is required. A Readmit Fo rm may be obtained from the Office of Graduate Studies or via email at graduate.studies@wku.edu . Once admitted to a program or enrolled in courses, a student may complete a readmission application online at the following website: https://acsapps.wku.edu/pls/prod/twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=wkumenu. P_GradReAdmUnsecMnu Program of Study (Form B/C) All degree-seeking students must submit a planned program of study (Form B/C) to the Office of Graduate Studies and Research within the first semester (or up to 12 credit hour s) of course work (inclusive of transfer credit). The degree program is to be developed in consultation with and approved by th e advisor(s) assigned at the time of admission. If a program of study is not on file with the Offi ce of Graduate Studies and Research, a student will not be permitted to enroll in a second semester or beyond 12 hours of courses (whichever comes first). Removal of this hold is contingent upon receipt and approval of the program of study (Form B/C). No exceptions w ill be made regarding this matter. All degree programs must be reviewed and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies and Research. Students in education graduate programs must have degree programs a pproved by Teacher Certification prior to submitting the program to Graduate Studies. The tota l number of credits students may apply to their degree program from credits earned prior to admission to the program (courses taken during th e senior semester, unclassified status courses, transfer courses, previous master's courses, previ ous certificate courses) may not exceed 12 hours. Non-degree education programs are reviewed and a pproved in the Office of Teacher Certification. Students entering the planned fifth-year (Rank II) or sixth-year (Ra nk I) professional education progr ams must have an approved program of study on file in the Office of Teacher Certifi cation. These planned programs lead to the Rank II or Rank I salary classifications as recognized by the Kentucky Department of Education. The approved program must be on file before a letter certifying completion of hours can be sent to the appropriate board of education. Course Substitutions Any change in the approved program of study must be specified on a Course Change Form, approved by the advisor and submitted to Graduate Studies for final approval. Course changes include the addition or deletion of a course, the substitution of a transfer c ourse, or substitution of another course offered by Western for a course on the program. The final approval should be obtained prior to enrollment in the course(s) to be submitted. Change of Program Students who wish to change from one program of study to another must apply on a \"Change of Program\" form. Admission to the desired program must be gained, and such admission constitutes a new date of admission. The advisor(s) assigned to the new program will evaluate any pr eviously-taken course for their applicability to the new program. Students may submit a change of program online at the following website: https://acsapps.wku.edu/pls/prod/twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=wkumenu. P_GradReAdmUnsecMnu 17 GRADUATE STUDIES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Grading and the Quality Point System The letters A, B, C, D, F, P and X are used by the Univ ersity to indicate the student's academic proficiency. These letters have the following significance: A - Excellent, four quality points per semester hour B - Good, three quality points per semester hour C - Average, two quality points per semester hour D - Below Average, Unsatisfactory, one quality point per semester hour. F - Failure, no semester hours earned and no quality points P - Pass, credit is awarded towards a degree, but no quality points are assigned. The \"P\" designation is restricted to specific courses approved for its use. X - Incomplete. A grade of \"X\" (incomplete) is give n only when a relatively sma ll amount of work is not completed because of illness or other reason satisfactor y to the instructor. A grade of \"X\" received by a graduate student, with the exception of thesis courses or similar projects, will automatically become an \"F\" unless removed within twelve (12) weeks of the next full term (summer term excluded). An incomplete must be removed within this twelve-week period regardless of whether the student is registered for additional work in the next term. A student should work with the inst ructor who assigned the incomplete on an independent basis to complete the necessary assignments. The grade of \"X\" will continue to appear as the initial grade on the student's transcript, along with the revised grade. A grade of incomplete is not used under any circumstances as a subs titute for \"F\" or \"W\". The designations of AU, W, NR, ER, and NG are not included in the determination of grade point average and are used in the following cases: AU - Auditor of a course (See be low for additional information). W - Officially withdrew NR - No report. Grades for an entire class were not received by the Office of the Registrar in time for processing. The designation \"NR\" is not to be used as a grade for individual students. ER - Error in reporting. This designation is used by th e Office of the Registrar when a grade is not reported for an individual student. NG - No grade. A grade is not appropriate to the c ourse. The \"NG\" designation is restricted to specific courses approved for its use. IP - In Progress. The IP designation is restricted to specific courses designed to span more than one term. Unless approved otherwise, an IP de signation unresolved at the end of one year after its assignment will be converted to an F. Auditing of Courses An auditor is one who enrolls and participates in a course without expec ting to receive academic credit. The same registration procedure is followed and the same fees are char ged as for courses taken for credit. An audited course is not applicable to any degree or certificate program. Regular cl ass attendance is expected of an auditor. Other course requirements, which may be obtained in writing from the inst ructor, will vary depending on the nature of the course. Students interested in auditing a course should secure permission from the instru ctor and discuss course requirements prior to enrolling. Failure to meet cour se requirements may result in the auditor being withdrawn from the course at the request of the instructor. A successful audit will be recorded on the transcript with the designation of AU. Any change from audit to credit must be done by the last day to add a cl ass. Changes from credit to audit must be done by the last day to drop a class with a grade of \"W\". Refunds for wit hdrawals from audited courses will be prorated on the same basis as refunds for withdrawal s from courses taken for credit. Recording of Grades Grades are recorded in the Office of the Registrar as reported by the faculty at the end of each term. No grade filed in that office may be changed except on a written statement fro m the instructor certifying that an error has been made, or in the case of an incomplete, that the work was comp leted within the time limit. All conditions must be removed before the student will be recommended for any certificate or degree. Grades Candidates for graduate degrees and/or certificates ar e required to maintain a combin ed average grade of B (3.0 grade point average) in all course work. Grades lower than a C may not be used in meeting degree or non-degree requirements. Graduate student s must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA in all courses taken as a graduate student (including all transfer courses and unde rgraduate level courses). Students who fail to meet the 3.0 GPA requirements for the graduate program GPA (courses on approved Form C) and overall cumulative GPA will not be awarded a degree or certificate. 18 Graduate Academic Probation and Dismissal Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 grade point av erage (GPA) for all courses taken at WKU and those graduate courses transferred to WKU to fulfill graduate program re quirements. Students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in both the major and the cumulative (overall) GPA to earn a degree or certificate. If a student's overall GPA falls below 3.0, the student will receive a letter of acad emic warning informing the student that the GPA is below 3.0. The student will have one additional full-time semester or the equivalent (9 hours) to remove the academic probation by attaining a 3.0 cumulative GPA. If the GPA rema ins below a 3.0 after completing the one semester of full- time course work or the equivalent (9 hours), the student may not register for any additional graduate credit at WKU and will be dismissed from the graduate program. Students placed on academic probation are not eligible for graduate assistantship appointments. Any student failing to obtain the required 3.0 GPA after the probationary period who wishes to be readmitted to Graduate Studies must submit a written academic plan detaili ng how the required GPA can be obtained. The request for readmission must have the support of the graduate faculty in the academic program before being reviewed/considered in Graduate Studies. This request for readmission must be submitted with a new application following the semester of academic probation. Each case will be revi ewed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research for a determination regarding readmission to the desired academic program. If th ey are accepted for readmission to the program, readmitted students will have one full-time semester or the equivalent (9 hours) to remove the academic probation by attaining a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Please note that each program reserves the right to apply more restrictive requirements to graduate students regarding probation and dismissal. Dismissal Graduate students may be dism issed from the program for having failed tw ice the final comprehensive examination for the master's degree. A graduate stude nt may also be dismissed from the gra duate program if the overall GPA, as a graduate student, (including graduate and undergraduate course work) falls be low 3.0 as described in the academic probation section above. Students may also be dismissed from programs for reasons other than failure to maintain a satisfactory grade point average. Expectations regarding student conduct are desc ribed in the Western Kentucky University Student Handbook and apply to students in all programs. Additional program -specific policies regarding student conduct and dismissal from a program for non-academic reasons may also apply. Stude nts should contact their advisors for more information regarding expectations for appropriate student conduct. Repeating a Course A course in which a student has received a passing grade (C or better) may not be repeated for the purpose of raising the grade. If a course is repeated in which a pa ssing grade was received, the course credit(s) will only count once toward the program and both grades w ill be used in calculating the GPA. A c ourse in which a grade of D or F is received must be repeated if the course is used in meeting degree requirements. When the course is repeated, the course credit(s) will only count once toward the program and both grad es are used in calculating th e GPA. If the course is not being used to fulfill degree requirements it may be repeated and both grades are used in computing the overall grade point average. In graduate education, grades are not replaced by repeating courses. Research Tool Grades For those students who choose programs that allow course work in lieu of the foreign language requirement, a minimum grade of B must be attained for the research tool. The research tool is included in the grade point average. Research tool requirements must be met prior to obtai ning admission to candidacy. The research tool should be completed within the first 15 hours of the graduate program. Foreign Language Examination Students may choose to complete the research tool requirement by taking a foreign language examination. The foreign language application must be filed and approved prior to the completion of the ex amination. Applications for the foreign language examination can be obtained in the Graduate Studies and Research office or in the Department of Modern Languages & Intercultural Studies. Admission to Candidacy (Form D) Admission to candidacy is a traditional component of graduate study; the purpose of which is to provide a planned, formal review of the student's progress toward the specifi ed program of study. The review enables the student, in consultation with appropriate University officials, to make warranted change s in the program. Admission to candidacy should be an expression of confidence that the student will (w ith appropriate, continued effort) be able to complete all requirements for the degree. All degree-seeking graduate students must apply for and be admitted to candidacy by submitting an Admission to Candidacy Form (Form D) to th e Office of Graduate Studies. Admission to Graduate Studies and Research and admission to candidacy are two separate procedures. Students seeking master's or specialist degrees should submit a Form D before the completion of 21 credit hours and after completing at least 15 hours of course work and, if 19 applicable, completing the research tool and removing an y deficiencies with a grade of A or B. The Form D MUST be submitted no later than one semester prior to the intended semester of planned degree completion. Failure to meet the filing deadline for the Form D may delay graduation by at least one semester. Students who have not filed a Form D prior to the completi on of 21 hours of course work are subject to a registration hold. This hold will not be removed until the Form D is si gned by the major advisor, and received in the Graduate Studies office. Failure to complete this requirement can delay graduation by at least one semester. Admission to Candidacy requirements: 1. An approved program of study, 2. Removal of any deficiencies or conditions for admission, 3. Attainment of at least a 3.0 grade point average on a ll graduate course work and at least a 3.0 overall GPA at the time of admission to candidacy, 4. Completion of the foreign language examination or research tool as speci fied for the program, and 5. Approval of the major advisor and Dean of Graduate Studies. Note: Master's or specialist degree students who enroll in 12 to 15 hours of course work (applicable to their approved degree programs) during their first semest er should submit their applications for candidacy (Form D) to the Office of Graduate Studies at the end of that semester. Comprehensive Examination All graduate degree programs require that either a written or an oral examination be satisfactorily completed, or that an approved capstone course be successfully completed.

Alternate Route to Principal Certification Kentucky Senate Bill #77 made it possible for higher education institutions with approved school administration certification programs to provide alternate route to certification programs upon application and approval by the Education Professional Standard s Board (EPSB). Western Kentucky University (WKU) has an EPSB approved Alternate Route to Principal Certification program. Under the provisions of Senate Bill #77 and state regulations, Western Kentucky University established procedures for the alternate route program as follows: 1. A local district superintendent must nominate a candidate for the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program at WKU. The letter of nomination must specifically state that the superintendent is recommending the candidate to the school council and will be employed for the coming academic year if selected by the school council. 50 2. Once the letter of nomination and a letter of application from the candidate are received, WKU will admit the candidate to the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program providing the candidate is accepted by Graduate Studies and Research. 3. WKU will provide the candidate with a letter sta ting that the candidate has been admitted to the Alternate Route to Principal Certification pr ogram, thus, under the provision of Senate Bill #77 and state regulations, making the candidate eligible to interview and accept a principal position. It should be noted that these candidates have the same eligibility status as any other candidate who has completed a regular certification program and already has the certification endorsement. 4. WKU will also notify the Office of Teacher Cer tification/Services that the candidate has been admitted to the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program. 5. If the candidate is offered the position, the superintendent must provide verification of employment to WKU and the candidate. WKU will assign the candidate an advisor, who will prepare the student's program. The candidate w ill submit the verification of employment and a TC-1 to the Office of Teacher Certification/ Services. That office will sign and verify the enrollment of the candidate in the Alternate Rout e to Principal Certification program and return the TC-1 to the candidate. The candidate will then forward the TC-1 with the verification of employment as a principal (or assistant principal) and the appropriate fee payment. 6. EPSB will issue the candidate a two-year, Temporary Provisional Certificate for All Grades Principal. The candidate will have two-years to complete all requirements for the principal certification, after which the candidate receives a regular Provisional Certification. Non-degree Certification Programs Principalship\u2014All grades Supervisor of Instruction Director of Special Education Director of Pupil Personnel School Superintendent The Department of Educational Administration, Leadership, and Research offers programs designed to prepare school personnel for effective leadership in P-12 schools. The curricula meet professional certification standards in school administration. Th e department also provides educational foundations courses that give graduate students a greater understa nding of their roles and the function of educational institutions in society. Course work associated with degree programs at Western Kentucky University may be used to meet certification requirements established by the Comm onwealth of Kentucky; however, the Commonwealth may institute changes in certification requirements at any time. When the Commonwealth initiates such changes, students seeking certification may be required to modify their courses/experiences to meet the new certification requirements. Students wishing to pursue one of the non-degr ee programs must make application to Graduate Studies and Research. Upon completion of the program, individuals must contact the Office of Teacher Certification/Services in the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences. That official then certifies to the Kentucky Education Professional Standards Bo ard that rank requirements have been met.

The faculty are highly qualified in their respective disciplines and utilize innovative teaching strategies al ong with state of the art instruc tional technology, in cluding ITV, web enhanced and web based instruction. The disciplines in the college have their roots in outreach to the community. Dental hy giene, communication disorders, consumer and family science, nursing, physical education, public health, recreation and social work prepares students for their profession by engaging them in activities within the community that applies the theories and concepts discussions in the classroom for a more comprehensive understanding of the issues, while providing a valuable service to the communities in which we reside. Students are required to complete clinical experiences, field work, or internships through one of the many affiliation agreements at a myriad of health and humans services facilities, agencies and organizati ons. A nationally recognized mobile health and wellness unit provides opportunities for students to apply skills learned in the classroom in the provision of prevention services to residences in our region. Due to the nature of these experiences students ar e required to meet various depa rtmental academic requirements and federal and/or state mandates. Departments may re quire the successful completion of specific courses or maintain a certain GPA in order to be placed in clinical or inte rnship experiences. Some students may be required to undergo criminal background checks and drug testing and to pr ovide proof of health insu rance, liability insurance, and/or immunization records prior to participating in any required experiences at selected off-campus facilities/agencies. Additionally, there may be certifications , training seminars, or other requirements specified by the facility/agency that a student must meet in order to be e ligible for field or practical experiences at the facility. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that all institutional and/or f acility requirements are met as a condition of participating in the on or off-campus experiences; students may be responsible in part or in full for any costs incurred to meet such requirements. Students are also responsible for transportation to and from off-campus experiences. CHHS is dedicated to improve the quality of life in the community through educa tion, service, collaboration, leadership, and scholarship.

Glaser Master of Arts in English, Ref. # 067 The master's program prepares students for teach ing in high school or college , for continuing graduate work toward a doctorate in English, or for many other careers that involve strong communication skills. The MA in English can be taken with a concentr ation in literature, creative writing, rhetoric and composition, teaching, or TESL. All five options may lead to Rank II/I for secondary teachers. In addition to Graduate Studies requirements, admission to a concentration in literature or teaching requires 27 hours of undergraduate English with a GPA of 3.0 or better. Admission requirements for the creative writing, rhetoric and composition, and TESL concentrations include a minimum of four undergraduate English courses beyond general education requirements, at least two being upper-level literature courses, with a GPA of 3.0 or better. A satisfactory writing sample is required for the creative writing option. A thesis is mandatory in the creative writing specialization but optional in the others. Those students seeking Rank II or Rank I certification for Grades 8-12 must possess a secondary school teaching certificate and must include a copy with the application for admission. All students in the MA program take Englis h 520 (which should be taken in the first semester of graduate study), 6 hours of American literature, and 6 hours of British literature. Literature specialists also take a non-literature elective and an additional 12 hours of literature or 6 hours of literature and 6 hours of thesis credit. TESL specialists take 565, 556, 407G, 408G, and an elective. Creative writing specialists take 501, a 3-hour writing elective, a 3-hour electiv e, and write a creative thesis. Rhetoric and Composition specialists take 412G and 12 hours of wr iting classes or 6 hours and a thesis. Teaching track specialists take 3 hours of English composition, SEC 580, EDU 544, PSY 510 or 511, and a 3-hour elective in the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences. All specializations include a research tool requi rement, which the student may satisfy by demonstrating reading proficiency in a foreign language or by completing English 520. If English 520 is designated as the research tool, it may not be included in the 30 credit hours required for the degree, and students must take an additional 3 hours for a total of 33 hours. An examination over the course work, related mate rials, and thesis (if there is one) must be completed. Rank II/I candidates also present a portfolio at the time of the examination. Early in the graduate program, the student should obtain from the English graduate advi sor a copy of the Reading List for the MA oral examination.

Brady, M. Williams Associate Professors: D. Applegate, T. Evans, J. Njoku Assistant Professors: C. Antonsen, K. Dowell, K. Hudepohl Master of Arts in Folk Studies, Ref. # 069 The study of folklore and folklife involv es examination and analysis of traditional expressive culture in all its forms including verbal, musical, material, and customary. In every society, agricultural and industrial, rural and urban, folklore is a vital part of life. The discipline has close affinities with literature, anthropology, sociology , history, geography, linguistics, philosophy, ethnomusicology, and psychology. Adequate undergraduate preparation in any of these disciplines will be acceptable for admission to graduate study in folk studies. The student with a GPA below 3.0 will be asked to submit three lette rs of recommendation prior to consideration for admission. Plan A (Thesis Option) This option provides advanced knowledge of the theoretical and methodological aspects of folklore and folklife. Course work will emphasi ze the history of the discipline, field research techniques, and surveys of various folklore genr es. It is designed to prepare students for both academic and public sector professions and for further academic research. Plan A requires a minimum of 36 hours plus the research tool. Specific requirements are FLK 577, 578, 569 (must be taken in the first year); three of the following genre courses: FLK 561, 571, 575, 576; 12-15 hours of electives selected with advisor's approval (hours depend on whether FLK 578 is used as the research tool); and six thesis hours (FLK 599). The research tool requirement may be met by demonstrating proficie ncy in a foreign language or by completing FLK 578 and taking an additional fo lklore course. The student must also pass a comprehensive written examination based on course work and a program reading list. Plan B (Public Folklore Option) This option requires additional course work rather than thesis writing. It also permits individually planned programs (with advisor) st ressing those combinations of course-related research, \"hands on\" skills, and writing experiences that will best prepare individuals for their personal and professional goals. Plan B requires 36 hours of course work plus the research tool. Specific requirements include FLK 569, 577, and 578 (to be taken in the student's first year); and three of the following core courses: FLK 561, 571, 575 or 576. In addition, FLK 562, 572, 589, and 9-12 hours of electives are required. Electives may be chosen from the following: FLK 462G, 470G, 560, or other electives chosen with the advisor's approval (hours depend on whether FLK 578 is used as the research tool). The research tool requirements are the same as for Plans A and C. The student must also pass a comprehensive written examination based on c ourse work and a program reading list, and submit a portfolio of professional-level work for the degree. 133 Plan C (Historic Preservation Option) While firmly grounded in the folk studies curriculum, the historic preservation option introduces students to the multiple facets of historic preservation and cultural conservation theory and practice. Internships with a variety of lo cal, regional, and national institutions will also provide opportunity for practical work experience in historic preservation. Plan C requires a minimum of 36 hours of course work plus the research tool. Specific requirements are FLK 569, 577, 578 (to be taken in the first year); and three of the following genre courses: FLK 561, 571, 575, 576. In addition, 470G, 464G, and 560 are required. The student must select 9-12 hours of preservation electives chosen with the advisor's approval (hours depend on whether FLK 578 is used as the research tool). The research tool requirements, the written examination, and the portfolio are the same as for Plan B. Master of Arts in Education, Folk Studies minor, Ref. # 009 This program is designed to enrich t eaching content in the public schools in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, and to broaden the teacher's general education background. Admission requirements are the same as for the Master of Arts in Folk Studies. The Folk Studies minor requires a minimum of 12 hours in folk lore, including Folk Studies 577 and 578 and two folklore electives. One course from a related discipline may be substituted for one folklore elective. Graduate Courses in Folk Studies All courses worth 3 credits unless otherwise noted.

Completion of the MA in Sociology will prepare graduates for positions in public or private agencies and give thorough preparation for teaching and for advanced study at the doctoral leve l. The course of study includes training in general sociological theory, social research methods, statistics, and professional writing. Additional academic training is provided in substantive areas as well as through directed study. Admission to the program requires a GAP score of at least 2200 (GAP = GRE verbal and quantitative scores combined times the undergraduate grade point av erage). Students desiring to earn assistantships must have a GAP score of at least 2700. Also, a minimum score of 3.5 on the analytical writing section of the GRE is expected for both admission and an assi stantship. In addition, preference is given to students who have completed the required courses for a sociology major or minor (Introductory Sociology, Using Statistics in Sociology, Strategies of Social Research, and Sociological Theory) with an average grade of B or better. Interested students should send applications for admission, GRE scores, and transcripts to the Office of Graduate Studies. Students seeking assistantships should also include applications for assistantships and three letters of recommendation. Acceptance is comp etitive, but some advantage is usually gained by early applicants. The Sociology MA program is comprised of a thesis and a non-thesis option. Both options require the following courses: SOCL 510 Qualitative Research Methods SOCL 512 Sociological Theory SOCL 513 Quantitative Research Methods SOCL 514 Advanced Social Statistics The 30-hour thesis option consists of 24 hours of course work (12 hours in the required courses listed above and 12 hours in elective courses), and 6 hours of thesis credit (SOCL 599). In addition, the research tool requirement must be completed. The non-thesis option consists of 36 hours of course work (12 hours in the required courses listed above and 24 hours in elective courses). In addition, the research tool requirement must be completed. Students selecting this option also must pass a comprehensive examination during their final semester. In both options three hours of credit may be take n in a 400-level course with a graduate designation, in SOCL 595 (Directed Study), or in a graduate cour se in a related field outside the Department of Sociology. To receive credit for more than one of these courses listed in this paragraph the student must receive advance approval from the graduate advisor. The department offers two courses (SOCL 500: Seminar in Teaching and SOCL 501: Practicum in Teaching) for those students interested in teaching. Students who have completed 18 graduate hours including SOCL 500 can be designated Graduate Teachi ng Associates and become eligible to teach their 141 own sections of Introductory Sociology while taking SOCL 501. The research tool requirement may be met by either passing a foreign language examination that demonstrates reading proficiency in a foreign language or earning a grade of B or better in SOCL 520, Professional Research and Writing in Sociology. If the r esearch tool requirement is satisfied by a foreign language exam, SOCL 520 may be used as an elective course in the graduate program.
