What is Homeopathy? Homeopathy is the most affordable, effective and safe system of medicine which is based on the principles of Nature discovered by Dr. Sameul Hahnemann in the year 1796. - Law of Similars: According to this law, that substance which causes a disease in humans can also remove those effects. - Law of Simplex: This law implies that the cure of a disease should be by using a simple or single medicine because, the effects of only one substance are proved on healthy human beings at a time and mixing two or more medicines will results in complication. - Law of Minimum: According to this law minimal amount of a medicine possesses sufficient energy to start the healing process. In other words the medicine should contain minimum matter and more energy. - Doctrine of Drug Proving: Homeopathic drugs are proved on healthy human beings irrespective of age, gender and region and all the changes are documented pertaining to physical, general and mental planes. - Theory of Chronic Disease: According to this theory Dr. Hahnemann has proved that if a disease or ailment is recurrently affecting an individual, it is because of a force within the body which he called as 'miasm'. The cure of such chronic diseases can be achieved by administering a proper anti-miasmatic drug will cure the disease permanently. - Theory of Vital Force: Dr. Hahnemann theorized that \"The material organism without the 'vital force' is capable of no sensation, no function, no self-preservation; it derives all sensations, and performs all functions of life solely by means of thi immaterial being the vital force which animates the material organism in health and disease\". - Doctrine of Drug Dynamisation: Dr. Hahnemann envisaged that while chemical matter has physical properties capable of producing a limited curative power and also unwanted side effects, it's dilution and potentisation can bring about more curity power with no side effects.
