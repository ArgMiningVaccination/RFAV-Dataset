The global market is moving more and more towards products of natural origin. Indeed, of the 4200-existing plant in Morocco, 800 are listed as aromatic and medicinal plants. Among these plants, saffron is a source of income for many areas of Morocco. Saffron, the dried stigma of the Crocus sativus flower, is considered among the main terroir products of Morocco. Saffron has accompanied all civilizations, whether for its culinary role, for its quality of dye or its ancestral virtues rooted in folk medicine. This review highlights the main components of saffron, and the pharmacological activities that result from it and make this product a serious therapeutic hope. Then, a classification of uses of saffron was carried out according to its uses, traditional, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and perfumery without forgetting its use a spice incorporated in many dishes around the world.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-10-25", "cleaned_text": "Traditional and Modern Uses of Saffron (Crocus Sativus) [https://doi.org/10.3390/cosmetics6040063](https://doi.org/10.3390/cosmetics6040063) [Cosmetopoeia, from the Traditional to and domestication of saffron: Vavilov indicates that its origin is the Middle East, while other authors suggest Central Asia or the islands of south-west Greece [ [2](#B2-cosmetics-06-00063)]. From this primary zone, it would have spread to India, China and Middle East countries. Found from these latter countries, the Arabs spread saffron throughout the Mediterranean basin [ [3](#B3-cosmetics-06-00063)], such as in Morocco, where it was most likely introduced by the 9th century [ [4](#B4-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Currently, the region of Taliouine provides bulbs and saffron, but in the recent years its culture has spread to new parts of the country: such as Elhaouz, Oulmes, Boulmen, Chefchaouen, and Midelt [ [5](#B5-cosmetics-06-00063)]. In 2015, the saffron plantation in Morocco was conducted in a surface area of around 1600 ha with an average yield of 3.5 t, making Morocco the fourth largest saffron producer in the world [ [6](#B6-cosmetics-06-00063)]. The conduct of its cultivation differs from one zone to another according to the climatic and edaphic conditions, and cultural techniques. Its water needs are relatively average (400 to 600 mm/year). The economic impact of saffron is important because of its high price, as it presents a strong added value. In addition to its economic importance, its importance is also in the agronomic, environmental and social domain. This crop mobilizes a large workforce\u2014especially female\u2014during the period of harvesting and pruning saffron. The production of one kilogram of saffron requires 150,000 to 200,000 flowers and about 400 hours of work. This discussion paper will describe the current understanding of the therapeutic properties of saffron, their relationship with the various phytochemicals commonly found in this gold spice, and the other different uses of this spice that give it particular renown, especially in the cosmetics field, where there are not many published reports documenting the use of this spice. 2. History and Genetic Origin [7](#B7-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Concerning the origin and domestication of saffron: Vavilov indicates that its origin is the Middle East (1951), while other authors suggest Central Asia or the islands of south-west Greece [ [2](#B2-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Negbi [ [8](#B8-cosmetics-06-00063)] proves as well that Crocus sativus was most likely selected and domesticated in Crete during the Bronze Age. From this primary zone, it would have spread to India, China and to the countries of the Middle East and it is from these last countries that the Arabs spread saffron throughout the Mediterranean basin [ [3](#B3-cosmetics-06-00063)], as in Morocco, where it was most likely introduced in the 9th century [ [9](#B9-cosmetics-06-00063)]. [10](#B10-cosmetics-06-00063)]. RADP analysis (random amplification of polymorphic DNA) carried out by Caiola et al. [ [11](#B11-cosmetics-06-00063)] to search for putative ancestors of C. sativus showed that C. cartwrightianus is the closest related species to C. sativus, followed by C. thomasii. AFLP analysis (amplified DNA fragment length polymorphisms) confirmed that the quantitative and qualitative DNA traits of both C.cartwrightianus and C. thomasii species are compatible with those of C. sativus [ [12](#B12-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 3. Botanical Description [Figure 1](#cosmetics-06-00063-f001)A) reaches 10 to 25 cm in height developing from its bulbs. The bulb, of sub-ovoid shape, is of variable size and forms. It has a massive structure and is covered by many concentric spathes. Each mother bulb produces from apical buds one to three large daughter bulbs and several small bulbs from lateral buds [ [12](#B12-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Saffron has two types of roots: fibrous and thin roots at the base of the mother bulb, and contractile roots formed at the base of the lateral buds [ [13](#B13-cosmetics-06-00063)] ( [Figure 1](#cosmetics-06-00063-f001)B). The leaves vary from five to 11 per bud ( [Figure 1](#cosmetics-06-00063-f001)C). They are very narrow and measure between 1.5 and 2.5 mm of dark green color. They measure 20 to 60 cm in length with a whitish band in the inner part and a rib on the outside. [Figure 1](#cosmetics-06-00063-f001)C). At their appearance, the flowers are protected by whitish membranous bracts. The pistil is composed of an inferior ovary from which a thin style, 9 to 10 cm long, arises. The style ends with a single stigma composed of three filaments of intense red color whose length exceeds that of the tepals, which are the part of the plant interesting for the man from the point of view of culture [ [14](#B14-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 4. Main Phytochemical Components of Saffron [15](#B15-cosmetics-06-00063)]. The three main biologically active compounds are ( [Figure 2](#cosmetics-06-00063-f002)): - (1) - Crocin, a carotenoid pigment responsible for the yellow-orange color of the spice; - (2) - Picrocrocin, bringing saffron flavor and bitter taste; - (3) - Safranal, a volatile compound responsible for the aroma and smell so specific to saffron. [16](#B16-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Safranal (C10H14O), responsible for the aroma (it accounts for 70% of the volatile fraction), has little or no presence in fresh stigmas, its concentration depends on the conditions of drying and preservation of saffron [ [17](#B17-cosmetics-06-00063)]. [15](#B15-cosmetics-06-00063)]. It also has many non-volatile active components, many of which are carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various - and -carotenes. The volatiles, which have a very strong odor, are consistent of more than 34 components, which are mainly terpenes, terpene alcohols, and their esters [ [18](#B18-cosmetics-06-00063)]. [19](#B19-cosmetics-06-00063)]. The chemical composition of saffron samples from many countries indicates that the reported values strongly depend on the methods used for drying, extraction and stigma analysis [ [20](#B20-cosmetics-06-00063), [21](#B21-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Many methods of analyzing saffron components have been described [ [22](#B22-cosmetics-06-00063)]. The quality of saffron is thus regulated by ISO 3632 standards, aimed at standardizing the classification of saffron worldwide; these are updated every three years. 5. Cosmetology and Perfumery Uses of Saffron [23](#B23-cosmetics-06-00063), [24](#B24-cosmetics-06-00063)]. In another category, Hindu women used saffron to make the bindi, the yellow dot on the forehead. It is, in a way, a third eye symbolizing good fortune and conscience [ [25](#B25-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Nowadays, saffron tepals have been studied in several studies as being rich in crocin and kaempferol, thus representing an important source of bioactive compounds for potential cosmetic formulations [ [26](#B26-cosmetics-06-00063), [27](#B27-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Beside the antioxidant properties, saffron presents multiple interests for cosmetic applications. The most promising activities are listed hereafter. 5.1. Anti-UV Agent [28](#B28-cosmetics-06-00063), [29](#B29-cosmetics-06-00063)]. In addition to the antisolar and moisturizing properties of saffron, the prevention of skin cancers by saffron because of its antioxidant properties is important as well [ [30](#B30-cosmetics-06-00063), [31](#B31-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 5.2. Redness of Dark Spots [32](#B32-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Melanocytes produce melanin in skin as a mixture of two pigments eumelanin and phaeomelanin, which are (brown black) and (red yellow) respectively [ [33](#B33-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Melanogenesis is accomplished by a series of oxidative reactions controlled by various enzymes. Tyrosinase is the main catalyst for this phenomenon [ [34](#B34-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Antioxidant activity is mainly exhibited by monoterpenoids, crocin, quercetin, kaempferol, and by other phenolic components of C. sativus. The mode of action of these compounds to reduce skin melanin is by inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase [ [35](#B35-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 5.3. Anti-Aging Effect and Diseases of the Skin [36](#B36-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 5.4. Perfumery [37](#B37-cosmetics-06-00063)]. It is from safranal, which is the main odoriferous compound of saffron that we obtain the note \"saffron\". In ancient Greece (around 2000 to 146 BC), saffron was a royal dye and was used as a perfume in salons, courts, theaters and bathrooms. Later, its use spread among ordinary people [ [38](#B38-cosmetics-06-00063), [39](#B39-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Additionally, during the Parthian Dynasty, they used saffron among the ingredients of a royal scent, which included a refreshing oil facial for kings and ritual leaders [ [40](#B40-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Today, we find this woody, sweet note and harmonious in the composition of different perfumes both feminine and masculine, with an original and exotic potential. 5.5. Saffron as Natural Pigments in Cosmetics [41](#B41-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6. Pharmacological Study of Saffron 6.1. Antidepressant [42](#B42-cosmetics-06-00063)]. It is predicted that by 2020 this will be the second leading cause of overall disability. Similar to standard antidepressants, saffron can exert its antidepressant effect by modulating the level of certain chemicals in the brain, including serotonin. Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine, is a mood-elevating neurotransmitter synthesized from tryptophan [ [43](#B43-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Although not appearing as a medicinal herb used traditionally, crocus petals are significantly less expensive than stigmas, prompting researchers to examine their potential in treating depression. Thus, a trial comparing the efficacy of petals and stigmas suggests that they are equally effective in the treatment of mild to moderate depression [ [44](#B44-cosmetics-06-00063), [45](#B45-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6.2. Treating Sexual Dysfunction [46](#B46-cosmetics-06-00063)]. The aphrodisiac activities of the aqueous extract of stigmas of C. sativus and its constituents, safranal, and crocin, were evaluated. It appears that saffron can, without risk, effectively combat certain fluoxetine-induced sexual disorders in women such as excitement, lubrication, or pain [ [47](#B47-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Saffron has shown a positive effect on sexual function with an increase in the number and duration of erections in patients with erectile dysfunction-even after treatment for only 10 days [ [48](#B48-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6.3. Antioxidant [49](#B49-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Other studies focused on the negative effects of oxidative stress on our brain, since it is the organ most exposed to oxidation, due to the high phospholipid content of neuronal membranes and the existing link with development of neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, whose treatment with saffron can prevent the aggregation and deposition of amyloid peptide in the human brain and can, therefore, be useful in Alzheimer's disease [ [50](#B50-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6.4. Anticarcinogenic [51](#B51-cosmetics-06-00063), [52](#B52-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Abdullayev et al. found that occurring saffron extract\u2014in combination with two synthetic compounds\u2014sodium selenite or sodium arsenite, may have a synergistic effect with saffron and may, therefore, have an important role in cancer chemo prevention [ [53](#B53-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Likewise, Botsoglou [ [54](#B54-cosmetics-06-00063)] demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of saffron against different malignant cells was dose dependent as well. Saffron pretreatment for five consecutive days prior to the administration of anti-tumor drugs, including cisplatin, significantly inhibited anti-tumor drug induced cellular DNA damage [ [55](#B55-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6.5. Antispasmodic and Digestive Tonic [56](#B56-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Safranal normalized gastric volume and pH, reduced the surface of gastric ulcer and produced gastric protection. In addition, it was able to improve the histological changes induced by indomethacin and the biochemical alterations of tissues [ [57](#B57-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6.6. Anti-Inflammatory and Analgesic Effect [58](#B58-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Extracts and tinctures of saffron have been used to treat fever, wounds, lower back pain, abscesses, and gingivitis as well as pain related to the eruption of the first teeth in infants [ [56](#B56-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Aqueous and alcoholic extracts of stigmas and saffron petals have an antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity for both acute and chronic pain [ [59](#B59-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6.7. Effect on Cholesterol Levels [60](#B60-cosmetics-06-00063)]. The hypolipidemic effect of crocin is attributed to the inhibition of pancreatic lipase, thus limiting the absorption of fats and cholesterol [ [61](#B61-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Previous studies have concluded that saffron has shown anti-obesity and anorectic effects in obese rat models. This thanks to its effect on the reduction of caloric intake by blocking the digestion of dietary fats via the inhibition of pancreatic lipase; the feeling of satiety due to the increased level of neurotransmitters without forgetting its role in the improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism, [ [62](#B62-cosmetics-06-00063)]. In addition, crocin has shown a significant decrease in the rate of body weight gain, total fat deposition, and regulates the weight ratio of body fat to the epididymis [ [63](#B63-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6.8. Effect on Blood Glucose and Insulin Resistance [59](#B59-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6.9. Healing of Second-Degree Burns [64](#B64-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 6.10. Effects on the Eyes [65](#B65-cosmetics-06-00063), [66](#B66-cosmetics-06-00063)]. The kohl pencil was used in Egyptian antiquity. It is still used today to make eyes black. In fact, oriental women used it to protect themselves from attacks related to the sun, the wind, the sand and possibly ocular infections as well. Kohl was, in fact, a very fine powder obtained by grinding cloves, rosewood, saffron, and antimony [ [62](#B62-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Current investigations show that saffron extract can reduce eye diseases such as cataracts [ [67](#B67-cosmetics-06-00063)], retinal degeneration [ [68](#B68-cosmetics-06-00063)], light-mediated photoreceptor cell death [ [69](#B69-cosmetics-06-00063)], and improves blood circulation and retinal function [ [70](#B70-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 7. Other Uses of Saffron 7.1. Culinary Use [71](#B71-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Saffron is used in India, Iran, Spain and other countries as a condiment for rice. In Spanish cuisine, it is used in many dishes such as Paella Valenciana, a specialty made from rice, and zarzuela, made from fish. Saffron is also used in French bouillabaisse, a spicy fish soup, Italian Milanese risotto and saffron cake. Iranians use saffron in their national dish\u2014chelow kabab. Indian cuisine uses saffron in its biryanis, traditional dishes made from rice. It is also used in some candies such as gulabjaman and kulfi [ [72](#B72-cosmetics-06-00063)]. In Morocco, saffron is used in tea instead of mint, but also as a spice in the preparation of various traditional dishes including koftas (meatballs and tomatoes) or mrouzia (a sweet-salty dish made from mutton or dill). Saffron is also a central ingredient in the blend of chermoula herbs that perfume many Moroccan dishes [ [73](#B73-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 7.2. Coloring Power [74](#B74-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Thus, the powerful dyeing power of saffron\u2014which could also be used in cosmetic\u2014has been used for a long time to color butter, pasta, cheeses, and oleomargarines. The golden yellow color of saffron is used in painting, textiles. The saffron solutions remain largely stable in alkaline and acidic medium. This property is due to crocin pKa (acid dissociation constant), dicarboxylic acids, esters, and nitrogen Saffron buffers solutions reduce the oxidation of cellulose. Saffron continues to dye the clothes of Buddhist monks, silk, wool, and Oriental carpets. Natural dyes have better biodegradability and compatibility with the environment, lower toxicity and less allergenic than some of the synthetic dyes. 8. Safety and Toxicity Considerations [75](#B75-cosmetics-06-00063)]. Nevertheless, it is not toxic when administered orally with an LD 50 greater than 5 g/kg. Although ingestion of less than 1.5 g of saffron is not toxic to humans, it is considered toxic when ingested in doses greater than 5 g and can be fatal if it is taken at about 20 g/day. Slight toxicity with saffron causes dizziness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, whereas more severe toxicity may cause numbness, tingling in the hands and feet and yellowish skin and eyes due to precipitation of yellow pigments on the skin and the conjunctiva. Spontaneous bleeding can also be a symptom [ [76](#B76-cosmetics-06-00063)]. 9. Conclusions Author Contributions Funding Acknowledgments Conflicts of Interest References - Algrech, C.
