I was surprised at how much better I felt after just one treatment. I began going to Holistic Natural Medicine at the suggestion of my chiropractor after If shared the latest set of symptoms I'd been having, for which my doctors didn't offer much explanation or treatment. This was my first experience with acupuncture, and it couldn't have been better! Erika always takes the time to listen to me and explains what she is doing and why. She has also given me some concrete steps that I can take to help resolve my issues. I'm always greeted with a friendly smile at the office and am always made to feel comfortable. I highly recommend Holistic Natural Medicine! - 5/26/2021 Whatever you do avoid this establishment. I felt 0 % better when leaving here but they some how managed to turn a 25$ co pay into a 100$ visit and lying to me when authorizing my credit card. They told me the visit would be 25$s when they took my card for a co pay. They then decided to charge me 80$s without my knowledge or concent. This is illegal and an extreme misconception. Avoid this establishment! - 1/29/2021 I had a very positive visit with Erika today! She was quite thorough and very good at what she does. She could tell many things about my body without me even telling her. The treatment I got while I was there already made a notable difference! She definitely released some tension from my left side especially my upper back/shoulder area. Please is clean and welcoming. My only complaint is that because it went so well the appointment seemed to go by so fast! I was just soaking it all in. Everything was so interesting and I had so many questions lol but I'll I look forward to learning more on future visits. - 10/21/2020 Erika is amazing at her work: smart and wise. Drawing upon deep knowledge to help the body repair. Thank you! - 1/5/2019 Erika has helped me in ways I didn't think were possible. After suffering for countless years with stomach problems and seeing numerous specialists to help, I thought I was stuck with a bad gut for life. I found Holistic Natural Medicine and have never felt better. Erika takes her time with her patients and listens to what their problems are. Most importantly she suggests changes to implement throughout my life to help me heal. After going to her regularly I am off of all medications I was previously taking and feel better than ever before. I highly recommend seeing her. I tell all my family and friends about her because I truly believe in what she does and the results I have had are amazing. - 4/1/2016First to Review I never went in here, but I did try. They seem awfully disorganized and won't set an appointment with you until they have all of your insurance information. I gave everything and they said I'd hear back in 48 hours. I waited a week and a half, called back, they have no idea what I'm talking about. I'm not sure if this is even a real place, google maps shows it as a little house. So I give them one star for being disorganized, wasting my time and not putting customer service by any means first. - 5/6/2016 I have been seeing Erica for a little over a year and so thankful I took the step to make an appointment with her. I went to see her for a few different things; anxiety, sinus issues, a ovarian cyst just to name a few. My cyst went way down in size, my sinuses have been so much better and I had chronic sinus issues and now won't be getting the surgery and the anxiety has dramatically improved! I cannot say enough good things about Erica, she treats the whole person and takes time to get to know you. I have seen other acupuncturist in the area and felt uncomfortable because there was lack of privacy and you could hear everything going on with the other patients. In her office that has never been the case, it's total privacy. I recommend Erica to my family and friends! - 4/26/2016 I first was treated by Erika several summers ago. She had been helping my wife for over a year. I was suffering from a pulled shoulder muscle/pinched nerve, and had been taking massive doses of aspirin and ibuprofen to deal with the constant pain. I also consulted my 'real' doctor and also tried massage therapy. Nothing worked. Then my wife persuaded me to permit Erika to try to help me. She's fantastic! She used a combination of acupuncture and localized massage and it worked. Fifteen months after the initial injury, the pain finally disappeared. I am pain-free and ever so grateful. I must admit that I was a true skeptic of natural medicine, but am now a confirmed believer.
