It has been approved for use in 71 countries with a total population of 4 billion people. The vaccine is named after the first Soviet space satellite. The launch of Sputnik-1 in 1957 reinvigorated space research around the world, creating a so called \"Sputnik moment\" for the global community. The vaccine's efficacy is 97.6%, based on the analysis of data on the incidence of coronavirus among Russians vaccinated with both vaccine components between December 5, 2020 and March 31, 2021. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for the vaccine were completed on August 1, 2020. The Phase 3 clinical trial results were published in Russia in the Lancet magazine on February 2, 2021. Phase 3 clinical trials of Sputnik V have also been successful in the UAE, India, Venezuela and Belarus. The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a proven well-studied human adenovirus vector platform; these vectors cause the common cold and have plagued humanity for millennia. Sputnik V was the first coronavirus vaccine to use a heterogeneous boosting approach based on 2 different vectors for 2 vaccine shots. This approach generates a more sustainable immunity compared to vaccines that use the same delivery mechanism for both shots. The safety, efficacy and lack of long-term adverse effects of adenovirus vaccines have been proven in more than 250 clinical trials over two decades. Sputnik V does not cause severe allergies. A storage temperature of +2...+8 \u00b0C allows the vaccine to be stored in a regular refrigerator without the need to invest in additional cold chain infrastructure. Sputnik V is effective against new strains of coronavirus, according to a study by the Gamaleya Research Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology published in the leading international magazine Vaccines. The vaccine produces protective neutralising antibody titres against new strains, including Alpha B.1.1.7 (first identified in the UK), Beta B.1.351 (first identified in South Africa), Gamma P.1 (first identified in Brazil), Delta B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3 (first identified in India) and variants B.1.1.141 and B.1.1.317 with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) identified in Moscow. Preliminary laboratory study by the Gamaleya Center shows that Sputnik V demonstrates high virus neutralizing activity against Omicron variant and is expected to protect against severe cases and hospitalizations. Sputnik V has demonstrated 3-7x less of a reduction in virus neutralizing activity against Omicron as compared to data from other leading vaccines. Ministry of Health Registration Certificate \"Vectors\" are vehicles, which can induce a genetic material from another virus into a cell. The gene from adenovirus, which causes the infection, is removed while a gene with the code of a protein from another virus spike is inserted. This inserted element is safe for the body but still helps the immune system to react and produce antibodies, which protect us from the infection. The technological platform of adenovirus-based vectors makes it easier and faster to create new vaccines through modifying the initial carrier vector with genetic material from new emerging viruses that helps to create new vaccines in relatively short time. Such vaccines provoke a strong response from a human immune system. Human adenoviruses are considered as some of the easiest to engineer in this way and therefore they have become very popular as vectors. Learn more about how adenovirus-based vector vaccines work Learn more about the successful experience of the Gamaleya Center on the development of vaccines against Ebola based on an adenovirus vector After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic Russian researchers extracted a fragment of genetic material from novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2, which codes information about the structure of the spike S-protein, which forms the virus' \"crown\" and is responsible for connection with human cells. They inserted it into a familiar adenovirus vector for delivery into a human cell creating the world's first COVID-19 vaccine. In order to ensure lasting immunity Russian scientists came up with a breakthrough idea to use two different types of adenovirus vectors (rAd26 and rAd5) for the first and second vaccination, boosting the effect of the vaccine. The use of human adenoviruses as vectors is safe because these viruses, which cause the common cold, are not novel and have been around for thousands of years. Efficacy of Sputnik V against COVID-19 was reported at 91.6%. The figure is based on the analysis of data on 19,866 volunteers, who received both the first and second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine or placebo at the final control point of 78 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Sputnik V's efficacy was validated by internationally peer reviewed data published in The Lancet. On 12.07.2021, a study on the efficacy of Sputnik V against new strains of coronavirus was published in the leading international magazine Vaccines by the Gamaleya Research Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology. The vaccine produces protective neutralising antibody titres against new strains including Alpha B.1.1.7 (first identified in the UK), Beta B.1.351 (first identified in South Africa), Gamma P.1 (first identified in Brazil), Delta B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3 (first identified in India) and variants B.1.1.141 and B.1.1.317 with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) identified in Moscow. The study methodology was based on assessing the viral neutralising activity (VNA) using live virus, which provides the most reliable data and is the accepted standard. The study compared the VNA of human serum after vaccination with Sputnik V on global strain samples with the VNA against the original strain B.1.1.1. Serum was sampled from individuals immunised with both components of Sputnik V. The data obtained demonstrate that Sputnik V retains its protective properties against new strains. The reduction in viral neutralising activity of Sputnik V against a number of strains was significantly lower compared to data published by manufacturers of other vaccines that earlier confirmed their efficacy against new coronavirus mutations.
