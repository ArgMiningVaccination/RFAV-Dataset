As a practitioner of \"Chang Sen Xue,\" or \"Longevitology,\" Zhang directs the flow of energy through one's body to specific organs to improve the body's ability to heal itself. \"This is not a religion or politics or meditation. It is based on the principle of controlling Qi or Chi, the energy that flows to the organs of the body for good health,\" Zhang said. This particular Chinese medical practice originated in Tibet and is based on the concept of chakras. \"Just as a healthy body draws oxygen from the lungs to breathe, it also draws in universal energy to replenish itself. It does so through points on the body, the neural plexus called chakras. Chakras are the body's power centers, energizing cells and organs so they can function,\" according to literature provided by Longevitology. The driving force is magnetism. Longevitology followers believe that the universe is a gigantic magnetic field and that a person is a small magnetic field. When the energy fields are in balance, people are healthy; when they are unbalanced, people fall ill. A person trained in Longevitology can serve as a \"medium\" who is able to transfer the universal energy to a person's magnetic field and bring it back in balance again. Zhang, 43, has been practicing this alternative therapy for one year. \"Before I became an advanced student and then a graduate, I suffered from asthma attacks and was on eight different kinds of medication. Now, I can control my health better and have had no attacks,\" she said. She gave a demonstration of using chakras. She placed her hand on her head. She closed her eyes, and for five minutes, remained absolutely motionless. One could not even hear her breathe. \"I am adjusting chakra 7 which controls the brain and nervous system. I can tell by touch whether a person's chakras are in balance or not. If they feel cold to me, then they are out of balance,\" she said. Zhang said Longevitology is based in Taiwan and is a nonprofit organization. \"We are all volunteers. The classes are free. We do not charge fees,\" she said. Zhang, who is a consultant for a high-tech company, has lived in Westford for 10 years. She is married to Minda Zhang, a digital platform security manager. They have two daughters: Mindy, 16, and Mandy, 13. Zhang is organizing a beginner's alternative healing class Sept. 12-14 at St. Mark's Episcopal Church. The Sept, 12 and Sept. 14 beginner classes will be held from 7 - 10 p.m. The Sept. 13 class will be held from 2 -to 5 p.m. From Sept. 15 through Sept. 17, from 7 to 10 p.m., an intermediate class will be held at the Westford Regency. Tzu-Chen Lin, a master teacher from Taiwan, will teach the classes. For more information about the classes, call Zhang "}
