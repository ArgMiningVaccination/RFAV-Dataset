Articles published between 24 January 2020 and 30 May 2021 were retrieved via a PubMed and EMBASE search. A total of 12 reports on phase-3 clinical trials and observational studies of COVID-19 vaccines were included in the review. In terms of vaccine safety, mRNA vaccines showed more relevance to serious adverse events than viral vector and inactivated vaccines, but no solid evidence indicated that COVID-19 vaccines directly caused serious adverse events. Serious metabolic, musculoskeletal, immune-system, and renal disorders were more common among inactivated vaccine recipients, and serious gastrointestinal complications and infections were more common among viral vector and inactivated vaccine recipients. The occurrence of serious vessel disorders was more frequent in mRNA vaccines. In terms of efficacy, two mRNA vaccine doses conferred a lesser risk of SARS-COV-2 infection (odds ratio: 0.05; 95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.13) than did vaccination with viral vector and inactivated vaccines. All vaccines protected more against symptomatic than asymptomatic cases (risk ratio, 0.11 vs. 0.34), but reduced the risk of severe SARS-COV-2 infection. The COVID-19 vaccines assessed in this study are sufficiently safe and effective. The results indicate that two mRNA vaccine doses prevent SARS-COV-2 infection most effectively, but further research is needed due to the high degree of heterogeneity among studies in this sample. Interventions should be implemented continuously to reduce the risks of infection after one vaccine dose and asymptomatic infection.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-09-04", "cleaned_text": "Safety and Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Different Vaccines at Phase 3 [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090989](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090989) [COVID-19 Vaccines and Vaccination]( /journal/vaccines/topical_collections/cvdv_vaccines )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00989)]. Common manifestations of COVID-19 include cough, fever or chills, and shortness of breath, making these diseases difficult to distinguish from influenza [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00989)]. Compared with SARS, MERS and influenza, COVID-19 is transmitted more easily from human to human through droplets and has a higher infection rate, but a lower mortality rate [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00989)]. Given these properties, it spread from its origin to other regions and countries at unexpected speed, causing a global pandemic. Currently, more than 100 million people have been infected globally, and about 2.9 million deaths have been registered globally; this disease has posed an enormous challenge to health systems worldwide [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00989)]. Infection control measures, such as wearing masks, the suspension of public gatherings, school closures, and travel restrictions, remain the mainstays of prevention, although they have seriously impacted daily life and the global economy [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00989)]. Because a standard therapy for COVID-19 is not yet available, effective vaccines are needed urgently to end the global pandemic. [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00989), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00989)]. Such vaccines employ the most traditional platform, by which the virus is inactivated using a physical or chemical method but retains its immunogenicity. When the inactivated virus enters the human body, it induces an immune response but has no pathogenicity. This vaccine technology is considered to be the safest and has been proven to prevent infectious diseases such as influenza and polio [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00989)]. It is also convenient to develop, and thus tends to be used to contain emerging infectious diseases. CoronaVac (Sinovac, Beijing, China) and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, Beijing, China) were developed in China, and their phase-3 clinical trials were performed in various countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and Peru. Data from these trials were published recently for BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, Beijing, China) and are under peer review for CoronaVac (Sinovac, Beijing, China) [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00989)]. These two vaccines have been approved for emergency use in many countries and regions, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Indonesia, Hong Kong and Macau. [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00989)]. Thus, these adenoviral vector vaccines are being used for emergency prophylaxis during the COVID-19 pandemic [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00989)]. AZD1222 (AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK), which employs a chimpanzee adenovirus vector, has been used extensively in various countries and regions. Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and CanSino (CanSino Biological Inc., Tianjin, China), which employ adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) and adenovirus serotype 5 single-dose vaccines, and the Russian-manufactured Gam-COVID-Vac (Gamaleya, Moscow, Russia) employs both of these vectors in doses administered sequentially at a 21 day interval. Despite the World Health Organization's (WHO's) approval of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson & Johnson, USA) and AZD1222 (AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK) for emergency use, rare cases of thrombosis after the receipt of these vaccines have raised public concern, regardless of the lack of establishment of a clear causal relationship between adenoviral vector vaccine receipt and thrombosis events. [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00989)]. mRNA vaccines can be developed more rapidly than can those based on other platforms; BNT162b2 (BioNTech, Mainz, Germany) was the first COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the WHO on 31 December 2020, followed by mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) on 30 April 2021. mRNA vaccines have been shown to provide enough protection (efficacy > 50%) [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00989)], but the technology with which they were developed is new; it has not been used previously for the mass production of vaccines or prevention of infectious diseases. Thus, long-term surveillance of these vaccines' safety and efficacy is required. In addition, the storage conditions required for these vaccines due to the instability of the mRNA structure [e.g., 70 \u00b0C for BNT162b (BioNTech, Mainz, 25 \u00b0C for mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA)] makes them difficult to transport. [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00989)]. Because these vaccines do not contain a live virus, they are considered to be safe and effective. Phase-1 and -2 results have been reported for NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax, USA) and ZF2001 (Longcom, China), COVID-19 vaccines of this type, and phase-3 clinical trials for them are underway [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00989), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00989)]. Preliminary analyses indicated that NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax, USA) induces high antibody titers against the SARS-COV-2 S protein, blocking attachment of the virus to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and that ZF2001 (Longcom, China), which targets the RBD of the SARS-COV-2 S protein, effectively blocks receptor binding. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Search Strategy [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00989)] ( [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00989-t001)). The keywords used for the PubMed search were \"COVID-19 vaccine*\" AND [(Efficacy OR Effectiveness) OR Safety], and the used for the EMBASE search or exp Safety/)]. Additionally, a systematic electronic search of ongoing studies and clinical trials was conducted using the COVID-19 section of the ClinicalTrials.gov database. 2.2. Selection Criteria 2.2.1. Inclusion Criteria [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00989-t001)). 2.2.2. Exclusion Criteria 2.3. Data Extraction and Publication Quality Assessment [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00989)], the quality of each included study was assessed in the following domains: study population, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting. Given that a small number of eligible articles had been published at the time that this systematic review was conducted, publication bias was examined as described in [Section 2.4](#sec2dot4-vaccines-09-00989). 2.4. Data Analysis [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00989)]. Thus, the occurrence of serious adverse events is a very important indicator in the evaluation of vaccine safety. Pooled estimates of odds ratios (ORs) based on the number of study participants experiencing serious adverse reactions and the proportions of serious adverse events (by system organ class) occurring after the receipt of at least one vaccine dose were used to evaluate vaccine safety. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated using pooled risk ratios (RRs) for the numbers of COVID-19 cases occurring after one and two vaccine doses, the numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases occurring after two vaccine doses, and the severity of SARS-COV-2 infections occurring after full vaccination. Meta-analysis of vaccine safety and efficacy were conducted separately, and analysis of subgroups defined according to the vaccine platform and case type were performed to characterize diversity among studies. Vaccine efficacy was determined using the formula (1 RR) \u00d7 100%. 3. Results 3.1. Study Selection [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00989-t002)). A flowchart of the literature search is provided as [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00989-f001). 3.2. Description of Studies [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00989), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00989), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00989), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00989)], five articles reported vector vaccines [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00989), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00989), [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00989), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00989), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00989)], and one article described a study of two inactivated vaccines [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00989)]. All vaccines reported on are administered by intramuscular injection. Relative safety statistics were provided in six articles [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00989), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00989), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00989), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00989), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00989), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00989)]; protection against SARS-COV-2 infection was evaluated by comparing the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infections in vaccine and control arms in all 12 full vaccination was evaluated in all 12 studies; cases were classified as symptomatic and asymptomatic in the first and second vaccine doses were reported in six articles [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00989), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00989), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00989), [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00989), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00989), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00989)]; and the severity of [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00989), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00989), clinical trials of AZD1222 conducted in more than one country were reported in three articles [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00989), [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00989), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00989)], and the efficacy of this vaccine against B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 lineages of SARS-COV-2 was reported in one article [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00989)]. [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00989-t002)summarizes information extracted from the selected literature. 3.3. Meta-Analysis Results 3.3.1. Vaccine Safety [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00989)] evaluated the occurrence of serious adverse events after one and two vaccine doses, and Sinopharm produced two inactivated vaccines developed from the SARS-COV-2 WIV04 and HB02 strains. BBIBP-CorV, which was developed from the HB02 strain, in collaboration with the Beijing Institute of Biological Products, has been listed as an emergency-use COVID-19 vaccine [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00989)]. All adverse events occurring after vaccination in the included studies were reported using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00989)]; and serious adverse events (hospitalization, death, and other life-threatening events) were classified using the US Food and Drug Administration's Toxicity Grading Scale [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00989)]. The risk of serious adverse event occurrence after at least one dose was greater for mRNA vaccines [OR = 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65-3.29] than for non-replicating viral vector (OR = 0.76; 95% 0.62-0.93) [Table 3](#vaccines-09-00989-t003)), but the 95% CIs indicate the lack of clear evidence for a direct relationship between the receipt of any of these vaccines and serious adverse reactions. Although no significant association between serious adverse events and vaccines was observed in the studies, with the exception of that of Baden et al., which reported a significant association between the receipt of the second vaccine dose and the occurrence of serious adverse events (OR = 4.63; 95% CI, 1.33-16.13) [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00989)], obvious heterogeneity among the three vaccine subgroups was observed (I2 = mRNA vaccines 61% vs. viral vector inactivated 0%; [Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00989)). Most heterogeneity derived from the mRNA vaccine subgroup. Thus, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using the sequential omission approach. The omission of data from Baden et al. [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00989)] reduced the degree of heterogeneity to 23.8%, which can be regarded as no significant heterogeneity in other studies. Hence, it was indicated that there was no significant association between serious adverse events and COVID-19 vaccines. were more common among recipients of the two inactivated vaccines, and serious gastrointestinal tissues and infections were reported more commonly among recipients of the viral vector and inactivated vaccines (9-34%), which were less seen in mRNA vaccines (<5%). Serious vessel or lymphatic disorders, such as thrombosis or lymphadenitis, were more easily observed in mRNA vaccines, although these disorders also occurred in the two other vaccine platforms. 3.3.2. Vaccine Efficacy [Figures S2-S4](#app1-vaccines-09-00989)). The overall RR for SARS-COV-2 infection after two vaccine doses was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.07-0.40; [Table 3](#vaccines-09-00989-t003)), indicating that the vaccines examined in the included studies are effective. The RR for SARS-COV-2 infection was lower by about 0.3 for the mRNA vaccines (0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.13) than for and inactivated (0.32; 95% CI, 0.23-0.42) vaccines, with the latter two groups showing similar efficacy. A subgroup analysis of efficacy after single doses of the mRNA and non-replicating viral vector vaccines (no such data were reported for the inactivated vaccine) yielded an overall RR for SARS-COV-2 infection that was 25% higher than the RR for infection after two doses (post single dose: 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.89; post two doses: 0.17; 95% 0.07-0.40), and a significantly higher RR for the mRNA vaccines than for the viral vector vaccines (0.53; and Risk of Bias Assessment [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00989-f003), where the results of the pooled analysis are similar to those of the original analysis in terms of safety and efficacy evaluation. [Table 6](#vaccines-09-00989-t006), eight articles presented a low risk of bias, whereas four articles were regarded as a moderate risk of bias based on the QUIPS tool assessment. 4. Discussion [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00989)], who found no difference in vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic cases relative to the control group, possibly due to the inclusion of asymptomatic cases in the analysis and the small sample. Second, the results may be imbalanced, because five of the 12 publications included reported on BNT162b2. Third, visual inspection of the funnel plots revealed asymmetry reflecting publication bias [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00989)]. Thus, the funnel plots were adjusted using the trim-and-fill approach, which did not affect the significance of the outcomes. 5.
