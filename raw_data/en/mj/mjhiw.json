It also includes emotional support, spiritual guidance and financial counseling. We take an integrated approach to providing this care because we recognize that mind, body and spirit all play a part in each person's health and well-being. Our team includes a host of oncologists and the use of medications, radiation, and other therapies to help you fight cancer. The Art Therapy sessions available at Swedish Cancer Institute introduce creative ways for patients to respond to their cancer experience, and they provide a safe space to explore thoughts and express feelings about cancer. Research shows that Art Therapy can help reduce symptoms related to pain and anxiety in patients with cancer. Art Therapy may also help reduce stress and help patients achieve personal insight. Learn more in our video: [What to Expect in Art Therapy](#). Art therapy is available at no extra cost and is open to all cancer patients, family members and caregivers.

Pain control is often a major concern for patients with cancer. Medical massage therapy, one of many integrated care services available at the Swedish Cancer Institute, is a proven technique in the control and management of pain. Medical massage therapy has been found to help relieve symptoms related to cancer, as well as side effects from related treatments and medical procedures, such as nausea, fatigue, insomnia, pain, restricted range of motion, and distress. Specialized techniques can also address edema and lymphedema management. - A licensed massage and certified lymphedema therapist will work closely with your care team to tailor each session to your unique needs. - The 60-minute sessions may include appropriate massage techniques, gentle stretching, and manual lymphatic drainage, with careful attention paid to depth of pressure and positioning requirements. - Massage may be done directly on the skin or through clothing, all within the patient's comfort level. Patients should consult with their oncologist or patient-care team before receiving a massage - referrals required.
