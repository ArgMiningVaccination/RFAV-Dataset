We've laughed and cried together, we've won big awards together, and we've achieved something close to mutual satisfaction (ninety-two percent of readers rate Tufts Magazine \"good\" or \"excellent,\" and Tuf ts Magazine rates its readers even higher than that). But the maga - zine has been coming to you in the same format for eight years. It's time we did something crazy, like go on a Nordic cruise together. In that spirit, the editors and designers of Tufts Magazine have decided to shake things up. And we're taking our cues from you. Close to six thousand readers answered the survey we sent out last spring. You told us you wanted to learn more about faculty research. You gave thumbs-up to articles on science and health and on public service. You expressed keen interest in cultural matters like art, entertainment, and books. And you said you wanted more Tufts history and nostalgia, as well as more news about the university. To no one's surprise, you held Class Notes and profiles of your fellow Jumbos to be indispensable. Your wish is our command. We've redesigned Tufts Magazine from top to bottom to give you more of what you want, in a form that makes everything easier to find. Instead of coming at you in fire-hose-like profusion, articles are now grouped by subject into four sections, each a mini-magazine within a magazine: discover. Our new health, science, and technology section presents the work of researchers and caregivers, both at Tufts and among our alumni.

This is all about you and Tufts\u2014your memories of the place, your role as an alum, and opportunities to connect with your classmates, and with your alma mater. It's home to Class Notes and \"The Big Day\" (weddings and unions). We've made other changes as well. Knowing how busy you are, we've shortened our longest articles and increased the number of brief items and \"brighteners.\" We've dispersed the columns among the four sections instead of lumping them together, as in the old \"Think Tank.\" And before you read a word, you'll notice our fresh new look\u2014with a greater variety of fonts, a color scheme to match the new four-section concept, more fun with captions and portraits, and other novel touches.

Jesper didn't just teach me what i wanted to learn, he showed me how i wanted to be in this world. it has been said that when a professor dies, a library burns. i n the case of Jesper Rosenmeier, the burning of that library is an incalcu - lable loss.

To clue them in to how it all works, Bers spent years collaborating with Tufts students on a small prototype robot that children aged four to seven could program themselves. Then she teamed up with an engineer, Mitch Rosenberg, to form KinderLab Robotics, which manufactures a kit based on that prototype. The KIBO robot, available for pre-order, features small wooden blocks, each with a bar code for a specific command: begin, end, move right, move left, shake, repeat. Kids arrange the blocks in different sequences, then run a scanner over the bar codes. A handclap starts the program; a voice command stops it.

That advice comes from Patrick J. Skelly, a Tufts researcher who is known as the Worm Guy among his colleagues. \"There are far more parasitic creatures than nonparasitic creatures,\" Skelly says. \"The more you learn about them, the more you are aghast. They are just unbelievable.\" Take the schistosome worm. A freshwater parasite of the class known as helminths, it slips through the skin and into the body. Once inside, it travels through the bloodstream to the vessels of the liver, where it matures and finds a mate. A few weeks later, the pair migrate to their final destination, the blood vessels around either the gut or the bladder, where the female lays her eggs\u2014several hundred in a single day. The eggs bore through the blood vessel walls and wind up in the colon or bladder, from which they exit the body as waste. While living and breeding inside the body, the invaders may remain undetected for a decade or more. But eventually they cause a debilitating and sometimes life-threat - ening illness known as schistosomiasis. Ghanaians collect water from Lake Volta. Some two-thirds of their countrypeople harbor the schistosome parasite, which infests many bodies of water. Dangerous W aters A parasite that afflicts 200 million people worldwide is the target of Tufts vaccine research BY JaCqueLine Mit CheLL photos: b rian c ruickshank/getty imagesfall 2014 | tufts magazine 9 Its symptoms range from gut pain, chronic diarrhea, and anemia in mild cases to kidney failure, bladder cancer, or enlarged organs. Some 780 million people world - wide\u2014over a tenth of the planet's inhabitants\u2014are at risk. According to the World Health Organization, schistosomiasis afflicts about 200 million people, mostly in Africa but also in Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Schistosomiasis is a dis - ease of poverty, second only to malaria in its toll on human health. The lack of clean drinking water and adequate sanitation creates ideal conditions for the parasite, which is carried by freshwater snails, to infect the body when the skin comes into contact with infested water. More than 200,000 people die from schistosomiasis each year, prompting the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to call the infection the world's most deadly neglected tropical disease. Only a handful of research teams worldwide are working to find vac - cines and treatments, and Skelly's lab at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine is one of them. The Molecular Helminthology Laboratory, which Skelly runs with Charles B. Shoemaker, is tackling one of the schistosome's biggest mysteries. Skelly removes a small vial from his desk drawer and holds it up to the light. Perhaps a dozen whitish worms are clearly visible, the size and shape of this capital letter G. \"They're quite big, these worms,\" Skelly says. \"Yet we don't see the host's immune system attacking them.\" Normally, when immune cells encounter suspicious foreign cells, the body mounts a full-blown immune response. But with schistosomiasis, the body ignores the worm and responds only to its eggs, which are what touch off the disease symptoms. Somehow adult schistosome worms manage to slip by the body's defense system with - out raising an alarm. \"How come there are no blood clots or immune cells around them?\" Skelly asks. \"What are they doing to turn these things off?\" Skelly and his team think the place to look for answers is on the worms' skin. \"That's what's touching the blood, of course,\" Skelly says. Lacking a true mouth and digestive system, schis - tosomes absorb glucose from human blood through their skin, using special glucose-transporting molecules as their eating utensils. It's such a crucial func - tion that Skelly and Shoemaker figured the glucose transporters, which act like tiny revolving doors, must be among the worms' least stealthy skin proteins. \"If you want to get the sugar, you have to stick those things out there,\" Skelly says. If the scientists can isolate the glucose transporter or another schis - tosome surface molecule, and generate enough of it, they may have the basis for developing a vaccine. A vaccine could be a longer-term solution than the current treatment, a drug called praziquantel that kills the adult worms in a person's blood - stream. Praziquantel is a fine remedy if you're an American who got infected during a trip to Africa. But if you live there, you're likely to become rein - fected often. Karen C. Kosinski, E11, an assistant professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts School of Medicine and a Tisch College faculty fellow, has been studying schistosomiasis in Ghana, where it's estimated that nearly two-thirds of people are infected. \"It would be great if everybody had access to drugs, but they don't,\" Kosinski says, noting that many Ghanaians can't afford even a sixty-seven-cent dose of praziquantel. Skelly and a research assistant pro - fessor in the lab, Akram Da'darah, are looking for other chinks in the schis - tosomes' armor as well: skin proteins that might make vulnerable targets for new drugs. In 2003, the pair pioneered a technique called RNA interference that enabled them to switch off the parasite's genes. Recently, they discov - ered a gene containing the blueprint for a particular skin enzyme. When the scientists used the RNA interference technique to alter production of the enzyme, the worm could no longer infect the host. The enzyme's presence had been suspected for years, Da'darah says, but no one had identified it. \"We were able to isolate it.\" Now the search is on for a way to disable that enzyme. Da'darah has screened nearly two thousand chem - icals to see whether one might be the magic bullet. So far, he has twelve promising candidates. If any of them can interfere with the enzyme enough to compromise the worm's ability to infect its host, it could lead to a new remedy for a plague that has been around literally for ages: scientists have found evidence of schistosome worms in Egyptian mummies.

That's in this world. But there is another world where I am the physicist and my father is the journalist. And yet another where I am a chinchilla and my father is a free-style rapper or a Sumo wres - tler or Kim Jong-un. All of these worlds are equally real to my father, who uses the dual pillars of probability theory and the concept of an ever-expanding universe to argue the existence of an infinite number of worlds where an infinite number of variations on life as we know it actually, tangibly exist. Three years ago, my father received a letter from one of these worlds: an invitation to travel to the Soviet Union to participate in a scientific conference that was taking place in 1956. This was no joke. The invitation was issued by the award-winning director Ilya Khrzhanovsky, a mad genius and enfant terrible of the Russian film scene. He wanted my father to play the role of a Soviet scientist in the bio-epic he was currently filming about Lev Landau, the Russian physicist who won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for his pioneering work on superfluidity. And so it was that my father announced he was returning for the first time to the Ukrainian city that we left as political refugees in 1976. I asked my dad what my mother thought of this idea. \"She doesn't like it,\" he replied. Lev Landau himself used to head the physics department at the Kharkiv State University, the same department from which my father would later earn his degree. Dau (his nickname and the title of the film) was also a born iconoclast who practiced free love, dared to correct Albert Einstein in a public lecture, and narrowly avoided falling victim to Stalin's purges for denouncing the Soviet government. As a man of extremes, Landau would probably have approved of Khrzhanovsky's outsized vision. To recreate the setting of Landau's work, Khrzhanovsky had built a 130,000-square-foot model of a Soviet scientific institute, which he popu - lated with a \"cast\" of cafeteria workers, party officials, janitors, clerks, and scientists who fulfilled their \"roles\" simply by living and working there as though the year were actually 1956 and they were really faithful drones of the Communist regime. Those who did not perform their tasks with the utmost fidelity to history were either fined or fired. As Khrzhanovsky told GQ 's Michael Idov, \"When the cleaning lady had to mop the same toilet floor every day for two years, she will do it differ - ently when she's doing it on-camera.\" Here Khrzhanovsky is also alluding to the film's epic production schedule: the cameras rolled on the set of Dau , almost nonstop, from 2008 to 2011. Khrzhanovsky's production company has refused to comment on when\u2014if ever\u2014the film will be released. With the exception of the three lead roles, all the characters in Dau were played by their contemporary doppel - g\u00e4ngers\u2014physicists played physicists, former KGB agents played KGB agents, former Communist bosses played . . . you get the idea. The set consisted of a Stalin-era scientific laboratory, cafeteria, seminar room, library, and communal living quarters where every morning the cast and crew enacted very Soviet-style arguments over the shared bathrooms. In other words, thirty-five years after leaving Kharkiv, my father returned only to immerse himself in a version of the Soviet Union far harsher than even the one he had fled. Upon arriving on the set, my father's bags were searched by an actual former KGB agent, who confiscated any item manufactured after 1956; he was forced to surrender everything, from laptop to lighter, as well as all of his clothes. He was then issued a set of Stalin-era clothing\u2014a suit with suspenders, watch, briefcase, hat, and trusy i maiku (a sort of Soviet T-shirt and boxers)\u2014and handed two hundred Soviet rubles in spending money. The one thing he was allowed to bring inside was a cigar, but only after he cut off the modern label\u2014with a knife made before 1956. Khrzhanovsky went to exhaustive lengths to infuse the institute with the atmosphere of paranoia that was the Soviet regime's trademark. When he gave my father a tour of the set, they were trailed the whole time by a \"KGB agent\" (his sinister mien left no question in my father's mind that this guy was the genuine article) to the accompaniment of piped-in cello music my father later described as \"the soundtrack of impending doom.\" In his student days at Kharkiv State University, my father's life took a dramatic turn after a very real inter - action with the KGB: they asked him to become their informant. When he declined, he was promptly blacklisted. His health exemption from the military was revoked, and he was sent to do hard labor with former convicts in the Soviet army. Upon his return, no phys - ics graduate programs would grant him entry, nor was he able to publish his work in Soviet journals. So he bounced from one odd job to another, the most memorable being a stint as a night watchman at the Kharkiv Zoo. Paradoxically it was only now, upon entering Khrzhanovsky's bizarre sim - ulacrum, that my father got to finally enjoy the privileges once reserved for elite Soviet scientists. He was given a driver and access to special canteens that served up limitless quantities of caviar and Georgian wine. In the material sense, this fictional Soviet life was far cushier than my father's actual Soviet life, where his family often had to resort to newspaper for toilet paper. fall 2014 | tufts magazine 13 foot LooSe in Kha RKiv My father, who has given talks in places as exotic as Istanbul, Kyoto, Rio de Janeiro, and Abu Dhabi, could have gone back to Kharkiv any time after the fall of the Soviet Union, but never showed the slightest interest until this most cosmically absurd opportunity arose. Once there, Kharkiv, his one- time prison, became a place of won - derment. For the week my father spent on the set of Dau , the only \"acting\" he was required to do was to give a talk on his actual work and attend the talks of other physicists\u2014an august group that included the Nobel prize winner David Gross\u2014in the evenings. During the day, he was free to explore. So he visited the zoo where he'd worked and discovered the animals looked \"much less sad,\" their cages newer and bigger. And he went to the city synagogue, which he'd known only as a sports club where he once took fencing lessons. Dazzled by its restoration, he asked the rabbi whether he might take a photo. \"A Jew asking to take a photo in a synagogue on Sabbath day,\" the rabbi tsked. But I'm a Jew in the atheist Soviet Union of 1956 , my father should have explained. Khrzhanovsky did hope the raw act of immersion in his brutalist tableau vivant would induce within his actors a metamorphosis into some form of Homo sovieticus. As my father later told me, \"It was all designed to press on your psyche, but I don't think it really worked for me. It didn't feel like I was back, trapped in the Soviet Union.\" In fact, when Khrzhanovsky asked him how he found the city after his thirty-five-year absence, he told the filmmaker he thought Kharkiv looked good\u2014greener\u2014and that the people seemed happier. It used to be that he could tell a Soviet citizen even from behind, by a certain hunched and hunted look. But the people on the street in Kharkiv looked just like the people on the street in Lexington, Massachusetts, where he lived now. But Khrzhanovsky waved off my father's explanation: \"They are only pretending,\" he insisted. \"Kharkiv still has the spirit of the old Soviet Union.\" Three years later, Kharkiv emerged as one of the conservative strongholds agitating for secession\u2014who knows, maybe Khrzhanovsky was on to something. The filmmaker needed his staged scenes to blend seamlessly with archi - val footage of Landau from the forties and fifties, but his fidelity to the past far eclipsed all pragmatic and cine - matic concerns. Despite a modest bud - get of $10 million, Dau disrupted daily life in Kharkiv to the extent of shut - ting down the airport, which serves a population the size of Philadelphia, paralyzing Freedom Square to accom - modate crowd scenes of upwards of four thousand costumed extras, and requiring a change of all the signage along the city's central avenues from Ukrainian back to Russian. \"Oh, it's the Soviet era again,\" Kharkiv citizens must have thought to themselves as they rounded a corner only to discover a seventy-ton mountain of cabbage, sprayed with wet concrete to look as though it was rotting. Knowing my father, I could under - stand why he'd be drawn to experi - encing in person what he had spent so many years theorizing about on paper. A parallel universe\u2014dropped right into the city of his birth. And I also had to ask myself whether the father who returned was same one who left. Was he somehow imperceptibly different? Slightly more Soviet? A touch more grim and distrustful? As was the custom in Soviet times, my father was given an assortment of gifts when he left the institute, and the next time I visited home he showed them to me. Because 1956 was a deficit year in the Soviet Union, even the most quotidian items were cherished, and my father's gifts reflected that fact. He left the canned meat and jams at the hotel, but brought back with him an avoska , the mesh bag all Soviet citizens carried should they happen upon a line at any time for goods of any kind. Some vintage matchbooks from the fifties (one featured a drawing of an alcoholic happily hugging a bottle of vodka). And then there was something my father described as his new prized possession. He led me to his study and there it was, displayed on a shelf along - side the sculpture his colleagues had commissioned on the occasion of the Tufts Institute of Cosmology's twen - ty-fifth anniversary: an ordinary roll of Soviet toilet paper. He held it out to me and laughed, a bit like a mad scientist.

We tried high-protein and low-carb. But the inescapable conclu - sion is that there's only one way to lose weight: eat less. Why is that so much easier said than done? That's what Emmanuel N. Pothos, associate professor of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics and neuroscience in the School of Medicine's Department of Integrative Physiology and Pathobiology, and his colleagues are trying to understand. Pothos' research focuses on the reward system in the brain that makes us want food. As it turns out, this system depends heavily on the chemical dopamine, which is normally released when an animal eats a meal. Dopamine produces a pleasurable sensation that lets the animal know it has satisfied a primal need.Starvation, however, alters this otherwise tidy feedback loop. When an animal is having a hard time finding enough food, the brain doesn't want it to feel satisfied after just one meal, so it releases less dopamine. Pothos and other researchers have seen corroborating evidence in the lab: the brains of underweight animals release less dopamine than those of normal-weight animals. Oddly, the brains of overweight animals release less dopamine as well. And human brain imaging by other researchers indicates that something similar is likely going on in people. \"Even though they are mirror opposites, the undernour - ished and the obese share two things\u2014an increased motivation to eat and a deficient brain dopamine system,\" Pothos says. A number of factors can knock the reward system off Discover heaLth ne WS f RoM tuft S Boogie BirD when a C olleague showed Aniruddh Patel a YouTube clip of a sulfur-crested cockatoo named Snowball seemingly dancing to the Backstreet Boys' \"Everybody,\" he was shocked. The bird appeared to be moving perfectly in sync with the beat. Patel, a Tufts associate professor of psy - chology and an expert in the burgeoning field of music neurobiology, had thought only humans could master that skill. Even animals closely related to us fail at very simple tests such as tapping in synchrony with a metronome. After a year of training, the best rhesus monkeys can do is tap a few hundred milli - seconds after each metronome click. Patel points out that parrots are one of the few species capable of learning and reproducing com - plex vocal patterns like humans, and he speculates that an ability to move to a beat may be linked to that. He notes that in brain studies of humans and parrots, there are special connections between motor-planning regions in the front of the brain and sound-processing regions farther back in the brain. Fortunately for Patel, Snowball's tastes have expanded. \"Now he's a big fan of Lady Gaga,\" Patel says.

Surprisingly, such stress might be an important factor, according to a Journal of Biological Regulators & Homeostatic Agents article by Evangelos Papathanasiou, DG11, an assistant professor of periodontology at Tufts School of Dental Medicine, and Theoharis Theoharides and Iro Palaska, two pathobiologists at Tufts' Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Under stress, they note, people manufacture more of the hormone cortisol, which, in the gums, seems to stimulate certain immune- system cells to step up their production of proteins. The extra proteins could increase inflammation, and the inflammation could speed the progression of gum disease, the researchers say. Papathanasiou and Theoharides are developing experiments to test the hypothesis. One possibility is to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of plant compounds called flavonoids on people experiencing different levels of stress.

A Tufts study led by Adela Hruby, N10, MPH10, N13, and published in Diabetes Care found that healthy people with the highest magnesium intake were thirty-seven percent less likely to develop high blood sugar or excess circulating insulin, common precursors of diabetes. Among people who already had such conditions, those who consumed the most magnesium were thirty-two percent less likely to develop diabetes than those consum - ing the least. The second association held true even when researchers accounted for other healthful factors, such as fiber, that often go along with magnesium-rich foods. Only half of Americans get the recommended daily amount of magnesium in their diet, which is 400 to 420 milligrams for men and 310 to 320 milligrams for women. You can find it in whole grains, vegetables, fish, nuts and seeds, and dark chocolate.

But they experience many of the same eye problems that people do, including cataracts, glau - coma, and injuries to the cornea\u2014unbeknownst to their owners. \"Dogs and cats are very good at memorizing their environment,\" says Christopher Pirie, one of Cummings School's three board-certified veterinary ophthalmologists. \"We see lots of patients that have pretty advanced visual dysfunction without their owners being aware of it simply because the layout of their home never changed.\" Watch out for tearing, squinting, red eyes, cloudy eyes, eye discharge, color changes in the eye, and a tendency to rub, paw, or scratch the eye. Another red flag is clumsiness and confusion in low-light conditions. And if an older pet is sleeping more and becoming less active, don't be so quick to attribute it to aging. The animal may be trying to cope with eye pain. Kara Gornick, an ophthal - mology resident at Cummings School, notes that \"the vast majority of conditions can be cured or at least successfully treated for a while with medications if they're caught early enough.\" Pirie, mean - while, emphasizes that eye care is essential to a pet's quality of life. \"Think about when you have an eyelash or piece of dust in your eye,\" he says. \"You'll do anything you can to get it out.\" (froM CUMMINGS VETERINARY MEDICINE ) 16 tufts magazine | fall 2014 Discover the huMan ani Mal Busy as a g randma Things we share with bees BY PhiLiP Sta RKS Darwin was not a fan of social insects, or at least not of those you're likely to step on or be stung by. Some of these critters\u2014notably ants and termites, and certain wasps, bees, and aphids\u2014 exhibit a high degree of social organi - zation that modern scientists describe as \"eusocial.\" And the thing about eusocial insects is that many of them, whole castes of workers, are sterile. Darwin felt, and rightly so, that sterile workers presented a \"special difficulty\" for his theory of natural selection. It was a difficulty he couldn't easily ignore: eusocial insects constitute about seventy-five percent of all insect biomass, even though only about two percent of insect species are eusocial. So what the heck is going on here? Why are so few so abundant? And what was Darwin so upset about anyway? Eusocial animals live in groups marked by an overlap of generations, cooperative care of the young, and a reproductive division of labor. It is this last part that made Chuck cranky: he had a hard time seeing how evolution could select for sterility. Science has answered that in a few different ways, chiefly by switching our focus from bodies, which are temporary, to genes, which are potentially immortal. Eusociality has turned some organisms into \"super-organisms,\" col - onies of animals that work together as if they were part of a single body, and collectively work so that one or a few of their relatives can reproduce. Honey bees are my favorite super-organism. They rely not only on a reproductive division of labor, but also on a general division of labor within the work force. This allows the colony to accomplish many different things at once: tending the queen, feeding the brood, expand - ing the colony, collecting nectar and pollen, and other tasks, which they optimize through their highly evolved communication networks. When tens of thousands of workers are performing optimally, amazing things can hap - pen. Not only do honey bees construct and defend their homes; they also clean them, air-condition them, and sometimes heal sick members within them. With skills like those, no wonder eusocial insects are so abundant. Aside from the threat to his theory of natural selection, there is some irony in Darwin's distaste for eusociality. And that's because these animals sound a lot like us. We live in multigener - ational groups, we provide coopera - tive care of offspring, and we have a division of labor where individuals can maximize their talents. These traits have allowed us to become the single most invasive species on the planet.But there's another eusocial trait we share with the honey bee, and that's a reproductive division of labor. A large class of humans is almost entirely sterile. They're called grandmothers. Of course, to be a grandmother you had to be a mother first. So unlike worker bees, these individuals are not sterile for their entire lives\u2014but they may be sterile sig - nificantly longer than they were fertile. The rarity in nature of such an extended post-reproductive life-span has led science to wonder about grandmothers. The main question mirrors the one we asked about sterile workers in insect colonies: under what conditions would forgoing reproduc - tion actually increase evolutionary fitness? And the answer is the same. Grandmothers may appear harmless, but don't be fooled; they are responsi - ble, at least indirectly, for generating a substantial share of human biomass. It turns out that having a grand - mother nearby increases a couple's offspring production by lowering the age for a first birth and shrinking the interval between births. You can call this the Nagging Hypothesis if you're brave enough (\"When are you going to give me a grandchild? Don't you think your baby needs a younger sibling?\"), but the data overwhelmingly support its effectiveness. For every ten years of postmenopausal life, a grandmother is likely to have two additional grandchil - dren. This is good for the grandmother and for her children's evolutionary fitness. Not every family benefits from sterile workers, of course, but many do. I believe humans are so successful precisely because we are eusocial\u2014or \"ideally\" social, as the term suggests. It's a phenomenon defined more by cooperation than by conflict, and that's something Darwin would have loved, even if he never felt the love for ants.

It was there that I unintentionally ended up impersonating a photojournalist\u2014my sole credential being a large 35mm camera\u2014during the August 1991 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt against Gorbachev by hard-line communists. Dozens of idling camouflage-green tanks and countless somber-looking soldiers gathered near the Arbat, a tourist hot spot full of small shops and vendors. Civilians, most of them as surprised to see the tanks as I was, milled about, talking to soldiers. With just the camera to defend myself against what seemed like most of the Soviet army, I did something only an awestruck twenty-two-year-old would think was a good idea: I climbed up onto one of the tanks and began taking pictures. I knew I was putting my life at risk, but this was history, possibly even the end of the Soviet Union. I looked around, mumbling the sorts of things I imagined news pho - tographers mumbled: That's it. There you go. Come on out. Show your face so I can take the picture. That's it.

I pressed the shutter button. Adjusting my oversized brown plastic glasses, I peered through the lens and snapped more photos. Soldiers cleaning their rifles. Commanders barking orders. Running on adrenaline, I was taking risks I had never dreamed of, and rel - ishing every moment. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a soldier spring from a hatch about ten tanks ahead of me. He was tall and blond, with broad shoulders, and was squinting around for some - thing. I lowered my camera and his eyes locked on to mine. I looked away nervously, realizing I had no expla - nation for why an American tourist should be standing atop a Soviet army tank a few miles from Red Square. A woman screamed in Russian, waving her arms, hollering for me to get down. Crap. The strapping soldier ran toward me, leaping from tank to tank. He seemed to have orders\u2014and it appeared I was his target. Suddenly, the tank I stood on jolted to life. Exhaust fumes filled the air. Steel hatches dropped shut. The approaching soldier yelled something unintelligible, an angry scowl on his face as I stood pan - icking in the plumes of smoke\u2014 I closed the dusty photo album and sighed. The kids were off with their grandparents, and my wife was rehearsing for a musical at our syn - agogue. Sipping my morning coffee during this rare moment of solitude, I marveled at that kid, exactly half the age I am today. Was it really me? Was I ever capable of putting myself in such peril? For a moment, the more conser - vative life I live today, with its responsi - bilities and pressures, felt foreign. I remembered all the freedom my parents had given me growing up. Whether allowing me to spend unsupervised days playing in a park or insisting I make my own decisions about activities, educational pursuits, and relationships, they instilled a great sense of self-reliance, and, in turn, confidence. Would I allow my eleven-year-old son or eight-year-old daughter the same latitude? Could I find the courage to let them explore the world, even if they took risks as boneheaded as the time I stood on that Soviet tank? Before the angry soldier could grab me, I jumped to the asphalt. Coughing and wheezing in the exhaust, I crawled to a grassy area, where I turned over and faced the sky, my heart beating out of my chest. It was then that I grew emboldened to stay in the USSR beyond my four-week sightseeing tour. With the fall of communism, opportu - nity was sure to find me, I thought. I remained in the new Russia for close to three years. I taught English in St. Petersburg and then got into real estate development in Moscow. Majoring in Soviet and East European studies had provided book knowledge, but living abroad provided more. Speaking with Russians about their impressions of American policy and debating the benefits of democracy with people who didn't believe in it, I realized that the success of our interna - tional community relies on discussion and empathy. I returned home more focused and determined, and genuinely interested in world events. The rattle of keys at the front door interrupted my thoughts. My son\u2014his inquisitive eyes and uncombed bushy brown hair not unlike my own at that age\u2014charged into the kitchen. He grabbed the unfa - miliar photo album and began studying its contents.

Cadley's algebra classroom is an oasis of stability. He knows the kids well enough to inquire about their basketball games and family outings before moving on to the lesson, which he picks up exactly where the class left off the previous day. Cadley is one of thirty-five Jumbos who joined the Teach for America corps last fall. The corps signs college graduates up for a two- year hitch teaching in low-income communities, where teacher short - ages are rampant nationwide. (The Tulsa school system, where Cadley works, started the 2013-14 school year with dozens of vacancies\u2014and that was with the 150-plus teachers supplied by Teach for America.) The corps provides intensive training and mentoring, and helps members pay off student loans or educational expenses. On the job, the mem - bers are school employees, receiving the same pay and benefits as other beginning teachers. Teach for America is a favorite postcollege destination for Tufts graduates. In 2013, the university ranked sixth among schools of similar size as a source of recruits, and a total of 241 alumni have taught with the corps during its twenty-three-year history. It's the focus on active citizenship, according Nick Diaz, a recruitment manager for the corps. \"Tufts students are really aware of issues of justice that are at play in this country and inter - nationally,\" he says. \"I think they are particularly attracted to the program because they embrace the 'think globally, act locally' mantra.\" Cadley, in Tulsa, agrees. \"I see Tufts values in Teach for America's values, and vice versa,\" he says. Maura Donahue, A10, who joined Teach for America two years after graduating from Tufts, instilled those altruistic values in her pre-kindergar - ten pupils in East Harlem. \"The vision I wrote for the school year is based on helping my students become engaged in their classroom community and making big concepts small,\" she says. \"Being considerate, helping, sharing\u2014they're learning the fundamentals,\" she says.

Its wall is plastered with peeling black- and-white I.D. photos of those buried within\u2014the murdered relatives of the Mayans who live in this army-built settlement. On a June day in 2012, I walked past the cemetery and into the settlement, my arms laden with a stack of surveys for my research. I was greeted casually and without curi - osity by heavily sunned residents squinting into the thick heat. Some women carried baskets on their heads and, against their backs, infants swaddled in bright woven cloths that matched their mothers' blouses and skirts. The men, pushing carts or pass - ing on motorcycles, favored jeans and cowboy hats. Pacux shares many features with other Guatemalan villages: simple wood and concrete homes, chickens wandering free, outdoor wood- fired cooking stoves, communal washing areas. Yet where a rural village might be open and airy and surrounded by cropland, Pacux is tightly enclosed, with just space enough for a person to squeeze between the small houses and the vegeta - bles growing in scanty tufts behind them.Field notes on a lost way of life in GuatemalaBy nOA h COhen-Cline, F13 illustr AtiOn by F rAncesc O bOnGiOrni fall 2014 | tufts magazine 23 fall 2014 | tufts magazine 23DAMMED 24 tufts magazine | fall 2014 24 tufts magazine | fall 2014 ActMy visit came thirty years after the massacres at Rio Negro, the farming village the Pacux residents once called home. In five separate onslaughts, the Guatemalan army had taken 444 lives. Massacres of indigenous people were not unusual during Guatemala's civil war, a conflict that left more than 200,000 dead or missing. But the Rio Negro massacres were unique in one respect: their purpose was to dislodge a community that refused to leave its land and clear space for the reservoir that would be created by the new Chixoy hydroelectric dam. Pacux, which houses Rio Negro's survivors, is four hours from the blocked-up river and the submerged fields that once fed them. Its only landmarks other than the cemetery are an abandoned school and a small infirmary with no medicine or staff, symbols of the government's unfulfilled promise of compensation. I was in Pacux to study the dam's lasting effects on the community. As I ventured deeper into this village\u2014where the community was forcibly resettled\u2014I met older men and women who sat idly in the shade of their homes, sharpening their machetes, watching their grandkids, watching me as I scribbled down notes. Their settle - ment was ill fitting despite the decades they'd had to adjust. They remained a people calloused by the land, and raised to draw from it organization and sustenance, yet here in Pacux they had only a grid of shoddy homes and thin, scattered plots to evoke the fields and orchards they once cultivated. One man told me about the violence that had brought him to this place. Returning from the hills where he'd been gathering firewood, he saw the army entering his village and hid, listen - ing to the shouting and the shots and the wailing of children. He emerged the next day to find the village destroyed and his wife, brothers, and two sons dead. \"The massacre was tough,\" he told me, nodding slowly beneath his broad cowboy hat. Others spoke of the pain of dislo - cation. \"After the water came, we went to live in the hills,\" one elderly woman told me. \"We didn't want to come here\u2014we were afraid of the army.\" Her pupils were veiled by translucent gray cataracts, and moved between my face and her lap as she sorted corn. \"But you couldn't have a life out there, so after some time we came.\" Another survivor said his family, like a few others, tried going back to what was left of their land. They built small houses on the steep slopes next to the reservoir\u2014a sudden lake the size of 25,000 football fields\u2014but struggled to grow food or catch good fish. \"Before, we had pigs, cows, donkeys. We could go to the orchards and get fruit.\" He smiled for a moment, and his wispy moustache splayed out before turning downward again. \"When we went back, everything was under the water, and the soil was bad.\" one evening, i left pacux sweaty and drained and repaired to the small concrete room I had rented nearby. The shower was a cold dribble. As I squirmed beneath it, I thought of clumsy metaphors for the river. For sev - eral hours a day there was no water in town and the electricity often flickered out. My inability, during those hours, to wash my hands or flush the toilet was an inconvenience\u2014trivial next to the privations faced by the communities that had inhabited the riverbanks for generations. They suffered the loss of a connection that was difficult to grasp for someone like me who conducts his daily life mostly unconscious of the natural resources needed to sustain it. I thought of children washing at a shared standpipe in the midday heat, of elders sorting corn on Pacux's stoops, of the handful of haggard men languishing in front of the booze shop on my corner. I dried off, slipped under the mosquito net that hung lumpily over my bed, and reviewed my notes for the day. I was searching for solid evidence of the dam's impact on the identity and dignity of commu - nity members, aware that I'd need to present something more substantial than these impressions I found so hard to shake. I also wanted to know why, thirty years after Chixoy, Guatemala persisted in building new dams, and why indigenous people continued risk - ing their lives to keep dams out. I kept thinking of my visit with Juan de Dios. De Dios was the direc - tor of ADIVIMA, an overworked and under-resourced Guatemalan NGO staffed by Mayans intent on righting the state's wrongs. \"Mayan lives are worth nothing in Guatemala,\" he'd stated flatly. De Dios, compact and powerfully built, and conspicuously free of sweat in the summer heat, sat at a desk in his modest office. We were a hundred kilo - meters and as many mountain switch - backs from the capital, Guatemala City, but just steps from Pacux. He wore jeans, with short sleeves hung over thick arms. I'd arrived practically unannounced on my way to the settle - ment, yet he put aside a pile of work to welcome me, and to decry the offenses perpetrated against the community that raised him. Together with a few international allies, ADIVIMA sought justice for the human rights violations attendant on Chixoy's construction\u2014the land grabbing, torture, disappearances, rape, and murder. Its mission had been at the center of national and interna - tional litigation for eighteen years, and those who pursued it had long grown accustomed to death threats. \"If we protest on the highway we are met with bullets so that trucks can pass, so they won't be slow to deliver fall 2014 | tufts magazine 25 fall 2014 | tufts magazine 25 their minerals,\" de Dios told me that day in his office. \"Or their onions, their milk. Can you imagine? A human life, valued less than a bag of onions?\" A few weeks later I was back with him and ADIVIMA, in an open-air hut shaded by a mango tree and guarded by two state police. I looked on as Rio Negro survivors huddled around a list of victims the organization had submitted to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in its case for reparations. In many instances, entire families had been killed and their birth certificates and I.D. cards lost. A young staff member explained that the court needed evidence that the individuals in question actually existed. The group mulled over the high - lighted names dimly projected on the screen. They closed their eyes, pressing each other to think of anyone they knew who could vouch for the dead. They came up with godparents, neph - ews, neighbors. \"They'll have to testify,\" the staff member said. \"They'll have to sign.\" He pressed his thumb against his palm, miming a fingerprint\u2014the legally acceptable signature from those who are illiterate. Juan de Dios watched it all from the back, uneasily. The case highlighted the violence against Rio Negro, a phenom - enon easier to characterize, and more amenable to demands for justice, than the erosion of a community over time. He would see that whatever reparations were awarded were put to good use, but a deep worry showed on his face, a worry I now understand was about the continuity of his people, and the long, slow effort to restore self-determination to a community robbed of it. The previously inhabited land \"holds emotional relationships with our ancestral past, and is a pathway for relationships between members of the community,\" he wrote in a sixty-eight-page document describing Chixoy's consequences. \"It is our collective her - itage, which allows the perpetuation of our culture.\" Later that summer, one of the men I interviewed in Pacux testified with de Dios before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. It was the man who lost his wife, brothers, and children. Rio Negro, he told the judges, was \"a marvel\u2014for its river, for the hills, the lands, the strength that was the river, the varieties of fish, and the archaeo- logical sites that are there. Our grand- parents did their ceremonies before planting, did their ceremonies when harvesting their crops.\" The community opposed the dam, he said, \"because for them the land is sacred.\" t he coming year brought encour - aging news. In October 2012, four months after de Dios and his dele - gation testified, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found the State of Guatemala responsible for human rights violations and ordered a suite of reparations that included for - mulating a plan to rescue the culture of the Rio Negro Mayans. Then, in January 2013, a Guatemalan court ordered Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt\u2014who held power during the Rio Negro massacres\u2014to stand trial for genocide and crimes against humanity. The case was brought by survivors of massacres elsewhere in Guatemala. On May 10, 2013, Montt was convicted and sen - tenced to eighty years in prison. It was an important victory\u2014though ten days later a court overturned the conviction and scheduled a retrial for 2015. Meanwhile, I made some progress of my own. I finished analyzing my data and found evidence that many chil - dren of displaced Rio Negro families have stopped using their indigenous language\u2014an indicator of cultural loss, the main focus of my research. But a much more salient point stuck with me, one that eluded my surveys: indigenous communities in Guatemala were tired of being pushed aside. They wanted some control over decisions about their resources, and a develop - ment agenda that did not impose its greatest costs on minorities and the poor, time and time again. Advocates like Juan de Dios can fight for reparations. They can win state-funded development support for their community, and force the State of Guatemala to finally accept respon - sibility for the atrocities it committed. But they cannot bring back this com - munity's way of life\u2014its harvest fes - tivals and rites of passage, its intimate relationship with the land. The best an advocate can do is show the state that indigenous people will insist on their due, even in the face of death threats, and even after thirty years. nOAh CO hen-Cline, F13, heads the Food s ystems Track of Clinton Global i nitiative. h e conducted his research in Guatemala as a fellow at the Tufts institute of the environment. this Mayan survivor of a g uatamalan army masacre has been relocated to the dingy settlement of p acux (left), whose cemetery wall bears the faces of murdered kin.26 tufts magazine | fall 2014 26 tufts magazine | fall 2014 Act CHina's F aBLeD aiR pollution assaulted Linda Greer, J76, the moment she arrived in Beijing in 2008, on her first trip there for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). \"I literally could not see down the block,\" she recalls. The city's fine-particle emissions, which cause lung and heart ailments, peaked at thirty-five times the World Health Organization's recommended limit in 2013\u2014the same year China's health ministry reported that seventy-one of sev - enty-four cities there failed to meet air-quality standards. The effects are felt even across the Pacific. \"If you live in California,\" Greer says, \"nearly a third of the air pollution you breathe comes from China.\" The country has emerged as \"manufacturer to the world\" largely because of its cheap labor and lax environmental regulation and enforcement, which help keep production costs low. As director of the NRDC's health and environment program, Greer has made it her mission to enlist U.S. corporations' help in cleaning up Chinese industry. \"We are complicit in a lot of China's pollution, because they are making so much of our stuff,\" Greer says. \"We are buying things cheaper and cheaper every day at places like Walmart, which has a huge hidden environmental cost.\" The NRDC, a large nonprofit environmental advocacy organization based in New York City, employs thirty Chinese nationals in its Beijing office.

Gornstein, Massachusetts' undersecretary of housing and community development, had only been on the job for eighteen months when the crisis that gave rise to such statistics hit, and there was no easy fix. The state, despite a relatively strong social safety net, has the sixth-highest rents in the nation, the fourth-widest income gap between rich and poor, and a paucity of affordable housing relative to need. The financial crisis of 2008 had only exacerbated deep inequities. Then came federal budget sequestration in 2013, freezing funds for Section 8 vouchers, which subsidize housing expenses for those in need. The result of these combined pressures was an unexpected seventy-percent spike in homelessness last summer and fall. But after twenty-two years as executive director of the Citizens' Housing and Planning Association\u2014and prior experience as a neighbor - hood planner in Cambridge and director of housing for the Tri-City Community Action Program in Malden\u2014the undersecretary was equal to the challenge. \"I was familiar with all the programs,\" he says. \"In fact, I advocated for a lot of the programs I'm now administering.\" Gornstein puts great stock in preventing homelessness in the first place. To this end, his department recently increased funding for a program that provides education, job training, child-care vouchers, and short-term financial assistance for families at risk of losing their homes. The department also helps municipalities hold on to affordable housing stock that could revert to market rate. Gornstein and his colleagues plan to streamline the application process for affordable housing as well. Currently, people must fill out a separate application for each town in which they might live, but the new system would let them apply once for housing anywhere in the state. With the well-being of so many people at stake, Gornstein describes his job as \"an honor and an awesome responsibility.\" \u2014KiM sie BerT MAC phAil installation of pollution control devices. They also pressure American businesses to hold Chinese suppliers to higher envi - ronmental standards. \"We're pushing corporations to reward the factories that have done these improvements with longer contracts and more business, and to deny contracts where environmental behavior is egregious,\" she says. Getting American firms on board isn't easy. The companies \"are not bound by any U.S. laws having to do with protecting the environment abroad,\" Greer says. \"And they benefit from the opacity of their operations, which are located so far away from their customer base.\" So far, a handful of U.S. corpora - tions known for their social responsi - bility programs\u2014including Target, VF, Gap, Levi, and H&M\u2014have actively participated in the NRDC program. Greer, who joined the NRDC staff in 1990, is sustained by her sense of humor\u2014without which, she says, \"I don't think I could have stayed in this line of work.\" She adds: \"I regard my China initiative like missionary work: one soul at a time. It's an 'OK, that's one factory, fifty-five thousand to go' kind of problem.\" But she does see a game-changer or two on the horizon. The Chinese government recently required some 15,000 of the country's biggest factories to post hourly online reports of air emissions and wastewater discharges. And citizens are unmasking offenders on their own. \"In the last five years, thanks basically to social media, there is so much visibility globally of the pol - lution problems, with people in China taking pictures on their cell phones and posting on websites. The curtain is definitely rising, and the anonymity with which multinational companies have been able to operate is rapidly coming to an end.\" dAve W ieCzOreK, a freelance writer for newspapers and magazines, lives in Glen e llyn, i llinois. phoTo: rIChArd h ousing and c ommunity development28 tufts magazine | fall 2014 JOnAThAn association's 2014 Christian a . herter a ward for Constructive dissent. t he award is unique in the federal government because it recognizes individuals who challenge the system from within.

The first plate, representing the mainstream of twentieth-century American cooking, holds a seven-ounce steak with a small side of carrots. The second exemplifies the farm-to-table style popularized by food writers and chefs like Barber, A92\u2014dishes that are seasonal, artisanal, and local, but often modeled on their conventional predecessors. This plate holds a seven-ounce grass-fed steak with organic heirloom baby carrots. On the third plate\u2014the one Barber is experimenting with at the two restaurants he co-owns, Blue Hill in Manhattan and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, in Westchester County, New York\u2014is a \"carrot steak\" embellished with a sauce containing braised bits of beef. This seemingly topsy-turvy meal could hold the key to restoring balance to a food-production system that has become unsustainable. The third plate emerged from Barber's efforts to perfect the second plate. His innovative and artful fare had made him a leader in the farm-to-table movement\u2014a winner of several James Beard awards, the foodie Oscars\u2014and helped shepherd a change in the way Americans cook and eat.

Like an alchemist in search of the philosopher's stone, Barber quested after the secret to cultivating great-tasting ingredients. He kept meticulous records of the produce and livestock grown and raised at the Stone Barns Center, a nonprofit agricultural complex that surrounds the Westchester County restaurant. For every piece of lamb he served, he could tell you when the ani - mal had been born, who its mother was, what grass it had eaten, and so on. But as he sought to uncover the key to deliciousness in his data, he realized he'd been going about it the wrong way. \"I was asking only about the lamb,\" he said recently. The recipe for delicious lamb, he learned, starts long before the lamb is even born. \"I wasn't asking about the crop rotation that supported the lamb's diet. I wasn't asking about the other animals on the farm. I wasn't asking about any of the in-between crops that also supported the farmer.\"He has written a book, The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food (Penguin), to consider just such questions. In it, he tells of farmers and scientists who are pushing the frontiers of sustainable agriculture. He aims to persuade cooks and consumers to quit building menus around a handful of celebrated ingredients and instead choose foods with an eye toward the viability of the land. So, Barber says, if you want those peak-of-summer Brandywine toma - toes\u2014a water-hogging crop that depletes the soil\u2014you also need to cook with kidney beans, millet, and mustard greens. Those less glamorous crops build soil structure, replenish nitrogen, and keep plant diseases at bay. But because not enough people buy them, farmers either sell such crops for animal feed, at a loss, or don't even grow them. \"That's very dangerous from an ecological point of view, and economically from the farmer's point of view,\" Barber says. Barber didn't set out to turn the culinary world on its head. He began his career as an apprentice at La Brea Bakery in Los Angeles, after Sol Gittleman\u2014former Tufts provost, current University Professor\u2014egged him on. In the spring of his senior year, Barber had mentioned a vague notion that he wanted to bake bread. The next day, in a German literature class, Gittleman beseeched an auditorium full of students to follow their passion in life. \"I have a guy here who wants to be a baker!\" he declared. \"And all of a sudden, I became a baker,\" says Barber, who insists that his liberal arts education has not gone to waste. Cooking \"is a liberal arts craft in many ways,\" he says. \"To understand it, you need to expand your mind beyond cooking.\" That is what the \"third plate\" con - cept asks people to do, as they consider the whole ecosystem of food, from sustainable farming to sustainable dining. \"You've heard the phrase 'nose- to-tail eating'?\" Barber asks, referring to the practice of creating dishes from all parts of an animal. \"This is nose-to-tail eating of the farm. We need to be more attuned to the nuts and bolts of farming, because it's the nuts and bolts that provide true sustainability.\" Helene R agovin is a senior writer at Tufts.

That would be the dozen or so albums by Birdsongs of the Mesozoic, a group that combines classical rigor with psychedelic acid rock to yield up what Billboard magazine once called \"cacophony meets classicism in a mes - merizing instrumental venture into the space-age jungle.\" If, however, you live in the Northeast, chances are good you've heard the other half of his output as a crackerjack composer of commercial jingles, including spots for Christmas Tree Shops, Waltham Camera & Stereo, and the Basketball Hall of Fame. Lindgren, A76\u2014who recently spent a week in residence at the Tufts music department, culminating in a sixti - eth-birthday concert of his music\u2014has been working the duality between accessibile and avant-garde since child - hood. \"I grew up with a strong classical background,\" he says. \"My mom was a society pianist, loved Chopin and show tunes, and started me on piano lessons at about age five.\" But Cream and Jimi Hendrix entered Lindgren's life in his teens, when his brother brought home their \"mind-blowing\" albums. Then he came to Tufts, where he studied composition with the legendary T.J. Anderson. \"I was your very diligent classical musician who practiced piano a lot and composed this very sophisti - cated, academic contemporary classical music,\" he says. \"The rest of the time, I was searching out records by odd and obscure bands like the Thirteenth Floor Elevators, Litter, the Move, and Idle Race.\" His record obsession goes on, even as his collection tops 10,000 seven-inch singles and 5,000 LPs, Erik Lindgren photo: kathy chapman (birdman)fall 2014 | tufts magazine 33 mostly by obscure sixties acts. By the late 1970s\u2014the dawn of punk and new wave\u2014Lindren was back in Boston with a master's from the University of Iowa, playing in garage bands. One band, Moving Parts, turned out to be presciently named: all its members were moving in different directions. While Lindgren wanted to combine the garage rock of the Stooges and MC5 with Stravinsky, Bart\u00f3k, and Webern, the drummer wanted the band to be Aerosmith, and the other two members wanted something louder and wilder. Those two formed Mission of Burma, one of the most out-there bands in American punk rock, in 1979. But Mission of Burma's main man, Roger Miller, would soon return to join Lindgren in Birdsongs of the Mesozoic, formed as an instrumental side project in 1980. \"Birdsongs of the Mesozoic represents an interesting moment in indie rock history,\" says Ira Robbins, a music critic and former editor of Trouser Press magazine. \"They came along at a point when bands were start - ing to shake off the self-consciousness of what was acceptable in punk, and they had real classical and modernist sensibilities and chops, creating music that was very daring and ambitious.\" Birdsongs' music was indeed differ - ent, and difficult. On the road, it was not unusual for bewildered listeners to remark, \"You're not from around here, are ya?\" Nevertheless, the band's punk-classical synthesis worked, especially when they broke out their eight-minute version of Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring , a composition so radical it caused a near riot at its premiere in Paris in 1913. More than once, Birdsongs' version elicited similar reactions. The band has been at it ever since. Lindgren also keeps busy with side bands, including the Frankenstein Consort, and runs the Arf! Arf! record label, which releases his own work as well as compilations of outsider music drawn from his record collection. On top of that, he runs a studio called Sounds Interesting, where he's recorded many a commercial jingle with the likes of Greg Hawkes (keyboardist for the Cars) and Andy Pratt (composer of \"Avenging Annie\"), and pursues other projects\u2014they're listed on his website, sfzrecordings.com. The odd juxtapositions in Lindren's career don't surprise his old Tufts mentor, the now retired T.J. Anderson. \"Erik's very intellectually curious, with a great sense of humor,\" Anderson says. \"He takes literally nothing seriously. Most of us worry\u2014but Erik just goes through life doing what he wants to do.\" DAVID ME ncon I, the music critic at the News & Observer in Raleigh, north c arolina, is a frequent contributor to Tufts Magazine . MINI-Q& a HAUnTED B y KAFKA The specter hovering over Jay Ca NTOr's new collection of stories, Forgiving the Angel (Knopf), is Franz Kafka. He glides in and out of the lives of the characters, which are mostly based on real people who had intimate ties with the writer. Cantor, a professor of English at Tufts and author of Krazy Kat and other novels, has been reading Kafka ever since high school in New York, and has taught his work for years. I recently spoke with Cantor about the genesis of his latest work. WHAT WA s yo UR go AL In WRITI ng THE sE sToRIEs? I wanted to explore what it meant to have an encounter with an angel, Kafka being the angel. Everyone who knew him was struck by his extraordinary honesty and his inability to comfort himself with illusions. Like Max Brod [Kafka's friend and literary executor who ignored the author's request to burn his unpublished works, and went on to make Kafka posthumously famous], they could never live up to what it meant to encounter Kafka, nor could they forget him. And that interested me. More deeply, the book is, as the novelist David Shields told me in a letter, about grief in general, how to deal with somebody who's gone and who one has loved\u2014someone who one feels, perhaps because of the grief, is part of the angelic order. Why I was moved to write about that I couldn't tell you. But for me that's what the book is about. THE B ooK Is sUBTITLED \"Fo UR sT oRIEs FoR FRAnz K AFKA .\" WHy Is THAT ? I feel a kind of kinship with Kafka. There's a kind of terror in his stories. I want to comfort him and show him that I understand and share his terror. Or maybe I think he shares mine\u2014I'm not sure; one of those two. Do yo U THI nK KAFKA W oULD APPRE cIATE WHAT yo U'VE DonE? That's a nightmare of a question.

As the press and bloggers remind us almost daily of its sesquicentennial anniversaries, the Civil War remains one such. Even now there's talk of Atlanta's capture by General William Tecumseh Sherman and his famous March to the Sea, which occurred in the autumn of 1864. fall 2014 | tufts magazine 35 36 tufts magazine | fall 2014 CreateThe discussion of the war, influ - enced by enduring sectional attitudes, suggests the nation's memory of the conflict is far from resolved. To cite just the most obvious disagreement, there's the matter of the Confederate flag, and whether it is a symbol of Southern pride or of racism. That's a debate that regularly resurfaces at colleges and state capitols. For me, as an architectural his - torian, the American past is linked to places. I see stories in houses and, in recent visits to several dozen Civil War-era dwellings\u2014from New England to Louisiana, from Illinois to Charleston\u2014my idiosyncratic house tour offered a fresh vantage for lifting some of the more opaque of the Civil War's mythic overlays. The well-re - stored house doesn't lie, and revisiting the war's characters at home has left me with a more nuanced view of the war between the states. i understood in childhood that the yeomen of the North fought to free the enslaved. Yet to travel to Ralph Waldo Emerson's home in Concord is to be reminded how mistaken was the presumption that average, mid-nine - teenth-century farmers and factory workers in Massachusetts harbored abolitionist sympathies. They didn't. Just the word aboli - tionist made people angry. To most New Englanders, abolitionists seemed bent on solving other peoples' prob - lems while impoverishing the North, which relied on Southern cotton to fuel its textile mills. Emerson discovered the depth of resistance to abolitionism in 1844, when he went public with his opposition to slavery. The ownership of slaves, though once legal in the region, had never been widespread and had ended decades ear - lier. Yet when the Women's Antislavery Association invited Emerson to speak, it met one obstacle after another. Hoping to host the lecture in a local church, the ladies found that the sub - ject cowed the elders at all the nearby houses of worship. When rain pre - vented an outdoor lecture\u2014Nathaniel Hawthorne had offered his glade\u2014the Concord Town Hall became the venue, but the man charged with tolling the town bell refused to announce the gathering. Emerson's young friend Henry David Thoreau had to ring the bell himself. Emerson drafted his address in his study at Bush, his home beside the rutted dirt road known as the Cambridge Turnpike. From the out - side, it resembles many houses built for middling men at the time. But to walk beneath the columned portico and into one of the front rooms is to don Emerson's thinking cap. A wall of books towers over a Windsor rocker Bush, the home Emerson bought for $3,500 in 1835, is a classic five-bay structure with a hip- roof. More imposing houses line the well- preserved streets of his town, but Emerson, who had chosen to leave the pulpit, continued to plumb his conscience here for nearly half a century. The final decade of his life saw a devastating fire (in 1872). Today, however, the house of the \"Concord Sage,\" including his well-appointed study, looks much as it did in his own time. all portrait photos: courtesy of the library of congress; all architectural photos: r oger straus iii fall 2014 | tufts magazine 37 and a pedestal parlor table; this was the study where Emerson wrote speeches and essays. Nearby a hall tree holds the walking sticks that Emerson, an invet - erate walker, used on his contemplative strolls. The lecture he delivered at the town hall called for \"a moral revolution\" and an end to \"the habit of oppres - sion.\" Though labeled a fanatic, he remained undeterred. Soon Bush's barn housed fugitive slaves moving north on the Underground Railroad. Emerson would welcome into his home both John Brown and, later, the man's fatherless daughters after Brown was hanged at Harper's Ferry. His neighbors thought Waldo too militant; most had little firsthand knowl - edge of slavery or African-Americans, who made up less than one percent of the North's population. In childhood, I knew many houses like Emerson's, but on visiting Bush, I felt both misplaced and at home. Raised by con - servative Yankees in the Emersonian hills of central Massachusetts, I understand why such antipathy greeted his aboli - tionist coming-out: there is a perpetual tension between the wish to do right and an instinctive resistance to change. Abolitionism would gain adherents in the years to come, but even with the cannonade at Sumter in April 1861, only a small minority in the North thought slavery a rationale for war. on a hilltop in northeast Washington, Abraham Lincoln finally decided what was to be done about the enslaved. In 1862, the president and his family had taken summer refuge in a Gothic Revival-style cottage, a stucco dwell - ing with multiple rooflines and tall chimney pots. Their domicile shared the property with the much larger Soldiers' Home, which housed disabled veterans. Lincoln played with his son Tad in and around the spacious house, as did the soldiers stationed nearby, who dubbed the boy their \"third lieu - tenant.\" In the evening, the president read Shakespeare to his male secretar - ies and regaled them with tales from his deep store of anecdote. In short, Lincoln diverted himself from the tribulations of war. I found it telling that, in the summer of 1862, Mary Todd confided that her husband, a chronic insomniac, slept hardly at all. He took late-night rambles around the Soldier's Home grounds, newly declared a national cemetery. The sight of the fresh graves of men he had sent into battle helped galvanize him to draft the Emancipation Proclamation. Though it did not free the slaves in the The woodwork offers the clearest clues to the architectural style at Lincoln's Cottage. Note the \"gingerbread\" of the porch's flattened arches and the intricately cut bargeboards that line the gables. The American version of Gothic Revival\u2014it began as an English taste, typically employing stone\u2014 relied on the new technology of the scroll saw to produce its decorative elements. Inside the home, Lincoln and his son Tad were known to play checkers in the library, with its lozenge (diamond-shaped) windows, another Gothic Revival touch. 38 tufts magazine | fall 2014 CreateUnion border states (that would have risked the defection of Maryland and Missouri), the landmark document signaled that the war was being fought not only to save the Union but to free the slaves, an important message to the South's many friends in England. Britons could no longer avert their gaze; Lincoln had put slavery front and center, and the Confederacy's chances of gaining much-needed British recog - nition plummeted. Modern savior narratives such as Spielberg's Lincoln would have us believe that the sixteenth president went to war to gain equality for black Americans. But in reading accounts of life at Lincoln's Cottage, examining corre - spondence, and visiting the place itself, I came to recognize that the evolution of Lincoln's racial thinking was an ambig - uous journey. Although Lincoln had expressed his moral opposition to slav - ery many years earlier, the Emancipation Proclamation, drafted during those July weeks, was primarily a war measure. It was born of his desire to stanch the loss of life and to win the war sooner by undermining the Confederacy's war efforts, which relied upon slaves for provisioning and other support. While Lincoln was clearly a man of ideals (preservation of the Union foremost among them), equality of the races was not on his list. That same summer he consulted African-American leaders to advocate colo - nization, the return of dark-skinned peoples to Africa. \"Even when you cease to be slaves,\" he warned, \"you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race.\" He had spoken against \"Negro equality\" in debating Stephen Douglas in 1858, and would not advocate suffrage for blacks until the very last speech of his life. It wasn't any sort of \"postracial think - ing\" that revealed itself in Lincoln's proclamation, but rather his gift for pragmatism in the service of multiple principles\u2014namely, adding freedom to the cause of union. These days the summer cottage contains few furnishings (little evi - dence survives of what the Lincolns brought to their summer residence), but the visitor encounters Lincoln's thoughts through audio and video. His carefully crafted phrases echo in the empty spaces, asking us to ponder the challenges Lincoln faced. my trip to georgia grew from a book written in Boston harbor. Barely a month after Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Alexander Stephens, vice president of the Confederacy, arrived at Fort Warren, on Georges Island. On May 27, 1865, he began a journal, his purpose to preserve \"some reg - ular record of the incidents of [my] imprisonment.\" The small, sickly Stephens\u2014 five-seven and less than a hundred pounds\u2014left a compelling account of his incarceration, describing bed - bugs, his \"low, underground, damp room,\" and his jailers' kindly char - acter. He often pined for his \"dear home\" in Crawfordville, Georgia. His Recollections would be published post - humously, but Stephens' correspon - dence with President Andrew Johnson had a speedier significance. In October 1865, Johnson pardoned Stephens, who was never charged with a crime, and \"Little Aleck\" returned home. Visiting Liberty Hall, one gains an intimate view of the man. It isn't so dif - ferent from Emerson's Bush, despite the taller ceilings at Stephens' home. Several homemade wheelchairs are on view, used by Stephens after a heavy gate crushed one of his legs. It's a place where he was loved\u2014family and former slaves alike wept at his homecoming. He grew up an orphan, receiving aid from other people as he pursued an education, and numerous young men read law under his tutelage in the Liberty Hall library. During the war, wounded soldiers found accommodations in his home; afterward, transients were welcomed to the \"Tramps' Room.\" Stephens could never accept the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which granted citizen - ship and the franchise to people of African descent. He remained true to his words to his fellow Georgians, delivered in Savannah on March 21, 1861, on his return from the Confederate constitutional convention. Claiming that Union policy was based on equality of the races, Stephens told his audience, \"our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea, . . . the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery\u2014subordination to the supe - rior race\u2014is his natural and normal condition.\" Yet Stephens had initially opposed secession and, more than anyone else in the Confederacy, he looked to nego - tiate a peace, meeting with Lincoln aboard the River Queen in Hampton Roads, Virginia, in early 1865. Lincoln remembered him fondly from their shared congressional days two decades Visiting lincoln's cottage, i came to recognize that the eVolution of his racial thinking w as an ambiguous journey .fall 2014 | tufts magazine 39 before, remarking, as he helped the little man out of his wool greatcoat, \"Never have I seen so small a nubbin come out of so much husk.\" But the friends reached no understanding to speed the peace. Returning to Congress after the war, Stephens sat in the House wrapped in a cloak and layers of cloth - ing (\"a queer-looking bundle,\" wrote one reporter). As Edmund Wilson observed, \"It was as if he had shrunk to pure principle, abstract, incandescent, indestructible.\" Alexander Stephens\u2014no monster, an admirable man in some ways\u2014nev - ertheless embodied a pernicious para - dox: for him, the \"subordination of the inferior race\" was a benevolent solution to a social problem. His Liberty Hall home survives, a sleepy museum and an incidental sideshow in a state park where visitors of all races enjoy camp - ing, swimming, and horseback riding.named for its spectacular view overlooking the Gulf of Mexico, Beauvoir is undoubtedly America's least likely presidential site. Like Stephens, Confederate President Jefferson Davis was imprisoned. Unlike Stephens, he refused a pardon: he wanted his day in court. Instead, he was incarcerated for two years without trial, his legs shackled, at Fort Monroe, Virginia, sharing a small room with armed guards and all-night light. On his release, Davis's vision, hearing, and memory had deteriorated, but he remained unrepentant. In the next decade, he would wend his way toward Biloxi, Mississippi, and Beauvoir, where he lived his last dozen years. Beauvoir is as much a survivor as Davis was. Ravaged by Katrina and then meticulously restored, the Greek Revival house, with its broad roof overhangs and enveloping porches, today stands proudly, sharing its site with the Jefferson Davis Presidential Library. The Sons of Confederate Veterans, Mississippi Division, maintain the library and Beauvoir as \"a perpet - ual memorial sacred to the memory of Jefferson Davis, the only president of the Confederate States of America, and sacred to the memory of his family and 'the Lost Cause.' \" It's a simple-seeming epithet, but, for me, the Lost Cause amounts to the missing skeleton key that opens the doorway to both Jeff Davis and the view many Southerners still have of the Civil War. The conceit\u2014in essence, that the good and genteel culture of the Old South was unfairly wiped out by the war\u2014is almost as old as the war itself, dating to a like-named 1866 book by Edward Pollard, a Richmond newspa - perman. Pollard and followers offered a partisan gloss on the war, assert - ing that the South possessed better Stephens called his home Liberty Hall, he explained, \"because I do as I please here and expect my guests to do the same.\" Before the Civil War, Liberty Hall's acres included a mix of orchards, a vineyard, and gardens that produced vegetables and showy roses. Stephens later recalled that, after Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, he sat quietly in his parlor, playing a game of casino, when a slave brought word that Yankee soldiers had come to arrest him. The messenger may have been his manservant, Harry, who would remain at Liberty Hall as a freeman until Stephens' death in 1883. 40 tufts magazine | fall 2014 Createsoldiery; that the Confederate army wasn't beaten but overwhelmed; that Robert E. Lee was \"godlike,\" Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson a true Christian martyr, and Ulysses S. Grant a butcher. Contrary to Winston Churchill's claim that the victors get to the write the history, the Lost Cause has animated mainstream texts for a cen - tury. That's changing, as research by historians north and south discounts the claims of Pollard and company. The most essential Lost Cause assertion\u2014that seceding states went to war to preserve not slavery but states' rights\u2014is now regarded by most historians as a disingenuous overstatement, for which some of the responsibility falls to Jefferson Davis. Tellingly, his 1881 opus, The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government , written at Beauvoir, was originally titled Our Cause . A West Point graduate, Davis served his first nation as a U.S. Army colonel, a U.S. senator, and an effective secretary of war. Then, in 1861, like many other Confederates (Lee among them), Davis decided his first allegiance was to his region. Driven by duty, he led the losing side, only to be incarcerated with - out due process. In time, he went from displaced person to lord of the manor, visited at Beauvoir by former Confederate generals, as well as Joseph Pulitzer and even Oscar Wilde (after dining with Wilde, Davis retired early and later remarked of his guest, \"I did not like the man\"). Though imperious and stiff, he was no archvillain, a role once routinely assigned him. At Beauvoir, Davis' shaving mirror is poised before a window to catch the morning sun. One can almost see him performing his daily ablutions before it. His house contains big Victorian beds, quite like those at Emerson's Bush and Stephens' Liberty Hall. At any of these homes, it's easy to envision the eminent man rising from his ample bedclothes, breakfasting with his family, then settling at his desk to compose his thoughts for his peers and posterity. These are retrospective places, suitable settings for considering the humanity of the occupants as they wres - tled with a war over race and union. If modern Americans want to under - stand why these Civil War players acted as they did, we have to see beyond self-satisfied Northern righteousness and the South's hazy myth-making. So go and have a look for yourself. Catching these men in midthought may change how you view the Civil War\u2014and help you understand our own moment of rising sectionalism.

One visitor, writing in the Atlanta Constitution in 1879, reported finding a \"gentleman\" seated there, at \"a large table, covered with papers. . . . There was the first and last president of the Confederate States of America.\" It was at Beauvoir\u2014on its porches, in its comfort - able drawing room \u2014that Jefferson Davis found the peace and equanimity to write his memoirs and to fade away, surrounded much of the time in his last years by three generations of his family, as pictured here, circa 1884. fall 2014 | tufts magazine 41 Mixed Media our books and creative milestones By K ARA P ETER s FIcTION A DAngER To HIMsELF AnD oTHER s Verbitrage This first novel in the Bomb Squad NYC series, by J.E.

As Bacon aged, he fell into blind - ness and his handwriting deteriorated. As many of the guitar works are from his later years, they tend to be difficult documents. Many of the guitar works were left unpol - ished in regard to editing and notation: there are whited-out measures, missing details, and many notes and chords that are hard to decipher. Another issue is that Bacon was not a guitarist and didn't have a complete understanding of the instrument. Several works contain passages that, as written, simply didn't work on the guitar. In many ways, my task has been to come to understand Bacon's style, inclinations, and voice as a composer and use that understanding to decode, reconstruct, and adjust his manuscripts wherever they are ambiguous or lacking in detail. I took this responsibility very seriously.

Why exhume this ancient his - tory? Because in 2014, the phrase has returned to modern memory as we commemorate what seems to be a cen - tury of uninterrupted conflict. It began with the guns of August in 1914, when Europeans stumbled into a conflict one historian would dub \"the war that never ended.\" The treaties that concluded the Great War set the stage for every war that raged over the next century, from Israel and Iraq to Afghanistan; from Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia to Ukraine; from India to Cambodia; from Vietnam to China; from Korea to Japan. At Versailles in 1919, a young Vietnamese nationalist petitioned in vain for recognition of his country. The European powers had no intention of weakening their colonial authority, and the man later known as Ho Chi Minh returned to his homeland to begin the revolution. In fact, during the \"peaceful\" interlude between 1918 and 1939, there was not a year without significant fighting in some part of the world, often led by petitioners who had come back from Versailles embittered and ready to rid themselves of their European masters. Wrong maps were being drawn that would assure perpetual conflict in the former Ottoman Empire and Africa. The Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, incorporated into the peace settlements, created artificial states in Syria, Iraq, and Jordan, so that Great Britain and France could maintain control over the oil fields of the Middle East. The Balfour Declaration of 1917 acknowledged Great Britain's support for a Jewish national homeland in Palestine. Versailles left the British Raj in South Asia intact. Resentment over perceived injustice simmered after the peace treaties until it boiled over into aggression in the 1930s. Radical regimes took power in Italy, Germany, and Japan to redress the wrongs. Marxism, held in check by the entrenched powers at Versailles, spilled over into China. Twenty years after the first global conflict, the world was plunged into another. But even after the conclusion of World War II, there was no letup to the effects of decisions made and not made in 1919. India achieved its independence in 1947, followed by the fighting that brought Muslim Pakistan into existence. The next year Israel declared its independence, only to experience more than sixty years of armed conflict with its neighbors. Wars erupted on the Korean peninsula and in the former French colonies of Southeast Asia. While the United States and the USSR faced off against each other without pulling a trigger, surrogate European revolutions in the divided Germany and ethnically rebuilt Hungary and Czechoslovakia kept the pot boiling. Toward the end of the twentieth century, what the earlier treaties had built as \"Yugoslavia\" began to unravel. The ethnic hatreds that had led to the assassinations at Sarajevo in July 1914 emerged once more. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, the U.S. military and various allies have been fighting uninterrupted wars, often against an insurgency with - out borders. Now, ISIS is trying to rees - tablish the eighth-century enlightened caliphate that stretched from beautiful Baghdad to Cordoba and taught the world city planning, science, mathe - matics, and medicine when Paris and London were mud-covered villages\u2014only this new \"caliphate\" lacks any hint of enlightenment. Wars in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq are threatening to redraw the maps of the region first cre - ated by British and French diplomats at Versailles nearly a century ago. They, in turn, will likely lead to new conflicts. The original Hundred Years War differed in at least one important respect from the century of hostilities we are marking in 2014: it actually ended after a hundred years. Perhaps what we are in the midst of now is the first Two Hundred Years War. soL gITTLEMA n, the Alice and n athan g antcher University Professor, has been a professor of g erman, Judaic studies, and biblical literature and is a former provost of the university. illustration: ward schumakerCredit: tK fall 2014 | tufts magazine 45 JUMBOMANIA A poster heralding the arrival of Jumbo the elephant in New York City in 1882 is among dozens of artifacts assembled by Andrew McClellan, a professor of art and art history, for an exhibition at Tufts, Jumbo: Marvel, Myth, and Mascot .

But the future icon had no sooner reached the Barnum Museum of Natural History\u2014today's Barnum Hall\u2014than he hit another snag: his eleven-foot-tall frame wouldn't fit through the door. The entire entryway had to be dismantled. P.T. Barnum, the founding trustee who had bestowed the remains of his celebrated elephant on Tufts, expressed in a letter to the museum's curator his hope that \"the trouble you have had in putting Jumbo in place will be more than compensated in the advertisement it will give Tufts College.\" Barnum got his wish. Jumbo would lend his name to generations of Tufts sports teams, students, and gradu - ates, not to mention outsize jets, olives, and loans. And now, 125 years after Tufts adopted Jumbo, he is being f\u00eated with an exhibition, a book, and a statue. The exhibition, arranged by McClellan, shares its title with his book\u2014the companion volume to the show\u2014and runs at the Koppelman Family Gallery in the Aidekman Arts Center until December 7. Its assemblage of photos, postcards, posters, newspaper clippings, and memorabilia tells the story of the gen - tle giant that was captured as an infant in East Africa in 1862 and shipped to the Paris Zoo and thence to the London Zoo, where he became famous for his size and kindly disposition, cheerfully giving rides to thousands of children, including the young Teddy of theHourElEpHantConnect fall 2014 | tufts magazine 47 fall 2014 | tufts magazine 47 ElEpHant in a publicity shot taken at the london Zoo in 1882, shortly after his purchase by p .t.

Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. In 1882, Jumbo was sold for \u00a32,000 (roughly $220,000 in today's money) to Barnum, with whose circus he toured both sides of the Atlantic. He became a bonafide superstar. Even posthumously, after his fateful run-in with an unscheduled freight train in St. Thomas, Ontario, in 1885, Jumbo's name and image contin - ued to show up on countless products. Later this academic year, Jumbo will be memorialized with a life-size bronze statue commissioned from the artist Stephen Whyte and underwritten by Dick Reynolds, A67, the universi - ty's former vice president of operations. The sculpture, closely modeled on a photo taken at the London Zoo (see page 47), will be installed in front of Barnum Hall. As McClellan makes clear in his book\u2014from which the images in this article are taken\u2014Tufts is lucky to have as its mascot an animal so full of cultural and historical reso - nance. He writes, \"Jumbo's life intersected with so many important strands of modern American history: the rise of mass entertainment, of museums, of advertising, and the notion of celebrity itself.\" \u2014THE EDITORS To order your copy of Jumbo: Marvel, Myth, and Mascot , Professor Andrew McClellan's richly illustrated companion volume to the current exhibition on the Medford/Somerville campus, visit Tufts' eCommerce Marketplace at bit.ly/Jumbo_book .

The institute, which launched on August 28 in new laboratories on the Boston campus, is a major initiative of the university's strategic plan, Tufts: The Next 10 Years (T10). What distinguishes TII from similar research cen - ters, says Tufts President Anthony P. Monaco, is that \"from the outset, findings in the laboratory will be tightly and deliberately coupled with strategies for implementing them around the world. TII is a univer - sity-wide commitment to science for social good.\" To support the institute's startup, Monaco has allocated funds that were bequeathed to the university; he intends to make the institute a priority in Tufts' next capital campaign. Four projects addressing the TII's inaugural research theme, \"Microbes: Improving the Environment and the Human Condition,\" were chosen to receive seed funding: Waterborne diseases. A team led by Elena Naumova (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Department of Public Health and Community Medicine) and Kurt Pennell (Civil and Environmental Engineering) seeks to reduce the public health burden of waterborne infectious diseases in Ghana and India. They are collaborating with colleagues from Christian Medical College in Vellore, India, and the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at the University of Ghana. Lyme disease. Sam Telford (Infectious Disease and Global Health) and his group are developing an oral vaccine to reduce the prevalence of the microbe in mice that causes Lyme disease. Their goal is to reduce trans - mission of the Lyme-causing bacterium to humans. hospita L infection. Xingmin Sun (Infectious Disease and Global Health) and his team are working on a vaccine against a stubborn hospital-acquired infection, Clostridium difficile , which kills nearly 30,000 people in the United States alone each year. They're target - ing those at highest risk for infection, including the elderly and patients with weakened immune systems. tb test. Gillian Beamer (Infectious Disease and Global Health) and her research team are developing a nearly instantaneous diagnostic test for tuber - culosis. The project is addressing the limitations of existing tests, including heat stability, portability, and rapid results. To ensure that discoveries get to those who need them most, each research team will recruit other Tufts Real-W orld Science The Tufts Institute for Innovation crosses disciplines to take on global problems By J ACqUElINE MITCHE ll illustration: federico jordanfall 2014 | tufts magazine 51 fall 2014 | tufts magazine 51 faculty who can help surmount the political, cultural, regulatory, infra - structure, and economic barriers that can hinder scientific breakthroughs from having significance beyond the laboratory. \"When you have an out - come that really addresses a problem, you realize it's not just about the sci - ence or the technology,\" says David R. Walt, a University Professor and TII's founding director. \"It's about actually understanding the problem and getting the right people in the room who have experience in those areas.\" While TII work will be conducted on all three campuses, the institute's base is in five thousand square feet of newly renovated laboratory, office, and meeting space in the Biomedical Research & Public Health Building. The TII research teams\u2014which will include undergraduates and graduate stu - dents\u2014will also tap the resources of the Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology next door in the Jaharis Center, the new Arnold 8 biosafety laboratory upstairs that was built to advance research in infectious diseases, and Boston's world-class hospitals. INTO THE FIElD With first-year seed funding and incu - bator lab space assured, the research teams will seek funding from external sources to complete their work. In an era of tight federal resources, funding agencies typically want a grant appli - cation to contain preliminary results produced by highly cross-disciplinary teams, Walt says. The TII model is designed to make Tufts more competi - tive in seeking such funding. The teams will eventually transition out of the TII laboratory and into the field. Many of the TII research projects will have both social and commercial value, says Lauren Linton, who joined Tufts in July as TII's deputy director. \"TII is designed to foster continuous waves of discovery and entrepreneur - ship,\" she says. Future projects might engineer microbes for cleaning up oil spills or harvesting carbon out of the air, according to John Leong, chair of the Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology and a member of the institute's executive committee. TII could solve problems in fields such as medicine, engineering, the environ - ment, and public health because it fuses strengths across disciplines, he says. Additional thematic areas of research will be developed in the future, and other Tufts faculty will be invited to submit proposals that sup - port those areas. Says Monaco: \"With our expertise in human and animal models of disease, international busi - ness and policy, engineering, the envi - ronment, the humanities and humani - tarian issues, and geopolitical contexts and challenges, Tufts is uniquely positioned to produce discoveries that improve the human condition.\" JACqUElINE MITCHE ll is a senior health sciences writer at Tufts.

Currently the director of development at the Two Ten Footwear Foundation in Waltham, Massachusetts, she spent twelve years on the Hill as a staff member and graduate student. Kaplan recently shared a little bit about herself and her hopes for her new post as president of the Tufts University Alumni Association (TUAA). You went to Oberlin as an undergrad. Why volunteer for Tufts? I'm totally in love with Tufts. I started working here when I was twenty-two as a staff assistant to Professor Rob Hollister in Urban and Environmental Policy and got my master's. My Tufts experience was really about growing as a young professional, and it was a very influential and positive part of my life. How does your background as a Tufts graduate student affect how you see the university and its alumni? I think we need to stop automatically thinking of Tufts students as under - graduates and consider the different experiences people have of the univer - sity. I'd like to see us build unity among the schools and stronger relationships among their respective alumni. We're all Jumbos, and we can only benefit from engaging with each other. What do you love most about Tufts? I love the people. Tufts alumni are so smart and passionate, and I'm proud to be aligned with the TUAA. I also love seeing the school's progress. I've seen a rapid maturing of the organization, and it's really exciting. Tufts' focus on international relations, public service, and environmentalism, and now the new T10 Strategic Plan initiatives to bridge the different disciplines\u2014they all really resonate with me.What do you hope to accomplish as president? I see myself as a conductor whose responsibility is to build the leadership that's going to continue to evolve the TUAA. I'd like to further improve communication with Tufts alumni and encourage alumni to become involved in different ways. We've also been hearing from undergraduates that they need help with their careers, so another goal is to really tie alumni to students, amplifying what Career Services is already doing so well. If not on the Tufts campus, where might we find Kate Kaplan? I'm usually spending time with my family\u2014my husband, two teenage daughters, and our adorable mini- goldendoodle dog, Chester. I've been a Girl Scout leader for the past nine years, and I'm also a back-of-the-pack triathlete.

Go through your presentation three to five times\u2014enough so that the talking points come to you readily. Practice in the real setting whenever possible. Breathe like a B aBy. That is, deeply and slowly, so that your belly rises and falls. It will slow your heart rate, provide your brain with much-needed oxygen, cen - ter you psychologically, and help make your voice strong and authoritative. remem Ber how low the stakes are. Public speaking is not a perilous adventure, no matter how much you may feel that it is. Even a failed presentation will rarely result in your being fired, demoted, or even seriously compromised in your job. Don't P icture your au Dience in their un Derwear. Don't speak to people's foreheads, either. Such suggestions are remarkably unconstructive, because they take you away from the here and now, rather than helping you deal with it. Get over yourself. Hey, what makes you think people are attending your presenta - tion because of you? The truth is, they're there because they hope to get something out of it. Understand that the audience is at the center of the entire public speak - ing dynamic. Imagine that the spotlight aimed at you is actually within you, and the warm glow of your knowledge and goodwill is bathing your listeners.CoMM on- SenSe Mana Ger al SouS a, a51, former vice president, Met life, Greenville, rhode Island look B efore you D eleGate. Don't assign tasks at random\u2014asking your marketing whiz to help you with something that requires a detailed knowledge of your financial situation, for example. You could end up with a botched budget, and at the very least, you'll be wasting Ms. Marketing's talent and time. Instead, decide what skills and background a job requires, and then consider who can best deliver. Be clear. Don't over-rely on pep talks to get people going. Instead, make sure they understand what you want them to do, and what's in it for them. Workers are much more motivated when they feel they have their work cut out for them. listen. Listening is difficult even in the best of times, and doing it well often takes extra effort. Part of the problem is that the brain works much faster than is required to process the words others are speaking. As a result, we can end up focusing on what we want to say next instead of really taking in what people are telling us. expert advice from our readersfall 2014 | tufts magazine 75 appS For loCavore S danIelle nI erenB erG, F01, president, Food Tank, Washington, d .C.

We often worry about rubbing a success in a struggling parent's face. But most of our triumphs are born out of hard work. Give that backstory its due. celeBrate your frien Ds' ProuD Par- entin G moments. We all have different parenting sweet spots. When you brag about your champion-sleeper baby to a couple with perpetual bags under their eyes, be sure to share in their joy over how smoothly feeding is going for them. And for crying out loud, let them know you're aware of what a drag sleep is for them right now. remem Ber that your frien D's success is not your failure. When we see a friend succeeding where we're strug - gling, it's easy to feel like we're parent - ing wrong. If you're on the receiving end of a brag, try not to compare, and instead share your own victories. If you still feel bad, you can always say, \"I'm so glad that approach worked for you.

The three photos on display here are part of the exhibition Manna: Masterworks from the Tufts University Permanent Art Collection , on view until December 7. It showcases forty-seven of the finest pieces Tufts has acquired, among them works by Pablo Picasso, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Walker Evans, and Louise Nevelson. Calling Marie Pereto-Hedin, J68, and her husband, Frank Pereto, art aficionados would be an understatement. Although she was a political science major, Marie lived music at Tufts. She minored in the subject, performed with the Tufts University Concert Chorale, and was president of the Music Honor Society. Today Marie can be found singing with the Quincy Choral Society. Frank, meanwhile, has pursued painting and photography. The couple, who met while Frank was consulting at the company where Marie worked, is just as enthusiastic about their support of Tufts. Marie has volunteered on multiple reunion committees, pitching in to help plan Alumni Weekend events. And while Frank has no official affiliation to the university, he wears his Jumbo badge with pride as a result of the warmth shown by the Tufts community. Marie and Frank have chosen to support students focusing on the arts and humanities at Tufts through a bequest in their estate plans. \"These areas are close to our hearts,\" says Marie. \"We are both driven by that creative urge, and we want to make sure students in these areas receive the support they need.\" \" We don't think of our bequest as giving back; we think of it as giving forward.\" For more information please contact Tufts' Gift Planning Office: 888.748.8387 | giftplanning@tufts.edu | www.tufts.edu/giftplanning www.facebook.com/CharlesTuftsSociety magazine 80 George Street Medford, MA 02155 22 Lives of the dammed 34 Civil War houses 10 Space-time portal 46 Jumbo's "}
