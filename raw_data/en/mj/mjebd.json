The negative aspects of aging are one of the most ubiquitous challenges to quality of life. However, one thing is for sure: scientists believe that a big part of the reason we experience aging the way we do is because of stressed or worn-out cells called senescent cells. Senolytics is a term used to describe ingredients shown to help decrease these damaging senescent cells. A well-formulated senolytic's goals are similar to those of pruning a plant: support efficient use of cellular resources, encourage the regeneration of more youthful cells, and ultimately support tissue health and appearance\u2014promoting whole-body cellular rejuvenation. Since senescent cells are experts at surviving, a senolytic formula can't rely on just a single ingredient to deliver results. Instead, a multi-pronged approach helps give the body the best opportunity to reduce its senescent cell load. My guest on this show - Gregory Kelly - has helped to develop several rare and powerful compounds that have scientifically shown senolytic activity, and which collectively cover a broader range of mechanisms than existing senolytic supplements on the market. His protocol, which we discuss on this show, involves a two-day rejuvenation regimen that he suggests using every month. Intermittent short-duration dosing is the most common way that senolytics are used in studies, and data suggests that it can take weeks for senescent cells to re-accumulate in the body, which is why Greg recommends this approach. Greg's compound, called \" [Senolytic](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/qualiasenolyticpod)\" and made by my friends at [Neurohacker Collective](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/qualiasenolyticpod), includes the following senolytic ingredients: - Fisetin (from Rhus succedanea Stem Extract): Supports tissue health by helping with pruning of stressed cells - Quercefit\u00ae Quercetin Phytosome (Sophora japonica L. Flower Extract / Phospholipid Complex from Sunflower): Supports tissue health by helping with pruning of stressed cells* - Longvida Optimized Curcumin\u00ae Extract (from Curcuma longa Root): Supports brain health and cognitive function* - Olive Leaf Extract: Supports management of stressed cells in joints* - Soybean Seed Extract: Supports healthy cellular functions involved in managing stressed cells* - Luteolin (from Sophora japonica L. Flower Extract): Supports tissue health by helping with pruning of stressed cells* - Milk Thistle Seed Extract: Supports liver health and management of stressed cells* - Piperlongumine (from Piper longum Root Extract): Supports senolytic and immune stressed cells* - Senactiv\u00ae (Panax notoginseng Root Extract and Rosa roxburghii Fruit Extract): Supports exercise recovery and management of senescent cells in muscle So who is Greg, exactly? Dr. Gregory Kelly, a highly accomplished naturopathic physician (N.D.), has an extensive background in natural medicine and nutrition. As the Director of Product Development at [Neurohacker Collective](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/qualiasenolyticpod) and author of the book Shape Shift, Dr. Kelly has made significant contributions to the field. He has also taught Advanced Clinical Nutrition, Counseling Skills, and Doctor-Patient Relationships at the University of Bridgeport in the College of Naturopathic Medicine, and was the editor of the journal Alternative Medicine Review. With numerous articles and more than 30 journal articles indexed on Pubmed, Dr. Kelly is a leading authority in areas such as nootropics, anti-aging and regenerative medicine, weight management, and the chronobiology of performance and health.
