From early January 2023 on, hospital admissions decreased in all age groups. In the last 8 weeks (13 December 2022 to 6 February 2023), the incidence of hospital admission was highest among unvaccinated people aged 80 and older. The incidence of ICU admission was highest among unvaccinated people aged 80-89 years. However, the absolute number of hospital and ICU admissions was relatively low in this period. Among people who had received a repeat vaccination in the autumn round, the risk of hospital admission due to COVID-19 was 41% lower in the age group of 40-59 years, 59% lower in the age group of 60-79 years, and 53% in the age group of 80 years and older. This was in comparison to people the same age who had received at least one vaccination, but had not received the repeat vaccination in the autumn round. People who do not have the same vaccination status may also have differences in vulnerability (underlying health conditions) or the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections they have had. Therefore, a comparison of hospital and ICU admission rates between people with a different vaccination status cannot be exclusively used to indicate vaccine effectiveness. Everyone who has been invited to get a COVID-19 vaccination in the basic series, but has not yet done so, can still be vaccinated. In addition, since 19 September 2022, it is possible to get a [repeat vaccination](https://www.rivm.nl/en/covid-19-vaccination/questions-and-background-information/repeat-vaccination) against COVID-19. This repeat vaccination in the autumn round is available to everyone aged 12 years and older who has at least completed the basic series of COVID-19 vaccinations. The vaccination is available from 3 months after the most recent COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. "}
