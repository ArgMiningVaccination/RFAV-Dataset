Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exists in hundreds to thousands of copies in each cell and encodes for 13 structural proteins which are subunits of respiratory chain. Mitochondria ge nerate energy for cellular processes by producing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Also , they control other processes heme syntheses, redox balance, calcium metab olism, waste management (urea ROS) and apoptosis. mtDNA deletions, point mutations, thymine dimers and mtDNA depletions are strongly related with disease in humans and other mammals. So me mtDNA alterations can arise spontaneously during life spam, other can be inheri ted by maternal lineage as specific mutations. So, nuclear DNA mutations can produce mitochondrial d isorders because while mtDNA encodes 13 proteins, mitochondria need almost 2000 p roteins with structural and functional roles. In these cases, a mendelian inheritance pattern can be observed. mtDNA alterations can be produced by exposure to toxic substances or UV and hig h-energy radiations. mtDNA mutations are cumulative because mitochondria lack reparative mechan isms. Normal and mutant mtDNA can coexist in the same cell, a condition known as heteroplasm y. Heteroplasmy allows the persistence of an otherwise lethal mutation through g enerations. Mitochondrial disorders can appear or diseases or haematological and renal disorders. Due to heteroplasmy, these disorders can appear with a wide range of intensities, because the mutant mtDNA needed to cause a disorder varies among organisms, among organ systems and within a given tissue, and depends on a delicate balance between ATP supply and demand. Another kind of problem surges at tissues under hypoxemic- related damage, where mitochondria play an important role in cell survival and recovery. Finally, the role played by mitochondria in cancer survival and treatment is focused in m any researches. Mitochondrial disorders have not a single treatment. In the most serious cases of inherited mitochondrial diseases, the supportive treatment only improves the life quality slightly. Nowadays, the most of experimental approaches search prevents the clinical manifestations of these diseases by reducing the mutant mtDNA percentage into the oocyte or the early emb ryo via nuclear transfer. Artificial Mitochondrial Transfer/Transplant (AMT/T) rises as an alternative to many acquired or inherited mitochondrial disorders, both ex vivo , in vitro and in vivo conditions . For this reason, our main objective is the updating of Mi toception to two cell models: PBMC's and murine oocyte. The present work shows the variation of an AMT/T method -MitoCeption- in a cellular model for in vitro treatment of acquired mt DNA disorder caused by UV Radiation by using Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and the feasibi lity of the same method for ex vivo AMT/T to murine oocytes and early embryos . In this model, we had found that irradiated PMBC's shown a reduction of mitochondrial mass, metabolic activity, viable mtDNA and cell Flow Cytometry, MTT and Trypan Stain, shown a re storation of mitochondrial mass, metabolic activity, viable mtDNA and cell survivance , detected by the same methods. In this in vitro model of cell damage by UV radiation, the main results represent an upgradin g in the applications of AMT/T. We showed that PBMCs could be used as a primary allogeneic mi xed source of mitochondria. We also showed that these mitochondria can be transferred in a mix from different donors (PAMM) to UVR-damaged, non-adherent primary cells. Addi tionally, the duration of the MitoCeption protocol was reduced. On the other hand, Mitoception used on murine oocytes and early embryos probed to be a safe method for AMT/T by using human 4 mtDNA was quantified by qPCR and 2CT method. Finally, healthy murine new-borns were obtained by embryo transfer, without clear evidence that human mitochondria remain in murine cells during embryos development after implantation. 5 R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Selon ROS) et l'apoptose.

The human cell and the mitochondria a. THE HUMAN CELL Biology studies life, how different organisms and its structures maintain homeostasis, adapt to change and die. To facilitate its study, life is organized in l evels of complexity such as cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, populations, communities, ecosy stem, and biosphere. Among organisms, they can be categorized in two broad types: u nicellular or multicellular. The latter includes all the more complex living beings inclu ding humans, with multiple cell to cell interactions that even today are not fully understood ( Mason, Losos, Singer, & Raven, 2017). The cell is considered the basic unit of life, where all life-sustaining bi ochemical reactions happen. It is characterized by having a complex and active boundary allowing it to interact with its surroundings, known as the plasma membrane (Pollard, Earnshaw, Lippincot- Schwartz, & Johnson, 2017) . Membrane components are in a diversity of states fluctuating from immobilized to completely crosswise and rotationally mobile (with axis o f rotation perpendicular to the membrane plane), as was emphasized in the fluid mosaic model, in which in tegral membrane proteins were proposed to be fixed in a lipid bilayer plain (Jacobson, Liu, & Lagerholm, 2019). The plasma membrane and limiting membranes of organelles fun ction to demarcate and coordinate cellular functions, allowing the separation of metabolites and enz ymatic reactions. Significant to such coordination is the subdivision of intracellular space into fu nctional compartments. Compartmentalization can be reached by intracellular membranes, which surround organelles and act as physical barriers. In addition, cells have developed complex mechanisms to divide their cytosol in a closely regulated manner (Aguzzi & Altmey er, 2016). Some structures and the molecular pathways involved are shared among life forms, as they all descended from a common progenitor that lived 3 to 4 billion years ago. Even though this progenitor no longer exists, its descendants had spread into three domains : Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (J. Xiao et al., 2019). The last one, Eukarya , is characterized by the presence of the nucleus, a membrane-bound compartment that contains the genetic information of a cell, the DNA. The genetic material inside the nucleus can be found as a coiled structure with linear bundles called chromosomes. Furthermore, eukaryotic cells have also others internal structures microtubules, micr ofilaments, and intermediate filaments, which play an important role in defining the cell's organization and shape (Figure 1). These features are neither present in Bacteria nor Archaea domains (Dacks et al., 2016). Additionally, eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than prokary otes with an average volume of 10,000 times greater than prokaryotic cells (Yamaguchi & Worman, 2014) (Figure 1). 21 Figure 1. Basic Cellular Architecture. A, Section of a eukaryotic cell showing its internal and general components: Structures as cell wall and chloroplast are exclusive of plants , while cilia and flagella are exclusive of protist and animal cells. B, Comparison of cells from the mayor branches of the phylogenetic tree (Pollard et al., 2017). Among the Eukarya domain Plantae, Fungi and Protista . All Eukaryotic cells differ among them, for example, animal cells lack an exterior wall and chloroplasts and obtain energy by ingesting nutrients and even other living c ells (Mason et al., 2017) (see Figure 1) whereas plant cells can obtain energy from inorg anic compounds and possess the aforementioned cellular wall and chloroplasts . As an individual unit, the cell can absorbs and metabolizes its own nutrients in order to obtain energy (catalysis) an d components, it also can produce other types of molecules (synthesis), eliminates metabolic was te (excretion), interacts with the surrounding environment (irritability and secretion) and proliferate in o rder to produce succeeding generations (reproduction). In fact, most unicellular organis ms reproduce by binary fission, an asexual process where there are no differences between the progeny and the progenitor cell. On the other hand, some multicellular organisms reproduce via sexual reproduction , in which new organisms are created, by combining the genetic information from two individuals of different sexes. The genetic material is carried on chromosomes within the nucl eus of specialized sex cells called gametes. In males, these gametes are named spermatozoa and in females the gametes are called eggs or oocytes. During sexual reproduction the two g ametes join in a fusion process known as fertilization, to create a zygote. Th e zygote is the precursor to an embryo offspring, which DNA is inherited half from each of its parents. The genetic information contained in cells is subject to errors or changes, called mutations that cumulate within DNA over time, through cell mitosis. In unic ellular organisms, asexual reproduction simply passes these mutations on to their offspring, while organisms which combine their DNA through sexual reproduction allow only a portion of their mutations t o pass to their offspring, increasing their probabilities of survival. This effect is increased throug h 22 natural selection, where individuals with exceptionally harmful mutations are un able to pass on their genes through sexual reproduction (Cavalier-Smith, 2010). Cell differentiation implies the specialization to one or more of the functions men tioned above. During differentiation and specialization, the cell adapt its own structures to perform an specific function or role (Alberts, 2015). For instance, to obtain a cell specialized in irritability (the capacity to react to an external stimuli with an electric membrane potential), a neuro blast -a non-specialized round and small cell- generates thousands of input conn ections (dendrites), an unique output connection (axon), a cytoplasm with a large endopl asmic reticulum and an active cytoskeleton. All these features allow the neuroblast to become a cell capab le of generating and transporting electric potential along its axonal plasma membrane wi th the sole purpose of liberating a special secretory substance, called neurotransmitter (Hyttel, 2010; Ji & Tang, 2019). Normally, a fully developed cell enters in a non-proliferative mode (stable or terminal differentiation). However, some events as inflammation, trauma and others that lead to n ecrosis and loss of functional cells, can start a natural regenerative process (Zachary, 2017) that . Cell's dedifferentiation involves a terminally differentiated cell returning to a less differentiated stage from within its own cell line. This process allows the cell to multiply again before re-differentiating, lead ing to the replacement of those cells that have been lost. In some cases, the dedifferentiated cell can switch their lineage, a process called trans-differentiation or metaplasia (Jopling, Bo ue, & Belmonte, 2011). Dedifferentiation implies a temporal elimination of functio nal specific structures. For instance, zebra fish's heart regeneration includes a lack of sarcomeres (by contractile apparatus disassembling) in cardiomyocytes as a step prior to cardiomyocyte s ' proliferation. This is a required step, because sarcomere maintenance is resource-demandant to the cell and physically impairs cell division. However, dedifferentiation must n ot be confused with a \"lack of differentiation\", a similar process in which the cell loss resource -demandant functional structures to survive in low energy conditions as nutrient depriving, hy poxia, ischaemia, etc. Cell structure Metazoans, a member of the Animalia kingdom, is characterized by having the body composed of cells differentiated into tissues and organs and usually a digestive cav ity lined with specialized cells. For instance, cellular shape correlates with its function, and this is determin ed during embryogenesis and cell differentiation (Pollard et al., 2017). Embryo genesis is the process by which the embryo forms and develops being characteristic of many multicellular organisms with sexual reproduction. During the early cellular differentiation, three embryonic laye rs are developed that give origin to all the mature types of cells and tissues: ectoderm, m esoderm and endoderm (Hyttel, 2010). All the neural cells, epidermal structures, teeth, cochlear sensory cells, corneal external epithelium and eye's lens are fat cells, chondrocytes, myocytes, nephrons, and blood cell s are derivates from mesoderm and finally, urinary digestive tract and glands, respirato ry system and germ cells come from endoderm (Gartner, 2017). The general plan of eukaryotic cellular organization varies between different organisms, but despite these modifications, all cells resemble one another in certain fun damental ways. Before we begin a detailed examination of cell structure, let's first summarize four major 23 features all cells have in common: (1) a plasma membrane, (2) cytoplasm, (3 ) ribosomes to synthesize proteins, and (4) a nucleus where genetic material is located. Plasma Membrane is the interphase between the cell and its environment. It is made of a phospholipid bilayer, integral proteins, cholesterol and other compo nents (Nicolson, 2014). The lipid components are hydrophobic; thus, the plasma membrane is imp ermeable to ions and most of water-soluble compounds. Subsequently, these compounds can cross the mem brane only through specialized transmembrane proteins, that form specific channels, carriers and pumps (Ari\u00f1o, Ramos, & Sychrova, 2019). By means of these integral proteins, the cell can obtain nutrients, release its metabolic final products, control internal ion co ncentrations and create a transmembrane electrical potential. A second group of integral proteins are the membrane receptors , that facilitate the interaction between the cell and their immediate environment. These receptors convert the binding with extracellular signals (i.e. hormones, growth facto rs, death factors, etc) into chemical and/or electrical signals that modify the metabolic acti vity of the cell (Ma, He, & Berkowitz, 2019). A third group of integral proteins is formed by adhesion proteins which allow the binding between cells or between the cell and extracellular matrix. Cell to cell adhesions allow a strong association, commonly seen in epithelia and cardiomyocytes. Similar adhesion proteins play a significant role in leukocytes capabil ity to bind and phagocyte bacteria and other microscopic pathogens (Pollard et al., 2017). Figure 2. General Components of Plasma Membrane: G. Glycocalix, CR. Cholesterol Raft, (cytoplasmic component). Transmembrane pro teins in pink represent receptors or carriers with enzymatic intracellular domains (as ATPase-depe ndant Na-K pump) (Modified from (Jacobson et al., 2019)). G CR TP PB TP TP MT A-IF 24 The cytoskeleton is a cytoplasmic dynamic network formed by three protein polymers: actin filaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules . This structure not only maintains the shape of a cell but allows its modification, intra cellular movements and o rganelle traffic. Cellular locomotion, muscle contraction, organelles transport, mitosis and cilia and flagella are issued by ATP-powered motor proteins (myosin, kinesins, dynein) that use the actin filaments and microtubules as roads to perform them (VanDelinder, Imam, & Bachand, 2019). In fact, these motor proteins not only move the plasma membrane and organelles but the cytoskeleton itself. Organelle traffic is an essential part of organelles' metabolic integration that depends on the interaction between organelles and motor proteins by means of a specific connector molecule -called adaptor complex- (Mason et al., 2017) The crosslink bet ween cytoskeleton and plasma membrane reinforce the cell's surface against external forces and allows microvilli development and balance, increasing the surface area of the plasma membrane for transporting nutrients, enabling substances int erchange between spermatozoa and epididymis' epithelium and a large number of other processes (Gartner, 2017; Pollard et al., 2017). The nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells. The nucleus is the repository of the genetic information that enables the synthesis of nearly all protein s of a living eukaryotic cell. It is deeply integrated in the metabolism itself mo dulating the transcription of the genetic information stored in specific genes in response to genetic, developmental, an d environmental signals. It is separated from the cytoplasm by its own double membrane and all the traffic into and out of the nucleus pass through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), because, unlike the cytoplasmic membrane, the nuclear membrane lacks other transport channels ex cept the NPCs 2019). The nuclear membranes develop since the interaction betw een chromatin and endoplasmic reticulum. They are separated by the nuclear cistern , the same one that is connected to the endoplasmic reticulum thanks to the continuity between the outer nuclear membrane and the membranes of this organelle. This continuity allows to ER c onnect with the lamina attachment site in the inner face of the nuclear membrane and also participate in NPC formation (Dawson, Lazarus, Hetzer, & Wente, 2009). The nuclear lamina is a network of intermediate filaments (lamins) that supports the DNA and provides support to nuclear envelope. The lamina also acts as an anchoring site for chromosomes and the cytopl asmic cytoskeleton (via protein complexes that span the nuclear envelope). The (Ho & Hegele, 201 9). Chromatin is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells (Mondal, Rasmussen, Pandey, Isaksson, & Kanduri, 2010). Chromatin's primary function is packaging very long DNA molecules into a more compact, denser shape, which prevents the strands from becoming tangled and plays important roles in reinforcing the DNA during cell d ivision, preventing DNA damage, and regulating gene expression and DNA replication. Durin g mitosis and meiosis, chromatin facilitates proper segregation of the chromosomes in anaphase; the characteristic shapes of chromosomes visible during this stage are the result of DNA being coi led into highly condensed networks of chromatin. In the case of human DNA, there are almost 3 billion bp in each single nucleus from which only 2% codes for genes and structural RNA (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004). DNA is associated with proteins called histones. Interactions between DNA, histones and other proteins fold each chr omosome densely, allowing the DNA to fit into the nucleus' small volume (Delage & Dashwood, 2008): In this packing process, the firs level is represented by each histone and its associated DNA (146 bp long) forming a nucleosome , separate form the next by a 200 bp long DNA chain. The nucleosomes' filament, known as a 10 -nm fiber, condenses DNA approximately sevenfold 25 relative to naked DNA. In a second packing level, thousands of nucleosomes o rganized in tetranucleosomes, form a solenoid fiber with 30 nm diameter . At third level, this solenoid is coiled in a mayor solenoid, the 100-nm chromonema fiber . Finally, the chromonema fiber form the central core of the chromatid (chromosome arm) (Pollard et al., 2017). The chromatin has been categorized into two main classes based on structural and functional criteria. Euchromatin contains almost all genes, equally actively transcribed and quiescent. Heterochromatin is transcriptionally repressed and is typically more condensed than euchromatin. However, the term heterochromatin involves several distinct modes of chromatin compaction that have different implications for gene expression. Accordingly, heterochro matin should not be supposed of as just condensing inactive DNA, but as a descriptor for compact chromatin domains that share the common characteristic of being remarkably resilient to gene expression (Alberts, 2015). According to the Viral Eukaryogenesis hypothesis, the nucleus -the main characteristic of eukaryotic cells- is a descendant of the viral factory of a DNA phage -from Nucl eoCytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses ancestor (Bell, 2019; Ga\u00efa, 2016). Since analogies between VFs and eukaryote's nuclei had been found, there are some central issues for understanding the origin of the nucleus: (1) nuclear assembly of endomembranes around chromatin are comparable to VFs from viruses than r eplicate into the cytoplasm; (2) many cytoplasmic VFs recruit part of the nucleus and/or ER m embrane to build their own membrane; (3) origin of centromeres and mitotic spindle, without whi ch nuclear chromosomes cannot be inherited (Cavalier-Smith, 2010). For some researchers, the nucleus can be a relatively late acquisition in the evolution of eukaryotes, since remains un clear if this structure emerged before, after or in a parallel process with other organelles in transitional eukaryotes. A central topic of this problem is the evolution of the nuclear po re complex (NPC), which allows a critical channel between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (Field & Rout, 2019) . Endoplasmic Reticulum and Ribosomes: catalyse using the nucleotide sequences of mRNA to specify the order of amino acids in a polypeptide that is going to be produce (process called \"translation of the genetic code\") (Arranz-Gibert, Patel, & Isaacs, 2019; Chatterjee & Yadav, 2019). Some ribosomes are found free in the cytoplasm and their function is to synthetize proteins for the cytoplasm i tself (enzymes, carriers, cytoskeleton components, etc). In the other hand, ribosomes that synthetize proteins destin ed for insertion into cellular membranes , for lysosomes' content or for exportation are associated to the external face of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) , in a special region called rough ER . This region forms a continuous pattern of sacks and tubules called the reticulum's cisternae (Voeltz, Rolls, & Rapoport, 2002) (Figure 3). Proteins synthetized on the reticulum's external surface include amino acids' signal sequences that target their ribosomes to the rough ER. The amino acid sequence of polypeptides synthetized on the rough ER determines if the protein folds up into the ER membrane or translocates across the lipid bilayer into the lumen of the reticulum's cisternae. In some cases, enzymes undergo post-translational protein modificatio ns by adding carbohydrate's chains. ER membranes and cisternae move across the cytoplasm thanks to motor proteins and cytoskeleton's attachments (Guardia et al., 2019). There is continuous bidirectional traffic of small vesicles between ER and Golgi apparatus transporting soluble proteins and membrane lipids and proteins (Y. Yang et al., 2005). These vesicles carry protein rec eptors and ligands to identify the proper membrane to which they will join (Peotter, Kasberg, Pustova, & Audhya, 26 2019). A special region of the ER which lacks ribosomes is called smooth ER . Enzymes found in this region synthesize many cellular lipids and metabolize drugs, while E R pumps and channels regulate the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (Yu et al., 2019). Golgi Apparatus: The GA is constituted by a stack of flattened, membrane-limited sacks with many associated vesicles. It is typically located in the cell's centre, near to the nucleus and the centrosome. The face near the nucleus and ER (Cis face) is convex and receives the transfer vesicles from the ER, full of newly synthetized proteins, to which the GA will perform s post translational modifications by adding lateral carbohydrates chains (Pothukuchi e t al., 2019). This process occurs both to transmembrane and secreted proteins. The face oriented to the cellular apical side (Trans face) releases vesicles to the cytoplasm (lysosomes) or to the plas ma membrane (secreted proteins). As proteins pass through the stacked Golgi membranes from o ne side to the other, enzymes in specific stacks modify the lateral carbohydrates c hains of these proteins. Nowadays, it is established that GA has distinct functional zones that regulate specific functions: glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins; proteoglycan , mucin, and lipid glycosylation; and ceramides; protein degradation (Gol gi membrane- associated degradation); and signalling for apoptosis (Sasaki & Yoshida, 2019). Man y components of the plasma membrane including receptors for extracellular molecules are recycled from the plasma membrane to endosomes and back to the cell surface many tim es before they are degraded (Simonetti & Cullen, 2019). Figure 3. Nucleus and these organelles have an impermeable membrane separating degradative enzymes from other cellular components. After synthesis by rough ER, lysosomal enzymes move through the Golgi apparatus, which add the modified carbohydrate, phosphorylate d mannose. Vesicular transport, guided by phosphomannose receptors, carries protein s to the lumen of lysosomes ( aval et al., 2019). Cells eliminate afunctional organelles and macromolecules by surrounding them into a membrane vesicle (the phagophore), which later fuses with a lysosome, becoming an autophagosome (C. O. Davis et al., 2014; Parkinson- Lawrence et al., 2010). Recognition of afunctional organelles depends of both physical and chemical interactions between organelles and lysosomes (i.e. mitochondrial ROS prod uction and mitochondrial surface's Pink1 retention ; ER mis-folded al., 2019; Raimundo, Fern\u00e1ndez-Mosquera, Yambire, & Diogo, 2016), Additionall y, cells ingest microorganisms and other materials in endocytic vesicles derived from the plasma m embrane, becoming phagosomes after fusion between lysosomes and endocytic vesicles. The contents o f these autophagosomes and phagosomes are then degraded by lysosomal enzymes (Kli onsky et al., 2016). Peroxisomes: Peroxisomes are ubiquitous single membrane-bound organelles containing a fine granular matrix composed by enzymes that play a crucial role in lipids and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism (Baboota et al., 2019) and synthesis of ether phospholipids and bile acids. Most cells have spherical or spheroidal per oxisomes with a diameter of 0.1 -1 m. Nonetheless, the peroxisomes can vary in shape and si ze in different tissues (Imanaka, 2019). Like mitochondria, peroxisomal enzymes oxidize fatty acids, but the energy is not used to synthesize ATP. Biosynthesis of peroxisomes in mammals invo lves three different processes: (1) the pre-peroxisomes budded from ER, (2) the import of peroxisom al membrane proteins (PMPs) and matrix proteins to the pre-peroxisomes, that will allow the peroxisome to grow and mature, (3) peroxisomal fission (Sugiura, Mattie, Prud ent, & McBride, 2017). Peroxisomal proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported in to the organelle using the same strategy as mitochondria but with different targeting sequences and transport machinery. Due to their central metabolic role, peroxisomes must cooperate with man y organelles involved in cellular lipid metabolism such as the ER, mitochon dria, lipid droplets, lysosomes, and phagosomes (Schrader, Kamoshita, & Islinger, 2019). Among all cell structures, the mitochondria play an essential role. From an energy production plant to its transfer from one cell to another, this organelle contin ues challenging research as it has an important role in health. b. MITOCHONDRIA Mitochondria plays a fundamental role in various functions within the cel l. It is responsible for the synthesis of most of the ATP required to cover the energy needs. It also acts as an important mediator of the use and production of organic molecules, such as lipids, nucl eotides, proteins and carbohydrates (Scheffler, 2008). Similarly, they participate in the control of intracellular calcium levels, the process of cellular apoptosis, heme synthesis, heat generation and participate in growth, differentiation, and survival of the cell (Hsu, Wu, Yu, & Wei, 2 016; Mishra & Chan, 2014; Picard, Wallace, & Burelle, 2016). Origin : The endosymbiont theory for the origin of mitochondria is now widely accepted. As usually described, mitochondria are cell organelles descended from the integration of an endosymbiont Ricketsiales (Emelyanov, 2001, 2003; Kannan, Rogozin, Koonin, 2014) host cell related to Archaea. Their mono phyletic origin and 28 close connexion to the order Rickettsiales arose from multiple phylogenetic reconstructions based on conserved proteins, the small subunit (12S) of rRNA and Emelyanov, 2001; Karlberg, Canb\u00e4ck, Kurland, & Andersson, 2000). The evolutionary transition from the original bacterium to a permanent organelle implied three mayor phenomena: (1) Genetic integration as a extensive lack of their genome, transferred to the nucleus or simply lost; (2) Metabolic integration or mutual dependency of the metabolisms by addition of carrier proteins to its inner membrane, outer membrane modifications, cristae specialization, evolution of contact sites b etween membranous mitochondria, connexions with cytoskeleton, host cell's proteins retargeting, among other mechanisms, and (3) Cellular integration in the form of synchronization of cellular and mitochondrial cycles (Bock, 2017; Poole & Gribaldo, 2014; Zimorski, Ku, Martin, & Gould, 2014). Structure: Since Palade's pioneer studies , it has been well stablished that mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles, with an outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and an inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) which is convoluted and folded into cristae mitochondriales (Palade, 1953). The presence of these folds or cristae increases the surface area of the IMM. OMM and IMM define two internal compartments, the intermembrane space (IMS) between the two membranes and the mitochondrial matrix - a compartment in which Mitochondrial DNA, metabolic enzymes and signalling agents are found- within the inner membrane. The intracristal space within the cristae folds is continuous with the intermembrane space communi cating through small circular junctions also called c ristae junctions (CJs) (T. G Frey, Renken, & Perkins, 2002). CJs formation is mediated by mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex (van der Laan, Horvath, & Pfanner, 2016) and their formation avo ids diffusion between the intracristae space and the IMS by sequestering cristae contents and regulating i ts transfer (Terrence G. Frey & Mannella, 2000). In most mitochondria, the IMS is small and electron-lucid, whereas the mitochondrial matrix is electron-dense, not homogeneous and exhibit a fine granularity wit h a frequently distinct crystalline inclusions with high electron density (Fig 4). The mitochon dria cristae exhibit a variable appearance according to the cell type as well as the developmental and metabolic states of the cell. For instance, they are often lamellar in shape, but can also be fo und in a tubular conformation in adrenal cortex and Leydig's cells neural cells (Scheffler, 2008; van der Laan et al., 2016). The mitochondrial shape is also variable, depending of the cell's metabolic needs, these organelles can merge with each other (fusion), forming giant mitochondria or even a mitochondrial network. Furthermore, thro ugh fission, these organelles can separate into smaller mitochondria (Pernas & Scorrano, 2016). Mitochondrial Function in different cell types Mitochondria play a main role in (1) ATP synthesis, (2) Ca 2+ homeostasis, (3) Nucleotide and heme synthesis, (4) apoptosis regulation (as part of cellular growth, differentiation and fate), (5) redox balance and (6) waste management. However, mitochondria don't work the same in all cells. As different tissues have specific physiological requirements, the mitochondri a respond to these needs being metabolically active. Recent research (Herbers, Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen, Hangas, Pohjoism\u00e4ki, & Goffart, 2019) found differences between brain, heart, skeletal muscl e, liver, kidney and brown fat tissue's m tDNA replication, gene expression and topology. For example, both liver and kidney cells replicate their mtDNA using the asynchronous mechanism known from cultured cells; while tissues with high OXPHOS activity, such as heart, brain, skeletal mu scle 29 and brown fat, employ a strand-coupled replication mode, combined with incr eased levels of recombination.

Inset: amplification of OMM and IMM. TEM micrography modified from (Science Source, n.d.) Further differences between cells regarding mitochondrial shape and activation are more obvious at a functional level. Muscle cells responds fast to ext ernal stressors as physical activity, improving mitochondrial biogenesis, OXPHOS activity and m itophagy (Favaro et al., 2019). In these cells, mitochondrial network is divided spatially in two mi tochondrial types: the first type is the subsarcolemmal mitochondria, that provides ATP for membrane a ctive transport, as well as for gene transcription. The second type, the intermyofibrillar mitochondria, regulates ATP synthesis for contractile filaments function and controls Ca 2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (Hood, Memme, Oliveira, & Triolo, 2019). 1. ATP synthesis: cells consume energy sources (called fuels) as carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids to generate energy-storing molecules as ATP and GTP. Each fuel has its own catabolic pathway that starts in the cytosol and ends in the OXPHOS chain. a. Carbohydrates catabolism starts with the glycolytic pathway, where carbohydrates as glucose are hydrolysed to pyruvate yielding 2 mol of ATP and 2 mol of NADH per mol of glucose. In aerobic conditions, pyruvate is transferred to the mitochon drial matrix and integrated to the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle, where 8 mol of NADH and 2 mol of FADH are produced. Then, NADH (including the NADH obtained in glycolysis , transferred to the mitochondria) and FADH are oxidized through the respiratory chain to obtain a theoretical yield of 30 mol of ATP glucose (Bender et al., 2018 Haigis, 2018; Vanderperre, Bender, Kunji, & Martinou, 2015). a b c d d e 30 b. Amino Acids catabolism : Mitochondria Glutami ne, which is transformed in alfa-ketoglutarate that enters in TCA cycle . The others mentioned amino acids (branched-chain amino acids or BCAAs) must be transformed in acetyl-CoA or succinyl CoA before entering in TCA cycle. Although the BCAAs mitochondrial pathway is well characterized, their import mechanism remains unknown (Spinelli & Haigis, 2018) c. Fatty acids catabolism: Fatty hydrolysed in the mitochondria by oxidation to acetyl-CoA in a process that produces large quantities of energy. When this pathway is proceeding at a high rate, three compounds, acetoacetate, D-3-hydroxy butyrate, and acetone, known as the ketone bodies, are produced by the liver. Acetoace tate and D-3-hydroxybutyrate are used as fuels by extrahepatic tissues in normal metab olism (specially in neurons and striated muscle), but overproduction of ketone bodies causes neural toxicity, a pathology called ketosis (Houten, Violante, Ventura, & Wanders, 2016). d. Respiratory Chain: Even though the TCA cycle that takes place in the mitochondrial matrix is part of aerobic metabolism, it does not use oxygen itself (Alberts , 2015). Only the final step of oxidative metabolism uses molecular oxygen (O 2) directly. Almost all the energy obtainable from metabolizing carbohydrates, fats, and other \"fuels\" in previous steps is stored in the form of energy-rich compounds that transfer electron s into the respiratory chain in the IMM. These electrons, most of which are carried by NADH, at last term combine with O 2 and H + at the end of the respiratory chain to form water. The energy released during the complex sequence of electron transfers from NADH to O 2 is diffused along the respiratory complexes I and III, and III and IV in the IMM to produce an electrochemical gradient that energies the conversion of ADP + Pi to ATP at Complex V (Chaban, Boekema, & Dudkina, 2014). For this reason, the term oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) describe this final series of reactions. The total quantity of energy released by biological oxidation in the respiratory chain is equal to that released by the explosive combustion of hydrogen when it combines with oxygen in a single step to form water. However, the combustion of hydrogen in a single-step chemical reaction, which h as a strongly negative G, releases this large amount of energy unproductively as heat. In the respiratory chain, the same energetically favourable reaction H 2 + \u00a4 O2 H2O is divided into small steps, allowing the cell to store almost half of the total energy that is released in the ATP molecule. 2. Ca 2+ homeostasis : Adequate cytosolic Ca 2+ levels depend on a delicate equilibrium between cellular Ca 2+ intake ( transmembrane Ca 2+ channels), cellular Ca 2+ release (ATP-dependant Ca 2+ pumps) and Ca 2+ mobilization from intracellular stores as ER. However, ER's Ca 2+ intake can be too slow to allow a rapid ionic equilibrium. Mitochondria can uptake the cytosolic Ca 2+ , released by ER previously, by similar or even larger cycles. Mitochondrial Ca 2+ storing is due to the large mitochondrial membrane potential (usually from -15 0 to -180 mV) and by the ER-mitochondrial protein connections ( MAMs ) that allow direct Ferreira, Ferreiro, & Rego, 2016; Patergnani et al., 31 3. Heme and Nucleotide synthesis : The biosynthesis of heme groups play a central part in electron transfer and it is another main process that is shared between the mitochondria and the cytoplasm. Iron -sulphur clusters, which are crucial not only for electron transfer in the respiratory chain, but also for the conservation and stability of the nucl ear genome, are produced in mitochondria. Nuclear genome instability, a hallmark of cancer, can so metimes be linked to the decreased function of cellular proteins that contain iron -sulphur clusters. Nucleotide synthesis: Nucleotides can be produced through recover pathways, via the recycling of pre-existing nucleosides and nucleobases, or through the de novo synthesis pathways, using amino acids and small molecules to synthetize the purine and py rimidine rings. Healthy mature cells use the recover pathways for nucleotides' synthesis but proliferating and cancer cells prefer de novo synthesis pathway. Mitochondria is responsible for one step in pyrimidine synthesis, although purine synthesis develops only in the cytosol, however, mitochondria play a primary role controlling both pathways, because de-novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides is coupled to mitochon drial respiratory chain and other mitochondrial pathways. Oncogenic activation of RAS and lack of tumour suppressors as p53 promote pyrimidine synthesis by activating u rea cycle. Cytosolic purine synthesis is stimulated by mTORC1, also stimulates the formation and assembly on the mitochondrial surface of the purinosome complex, which carries o ut de novo purine synthesis (Gattermann et al., 2004; Spinelli & Haigis, 2018 ; Villa, Ali, Sahu, & Ben-Sahra, 2019). 4. Apoptosis regulation : Apoptosis is a key mechanism that mediates cell replacement, body growth embryogenesis and defence: During morphogenesis or epithelial replacement, tissues must have an equilibrium between cellular production and death. In the o ther hand, damaged, infected, abnormal, misplaced, non-functional, or potentially dangerous cells must be eliminated by apoptosis before they threaten the health of the organism (Alberts, 2015). There are two mechanisms that induce apoptosis: the extrinsic and the intrinsi c (mitochondrial) pathways. In the first one, cells respond to external signals (hormo nes, cytokines, etc) called Fas-ligands that bind to cell-surface death receptors. These receptors are homotrimers and belong to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, which includes a receptor for TNF itself and the Fas death receptor (Steller, 2015). When triggered by the binding of Fas-ligand, the death domains on the cytosolic extrem ities of the Fas death receptors bind intracellular adaptor proteins, which bind initiator caspases (pr imarily caspase-8 and 10 ), forming a death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) . After dimerized and activated in the DISC, the initiator caspases cleave their associate proteins and then activate downstream executioner caspases to induce apoptosis (Reed & Green, 2011). Apoptosis as response to cellular or DNA damage or development signals are governed by the intrinsic pathway , which depends on the release into the cytosol of mitochondrial proteins as cytochrome c (Cyt-c) , the mitochondrial hypoxia or ischemia, there are a depl etion of cellular ATP and phosphocreatine. These disturbances in energy metabolism start pathophysiological responses that convergence on mitochondria such as cellular uptake o f calcium. The increase of cytosolic calcium is compensated with mitochondrial calciu m uptake and swelling, impairment of respiration and increased production of ROS that trigger mitochondrial permeabilization and Cyt-c release (Thornton & Hagberg, 201 5). When released into the cytosol, it binds to an adaptor protein called apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf1) , causing the a heptamer named an 32 apoptosome (Yuan & Akey, 2013). The Apaf1 proteins in the apoptosome then recruit initiator caspase-9 proteins, which are supposed to be triggered by proximity in the apoptosome, just as caspase-8 is triggered in the DISC. The activated caspase-9 molecules then activate downstream executioner caspases to induce apoptosis (Dorstyn, Akey, & Kumar, 2018). During embryogenesis, programmed cell death is also controlled by the apoptosi s intrinsic pathway, which is regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins . This family includes both anti-apoptosis and pro-apoptosis members. The pro- and antiapoptotic molecules can directly or indirectly antagonize each other. In the absence of an apoptotic stimulus, anti- apoptotic Bcl2 members bind to and constrain the effector Bcl2 members on the OMM and in the cytosol. In the presence of an apoptotic stimulus, BH3-only protei ns are activated and bind to the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 's so that they can no longer constrain the effector Bcl2 family proteins; the latter then become triggered, aggregate in the OMM, and prom ote the release of intermembrane mitochondrial proteins as Cyt-c into the cytosol (Gro ss, 2016; Yin & Dong, 2003). 5. REDOX balance : Mitochondria are critical for buffering the redox potential in the cytosol. Cells need a continuous amount of the electron acceptor NAD + for the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate during glycolysis. This NAD+ is transformed to NADH in the process, and the NAD + needs to be renewed by transferring the high-energy NADH electrons somewhere (Bender et al., 2018). The NADH electrons wi ll finally be used to help drive oxidative phosphorylation inside the mitoch ondria. However, the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH. The electrons are therefore passed from the NADH to smaller molecules in the cytosol that can move through the inner mitochondrial membrane. Once in the matrix, these smaller molecules transfer their electrons to NAD + to form mitochondrial NADH, after which they are returned to the cytosol for recharging \u2014creating a shuttle system for the NADH electrons (Alberts, 2015). However, the cytosol is a more oxidizing location in which the NAD+/NADH propo rtion ranges between 60 and 700. On the contrary, mitochondria employ more reductive metabolic reactions, and the NAD+/NADH proportion is approximately 7 -8. To sustain the imbalanced distribution of NAD, mammalian cells use indirect pathways: malate -aspartate shuttle, citrate -malate shuttle, -Glycerophosphate shuttle and one carbon metabolism pathway (Spinelli & Haigis, 2018) 6. Waste management : the final products of catabolism have poor energy content, or they are toxic. However, compounds depicted as waste (ammonia and ROS) have a functio nal role into the mitochondria. a. Urea cycle: The urea cycle is a central metabolic pathway in mammals that converts the ammonia (NH 4+) produced by the catabolism of amino acids and nucleotides to the non-metabolizable (by mammals) urea excreted in urine. As part of their fate, amino acids are imported into mitochondria and oxidized to produce NADH for AT P production (see up). Additionally, mitochondria can process exceeding ammonia transferring it to alfa-ketoglutarate to produce glutamate and glutamine in bidirectional reactions. 33 The urea cycle consists of the action of three mitochondrial enzymes - N- acetylglutamate synthetase , Carbamoyl transform glutamate to carbamoyl phosphate. Then, by binding carbamoyl phosphate to ornithine to citrulline, ammonia from to arginine, which is divided in urea and ornith ine. Finally, a small group of transporting proteins transfers ornithine from cytosol to m itochondrial matrix and citrulline from mitochondria to cytosol (Foschi et al., 2015). b. Reactive Oxygen Species: It is worldwide admitted that mitochondrial produced ROS can damage mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and ROS-induced lesions in mtDNA can lead to somatic mutations that accumulate, affect the integrity of respiratory chain , and cause mitochondria-dependent aging (D.-X. Tan, 2019). Mitochondria prod uce ROS in response to stressors such as hypoxia, starvation, cytokine stimulation and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Zsurka, Peeva, Kotlyar, & Kunz, 2018 ). To evade ROS production 's consequences , mitochondria does ROS clearance through enzymes as superoxide dismutase. This enzyme transforms ROS in Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) that is reduced to water and O 2 due to the combined activities of peroxiredoxins 3 and 5, thioredoxin 2 and thioredoxin reductase 2 (Spinelli & Haigis, 2018). However, mitochondrial ROS are also implied in some critical proce ss as signalling agents: they promote cellular proliferation, differentiation and mi gration. Likewise, they stimulate glycolysis in cancer cells -The Warburg effect- (Liberti & Locasale, 2016). Finally, mitochondrial ROS have a role in immune defe nce by stimulating macrophages' antibacterial immune response and B cell and T cell activation (Dan Dunn, Alvarez, Zhang, & Soldati, 2015; M\u00fcllebner, Dorighello, Kozlov, & cell Mitochondrially encoded subunits of the OXPHOS system assemble with nuclear- encoded subunits into enzymatic complexes. Expression of the mitochondrial invol ves intramitochondrial replication, transcription, and translation. Mitochond rial translation is associated to other mitochondrial and cellular functions. The synthesis of mi tochondrial- encoded proteins is coordinated by the connection of mitochondrial pr otein synthesis with assemblage of respiratory chain complexes. Mitochondrial translation controls c ellular proliferation and cell cycle, and mitochondrial ribosomal subunits play a role i n the cytoplasmic stress response. Thus, translation in mitochondria is integrated into cellular pro cesses. Additionally, mitochondria are known to regulate key cellular processes, inclu ding calcium signalling, cell metabolism and cell death, among others. a. Genetic integration: Mitochondria retains 63 proteins or less encoded in its genome, but it harbour almost 2000 proteins involved in its ancestrally prokaryotic biochem istry (Zimorski et al., 2014). This discrepancy is explained inside the endosymbiotic theory as the Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer Phenomenon, in other words, the mitochondrial gen e transfer to the nucleus. The transferred genes became pseudogenes, or their transcripts became cytosolic proteins until mitochondria developed the protein import mach inery. Then, the transferred genes obtained the expression and targeting signals needed. Al 34 last, mitochondria retained only the genes for the electron transport chain protein s, its own ribosome and the transport RNAs (Bock, 2017). b. Metabolic integration: Mitochondria distribution in the cytoplasm of the cell is not random. Their distribution responds to th e cell's metabolic needs. For instance, in a secretory cell, mitochondria are located near the ER-Golgi complex. Their position is different as in a kidney's proximal tubule's cell , where mitochondria are apical surface, close to ATP-depen dant membrane's transport mechanisms. The needs of ATP can change along the cell's life ; therefore, mitochondrial position, number, shape and size should change in correspondence. These changes are mediated by mitochondria-cytoskeleton interactions. For instance, when mitochondria are observed in live cells, they seem to be coarsely ranged along their long axes. Howev er, when they colocalise with cytoskeletal structures, their association with microtubules becomes immediately apparent. Motor proteins as kinesin-1 and some adaptor complexes ( as kinectins, Miro, syntabulin and others) that link kinesin to mitochondria have been identified but their participation in mitochondria's motility, morphology and anchorage remains poorly & Pon, 2007; Sukhorukov & Meyer-Hermann, 2015). Additionally , there is a correlation between ATP cell's needs and the number, shape and size of mitochondria (Scheffler, 2008). From cristae modifications to the formation of a mitochondrial networks, these morphological changes warrant the functionality required to fit the roles needed to promote cellular survival (P ernas & Scorrano, 2016). There is a relation between cristae shape and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) function, suggesting that membrane morphology modu lates the organization and function of the OXPHOS system, with a direct impact on cell ular metabolism (Chaban et al., 2014) . A rise in cristae number follows exposure to a substrate rich in oxygen (non-glycolytic). This rise is accompanied by higher levels of respiratory chain proteins and supercomplexes, which together increase oxidative phosphorylation activity (Cogliati, Enriquez, & Scorrano, 2016). In cell culture starvation models, a decrease in cristae thickness supports increased ATPase dimerization and activity, improving respiratory chain supercomplex assembly and mitochond ria- dependent cellular growth. Independently of the role of cristae in metabolism, a reduction in cristae thickness decreases the release of apoptotic molecules following a cell death stimulus (Pernas & Scorrano, 2016). Another main issue in mitochondrial metabolic integration is the presence of close contacts other organelles ( mitochondrial MCS ) (Elbaz 2011). are regions where two membranes are closely apposed but the membranes do not fuse maintaining the organelles ' identities. The contact sites among the ER and mitochondria have been measured to be 10 -30 nm wide (Rowland & Voeltz, 2012; Stacchiotti et al., 2019). Contacts between mitochondria and Golgi Complex and/or ER can serve to recycle and repair mitochondrial memb ranes, calcium homeostasis, lipid transport, ion exchange and formation of specialized protein microdomains that allow to coordinate diverse signalling pathways. Additional ly, ER- mitochondrial contacts play fundamental roles in mitochondrial biog enesis (fission) and mitochondrial proteome transfer. As in mitochondrial traffic, there are a growing set of protein connectors in the contact sites: a voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) 35 on the outer mitochondrial membrane related to calcium transfer , GRAMD1A - GRAMD1C (in metazoans) related to sterol transfer from ER to mitochondria, ERMES complex related to phospholipid transport from ER to mitochondria and mitochondrial- vacuole contacts , termed vCLAMPs, also related to phospholipid transport, in coordination with ER or bypassing it (Lahiri, Toulmay, & Prinz, 2015; M urley & Nunnari, 2016). c. Cell cycle integration: The cell cycle is an essential cellular mechanism that regulates the fate of cells and typically consists of four phases: S-phase , during which DNA replication occurs; M-phase , where cell division, or mitosis, takes place, and the gap phases that separate the two; G1 and G2 , respectively (Sen, 2019) . As mentioned previously, mitochondria can change their shape, number and internal structure as part of their metabolic integration (Scheffler, 2008). Additionally, these changes, expressed by means of biogenesis and mitophagy, are correlated with the cell cycle wi thin the healthy cells. Several cellular signalling pathways, as well as those that driv e cell division, interact closely with the mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial function, specifically mechanisms that control mitochondrial fission and fusion, biogenesis, Fajas, 2015). Mitochondrial biogenesis is controlled through coordinated transcriptional regulation of nuclear and mitochondrial genes. The activity of these transcription factors is controlled by the energetic demands of the cells (Andreux, Houtkooper, & Auwerx, 2013). During cell cycle development , the 'structure' of the mitochondrial network within the cell can change from an inter-connected n etwork in G1, to a hyperpolarized, giant single tubular network in the G1/S transition, an d to a very fragmented network in mitosis (Margineantu et al., 2002; Pernas & Scorrano, 2016). Quality control Mitochondrial quality is granted by the balance between the number of fu nctional mitochondria and the cell's energy needs. Mitochondria are very dynamic organelles that replicate by fission when the cell needs more energy. The fission process is triggered v ia Drp1 activation. When mitochondria become overloaded, their molecular components can be damaged by ROS and these damages can be repaired by fusion, which is me diated by Opa1, Mfn1, and Mnf2 . The by mitophagy. a. Mitochondrial fission and concomitant mtDNA replication are the assumed mechanisms for mitochondrial proliferation that guarantee that growing and dividi ng cells hold an adequate number of mitochondria to sustain their cellular function s. This process produces not only new organelles but offers a quality control mecha nism by segregating and targeting damaged mitochondria for elimination via selective autophagy (Bess, Crocker, Ryde, & Meyer, 2012). The key 1 and 2 (NRF1 and NRF2) (Khan, Roberts, & Wu, 2019; Lopez-Mejia & Fajas, 2015). cytoskeletal, and organellar elem ents and consists of three key steps: (a) marking of a fission site, (b) assemblage of cy tosolic dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) dimers and oligomers into a spiral-shaped superstructure around the marked fission site, and (c) GTP hydrolysis and DRP1 hel ix 36 constriction that separate the mitochondrion in two daughter mitochondria (Pernas & Scorrano, 2016). b. Mitochondrial fusion is a mechanism to repair damaged mtDNA and mitochondria. Healthy mitochondria with wild-type (normal) mtDNA can fuse with abnormal mitochondria to compensate for defects by sharing components (Youle & Van Der Bliek, 2012). Because nucleoids do not seem to exchange DNA, mitochondria in het eroplasmic cells balance one another by sharing RNA or proteins (L. Yang et al., 2015). Fusi on between mitochondria can also rescue two mitochondria with mutation s in different genes by cross-complementation to one another, and it can alleviate the eff ects of environmental damage through the exchange of proteins and lipids with oth er mitochondria. Mitochondrial fusion can therefore maximize oxidative capacity in response to toxic stress, if the stress is under a critical threshold. In mammals, fu sion between OMMs is facilitated by membrane-anchored dynamin family protei named Mfn1 and Mfn2 , whereas fusion between IMMs is facilitated by a single dynamin family protein called Opa1 (Roy, Reddy, Iijima, & Sesaki, 2015). c. Mitophagy: Mitochondria are very active organelles that are continuously being synthesized and recycled. This turnover promotes the preservation of an optimall y operative pool of mitochondria. Some types of mitochondrial damage can tri gger mitochondrial DNA destruction, either via direct degradation or through mitop hagy. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization, increased ROS production or loss of DN A repair enzymes can increase mtDNA damage and mitophagy of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments (Van Houten, Hunter, & Meyer, 2016). In the PINK1-Parking mitophagy pathway , non- functional mitochondria covalent modification (i.e. phosphorylation of Translocase of Outer Membrane (TOM) components). Once the mitochondrion loses its membrane potential , PINK1 , which is usually imported and degraded within the matrix, cannot pass in the matrix, and it stabilizes on the OMM where it recruits Parkin, which then ubiquitinates OMM proteins, and attracts the adapter protein SQSTM1/p62 to the ubiquitin chains to flag the organelle for mitophagy by inducing contact with the phagophore's membrane (Hattori, Saiki, Imai, Lionaki, Markaki, Palikaras, & Tavernara kis, 2015) 37 Chapter 2. Cellular damage and mitochondria A clear understanding of cellular structure and physiology is essential to stu dy its response to injury. The cell has an external boundary -the plasma membrane- and a cytosol functionally divided in interconnected compartments called organelles. The organel les' function depends in great manner on the chemistry of their membranes and intracellular m atrix. Cell membranes and organelles are target of many types of etiologic agents (from bio logical, chemical or physical origin) and the cellular reaction to the pathogens' aggression is in the co re of the physiopathology of many diseases. 1. Types of cellular stress or damage (Differences, exogen ous, endogenous, UVR stress or damage) Injury to tissues and organs starts at a cellular level. The development of str uctural alterations is preceded by biochemical modifications. In some cases, the biochemical modifications are the only detectable changes. Cell damage disrupts cellular homeostasis. There are thousands of etiologic agents, from internal or external origin, but all of them activate one or more of four final common biochemical mechanisms to cell damage : (1) ATP depletion, (2) cell membranes' permeabilization, (3) biochemical pathways' disruption and (4) DNA damage. Etiologic agents: The more common etiologic agents of cellular injury are: (1) hypoxia, (2) physical agents (trauma, temperature extremes, radiant energy and electric shock), (3) biological agents (viruses, microbes, parasites), (4) nutritional imbalances, (5) genetic derangement, (6) chemical (and pharmacological) agents, (7) immunologic dysfunctio n and (8) aging. a. Hypoxia: Hypoxia is the insufficient oxygen supply for the cell's metabolic needs and its value is different according to cell's metabolic rate. Hypoxia can be a consequence from insufficient oxygenation of blood as result of cardiac or respiratory failure, decrease of vascular perfusion (ischaemia), reduced O2 transport by erythrocytes (as in anaemia), or inhibition of cellular respiratory enzymes (i.e. cyanide toxicosis) which results in an adaptive response that comprises a temporary cell-cycle arrest and reduced respiratory chain activity energy availability (Qian, Gelens, & Bollen, 2019). Hypoxia is one of the most common and most significant causes of injury; indeed, it is habitually the final cause of cell injury (F. Xiao, Li, Wang, & Cao, 2019) . Interestingly, hypoxia can be a physiological condition for mesenchymal stem cells. H ypoxia (as low as 1-5% Oxygen concentration) can stimulate the cell differentiation in mesenchymal cell s and permits cell proliferation because this concentration is enough to warrant ATP synthesis by the stem cell's mitochondrial respiration at certain developmental stages. Additionally, while mitochondrial ROS production trigger replication facto rs expression under hypoxic conditions, ROS repression under the same conditions leads to preservation of stem cells quiescence and function (Ivanovic, 2009; Okita, Ichisaka, & Yamanaka, 2009). b. Physical agents : trauma can damage cells directly by crushing or slashing or indirectly by blood supply interruption. Hyperthermia can hurt blood vessel (at lo w intensity) or denatures enzymes and proteins (Munir et al., 2019; Raff et al., 2019; Tenorio et al., 2019). Cold can affects blood supply by causing severe vascular constriction o r literally 38 freezes cells, forming intracytoplasmic ice crystals that disrupt cell membranes (G\u00f3mez & Khan, 2019). Radiant energy (Ionizing and ultraviolet radiation) are the main f orms of radiation triggering cellular damage. Radiant energy affects atoms and molecules, UV radiation can disrupt cellular bonds with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (X. Xiao, Huang, Fan, & Zuo, 2018). Ionizing radiation causes direct cell memb rane or organelle damage or the production of ROS, that reacts with other cellular compon ents, as DNA (Baselet, Sonveaux, Baatout, & Aerts, 2019). Electric shock generates heat as it passes through tissues, burning them. Additionally, electricity disrupts the nervous impulses in respiratory centres, cardiac conduction system or neuromuscular junctions (D. H. Lee, Desai, & Gauger, 2018). c. Biological agents : biological agents range from prions, to microbes and to macroscopic parasites. The main difference with another etiologic agents is that biological agents can replicates once they gain access to cells and tissues (Westman, Hube, & Fairn, 2 019). Biological agents can sequestrate DNA synthesis machinery (viruses), produce toxins (bacteria and fungi), bargain nutrients or produce inflammation and immune response (all of them). d. Nutritional imbalances : Nutritional imbalances predispose the cell to damage. Animals can adapt to short-term dietary deficiencies in protein or calories through glyc olysis, lipolysis, and catabolism of muscle protein. Nevertheless, long-term malnou rishment leads to atrophy of cells and tissues. On the other hand, caloric excess can overload cells with glycogen and lipids and lead to obesity with metabolic disorders that p redispose the obese animal to a variety of diseases, as arteriosclerosis (Hennig, Toborek, McClain, & Diana, 1996; Martins, 2018). Some dietary deficiencies of essential amino acids , fatty acids, vitamins, or minerals can lead to muscle degeneration, reduced growing, augmented vulnerability to infection, metabolic disorders, and many other diseases, depending on which nutritional factors are missing from or disproportionate in the di et (Zachary, 2017). e. Genetic instability : selective reproduction and/or endogamy in closed populations can result in declined genetic diversity and increased prevalence of hereditary diseases as metabolic abnormalities, neoplasia, autoimmune diseases or increased susceptibility to infections. Both animals and humans, many of these inherited disorders show a famili al phenotype, i.e. human Tay-Sachs disease (Solovyeva or D obermann Pincher dog's granulo cyte deficiency. f. Chemical (and pharmacological) agents : chemicals, drugs and toxins can change cellular homeostasis. The therapeutic effect of pharmacological agents is due to the modification of the homeostasis of certain groups of cells, within acceptable param eters. All chemicals must be considered toxins if they modify cells' homeostasis out of their limits without benefits. Chemicals disturb cells by binding receptors, inhib iting or inducing enzymes, altering metabolic pathways, increasing membrane perm eability, producing free radicals, damaging chromosomes or cell's structural components (Chen, Patwari, & Liu, 2019; Ore & Olayinka, 2019; Tousson, El-Atrsh, Mansour, & Abdallah, 2019). The susceptibility of a cell to chemical injury depends on such factors as its mi totic rate and its ability to bind, take up, concentrate, or metabolize the chemical. 39 g. Immunologic dysfunction: immunologic dysfunction can produce cell damage indirectly, by allowing microbial colonization (immunodeficiency) or directly, throu gh an excessive response (hyper-sensibility, i.e. allergies) to a foreign antigen or by attacking same organism's antigens (autoimmunity) . h. Aging : aging is related to the cumulative damage on cell's proteins, membrane lipids and DNA. Much of these damages are attributed to ROS production, DNA mutations an d cellular senescence. Cumulated DNA damage predisposes to malignant cell transformation. Senescence is related with telomeres shortening, a process that occurs with each mitosis until cell stop dividing and die. In cell with terminal differentiation, as neurons an d muscular fibres, there are not mitosis along the organism life's spam, but these types of cell cumulate lipofuscin and others metabolic wastes by a reduction in cellular exocytic capacity, contributing to cellular degeneration and death (Gi orgi et al., 2018; D.-X. Tan, 2019; Woods, Khrapko, & Tilly, 2018). 2. Cellular response to stress and damage (regulatory c ascade, p53 and others, cell-to-cell communication): Cells have a restricted range of responses to injury, depending on the cell typ e and the nature of the injury. These responses can be classified as (1) adaptation, (2) degeneration, or (3) death (Zachary, 2017). Adaptation and degeneration are considere d reversible responses: A cell may adapt to a stimulus or sublethal injury positively , with increased efficiency or productivity (i.e. muscular hypertrophy under training) or suffer deg eneration with reduced functional capacity. This means that a stressor doesn't necessarily cause damage or that the risk of adverse effects increases linearly as the total dose of the stressor. Indeed , a stressor can have a strong stimulatory effect on the cell at an appropriate dose and causes damage at other one. This cell behaviour is named hormesis and explain the not-linear cell response to many stimuli (Costantini, 2019). For instance, low to mild intensity muscular training cause muscular hypertrophy, a desirable adaptative effect for athletes and fitness' fans, but excessive training without appropriate rest can cause muscular necrosis, atrophy and myoglobinuria. On the other hand, opioids show an opposite type of hormesis: they are temporally strong analgesics at higher doses, before lost their analgesic (Dud ekula, Arora, Callaerts-Vegh, & Bond, 2005). The response to injury can be reversible, with eventual restoration of the previous normal cellular structure and function (healing) or i rreversible with evolution from degeneration to cell's death. Irreversible DNA damage can result in growth arrest (senescence), cell death, or cancer. a. Reversible cell damage : The most important manifestations of cell damage are the metabolic disorders following intracellular accumulation of abnormal amou nts of several substances. These intracellular accumulations occur as a result of not only sublethal injury sustained by cells but also normal (but inefficient) cell function. Two groups of substances can cause accumulations: (1) a normal cellular substance (such as water, protein, lipi d, and carbohydrate excesses); or (2) an abnormal substance, either endogenous (such as a product of abnormal metabolism or synthesis) or exogenous (e.g., infectious agents o r a mineral) (McCance & Huether, 2019). These products can accumulate momentarily or permanently and can be toxic or innocuous. 40 A primary cell response to injury is acute water accumulation or cell swelling (hydropic degeneration). In a general way, hypoxia, hypotonic environment and ATP synthesis reduction cause Na +/ K +-ATPase pump dysfunction, affecting the cellular capacity to conserve the appropriate membrane 's electrochemical gradient and hydric equilibrium. Then, Na + cumulates in the cytosol and later into the membranous organelles as ER and mitochondria, with water movement from external to internal membranes' face and functional decay. The membranous organelles take a vesiculate shape and their internal cavity lacks d ensity by reduction of metabolites' concentration. In the same way toxic substances can produce the same initial lesions if they interfere with Na +/ K +-ATPase pump or with respiratory chain (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2018). As seen previously, if these interferences with cellular homeostasis are sublethal or they have short duration, the cell recovers their homeostasis, producing enough ATP to maintain Na +/ K +-ATPase pump, expulse Na+ and water until reach the physiologic level and restore cell structure and function. Metabolic disturbances as alcoholic toxicity or exceeding dietary calories can cause muscular and liver steatosis (intracellular fatty acids cumulation, or fatty degeneration). Dietary steatosis is related with cell need for storage exceeding caloric mo lecules, transforming all of them (carbohydrates, amino acids and fats) in intracytoplasm ic fat droplets (Zachary, 2017). Normally, each cell can storage a certain quantity of fat droplets without metabolic disturbances. However, if dietary offer is excessive, fat droplets cumulate and merge, forming giant droplets, displacing and compressi ng organelles. In muscular fibres, this displacement can damage and atrophy the contractile apparatus. In liver, both dietary and hepatotoxic-derived chronic steatosis can lead a toxic and inflammatory response (steatohepatitis), with hepatic insufficiency, cirrhosis and neoplasia as probable terminal consequences. For example, alcohol co nsumption is the most frequent cause of steatohepatitis ( Alcoholic Liver Disease ) in humans (McCance & Huether, 2019). The pathogenesis of ALD is not entirely characterized, and new studies reveal a main role of mitochondrial participation: ethanol is transformed in acetaldehyde at cytosolic level, with participation of cytochrome P450 (placed in smooth ER surface) (Guengerich, Wilkey, & Phan, 2019) and transported to mitochondrial matrix. Acetaldehyde is transformed in acetate and delivered to TCA cycle, fatty acids, ketone bodies and am ino acids synthesis. Animal studies have shown that alcohol causes Cyt-P 450 and mitochondrial DNA damage, lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, leading to steatohepatitis (McCance & Huether, 2019). b. Irreversible cell damage and cell death : The cellular response to injury depends on the type of cell damaged, its vulnerability and/or resistance to hypoxia and d irect membrane damage and the nature, severity, and extent of the injury. I.e. neurons, cardiac myocyte s, endothelium, and kidney's proximal tubule epithelium are cell that are very vulnerable to hypoxia. Whereas fibroblasts, adipocytes, and other mesenchymal structural cells are fewer vulnerable. While many stresses and stimuli cause cell death, the type of cell death follows one of two pathways. The first is necrosis, a pathological term deno ting to areas of dead cells within a tissue or organ. Necrosis is the result of an acute and usually deep metabolic disturbance, such as ischemia and severe toxicant-induced 41 damage, where cell death occurs with abrupt onset after adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion (Zachary, 2017). Since necrosis as detected in tissue sections is a consequence rather than a process, the term oncosis describe the process leading to necrotic cell death. The second pattern is programmed cell death, most commonly manifested as apoptosis. In this case, specific stimuli start execution of well-defined process leading to orderly cel ls' resorption with slight escape of cellular components into the extracellular space and litt le inflammation. Unlike the abrupt necrosis' event, apoptosis can take hours to conclude and is an ATP - requiring process without an evident point of no return. I. Necrosis: There are a common set of events that occur in necrotic cell death: failure of respiratory chain leads to ATP depletion, which causes cytoskeletal alterations and cellular ion transport disruption. These changes at molecular level cause cellular swelling and organelle vacuolization. Following, mitochondr ial depolarization, lysosomal breakdown, plasma to organic anions, intracellular Ca 2+ and pH dysregulation, and accelerated vacuoles formation with more rapid swelling occurs. Finally, the process culminates with the rupture of vacuolized organelles' membrane. Vacuoles' rupture leads to loss of metabolic intermediates, leakage of cytosolic and lyso somal enzymes, and collapse of all electrical and ion gradients across the membrane. This all-or-nothing collapse of the plasma membrane permeability barrier is lo ng-lasting, irreversible, and incompatible with cell's life (Zachary, 2017). II. Apoptosis: Apoptosis is a mechanism to regulate cell number and is vital throughout the life of all metazoans. Different to oncotic necrosis, in which the dying cell swells until it literally explodes, apoptotic cell death is a process of condensation, shrinkage and fragmentation followed by phagocytosis. As explained above, there are two apoptosis pathways, the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathway. While some different types of biochemical events have been recognized as important in apoptosis, maybe the core role belongs to the caspases. Remarkably, inhibition of caspases, rather than defending the cell from death, could readdress it from apoptosis to necrotic cell death. Their enzymatic properties are ruled b y a dominant specificity for protein substrates containing Asp and using a Cyst eine side chain for catalysing peptide bond cleavage. This specificity allows caspases to do a small number of peptide cleavages on a specific protein, normally only one, but this only cleavage can activate or deactivate (but don't degrade) this protein. Three caspases act as initiators : caspase-8 and 10 in extrinsic pathway, caspase-2 (activated by p53 following DNA damage) and caspase-9 in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. Then, initiator apoptosis extrinsic pathway, Death Factors (DFs) as Tumoral Necrosis Factor, act as ligands binding to cell surface Death Receptors (DRs). Once activat ed by their ligands, DRs as FAS and TRAILR (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor) recruit and trigger its associated death domains ( FAD and TRADD , respectively) and procaspase-8 to form the cytoplasmic DISC (Reed & Green, 2011). 42 TRADD cooperates with FADD, which activates procaspase-8. Enough active caspase-8 then activates executioner caspases 3 and 7 to execute apoptosis. Caspase-8 can also cleaves Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, which translocates to mitochondria to activate intrinsic However, if caspase-8 activi ty is deficient, DR-mediated apoptosis can be increased by mitochondria, usually through Bcl-2 proteins, such as the proapoptotic Bak (Bcl-2 antagonist) and Bax (Bcl-2 -associated X the apoptosis intrinsic pathway, no ligation between DFs and DRs are required. The triggers are toxins as ROS, starvation, lacking growth factors or hormones and DNA damage that leads to stimulation of p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) (Sung et al., 2018). Here, the key event is MOMP (a lethal mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization ), triggered by activation, posttranslational modification, and upregulation of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins as the mentioned PUMA. For instance, PUMA induce MOMP via oligomerization of Bax and Bak to form channels in the OMM (Beyfuss & Hood, 2018). This permeabilization of OMM releases cytochrome c from the intermembrane space into the cytosol. Cytochrome c promotes the assembly of the caspase-activating complex or apoptosome, which involves to caspase-9 and apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1 ) (Dorstyn et al., MOMP also second mitochondrial activator hydrolases, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), and endonuclease G (Thornton & Hagberg, 2015). In the execution phase of apoptosis, the activated executioner (caspases 3, 6 and 7) cleave cell proteins after Asp residues. In a similar way, Granzyme B from cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells can also trigger apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and caspase-7 (Martinvalet, 2019). Executioner caspases cleave nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, leading to disintegration of the nucleus, disruption of the cytoskeleton and cell fragmentation. 3. Mitochondria response to stress and damage (Adaptation, fis sion, fusion, senescence, apoptosis) Most of the primary mediators of the stress response, including hormones (Glucocorticoids and catecholamines), immune factors (cytokines) and heat-sho ck proteins, exert numerous effects on mitochondrial response. This response is modulated in a proportional ratio with the energy needs of tissue affected (Herbers et al., 2019) and depending on the nature of the stressor (Klionsky et al., 2016; Manoli et al., 2007) : (1) growing mitochondrial number by biogenesis and/or increasing their volume; (2 ) the expression activity (OXPHOS) subunits; (3) regulati ng the uncoupling of the respiratory chain, with consequent release of energy in the form of heat; (4) enabling signal transduction between mitochondria and nucleus and other intracellular organelles; (5) producing ROS for signalling or defence; and (6) ind ucing the apoptotic cascade. As explained previously, difference between adaptation and injury depends on the intensity and duration of stimuli. a. As shown earlier, mtDNA replication and mitochondrial fission are the mechanism for mitochondrial proliferation that guarantees that growing and dividing cells ho ld an adequate number of mitochondria to sustain their cellular functions. Both in a ph ysiological response and in a response to deleterious stimuli, these processes are stimulated by stressors that 43 increase the Ca 2+ ER release and/or Ca 2+ transmembrane influx from intercellular matrix to cytosol. As a result, Mid49, Mid51, and Mff are activated and they recruit Drp1 to mitochondria (Youle & Van GTPase , which translocated to the mitochondrial outer membrane where itself assembles by using GTP as energy source. Drp1 is recruited from the cytosol to form spirals that include ER tubules and actomyosin filaments arou nd a single mitochondria to constrict and separate it in two (Roy et al., 2015). On the other hand, stress- increased energy needs activate the nuclear respiration factor 1 (NRF-1 ) that triggers a structural protein of mitochondrial nucleoid, the mitochondrial transcription facto r A ( TFAM ) which, in conjunction with nuclear- DNA polymerase (POLA) activate mtDNA replication (Herbers et al., 2019). b. Mitochondrial fusion is essential for mixing of mitochondrial contents and preserving electrical conductivity throughout the mitochondria. When mtDNA is damaged (mutat ions, deletions, oxidation by ROS, or UV-induced pyrimidine-dimers formation, etc) or membrane integrity and electric potential are compromised, mitochondria respond by fusion between them. This process allows mtDNA reparation by recombination (cross-complementation) and through the exchange of lipids and proteins. Mitochondrial fusion is activat ed GTPases 2, Opa1 ). Mfn1 and 2 have transmembrane domains fixed to OM M that tether OMM with other organelles' membrane, including other mitochondri a. Normally, Opa1 is involved in maintain cristae morphology and the assembly of the pro- apoptotic factor cytochrome c and other components of electron transport chain comp lexes. The function of Opa1 is controlled by the mitochondrial energetic status. In healthy cells, Opa1 is present in two main forms: an IMM-anchored form, responsible for mitochondrial fusion at IMM level and a soluble form in the intermembrane space. The soluble form is produced by proteolytic cleavage of Opa1 is also optionally triggered by decreased mitochondrial function and membrane potential, that activate a metalloprotease , Oma1 . Then, Oma 1 cleaves can become uncapable to perform fusion . c. In a final step, mixed mitochondria separate all the damaged components (mtDNA, m atrix proteins and membranes) from the healthy or functional ones, by using the fission process, and then, the non-functional mitochondria can be eliminated by autophagy , as described previously. d. Cellular senescence denotes a stress response targeting to preserve cellular homeostasis. The senescent cell is a stressed or damaged, yet viable, cell that has entered an irreversible, non-proliferative state while remaining metabolically active (Wiley et al., 2 016). The first condition described to lead cellular senescence has telomeres' shortening (de Magalh\u00e3es & Passos, 2018). Additionally, there are a wide range of other stimuli documented as mai n inducers of premature cellular senescence, such as oxidative stress, activated oncogenes (oncogene induced senescence/OIS), failure to repair DNA damage by irradiation or genotoxic drugs, cell -cell fusion, epigenetic modifiers , or disturbed protein functions and regulation (proteostasis) (Vasileiou et al., 2019). 44 There are two conflicting points of view about mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS) : on the one hand, mitochondrial homeostatic mechanisms, such as impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolism and dynami cs, has arose as a hallmark of cellular senescence . On the other, impaired mechanisms in mitochondrial function ( mitostasis ) have been suggested to induce cellular senescence . As in a vicious circle, senescent cells are characterized by increased production of r eactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly attributed to dysfunctional OXPHOS. Mitochondrial ROS can exacerbate cellular senescence by increasing the mtDNA damage and its response sig nalling pathway (DDR) (Vasileiou et al., 2019). So, the greater the mtDNA damage, the greater the degree of OXPHOS dysfunction and greater ROS production. In MiDAS, perturbation of mitochondrial homeostasis produces various results that act as triggers of senescence molecular axes involving the tumour suppressor p53 and Rb- p16 INK4A . p53 acts as the starter, whereas Rb-p16 INK4A continue the cell-cycle arrest. Mitochondrial dysfunction includes a decreased NAD +: NADH and/or increased ADP: ATP or AMP: ATP cytosolic ratios. These metabolic imbalances activate the energy 5'AMP - activated protein ( AMPK phenotype drive to senescence paracrine & Wiley et al., 2016). Additio nally, chronic upregulation of p53 is a major stimulus to intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway , as explained previously. 45 Chapter 3. Mitochondrial diseases Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a variety of disorders, i ncluding primary mitochondrial diseases and other common conditions, such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and aging-related diseases. The causes why mitochondria can become sub functional are varied. For example, the mitochondria of cardiac muscle, after an event of hypoxia and / or ischemia, undergo metabolic changes that persist after the oxyg en supply to the myocardium has been re-established. Something similar occurs in tissues affec ted by inflammatory processes, even after the resolution of these processes (James D. M cCully, Levitsky, del Nido, & Cowan, 2016; Wu et al., 2016). Acquired disorders involving mitochondria include Type II diabetes mellitus, some neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, increased infections susceptibility and cancer. These disorders are described below. In mammalian females, age correlates with the accumulation of damage in the mitochondrial DNA of the oocytes and even with the decrease in the number of mito chondria present in these cells, causing problems of decreased female fertility, due to the in feasibility of oocytes, impediment of embryo implantation or early embryonic death (Bentov , Yavorska, Esfandiari, Jurisicova, & Casper, et al., 20 16; Shourbagy, Spikings, Freitas, & John, 2006). On the other hand, if a female with this condition has a live birth, the new-born will have a high probability of suffering diseases characterized b y mitochondrial dysfunction, whether of reproductive or metabolic type. Finally, both in domestic mammals and in humans, specific and inherited m utations in the mitochondrial genome have been identified, related to maternally inherited mi tochondrial genetic defects or secondary mitochondrial disorders due to nuclear gene defect s. A list of these disorders is included in table 1 (see below) (Claiborne, English, & Kahn, 2016; L evinger, al., 2009; Tachibana et al., 2009). 1. Acquired dysfunction (Chronic diseases, description, types of trea tment) Nowadays, our comprehension of the aging process remains incomplete, but most gerontology's researchers would agree that aging starts with mo lecular damage, leading to cell, tissue and eventually organ dysfunction. According to this viewpoint, the inherent process of aging would create a platform upon which the age-related diseases app ear (Payne & Chinnery, 2015). The best-known hypothesis to explicate aging is the free rad ical theory, which proposes a central role for mitochondria as the primary source of intracel lular reactive oxygen species (ROS) that leads to mtDNA mutations (Sun, Youle, & Finkel, 2016 ). Acquired mtDNA mutations have been widely described in normal human aging , mostly in tissues with terminal differentiation such as muscular fibres and neurons, but also in cells with high mitotic rates such as enterocytes, and somatic mtDNA mutations are also well - described in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (Giorgi et al., 2018). 46 Table 1. Mitochondrial diseases and associated genes Primary mitochondrial diseases due to mitochondrial gene defects Maternally inherited diseases Genes affected (AGY), Ser (UCN), Tyr) Myopathy Diabetes MT tRNA (Glu) NARP (MILS deafness MT tRNA (Ser syndrome mtDNA deletion Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia; CPEO : Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia; : Dominant Optic Atrophy; KSS : Kearns-Sayre Syndrome; (B. H. Coh en, Chinnery, & Copeland, 2018) and (R. L. Davis, Liang, & Sue, 2018) Mitochondrial deterioration can show a wide range of dysfunctions, related with acquired diseases. Many of these diseases are aging-related or share its physiopathology with normal aging process. Between mitochondrial abnormalities, ROS producti on have been considered one of the major consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction, addi tionally, ATP deficiency, mutations in mtDNA, mitochondrial permeability transition por e (mPTP) opening, apoptosis, Ca2+ deregulation, inflammation, and altered fusion/fission dynamics are all mitochondrial features that, whereas not necessarily acting independently, become 47 disrupted in aging process and many related disorders as Type 2 diab etes mellitus, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Atherosclerosis, Increased infections susceptibility and cancer (Lane, Hilsabeck, & Rea, 2015). a. Type 2 Diabetes: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common metabolic diseases worldwide, and its prevalence has continued to rise in recent years. It w as estimate that there are around 451 million people with DM (in 2017) and 4-5 million deaths worldwide each year (Cho et al., 2018; Roglic & Unwin, 2010). Whereas Type 1 DM is a low-prevalence autoimmune disease characterized by -cell destruction and deficient insulin secretion, Type 2 DM ( T2DM ) is characterized by an impairment of insulin action and account almost the 90% of diabetes cases (Fujimaki & Kuwabara, 2017). T2DM includes insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and increased leve ls of blood glucose due to overnutrition accompanied by insulin secretion deficiency - related to -cell exhaustion. T2DM is commonly related with the development of associated comorbidities, affecting muscular tissues, nervous system, liver, kidney and endocrine glands. For instance , in skeletal muscle, T2DM shows increased ROS production, with a reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis and content (Martin & McGee, 201 4). Mitochondrial content reduction is the main cause of the muscular impaired energy metabolism (Lai, Kummitha, & Hoppel, 2017). Additionally, T2DM shows decreased mitochondrial fusion and increased mitophagy, that induces the accumulation of damaged mitochondria in skeletal muscle, leading to the disturbance of energy metabolism (Rieusset, 2015). Neurons doesn't depend of GLUT4 -the insulin- dependent glucose carrier- therefore, insulin resistance affects neurons indirectly. However, T2DM affects neurons by triggering mitochondrial dysfunction: reduced respiratory chain activity, increased neurons' ROS pro duction, ER and mitochondrial calcium release to cytosol and apoptosis by intrinsic pathway. In fact, individu als with T2DM have twofold risk to develop dementia, the most common type of Alz heimer's Disease ( T2DM-related AD ) (Silzer & Phillips, b. Neurodegenerative diseases: there are a list of neurodegenerative diseases of mitochondrial ALS ) and Friedreich's ataxia, among others. There are cumulative evidence that diseases as PD, stroke, ALS and AD are more common in some human groups, linking these diseases with specific mitochondrial haplogroups (Coskun et al., 2012; Keogh & Chinnery, 2015). these haplogroups have an increased predisposition to pre-mitochondrial aetio logical factors. For example, the mitochondrial role in Parkinson's disease (PD ) was found by studying the Parkinson-like toxic syndromes related with heroine consumption and paraquat or rotenone poisoning. The development of Parkinson-like toxi c models -by using the mentioned toxins- revealed a reduction of complex I activity and a rise in RO S production leading the accumulation of mtDNA mutations in dopaminergic neurons at substancia nigra as direct effect of these toxins (Guillet-Pichon & Verny, 2016). Sporadic form of PD shows similar mitochondrial dysfunction at comple x I, related with 48 a set of primary aetiological factors as neuronal autotoxicity and previous mitochondrial damages. Otherwise, in the familial form of PD , there are heritable mutations affecting a set of nuclear DNA genes as -synuclein, LRRK2, Ubiquitin ue-induced kinase (PINK 1). These mutations affect a wide range of brain neurons, inclu ding dopaminergic and cholinergic ones is accompanied by mitochond rial fragmentation plus reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and the failure of ubiquitin-proteasomal system alters mitostasis by failing in , 2018). A second illustration of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer's Disease. In AD , is widely recognized that intercellular Amiloid- peptide protein-Tau cumulation is responsible of neurofibrillary degeneration, which are the central lesions in AD. However, it is unclear if mitochondrial dysfunction is the cause or a consequence of these lesions (J. Wan g & Chen, 2016). Nowadays, the MERCs/MAMs hypothesis for AD theorises that Mitochondrial-ER contacts (MERCs) may be the places at which all the AD -related mitochondrial dysfunctions converge: a proteomic data analysis revealed that Mitochondria Associated ER Membranes (MAMs) are enriched with compounds associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. This protein cumulation could induce MAMs ' functional failure, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (De Mario, Martinvalet, & Giacomello, 2016; al., 2016). c. Atherosclerosis: atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the vessel wall characterized by the chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of macrophages. The macrophages' conversion into pathologic foam cells filled with lipidic vacuo les, suggests that the macrophage is exposed to a devastating load of lipid and cell debri s that might paralyze any previous defensive role. Evidence indicates that atherosclerotic lesion development is intensely compromised if monocytes are prevented from entering the blood vessel wall and thus a pathologic contributi on is indicated. Atherosclerosis starts with lipids as triglycerides and cholesterol are deposited under the ve ssels' intima, forming the atheromatous plaques. Theses plaques growth by the proliferation and cumulation of fibrous tissue and smoo th muscle, protruding in the vessel's lumen and consequently reducing the vessel's diameter and the (Victor, to the proteoglycans of intercel lular matrix and suffer spontaneous oxidation that provokes intima's inflammation and monocytes and lymphocytes infiltration. Then, macrophages phagocyte the oxidized lipids, but they are incapable to degrade these lipids into their phagosomes, which becomes vacuoles permanently stored into macrophages' cytosol (foam cells) . On the other hand, T lymphocytes are activated by oxidized lipids acting as antigens. T 49 Lymphocytes release Baradan, & Nasri, 2014). Mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease are closely related to primary cardiomyopathy, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ROS production, and atherosclerosis by regulating systemic metabolism inflammati on, proliferation, and apoptosis. mtDNA damage arises before atherosclerotic lesions. Atherosclerotic fibrous cap and core area exhibit significant mitochondrial dysfu nction characterized by a reduction in mtDNA copy number, oxygen consumption and reduced mtDNA-encoded subunit complexes I, III, IV, and V, which lead to abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and augmented apoptosis and release of inflammatory factors. The mitochondrial dysfunction causes an opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and reduction of mit ochondrial membrane potential. The continued opening of the mPTP leads to the swell ing of mitochondrial matrix and rupture of OMM. This process results in the release of pro- apoptotic factors into the c ytosol and cell apoptosis. Vessel's wall inflammation activates the dendritic cells, neutrophils, cells through Toll- receptor 9 (TLR9 ) signalling and aggravates atherosclerotic lesion. These phenomena promote the development of atherosclerosis and plaque vulnerability (J. Lee et al., 2009; Peng et al., 2019; Victor et al., 2009). d. Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture susceptibility. Bone loss in elderly is the result of complex interactions between endocrine-induced metabolism reduction, changes in activity level, chan ges in nutrients intake, obesity and age-related disorders, including mitochon drial dysfunction (Greco, Pietschmann, & Migliaccio, 2019). Most of mentioned osteoporosis factors can act on bone metabolism and structure indirectly, through age-related muscular metabolism impairment (sarcopenia), where bone loss is understood as consequence of reduced muscular-bone physic and metabolic interactions that control bone remodelling. Also, direct effect of the mentioned facto rs can act on bone metabolism and structure. However, effective therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating osteoporosis are unavailable because of the limited understanding of mechanisms underlying this disease. New evidence has confirmed that oxygen consumption rate and intracellular ATP content are significantly upregulated during osteoblastogenesis, indicating contribution of mitochondrial energy metabolism in bone stem cells' differ entiation (Zheng, Sui, Qiu, Hu, & Jin, 2019). Mitochondrial role in osteoporosis is connected to oxidative stress ( OS ) that leads to osteoblasts apoptosis, osteoblastogenesis downregulation and bone remodelling impairment (Zheng et al., 2019). The mechanism involves an initial disturbance of mitochondrial fission and fu sion mechanisms by OPA-1 ROS-induced alteration. However, it is unclear whether OPA1- mediated mitochondrial events regulate OS-induced osteoblast apoptosis (Cai et al ., 2019). Recently, researchers have found that ROS activate FoxOs (maybe impairing FoxOS deactivation by sirtuins), causing Wnt signalling inhibition in bone stems cells, causing a reduction in osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis activation. FoxOs is a group of proteins that performs a key role in the cells ' adaptation to a variety of 50 stressors such as oxidative stress and growth factor deprivation by promoting cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, autophagy, and free radicals cleaning (Almeida & Porter, 2019). Additionally, increased ROS production and ATP depletion follo wing mitochondrial transcription factor A ( Tfam ) deficiency lead to increased osteoclast differentiation and activity (bone-resorbing) even with augmented apoptosis (Suh, Chon, Jung, & Choi, 2019). e. Increased infections susceptibility : In elderly, increased prevalence and severity of infections is caused by a decline in bone marrow (BM) myelopoiesis and reduced leukocytes' activity. However, aging causes a paradoxical behaviour on immune system. On one hand, there are the mentioned impairment of defensive reaction to infections. On the other hand, an increased and diffuse inflammatory response and a rise of autoimmunity disorders can be observed. Age-related impairment of mitochondrial function can impair immune respo nse. Mitochondrial ROS production is a crucial antimicrobial function macro dendritic cells, and neutrophils (Pinegin, Vorobjeva, Pashenkov, & Chernyak, 2018). Aging is characteristically accompanied by reduced mitochondrial production o f antimicrobial ROS and a simultaneous rise of phagocytes' oxidative stress. Reduction in phagocytes' activity impair antigen's presentation and lymphocyte activati on. Additionally, elderly's phagocytes show a DNA release from damaged mitochondria to cytosol that is a main promoter of ROS production and inflammatio n and may consequently promote host immunosenescence by different mechanisms. (Jose, Bendickova, Kepak, Krenova, & Fric, 2017; Picca et al., 2019). Some researchers explore the relation between a widespread asymptomatic - herpesvirus HHV5 ( Cytomegalovirus, Parini, Giuliani, & Santoro, 2019). However, the possibility of mitochondrial origin of inflamm-aging remains on the table since mitochondrial \"danger signals\" released by cells during stress, apoptosis or necrosis (e.g. cardiolipin, n- formyl peptides (e.g., fMet), TFAM, ATP, mitochondrial ROS and mtDNA) can be recognized as mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs) by phagocyte's pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and others. Mitochondrial release of DAMPs may induce inflammation via recognition by PRRs that leads to caspase-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation that leads the release of pro- inflammatory cytokines (McGuire, 2019). Other factor to be considered is th at an unusual proinflammatory macrophage's phenotype (M2 type) and its cumulation into tissues can be triggered by age- related macrophage's endoplasmic reticulum stress and Bossche, Mastroberardino, de Winther, & Leenen, 2019) f. Cancer : Most of cancer cells have somatic mutations in mtDNA and/or the mtDNA depletion, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with aggressive malignancy and poor prognosis in some types o f cancer (Fakouri, Hansen, Desler, Anugula, & Rasmussen, 2019). Reduced mtDNA content is equally detected in tumour-initiating cells. Despite mutations in mit ochondrial genes 51 are common in cancer cells, they don't eliminate entirely the mitochondrial energy metabolism and functionality. Instead, they promote redirecting of cancer cell's bioenergetics and biosynthetic phenotype through a mitochondria-to-nucleus signalling triggered by \"dysfunctional\" mitochondria (Chakrabarty et al., 2018) that changes transcription and/or activity of cancer-related genes and signalling pathways . Different cancer cell types may undergo different bioenergetic changes, some to more glycolytic and some to more oxidative. These different metabolic profiles may coincide within the same tumour mass (intratumor heterogeneity), including some similar to mesenchymal stem cells ' profiles that can explain Cancer cells reinforce their metabolism to promote growth, survival, proliferation, and long-term preservation. The common characteristic of this reformed metabolism is the improved glucose uptake and a preference for lactic glycolysis. This behaviour is detected even in the presence of adequate oxygen concentration and totally operational mitochondria and, together, is known as the 'Warburg Effect' (Liberti & Locasale, 2016). Recently, some studies showed that the Warburg Effect is required for tumour growth. In one hand, mesenchymal stem cells-derived stanniocalcin-1 ( promotes by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, reducing intracellular ROS, and shifting metabolism towards a mor e glycolytic metabolic profile. Additionally, it has been exposed that nei ther hypoxia nor OXPHOS defects imply a stopping of mitochondrial metabolism, and in any case the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle can alter metabolic fluxes to promote a glutamine dependent biosynthetic pathway that sustains tumour progression. Hence, the TCA cycle represents a metabolic pivot that drives substrate use upon changes in resources accessibility (Vatrinet et al., 2017). These changes can promote cell survival b y regulating mitochondrial respiration and avoiding ROS-induced apoptosis (Ohkouchi et al., 2012). g. Subfertility: in many species, ovarian (female reproductive) aging and subfertility arise long before animals are considered chronologically aged. Because the ovaries suffer this relatively early aging process, maternal aging is a main cause of subfertility i n women and domestic animal females. The following features are common in ovarian aging: \u00b7 the ovarian oocyte pool remains quiescent since the foetal life until their recruitment in a menstrual or estral cycle . In women, this recruitment can be delayed by more than 30 years, augmenting the aging consequences (Albu & Albu, 2017). In domestic animals, specially murine, bovine and porcine mod els, the species' metabolic rate and/or the pressure for zootechnic yields causing obesity and metabolic imbalance accelerate the animals' ovarian aging rate (Aardema, van Tol, & Vos, 2019; Baggerman, 2019). \u00b7 During quiescent period , oocyte's DNA (including mtDNA) and cytoplasmic structures are very vulnerable to damage by radiation, ROS, toxic compounds an d more. Chromosomal aberrations are recurrently found in human gametes (21% and of spermatozoa), of aneuploidies in oocytes, while structural chromosomal abnormalities predominate in sperm cells. Chromosomes 21, 22, and 16 are frequently overrepresented in aneuploid g ametes (Albu & Albu, 2017). The influence of age on ovary is owed to both reduced number and quality of the oocytes, consequence of the high rate of chromosomal aneuploidy in the embryo and mitochondria dysfunction. \u00b7 mtDNA damage plays a main role in reduced oocyte and embryo quality and developmental capacity because it lacks repair systems, including the opportunity of recombination with a healthy and fresh mtDNA pool from the sperm after fertilization. In most animal species, sperm's mitochondria are ubiqu itinated and destroyed by autophagy before the zygote's first division. In humans, the sperm's elimination mechanism remains poorly understood, but its existence is worldwide accepted and human paternal mtDNA inheritance is a very polemical find an d reason for immediate report and debate in the literature (Balciuniene & Balciunas, 2019; Luo et 2019). an oocyte's lesser response to n ormal pituitary's stimuli, leading to a reduction in oocyte recruitment. Additionally, oocytes from aged ov aries show mitochondrial structure's alteration and and mtDNA amount (Bianchi et al., 2015; Kushnir et al., 2012). Age-relat ed cumulative mitochondrial damage may be attributed to severe ATP synthesis reductio n and oxidative stress generated by ROS from the own et al., 2016; Roth, 2018; Simsek-Duran et al., 2013). These alterations reduce oocyte's fertilization rate, embryo development and implantation success (Mohammadzadeh, Fesahat, Khoradmehr, & Khalili, 2018; Payton Wang, Zhang, Jiang, & Seli, 2017; Woods et al., 2018) 2. Mitochondrial Hereditary diseases (Description, Types of treatm ent) Mitochondria contain their own DNA, inherited by matrilineal route (Liu et al., 2014), with its own genetic code that encodes 13 components of electron transport chain (ND1 to ND6 subunits of ETC complex subunits complex IV; subunit 6 and 8 of mitochondrial ATPase (complex V) and ETC complex III), 2 ribosomal RNAs an d 22 transfer RNAs (Mishra & Chan, 2014). The histone proteins can protect the nuclear genome from variou s types of DNA damaging agents, but mitochondrial genome lacks them, hereafter, mitochondri al DNA is more susceptible to cumulate damage than nuclear DNA. The mitochondrial DN A is exposed to various kinds of endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging agents, some of which can lead to various kinds of diseases including of neuro degenerative form, cancer, cardiom yopathy, diabetes and several aging-related disorders. 53 Figure 5: Map of Human Mitochondrial DNA and main mutations and deletions ca using inherited mitochondrial diseases. Descriptions in the text (\"WebHome < MITOMAP < Foswiki,\" n.d.) The fact that mitochondria are inherited only through the mother's way means that mitochondrial DNA does not benefit from the possibility of genetic recomb ination that the nuclear genome possesses thanks to sexual reproduction. Animal cells depend on the mitochondria because they only possess the enzymes required to perform oxidative phosphorylation, so the damage or mitochondrial DNA mutation (mtDNA) transl ates into the probability that the cells cannot maintain their balance bioenergetic, and in th e appearance of clinical signs based on tissue dysfunction with high energy consumption (Mishra & Chan, 20 14), such as muscle tissue, neurons and many tissues with endocrine function. The developing eggs in the female embryo go through an \"mtDNA bottleneck\", in which the number of mtDNA copies is first reduced to less than 50 copies and then am plified to more than 100,000 copies (Marlow, 2017; Shoubridge & Wai, 2007; Woods et al. , 2018). Therefore, unpredictable quantities of mutant and normal mtDNA are present in the mature eggs of an individual woman, and, therefore, in the cells of her offspring. This phenomenon influences the severity of diseases caused by mtDNA mutations and can lead to very different m anifestations between individuals from the same family. Mitochondrial diseases are one of the most common forms of inherited metabol ic syndrome, which show unique variability in clinical presentation and can manifest at any age in any organ. Even with dramatic advances in the genetic and metabolic diagnosis of these severe progressive diseases, there are still no curative treatments (Suomalainen & Battersby, 2018) . Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that results of dysfu nction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. They have a very variable spam of clinical p resentations and Low frequency deletion zone High frequency deletion zone 54 they can be triggered by mutation both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA). Whereas some mitochondrial disorders only disturb a single organ (e.g., the ear in in mi tochondrial deafness), most involve multiple organ systems, frequently accompanied with by mani fest neurologic and myopathic symptoms. Mitochondrial disorders may present at any age. We focused this work only on mtDNA-related diseases. Many persons with a mtDNA mutation show a set of clinical features that are grouped within a distinct clinical syndrome, such as mitochondrial encephalomyopat ). However, there are a substantial clinical variability, and many individuals do not enclose p recisely into one of the syndromes already mentioned, which is demonstrated by the overlapping range of disease phenotypes resulting from mutation of the nuclear gene POLG , which has arisen as a major cause of mitochondrial disease (Chinnery, 2014) in MIRAS and Leigh\u00b4s Syndrome. Common clinical signs and symptoms of mitochondrial disease include e xternal retinopathy, and diabetes mellitus. Com mon central nervous system features are fluctuating encephalopathy, seizures, dementia, migrai ne, stroke-like episodes, ataxia, and spasticity. A high incidence of mid- and late pregnancy loss is a common occurrence that often goes unrecognized. These features can be present in nuclear or mitochondria- encoded diseases, but the mitochondrial forms are more frequent. N uclear gene defects may be inherited in a recessive or dominant autosomal manner. Mit ochondrial DNA defects are inherited in a maternal way only (Chinnery, 2014). a. MELAS: MELAS, is a mitochondrial disease linked-in most the cases- to a point mutation in the MT-TL 1 gene -known as m.3243A>G mutation- on position 3243 of the mtDNA, where an adenine (A) is substituted with a guanine (G). This gene codes for mitochondrial tRNA Leu (Esterhuizen et al., 2019; Meseguer et al., 2019). The mutation alters protein synthesis at Complexes I, III, IV and V of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. MELAS is a multisystem disorder and its patients develop symptoms between ages two and 40 years. Most frequent symptoms includ e stroke-like episodes, encephalopathy with seizures and/or dementia, muscle weakness and exercise intolerance, repeated headaches, repeated vomiting, hearing loss, peripheral neuropathy, learning disability, and short stature. Lactic acidaemia is very frequent and show ragged red fibres are typically found in muscle histopatholog ic samples (El-Hattab, Almannai, & Scaglia, 2018). b. MERRF: Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers is another multisystem mitocho0ndrial disorder characterised by myoclonus, combined to epilepsy, ataxia, weakness and dementia. MERRF manifestations appear in childhood. As in MELAS, common findings include ragged red fibres, hearing loss and short stature. Additi onally, occasionally observed (DiMauro & H irano, 2015). The MERRF 's most commonly associated mitochondrial mutation (80% of the cases) affects the gene MT-TK encoding tRNA Lys , by presenting an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 8344 (m.8344A>G ) which is associated with severe defects in protein 55 synthesis, leading to fragmentation of mitochondria -correlated with altered processing of OPA1- and impaired OXPHOS (Chuang et al., 2017) . Others pathogenic variations have also been reported in a subgroup of persons with MERRF. c. LHON: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy develops during young adult life, around 15- 35 years old. This disorder affects four times more men than women. It is characterised a sudden bilateral subacute failure of the central visual field. in 75% of the cases, an eye is affected first, followed by the other in a period of two or three months. In the rest of the cases, both eyes are affected simultaneously. Most patients qualify for registration as legally blind (visual acuity 20/200). Neurologic syndromes such as postural tremor, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, and movement disorders are more common in individuals with LHON than in the general population. Some persons with LHON, usually women, may also develop a multiple sclerosis-like disease (Yu-Wai-Man & Chinnery, 2016). LHON is caused by one of three possible mutations that affect Complex 1 ND1 , 4 or 6 2017; Yu-Wai-Man Chinnery, d. Maternally-inherited Leigh 's and Retinitis Pigmentosa ) are part of a range of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by anomalies of mitochondrial energy generation . MILS is a subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy characterized by typical symptoms beginning of between ages three and 12 months, habitually subsequent to a viral infection. Mitochondrial most common variant ( m.8993 T>G) affects mtDNA for the ATP6 subunit of complex V (mtATP6 gene) (Guy & gene (Ng et al., 2019). In MILS, decompensation with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid during an intercurrent infection is characteristically related t o psychomotor delay or deterioration. Neurologic features include hypoton ia, spasticity, movement disorders (including chorea), cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy. Extra neurologic features may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. About 50% of affected individuals die by age three years, most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure (Thorburn, Rahman, & Rahman, 2017). NARP is characterized by proximal muscle weakness with sensory neuropathy, ataxia, and pigmentary retinopathy. Onset of symptoms, particularly ataxia and learning difficulties, is often in early childhood. Individuals with NARP can be relatively stable for many years, but may suffer episodic deterioration, often in association with viral illnesses. Most cases of NARP are caused by mutations i n the same genes related to MILS : et al., 2017) e. Pearson syndrome (PS): this is a large-scale single mtDNA deletion syndrome, along with Kearns -Sayre syndrome and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. In PS first cases reported, specific probes showed that the deletions spanned the genes coding for 4 subunits of NADH dehydrogenase, 1 subunit ATPase . The deletion spanned 4,977 bp (Rotig et al., 1989). Other cases range single mtDNA deletions between 3.5 to 8 kb (Jacobs et al., 2004). PS is a fatal syndrome that manifests bone marrow failure, recurrent sideroblastic features are variable and progressive. Anaemia typically starts into the first year of life and can be accompanied by pancy topenia and multisystem participation, including failure to thrive, hypotonia, and metab olic imbalances including lactic acidosis. Other features include alis, chronic colitis, and acute metabolic decompensations during intercurrent sickness. Death may happen in early childhood due to metabolic decompensation, liver failure, or sepsis due to neutro penia. Survival and spontaneous recovery from bone marrow dysfunction after several years is possible, with a transition to clinical manifestations of KSS (Goldstein & Falk, 20 19). f. Kearns -Sayre syndrome: KSS is usually due to a single mtDNA deletion of 4,977 bp known as m.8470_13446del4977 & Falk, 2019; Salda\u00f1a-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2019). Though KSS is due to a single mtDNA deletion in the majority of the cases, there are a number of cases in which KSS is due to mtDNA point mutations, such as m.3249G>A, m.3255G>A or m.3243A>G , all of them in the tRNA Leu gene (Finsterer, 2018). Patients present a core set of symptoms as weakness, onset <20 years old, myopathy, ptosis, ophthalmopl egia and retinal pigmentary abnormalities as main symptoms , frequently accompanied by hearing loss, elevated CSF protein, endocrine abnormalities and short stature (Finsterer, 201 9). Cardiac conduction defects may be present or develop later. Diagnosis is easily m ade by recognizing the patient's phenotype and screening for mtDNA deletions i n leukocytes. Early recognition and diagnosis are beneficial to allow for sympto matic management and routine cardiac monitoring (Goldstein & Falk, 2019). g. CPEO: Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia is the third syndrome caused mainly by the same large-scale mtDNA depletion that KSS, involving striate d muscles only. However, numerous pathogenic variants in either mtDNA or nuclear genes als o cause PEO that is often associated with other clinical manifestations, suggesting an underlying nuclear gene aetiology (Montano et al., 2019; Nogueira et al., 20 14). cPEO is characterized by ptosis, impaired ocular movements due to paralysis of the extraocular muscles (ophthalmoplegia), oropharyngeal weakness, and intermittent severe proximal limb weakness with exercise intolerance (Goldstein & Falk, 2019). Treatments: MELAS's treatment lacks a specific consensus approach. Symptomatic management can include cochlear implants for sensorineural hearing loss, anticonvul sants, standard analgesics, dietary modifications and hypoglycaemic agents for diabetes, regular exercise and psychiatric treatments. Some dietary supplementations as antioxidants, L-carniti ne and l -arginine 57 and/or citrulline infusion during stroke-like episodes helps to recovery and prevention of these manifestations by improving blood supply. Medications that affect negatively mit ochondrial function as anticonvulsant valproic acid must be avoided (A. W. El-Hattab, Adesina, J ones, & Scaglia, 2015). No cure exists for MERRF syndrome. As in MELAS, treatment with antiepilepti c drugs, regular exercise, high doses of CoQ10, L-carnitine, and vitamins ' composite has been tried to recover mitochondrial function and reduce mitochondria-generated oxidative stres s; however, success has been limited (Chang et al., 2013; DiMauro & Hirano , 2015). In the same way, MILS, KSS and CPEO are all to correct ptosis, acidosis control with sodium bicarbonate, anticonvulsants, physical therapy, cardiac pacemakers, etc. Nowadays, only LHON treatment with idebenone has been approved by the European Medicine Agency . This compound is a synthetic, short-chain analogue of ubiquinone, whi ch is responsible for transporting electrons from complexes I and II directly to complex II I. Also, idebenone shows a better bioavailability than CoQ10 at mitochondrial neuroprotective agents, improving of mitochondrial biogenesis, near-infrared therap y and more approaches are being studied (Jurkute, Harvey, & Yu-Wai-Man, 2019) 58 Chapter 4. Artificial Mitochondrial Transfer / Transplant (AMT/T) 1. From cell to cell communication to the AMT/T Cell-to-cell communication is an essential process for the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms. Various mechanisms for the exchange of molecular information between cells have been reported, e.g. ligands secretion, synapsi s, cytosolic components transfer through gap junctions or exosomes (Gerdes, Bukoreshtliev, & Barroso, 2007). Among them, Horizontal (cell-to-cell) mitochondrial transfer (HMT ) between mammalian cells was first observed some decades ago (Clark & Shay, 1982). This find has inspired new concepts about mitochondria and mtDNA segregation and inh eritance. Different modes of HMT have been reported under various pathophysiological conditio ns. However, the basis for cellular selection of a HMT mode remains unclear (Paliwal, Chaudhu ri, Agrawal, & Mohanty, 2018). HMT promotes the integration of mitochondria into the original mi tochondrial network of recipient cells, contributing to changes in the bioenergetic competence and in other functional properties of them, not only in vitro but also in vivo (Berridge, McConnell, et al., 2016). Additionally, HMT comprises also the transfer of mitochondrial genes, which has significant consequences in the physiopathology of mitochondrial dysfunction. The c ell-to-cell transfer of mitochondria or their components, may also result in the initiation of stem cell differentiation, reprogramming of differentiated cells, or stimulation of inflammatory signalling pathways. Various mechanisms facilitate HMT, including tunnelling nanotubes, exosom 2016). These finds have o pened new research lines for the treatment of mitochondrial related disorders by healthy mitochondrial transfer. a. HMT by cellular contacts: TNTs were first reported as large, ultrafine intercellular structures derived from filopodia-like protrusions, connecting cultured cells betwee n them and forming complex cellular networks (Rustom, 2004). TNTs have a di ameter of 50 to 1500 nm and an average length of 30 to 140 \u00b5m. TNTs possess a prominent F-actin pack crossing the whole length of the nanotube and, in case of the thick ones, cytokeratin and microtubules. Through TNTs, cells can share cytosolic components, and mitochondria (Gerdes et al., 2007). TNTs had probed to an important communicati on way between mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), immune cells and cancer cells (Jorgensen, 2019). HMT by nanotubes was probed to be capable for restore aerobic respiration (Ahmad et al., 2014; Spees, Olson, Whitney, & Prockop, 2006), improve phagocytic activ ity (Jackson et al., 2016), prevent inflammation damage and apoptosis (X. Li et al., 20 14a; X. Wang & Gerdes, 2015) and improve chemoresistance in tumoral cells (Pasquier et al., 2013). Gap junctional channels had been reported as a HMT way in an acute lung damage model (Islam et al., 2012a) , but more research is necessary to stablish if this is a main way. b. HMT through exosomes and microvesicles : Cells release diverse types of membrane vesicles of endosomal (exosomes) or plasma membrane origin These extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) represent a significant method of intercellular communication by serving as vehicles for transfer of membrane and 59 cytosolic proteins, lipids, and RNA between cells. The exosomes are released by a diversity of cells in vivo or in vitro conditions and this term is exclusive for v esicles released from cytosolic multivesicular bodies, whereas microvesicles are shed from plasma membrane (Raposo & Stoorvogel, 2013). These EVs contain a wide range of bioactive molecules, including membrane receptors, adhesion proteins, cytokines, chemokines, growth facto rs, and even different RNA species, including functional mRNA and miRNAs (Sluijter, Verh age, Deddens, van den Akker, & Doevendans, 2014). EVs transfer is involved in cell differentiation, paracrine regulation, disease signalling and progression and infla mmatory modulation. EVs related HMT had been observed in response to acute lung i njury models (Islam et al., 2012a), also in astrocyte response to neuronal damage (Berridge, Schneider, & McConnell, 2016) c. Internalization of isolated mitochondria in HMT : some studies have found that stress signals released by damaged or inflamed cells, including damaged mitochond ria, released mtDNA and mitochondrial metabolites as ROS, are categorized as damage associa ted molecular patterns (DAMPs) by surrounding mesenchymal cells (MSCs) and imm une system cells (Unuma, Aki, Funakoshi, Hashimoto, & Uemura, 2015). mtDNA released by damag ed cells are internalized by MSCs that then triggers the cytoprotective function of MSCs and improved mitochondrial biogenesis thus MSCs for Kami , Matoba, & Gojo, 2014). Although some of cellular competence for mitochondria l internalization by macropinocytosis was reported (Kitani et al., 2014), but there is not enou gh evidence that this is a frequent process (Rogers & Bhattacharya, 2013) 2. History and development of the Artificial Mitochondrial Transfer /Transplant techniques As seen before, many diseases, tissue damage, and aging challenge the cell and its mitochondrion, thus disturbing their integrity, function, and homeostasis (Lan e et al., 2015; Sinha et al., 2016a). Cells naturally have the capacity to exchange intracellular components and especially mitochondria through different processes such as cell-to-cell contact, m icrovesicles, nanotubular structures, and other mechanisms (Islam et al., 2012a; Rustom, 2004; Spees et al., 2006). Clark and Shay initiated the artificial mitochondria transfer (AMT), whi ch involved transferring mitochondria with antibiotic-resistant genes into sensitive cells, thereby enabli ng them to survive in a selective medium (Clark & Shay, 1982) and opening this new field of research. Subsequently to this work, the development of artificial transfer has and continues to mimic aspects of naturally occurring cell transport, especially in the mechanisms cell s naturally use to rescue other damaged cells. We will ponder key advances needed to expand the current knowledge about the artificial transfer of mitochondria and how these techniques could be used therapeutically. We will provide an overview of the features of the mitochondrial structure that are i mportant in maintaining its integrity throughout artificial transfer (Huang et al., 2016; Onfelt et al., 2006; Sluijter et al., 2014). Currently, there is a certain probability of achieving repair of mitocho ndrial dysfunction in mature human tissues that recover from different forms of cell damage (Islam et al., 2012; McCully et al., 2016) by transferring mitochondria obtained from the patient himself, from a human donor or even from another species. Pharmacological alternatives for the repair of dysfunctional mitochondria are also studied (Andreux et al., 2013). In the repro ductive area, 60 diverse methods for the replacement of dysfunctional mitochondria by healthy mitochondria from a donor are studied (Wolf, Mitalipov, & Mitalipov, 2015a). These techniques include: the transfer of the nucleus of the dysfunctional oocyte to a healthy enucleated oocyte (Tachibana et al., 2009), the transfer of cytoplasm rich in mitochondria from a h ealthy oocyte to a dysfunctional oocyte (Wu et al., 2016) and the direct transfer of purified mito chondria, taken from any tissue from a healthy donor to a dysfunctional cell (Andr\u00e9s Caicedo et al., 2015). a. Non- invasive AMT/T in vitro : In vitro AMT/T have a range of methodological approaches, from isolated mitochondrial transfer until cell-to-cell mitochondrial transfer. Th e first and simplest approach is the Mitochondrial Transformation (MT) , developed by Clark and Shay in 1982. In this research, they used the antibiotics chloramphenicol (CAP) and e frapeptin (EF), which inhibit the mitochondria's protein synthesis and ATPase function to kill sensitive mammalian cells. They demonstrated that purified mitochondria obtained from (CAP/EF)- resistant cells are taken by mutant (CAP/EF)-sensitive cells by using a presumed endocytic pathway after 12 hours coculture. Then, the mutant (CAP/EF)-sensitive cells can obtain resistance to these antibiotics by mtDNA recombination. Subsequently, the cellular internalization of mitochondria by macropinocytosis was demonstrated (Kitani et al., 2014a; Kitani et al., 2014b). However, the same research by Clark and Shay show ed that the mitochondria of modified cells, transferred to new cells, did not con fer resistance to the recipient cells. This offered evidence that mitochondria can only survive by having the genes for antibiotic resistance, i.e. with a healthy pool of genes. The developing of Clark and Shay's Mitochondrial Transformation continued until recent years. In the way, some efforts failed, possibly by methodological errors (Spees et al., 2006). The Katrangi et al research (2007) demonstrated that isolated mitochondria are very sensitive to management conditions, specially temperature, and that recipient cells nee d specific conditions to show successful mitochondrial internalization capability. For i nstance, cell with mitochondrial disfunction as A549 0 cells must be cultured in medium enriched with uridine and pyruvate to facilitate energy supply before performing mitochond rial intake (Spees et al., 2006). On the other hand, mitochondrial transformation can be blocked by the presence in the medium of some substances as pentosan polysulphate and hepari n, which indicate critical participation surface's heparan prote Saada-Reich, & Lorberboum-Galski, 2016). While the previous paragraphs are oriented to describe the use of Mitochond rial Transformation as a strategy to improve the synthesis of energy and the survival of recipient cells, some researches show that MT can be used to unbalance and eliminate cancer cells. Mitochondrial enzymes succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase had been reported as tumour suppressors (R. L. Elliott, Jiang, & Head, 20 12). Additionally, the improving of mitochondrial respiration, ROS production an d cell apoptosis by increasing the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor had been rep orted as consequence of Mitochondrial transfer to cancer cells (Chang et al., 2019). On the oth er hand, some studies demonstrated the protective role of mitochondrial transfer from M SCs to cancer cells on cancer cells viability and survivance (Ohkouchi et al., 2012; Sansone et al., 2017). These researches show that different types of cancer must be confronted by different cancer therapy strategies with mitochondria in mind: some types of cancer are damaged by healthy mitochondrial transfer, other kind of cancer could be treated wi th 61 damaged mitochondria and finally, mitochondria can be a target for pharmacol ogical attack, avoiding cancer cells proliferation or inducing apoptosis in them. Mitoception, a new approach for AMT/T in cultured or isolated cells, has been developed by Caicedo et al (2015). This approach allows the reduction of mitochond ria-cell coculture time. Its main advantage is the augmentation of mitochondrial cell i ntake, avoiding the mitochondrial decay as consequence of large coculture time lapse. The Mitoception protocol has been designed originally to be used on in vitro cultured cancer cells, attached to a culture substrate (MDA-MB-231 target cancer cells), or in neurospheres (glioblastoma stem cells) Caicedo al. , 2017). Recently, Mitoception was adapted to be used on suspended cells as PBMCs or gametes (Parra et al 2019, Cabrera et al 2019). This research shows that AMT/T in vitro, by using isolated mitochondria, can improve some cellular indicators as metabolic activi ty, mitochondrial mass, mtDNA sequence stability, p53 gene expression, and percentage of dead cells. Berridge et al (2016) have assembled an important research corpus about allogenic an d exogenic AMT/T under cell coculture conditions . In these researches, there is a manifest preference for the use of mesenchymal cells, both human and animal, as mitochondr ia's donor cells by cell-to-cell communication. Other cells that can act as mitochon dria donors are epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes and some nervous system's cells. However , mitochondrial transfer between cells in vivo had little evidence until recent y ears. Both approaches investigate the therapeutic use of mitochondria in a set of physiopato logical conditions as immunosuppression (Luz-Crawford et al., 2019a), hypoxemia, bacterial infection, trauma (H. Li et al., 2019) and antibiotic toxicity, amon g others. In these researches, the critical role of tunnelling nanotubules (TNTs) over another types of cell- to- cell mitochondrial transfer leads to the development of a new type of therapeutic approaches. b. Non- invasive AMT/T in vivo : Direct mitochondrial injection to damaged tissues (McCully et al., 2016) of mitochondria isolated from the same patient is the main t echnic in development. Mitochondrial injection to damaged tissues had demonstrated an improvement of high energy synthesis and cellular ATP storage along with an altered myocardial proteome. Once internalized the transplanted mitochondria rescued cellul ar function and replaced damaged mitochondrial DNA. No immune or auto-immun e reaction and no pro-arrhythmia as a result of the transplanted mitochondria was detected in these cases, opening a new field in the treatment research of hypoxia-ischemia lesions. This cell - to-cell communication approach has been studied in lung-diseases models, proving that mesenchymal cells introduced at damaged tissues can restore epithelial function and regenerative abilities (Islam et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014; Morrison et al., 2017; P aliwal et al., 2018). Other models study mitochondrial transfer as treatment for ischaemic cardiomyopathy (Blitzer et al., 2019; Masuzawa et D. McCully et al. , 2009; Moskowitzova et al., 2019), muscular (Orfany et al., 2019) and brain injury (Zh ang et al., 2019) and mitochondrial-related behavioural disorders (Y. Wang et al., 2019) c. Invasive techniques for AMT/T: The Ooplasm Transfer (OT) by microinjection to the oocyte is a technic originally developed by Cohen et al (1998) in order to treat the recurrent implantation failure in women. In OT, from 5 to 15% of the ooplasm fr om healthy and fertile 62 donor oocytes is injected into each developmentally compromised oocyte to improve its fertilizability and development's capability (Barritt, Brenner, Malter, & Cohen, 2001; J. Cohen, 1998). Also, this procedure had been successfully applied in experi mental animal models as bovine, fish and another species (Labarta, de los Santos, Escrib\u00e1, Pelli cer, & Herraiz, 2019). However, the impossibility to develop glass injection nee dles of required size (<1 \u00b5m in diameter) caused that cytosolic microinjection fails with smaller cells as somatic ones, limiting its practical applicability to oocytes . Nowadays, OT is a standard procedure for subfertility cases in women and remains as an experimental procedure in animal models as rodents, cows and sows (Brenner, Barri tt, Willadsen, & Cohen, 2000; Landry et al., Z.-B. Wang et al., 2017). In this procedure, mitochondria and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), proteins, and other factors are transferred, but the specific manner as ooplasmic transfer affects the physiology of the early human embryo was not initially understood. Earlier studies probe that aged females carry some acquired damage in oocyte's mtDNA, calcium metabolism, cytoskeleton structure, cytosolic proteins Goto, Kuwayama, Monji, & Iwata, 2013). However, more and more efforts have been directed to understand the mitochondrial role in the aged female oocyte, because most of the afo re- mentioned damages are related to mitochondrial dysfunction (Boudoures Anna, 20 17; Darbandi et al., 2016; Hammond et 2016; et al., 2017; Pawlak, Chabowska, Malyszka, & Lechniak, 2016). On the other hand, this procedure has been suggested as non- appropriate for mitochondrial inherited diseases' prevention. Some researchers consider that the large ooplasm volume needed to reduce oocyte's mutant mtDNA percentage needs more invasive manipulations that invoke serious ethical concerns (Yabuu chi et al., 2012). Between invasive AMT/T technics developed, Mitochondrial Supplementation (MS) is characterized by use isolated mitochondrial transfer, in this case, by microinjec tion (Cagnone et al., 2016; Pinkert, Irwin, Johnson, & Moffatt, 1997). As OT, MS is not available for small somatic cells. Neither for subfertility treatment yet, but it is a useful to ol for the study of mitochondrial fate during early embryo development. From these researches, some findings of interest are: mitochondrial MitoTracker toxicity, xeno offspring after xenogeneic MS because embryo and foetus's inadequate capacity for oxidative phosphorylation and possibly increased oxidative stress (Cannon et al., 2011; Ingraham, 2003; Trounce et al. , 2004) or mitochondria in intraspecific MS determined by (PN) utilizes a metallic nanostructure to produce a short laser pulse energy and transform it into a highly confined and precisely shaped explo sive vapor bubble. Rapid bubble expansion and collapse perforates a lightly-con tacting cell membrane via high-speed fluidic flows and induced transient shear stress. Developed in 2010, PN has been used by an single research team in some cellular transfer experiments (Wu, Teslaa, Teitell, & Chiou, 2010; Wu et al., 2011; French et al., 2011). In a recent study, this technic thtawas used by AMT/T in somatic cell lineage (143BTK- 0 cells). Mitochondrial transfer by 63 PN is reported as more efficient than cell fusion. Additionally, as other AMT/T technics, PN restores metabolic profile in recipient cells. However, PN works cell by cell prejudicing the obtention of enough cell quantities for statistical analysis in somatic cell mod els (Wu et al., 2016). A similar new twchnic, the Biophotonic Laser-Assisted Surgery Tool (BL AST) could deliver large cargo elements into 100,000 cells in 1 min, but mitochondria l transfer results with this technic has not been published yet (Patananan, Wu, Chiou, & Teitell, 2016; Wu et al., 2016) Magnetomitotransfer (MMT) is a novel technic that use antibodies anti-TOM22 bonded to magnetic microbeads. The antibodies bond to mitochondria, allowing thei r movement and transfer by using magnetic fields to move mitochondria. Interestingly, M MT can be used to transfer mitochondria inward or outward cells, making theoretically possible bot h rise the healthy mitochondria or reduce the damaged or mutated mitochondria amounts into the cultured cells (Hubbard et al., 2019; Macheiner et al., 2016). An additional advantage reported by the researchers is that MMT has a better mitochondrial yield than differential centrifugation (DC) and density gradient high speed/ultracentrifugation (UC), the basis of most the mitochondrial isolation protocols. However, it is po ssible that additional experiments with lower microbead concentrations are needed to test possi ble toxic effects of microbeads in AMT/T to cultured cells. 64 Chapter 5. Use of MitoCeption\u00ae for the Treatment of Mitochondrial disorders and diseases Medical consensus on mitochondrial diseases diagnosis and treatments is disappointi ng. In the most cases, they have remarkable heterogeneity, both in their clinical presentation and genetic aetiology, offering challenges for diagnosis, clinical management and clarification of molecular mechanism. treatment is restricted to exercise and dietary supplements without enough statistical basis proving their effectivity (Hirano, Emmanuele, & Quinzii, 201 8). Acquired mitochondrial disorders and some diseases with central mitochondrial involve ment as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Diabetes type II or Atherosclerosis have no treatment focused on improving mitochondrial behaviour or energy supply. On the other hand, recent researches proved that acquired disorders as post traumatic and hypoxemic muscular or neural degeneration can be treated with AMT/T (Masuzawa et al., 2013). Nowadays, some efforts for mtDNA modification in mitochondrial diseases have been done by using in vitro models: some researchers had obtained healthy cells from a LHON patient after modify their mutant mtDN A by using cybrid' s technology (Wong et al., 2017). In the immediate future, AMT/T, and specially MitoCeption, could be used to improve tissues\u00b4 survival and reparation, reducing signs and symptoms of these diseases. For instance, a recent paper claims that direct human mitochondria transferred can ameliorates cognitive deficits, neuronal loss and gliosis in an Alzheimer murine model (Nitzan et al., 2019). MitoCeption was originally developed as an in vitro AMT/T technic for cell me tabolism and mitochondria-cell interactions research by using substrate-attached cells (Andr\u00e9s Cai cedo et al., 2015). However, it is possible that MitoCeption can be used in m itochondrial disorders therapies. MitoCeption could be used to add healthy mitochondria in aged cells and thu s allow the renewal of the mitochondrial pool in cells ex-vivo before cell transplantation to patients. Mitochondrial acquired damage is due to many causes: hypoxia, toxic met abolites, drugs, nutritional imbalance, UV or gamma radiation, etc. Damage by UV radiation is a main concern in dermatology and skin oncology. Additionally, there is a participation of UV radiation causing immune suppression behind skin cancer progression. UV-related immune suppression in volves myeloid tissue and leukocytes' mtDNA alterations (Hart & Norval, 2017). To study if AMT/T can be used in order to treat UV-related mtDNA damage, we developed a UVR mtDNA damag e model by using UV-C irradiated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) as study objects and PBMCs from healthy donors to obtain high amounts of Mitochondria needed for Mitoception as AMT/T treatment approach. Our results demonstrated that UV-C cause mtDN A depletion, loss of cell viability, increase of mitochondrial ROS and P53 e xpression and Mitoception can restore UV- irradiated PBMCs' mtDNA account, mitochondrial mass and normal metabolic profile in vitro . The same procedure can be used in cell therapy. In some cases of age-related immunodeficiency due to phagocytic inability, Mitoception could renovate the mitochondrial pool of myeloid stem cells, improving phagocytes' capacities. This appro ach mimics the observations made on normal MSC and phagocytes behaviour in vitro (Gerdes et al., 2007; Jackson et al., 2016; Morrison et al., 2017). In the same way, MitoCeption could be used to cancer treatment. In vitro models of AMT/T proved that cancer cells can be affected by mitochondria transferred into the cells (Andr\u00e9s Caicedo et al., 2015; Chang et al. , 2019; Mombo 65 et al., 2017). These in vivo and ex vivo models have proved that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can transfer mitochondria to cancer cells naturally. On the other hand, some researches pro ved that horizontally transferred normal mitochondria can enhance tumoral growth (Do ng et al., 2017; A. S. Tan et al., 2015). However, it is possible to use Mitoception to produce autologous MSC loaded with defective or damaged mitochondria (as Trojan Horses) and transplant thes e MSC to the tumour boundaries. The horizontal transfer of damaged mitochondri a to the tumour cells could impair the tumour growth and even starts an apoptotic process inside it. On the other hand, elder women and domestic females suffer from low or loss of fertility since oocyte quality decreases as maternal aging (Kansaku et al., 2017; Moh ammadzadeh et al., 2018; Rambags et al., 2014; Woods et al., 2018). As energy source, mi tochondria play essential roles in oocyte development, determining pre-fertilization oocyte quality. With advanced maternal age, increased dysfunctions emerge in oocyte mitochondria, which decrease oo cyte quality its developmental potential (Schatten, Sun, & Prather, 2014; Z.-B. Wang AMT/T by microinjection to oocytes was proved by some research teams , showing an improvement of oocyte's developmental potential (Kujjo et al., 2013; Liu, Yang, Lu, & Qiu, 2008; Takeda et al., 2005; Woods & Ti lly, 2015). We suggest that autologous MitoCeption by using PBMCs as source of mitochondria, can b e an easier, faster and less expensive method to improve oocyte 's developmental potential, by improving the oocyte's fertilization yield and embryo's implantation probability in aged women an d domestic females as cows and female pigs. Nowadays, pronuclear or spindle transfer are the only technics used to prevent the transmission of maternally inherited mitochondrial diseases (Hyslop et al. , 2016; al., 2019; Rai, Craven, Hoogewijs, Russell, & Lightowlers, 2018), with the aim of reducing the mutant mtDNA percentage and reducing the probability of signs appearance in the new -born. We propose that these diseases are eligible for preventive treatment by MitoCeptio n instead of pronuclear or spindle transfer. Recently, we have successfully proved that Mitoception can be used with a xenotransfer model with Human Mitochondrial Mix on oocytes and zy gotes from healthy, young rodent females, without affect their developmental capacity and implantation (data not published yet, see paper N\u00b0 3 below). This model can satisfy both ethical and m edical concerns by avo iding the use of donor's germplasm, cancer drugs application as cytochalasin B or ooplasm damage. 66 Chapter 6. Results a.

H. Kim, Son, Benayoun, & Lee, 2018). For example, complexes are ensemble with subunits encoded by n DNA and the mtDNA in the mitochondria, mutations in any of their sequences could cause a failure and loss of cell homeostasis. Additionally, mutual regulatory mechanisms between both genomes to con trol mitochondria dynamics, biogenesis and cell homeostasis are in place to survi ve stress and aging(Boengler et al., 2011; Gammage, Moraes, & Minczuk, 2018; K. H. Kim et al., 2018). mtDNA is very different from nDNA as it lacks a chromatin packing and repairing mechanism s, make it particularly vulnerable to cellular and environmental mutagens. 700 mutations o f mtDNA have been described and some of them directly associated to infertility, my opathies, neurodegenerative disorders, among others diseases(Wolf, Mitalipov, & Mitalipov, 2015 b). Prevalence of mtDNA diseases has been estimated of 1 in 5000 individuals with a frequ ency of 1 in 200 new-borns(H. R. Elliott, Samuels, Eden, Relton, & Chinnery, 2008; G orman et al., 2016). As mtDNA is maternally inherited, it has been observed that 150 to 780 women per year are in risk of transmitting an mtDNA disease in the UK and US(Herbert & Turnbull, 2018). The mitochondrial susceptibility to harmful mutations and the frequency observed emph asize the importance of developing new therapeutic options to prevent the transmission or cure of mitochondrial diseases early in development(Herbert & Turnbull, 2018). The oocyte can carry inherited mitochondrial diseases or develop de novo mut ations during its development causing mitochondrial dysfunction that would reflect disease later in growth. The oocyte issued from an aged mother can accumulated mutations with time causing infertility. Patients with inherited or de novo mtDNA mutations have a variety of pathological phenotypes as cells can have coexisting healthy and mutated mtDNA genomes, this m ix is called heteroplasmy. An imbalance towards unhealthy mtDNA increases the possibility o f cellular dysfunction resulting in cells and tissues more affected than others in an organism(Go rman et al., 2016). Replacing or rebalance the heteroplasmy in the oocyte towards healthy mit ochondria could be a viable therapy to mutated mtDNA related disorders and oocyte aging. 107 Nowadays, a few options are available before and after conception for women carrying mtDNA hereditary mutations when desiring to have a healthy child. First, is necessary to estimate the levels of heteroplamsy and homoplasmy (were all the mtDNA is affected) by observing the patient symptoms and by DNA screening through tissue biopsy. If low penetra tion of the mtDNA mutations is observed, it is possible to continue to in v itro fertilisation (IVF) and select embryos carrying the less of mtDNA mutations. In the case of having a hig h percentage to tissues affected with mtDNA mutations or homoplasmy, egg donation and adopti on are the most common choices. As an emerging option, mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) or mitochondrial donation offers the possibility to have offspring genetically related and a reduction of the risk of transmitting an mtDNA related disorders. So far, MRT has sh own positive effects in clinical applications(Wolf et al., 2015b). As a possibility, g ene therapy could be plausible, however more evidence regarding the safety of this technology is needed bef ore human tests(Nightingale, Pfeffer, Bargiela, Horvath, & Chinnery, 2016). MRT uses different methods of transplanting the nuclear genome from an unfertilized or fertilized egg of an affected patient or couple to an enucleated egg coming fro m a healthy donor. MRT techniques applied before oocyte fertilization are spindle - chromo somal complexes (karyoplast) transfer (ST) and polar body pronuclear transfer (PNT). Pronuclear transfer (PNT), is an MRT performed after fertilization. Even if these procedures have resulted successful during in vivo and in clinical procedures, invasive manipulation, chemicals, unheal thy mitochondria residuals and recipient ovule loss due to enucleation are still causes of concern. Neverth eless, MRT is difficult to put in practice due the need of specialized equipment and extensi ve manipulation of germinal cells(Sato et al., 2005). Techniques based in th e cytoplasmic microinjection of mitochondria in oocytes represent a harm to its physiology as there is the risk of cell's destruction and a pronounced decrease of the amount of developing embryos , independently of the content of the needle or the developmental stage treated (oocyte or zygote) (Liu, Yang, Lu, & Qiu, 2008; Sokolova et al., 2004). Less invasiv e procedures to increase the quantity of healthy or eliminate unhealthy mitochondria are needed. Bet ter mitochondrial therapies, less complex to apply and with less manipulation could increase the p ossibility to have healthy offspring for women with mitochondrial disorders or oocyte fertility prob lems due to age. It has been reported that Mesenchymal Stem / Stromal Cells have the capacity to transfer functional mitochondria to stressed or damaged cells and different cell types(Andr&#x00E9 Caicedo et al., 2017; Islam et al., 2012b; Jackson Megan V. et al., 2016; X. Li et 2014b; & Bhattacharya, 2016b). Inspired by this process we develop the MitoCeption technique based in the artificial transfer / transplant of healthy mitochondri a (AMT/T) to a recipient cell using a thermic shock and a centrifugation. We previously observed that the transfer of healthy mitochondria to UVR stressed recipient cells repair the endogenous mitochondrial mass, mtDNA damage, metabolic activity and reduced the expression of stress markers such as p53(Cabrera et al., 2019). As oocytes and embryos can carry defective mitochondria, by mutations on its mtDNA, we sought to apply the MitoCepti on (AMT/T) technique to transfer effectively increasing amounts of healthy exogenous mitochon dria, increasing heteroplasmy and the possibility to reduce the diseased phenotype. For this reason, we propose the use of the Mitoception technique as an alternative of MRT for mi tochondrial transfer to oocytes or early embryos. Results AMT by Coincubation and MitoCeption to oocytes. To determine if murine oocytes can receive exogenous mitochondria by Mitoception, we develop a model in which we detect them by fluorescence microscopy and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in murine oocytes. Mitochondria was i solated from human Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) labelled with MitoTracker Red , combined in a three-donors mix and quantified. Mix was made in order to mi nimize the quantity of blood required from the donor without affecting the total amount of recovered mitochondria (50 to 60 ng/\u00b5L). Oocytes were collected from 8-12 weeks old and coincubation oocytes (25-30) and human mitochondria (2 5 ng/\u00b5L) was performed following the modified protocol for non-attached cells (MitoCeption, in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, 500 \u00b5L of RPMI at 5% FCS at 4\u00b0C, 500 g during 5 m in, then placed at to 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 during 1h)(Cabrera et After 1h of MitoCeption and coincubation, oocytes were washed and used for fluorescence and quantitative real-time qPCR detection of internalized human exogenous m itochondria. 109 Qualitatively, we observed an increase of red mitochondria detected in the g reen murine oocytes that were mitocepted in comparison with the controls (Fig. 1b). DNA was isolated fr om the control and Mitocepted oocytes. Human mtDNA, was detected by using primers that specifically bind to a unique region between positions 241 and 390 previ ously used in literature(Ajaz, Czajka, & Malik, 2015; Malik, 2011). Mouse specific mitochondria primers (mMito) were desig ned by Malik et. al. 2016 at position 1321-1447(Malik, Czajka, & Cunningham, 2016) . Nuclear were used for quantifying murine mitochondria and as a housekeeping gene respectively. We observed a statistically significant increase in the number of copies of human mtDNA in the murine mitocepted oocytes (ANOVA test, * p<0.01). No changes were observed in the quantity of mMito.

Discussion: Methods: Superovulation: We mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) i.p. into each mature female mouse (8-12 weeks old), between t he hours of 17:00 and 18:00. Follow this up 48- hours later with a 7.0 IU i.p. injection of hum an chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The next day, at 07:00, we prepare two Petri's dishes with Liquid paraffin: one for sperm capacitation (sperms' dish) and the second for oocytes' collection and IVF (fertilization dish). In both dishes, we put a drop (100 \u00b5l) of RPMI medium enriched with 130 0 mg/L of sodium pyruvate and 2000 mg/L of sodium lactate and we p lace the dishes on a hot plate at 37\u00b0C. Oocytes ' collection : We sacrifice the female mice and dissect them to expose the abdominal cavity. Then, we move forward the digestive tract from inside the abdomen and expose the uteruses, oviducts and ovaries. Remove the uteruses, oviducts and ovaries, and pl ace them on sterile filter paper. By carefully dissection, we remove the oviducts (ampullae) only, avoiding as much fat, blood and tissue fluid as possible. We immerse the removed oviducts in liquid paraffin contained within fertilization dish. Later, using forceps to hold the ovid uct against the base of the fertilization dish, we use a 30G injection's needle to tear open the ampulla of the oviduct and release the cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) from within. Then, we drag them into the drop of RPMI enriched medium. We cultivate the COCs at 37\u00b0C for the time needed for sperms' collection and capacitation. During this time (50 minute s average), the cumuli's cells partially come off the oocytes' surface (note: we did not sacrifice multiple mice at once; instead, we did sacrifice one mouse and swiftly remove its oviducts before moving on to the next mouse). Sperm collection and capacitation: We sacrifice one mature male mouse (3 to 6 months old) and remove his cauda epididymis , avoiding as much fat, blood and tissue fluid as possible. We place the tissue on sterile filter paper to blot away any blood and fluid. Then, we place the removed cauda epididymis in a sperm dish containing liquid paraffin. Then, we cut the duct of 115 each cauda epididymis using a 30G injection's needle and we use a dissecting needle to gently press the surface of the cauda epididymis and release the sperm within. Using a dissecting needle, we introduce the clots of spermatozoa released from the cauda epididymis into the drop of RPMI enriched medium at 37\u00b0C. We store the sperms' suspension for 30 minutes on the hot plate to perform the immediate sperms' capacit ation thanks to the normal contain of PBS of the medium. In vitro fertilization (IVF): After the 30 minutes for sperms' capacitation, we evaluate the sperms' motility with a microscope before taking 20-30 \u00b5 l of sperms' suspension and putting it in the medium drop of fertilization dish. We place the fertilization dish in an i ncubator (37 , 5% CO 2 in air) by 3 hours. Embryo wash and selection : after IVF, wash the embryos 3 times in fresh KSOM M16 Mouse Embryo Medium in a washing dish filled with liquid paraffin, avoidi ng the transfer of RPMI medium. The wash procedure consists in the individual oocyte transfer from one medium d rop (100 \u00b5 l) to the follow, using a capillary pipette (modified Pasteur's pipette). We d iscard any non - fertilized oocyte and parthenogenic embryos before continuing any procedure. Embryo culture: In a 12 well plate, we put 250 \u00b5l of KSOM M2 Mouse Embryo Medium for well and assay's condition, and we place 20 embryos (2 -cell stage and forward) each. This medium allows culture until blastocyst stage (3-5 days) in an incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in air. Embryo Transfer into s ubrogate mother's oviduct: While females selected and treated as oocytes' donors, synchronize an additional female of the same age with the same procedure (see up). The second day of embryo culture select 20 embryos of 2-6 cel l stage and put them in a drop of 100 \u00b5l of KSOM M2 Mouse Embryo Medi um in a Petri's dish filled with liquid paraffin and incubate at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in air until their transfer. Anesthetize the synchronized female 70% isopropanol and shave the hair from both zones. Put the female on the ho t plate at 37\u00b0C. Cut the skin and abdominal wall of one side and pull out the ovary, oviduct and part of the uterine horn. Clip a \"mosquito\" clamp onto the fat pat attached to the cranial side of ovarian bursa. Charge the capillary pipette with 2-3 bubbles of air, followed by 10 embryos . With a 30- gauge needle, make a hole in the external surface of the oviduct, just for ward the ampulla and insert the capillary pipette into the hole. Expel the embryos and the air bubbles. Co ver the oviduct with the fat pad, push the ovary, oviduct and uterine horn into the abdomen and close the wound using 3-0 Blue polypropylene suture or wound clips . Repeat the procedure in the other side of the body . Disinfect the chirurgical wounds with iodine and maintain the female over the hot plate at 37\u00b0C until her fully recovery from anaesthesia effects. If the embryo transfer was successful, a minimum of 3-4 new-borns must be obtained 21 days later. 116 PBMCs Isolation. Blood was collected from healthy adult donors, women and men between 20- 30 years old, each of whom provided informed consent in accordance with relev ant guidelines and regulations approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidad San Francisco de Qui to for mitochondria studies (2017-026IN). After blood collection, PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll- Paque Premium (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; MA, U.S) and centrifuged at 400 x g for 30 min without break or acceleration to create a density gradient. PBMCs were washed by suspension with 1X PBS (Gibco by Life Technologies, ThermoFisher Scientific; MA, U.S) in a standardi zed volume of 10 mL and centrifuged at 1500 x g for 20 min at 4\u00baC. Supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was re-suspended in 10 mL of PBS. Cells were counted in a Neubauer Cell Chamber and diluted to 1x106 cell/mL in 1% FCS RPMI (Gibco by Life Technol ogies, ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, U.S.) with a final volume of 2 mL in an Eppendorf tube per condition. Cells w ere stored for a maximum of 2 h at 4 oC until further assays were performed. Mitochondria labelling with PBMCs were incubated with 250 nm/mL of MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes by Life Technologies, ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, U.S) solution in 1% FCS RPMI at 37\u00b0C during 30 min. Two washes were performed to eliminate excess dye and cells were re-suspended in 1 mL of PBS. Once the mitochondria of P BMCs were labelled they were processed for isolation. Mitochondria isolation. Stained mitochondria were isolated from 10-20 million of fresh PBMCs using the Mitochondria Isolation Kit for Tissue (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, U.S) followin g manufacturer instructions with a final recovery step using a centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 15 min to obtain highly pure mitochondria isolates. A second wash was perform ed using the same centrifugation conditions to discard residues of Reactive C of the Kit. 1 mL of DME M High Glucose (Gibco by Life Technologies, ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, U.S.) without serum (D MEM pure) was added to re-suspend the mitochondrial pellet. Mitochondrial concentration was determined using Pierce TM Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientifi c, MA, U.S). A typical mitochondria yield was 30 to 50 ug/mL. The mitochondrial solution was stored at 4\u00b0C until MitoCeption of embryos was performed. Adapted MitoCeption Protocol. Zygotes from all conditions were centrifuged at 400 x g at 4\u00b0C during 5' in 2 mL of RPMI 1% FCS in a microcentrifu ge tube, the supernatant was discarded and 250 \u00b5L of the isolated mitochondrial solution, in DMEM pure, was added at different concentrations. 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes were centrifuged at 500 x g for 5' with the 250 \u00b5L of stained mitochondria and zygotes at 4\u00baC. Finally, zygotes were co-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 and washed by collecting each embryo individually with a capillary pipette an d placed in 250 \u00b5l of KSOM M2 Mouse Embryo Medium for well and assay's condition before left to culture until downstream assays. 117 Mitochondrial DNA transfer quantitation by qPCR . Embryos (zygotes and morulae) tested in all conditions were washed with 1mL PBS and centrifuged at 1200 x g for 5 min prior to the assay to eliminate un-transferred mitochondria. DNA was extracted from embryo s using MagMax - 96 Mutli-Sample Kit (Applied Biosystems by ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, U.S). Real Tim e quantitative PCR was performed in a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems b y ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, U.S). Fast Syber Green Master Mix (4385610; Applied Biosystems by ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, U.S) was used accordingly to manufacturer's instructions with a final DNA concentration of 10 ng/\u00b5L in a 10\u00b5L reaction. Murine and human DNA was the murine nuclear -2 microglobulin gene was used as a standard with the primers: 3'; hMitoR3 5' - 3'. The qPCR reaction was based on Ajaz et al., 2015 protocol with a minor modification: a pre-in cubation at 95\u00b0C for 5 denaturation 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds; annealing and extension at 63\u00b0C for 30 s (denaturati on and extension steps were repeated for 40 cycles); melting at 95\u00b0C for 5 seconds, 63\u00b0C for 1 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 seconds and 40\u00b0C for 30 seconds. Data were collected by estimating the 2- CT. Statistical analyses. Our data was analysed using GraphPad Prism 6. We performed Anderson- Darling Normality tests to determine the use of parametric or non-parametric analysis. After, we used un-paired ANOVA and t- Student's tests to analyse the differences among conditions, using an value of 0.05 (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001 , *****p<0,00001) to establish significant differences. Conclusion and discussion Mitochondrial diseases are a group of inherited sicknesses characterized for consiste ntly disturb mitochondrial respiratory chain function and cellular ATP synthesis. Nowadays, it could be considered as a main cause of inherited metabolic disease in humans (R. L . Davis et al., 2018), with a prevalence of 1 of 2000-5000 individuals in.... (Gorman et al., 2015; Suomalainen & Battersby, 2018). However, instead of their high prevalence, since mitochondrial diseases have a wide range of clinical presentations and intensities, their correct diagnosis and treatment remains difficult (Tranchant & Anheim, 2016). A little set of therapies for mitochondrial diseases' patients had been develo ped. Pharmacological, nutritional and sporting approaches are the most commons, but all of them with ambiguous benefits. Emerging therapies include (1) stimulation of mitochondria l 118 biogenesis; (2) regulation of mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics; (3) evade of OXPHOS defects; (4) replacement therapy (MRT); and (5) chronic hypoxia. (Hi rano et al., 2018). Among the emerging therapies mentioned, only MRT could be applied on the oocyte or embryo in order of prevent the development of these diseases (Rai et al., 2018). MRT was developed in somatic cells since the basic co-culture (Clark & Shay, 1982) un til microinjection (Liu et al., 2008). In the middle, another technics as peptide -mediated mitochondrial delivery (Chang et al., 2013) magnetomitotransfer (Macheiner et al., 2016), Photothermal Nanoblade (Wu et and centrifugation (Andr\u00e9s Caicedo et al ., 2015; M. J. Kim, Hwang, Yun, Lee, & Choi, 2018) were studied. Remarkably, only the mentioned M TR by microinjection to oocytes or embryos was performed in experimental assays. No wadays, the effort for prevent the mitochondrial diseases is focused in ooplasm, spin dle or nuclear transfer from one oocyte or zygote to another, always by However, coun tries as China or USA had declared illegal the treatments and researches that involve spindle or nuclear transfer, and this theme becomes very controversial (Appleby, 2015; Baylis, 2013). T o our knowledge, this is the first attempt to perform MTR in mouse embryos by Mitoception, a non-invasive technic developed originally for cultured cells by Caicedo et al, (2015). MRT were developed by using different methods of transplanting the nuclear genome from an unfertilized or fertilized egg of an affected patient or couple to an enucleated egg coming from a healthy donor. The MRT is performed by transfer spindle - chromosom al complexes (karyoplast) (ST) between mature metaphase II-arrested oocytes. The Karyoplast is introduced into an enucleated recipient egg (cytoplast) and then fertilized by intracytop injection(Tachibana, Sparman, & Mitalipov, 2010). MRT is performed after fertilization; the haploid separated and packed maternal and paternal genetic material pronuclei are transplanted to an enucleated donor egg. Polar body transfer (PBT) , uses a oocyte from a patient during its maturation, were it passes through two reductive div isions characterized by an uneven segregation of the cytoplasm obtaining two small bodies (PB1 and PB2, respectively) containing a complement of chromosomes. PB1 has a di ploid and PB2 has a haploid set, both have shown to continue to meiosis and full-term d evelopment of viable offspring when transferred to a donor oocyte. When used for MRT, PBT has shown to carry li ttle or undetectable diseased mitochondria, however PB1 and PB2 suffer in a brief time D NA fragmentation which lower the success of this technique(Wolf et al., 2015b). Even if thes e procedures have resulted successful, invasive manipulation, chemicals, unhealthy mitochon dria residuals and ovule loss to enucleate are still evidenced during the proto col which are of concern 119 when performed in human cells, being difficult to achieve due the need of specialized equipment(Sato et al., 2005). Techniques based in the cytoplasmic microinjection of mitochondria in o ocytes represent a harm to its physiology as there is the risk of cell's destructio n and a pronounced decrease of the amount of developing embryos, independently of the conten t of the needle or the developmental stage treated (oocyte or zygote) (Liu, Yang, Lu, & Qiu, 2008; Sok olova et al., 2004). For this reason, we propose the use of the Mitoception technique as a bett er alternative for mitochondrial transfer to oocytes or early embryos. It has been reported that Mesenchymal Stem / Stromal Cells have the capacity to transfer functional mitochondria to stressed or damaged cells and different cell types(Andr&#x00E9 Caicedo et al., 2017; Islam et al., 2012b; Jackson Megan V. et al., 2016; X. Li et al., 2014b; Luz-Crawford et al., 2019b; Miliotis et al., 2019; Si nha et al., 2016b). Inspired by this process we develop the MitoCeption technique based in the artificial transfer / transplant of healthy mitochondria (AMT/T) to a recipient cell using a thermic shock and a centrifugation. We previously observed that the transfer of healthy mitochondria to UVR stressed recipient cells repair the endogenous mitochondrial mass, mtDNA damage, metabolic activity and reduced the expression of stress markers such as p53(Cabrera et al., 2019). As oocytes and emb ryos can carry defective mitochondria, by mutations in their DNA, we sought to apply the MitoCeption (AMT/T) technique to transfer effectively increasing amounts of healthy exogenous mitochon dria, increasing heteroplasmy and the possibility to reduce the diseased phenotype. Mitochondria transfer history until Mitoception 1 paragraph In this study we seek to artificially transfer mitochondria to oocytes and zygotes and followed its normal development to later embryos by the updated Mito Ception protocol. In order to observe its survi val and implantation capacities in vitro and under an embryo's transfer protocol to subrogated mothers. Variability in mtDNA or nDNA sequences encoding for mitochondrial pr oteins are common and some of them could influence its protostasis leading to a high er susceptibility to disease and hereditary disorders(Latorre-Pellicer et al., 2016). 120 Bibliography: 1.

Conclusions and Perspectives Mitochondria are very important organelles. They are the cell powerhouse and, the y control central metabolic process as cell differentiation and fate, calcium and urea homeos tasis, and heme and nucleotides synthesis, among others. Additionally, mitochondria p lay a role in inflammation, tissues' recovery after hypoxemic conditions and cancer progression. Strict control of mitochondrial mtDNA structure, mitochondrial number and function is essential to normal cell metabolism. Cellular energy needs, hormones, cytokines and other stressors and signals exert influence on mitochondrial activity. Because of the wide range of functions and process where mitochondria are involv ed and by their deficiency in mtDNA repair mechanisms, these organelles are very sensitive to suffer damage in their membrane proteins and DNA. These organelles that are cru cial for life can also be main players in contributing to cell death and disease. Mit ochondrial repair mechanisms include mitochondrial fusion, fission and mitophagy. These i nternal mechanisms can repair only acquired damage and fail in repair inherited mtDNA mutations or deletions. Only mitochondrial transfer can aid to replace the mutant mitochondria by collaborati ng with mitochondrial fusion, fission and mitophagy to eliminate abnormal mi tochondria and improve the number of normal mitochondria. Because of this, horizontal (natural) mito chondrial transfer from mesenchymal stem cells to compromised cells can repair only acquired dis orders related to inflammation and hypoxemic damage. Acquired disorders can be treated with some mitochondrial therapies for tissue damage repair are being developed, including pharmacological treatments, mesenchymal stem cel l transplant and direct autologous mitochondrial injection to the tissues. Some artificia l mitochondrial transfer or transplant are being developed to improve mitochondria l load into the cells in vitro, searching to increase the mitochondrial repair rate in damaged c ells and tissues. Among the alternatives, MitoCeption surges as a therapeutic approach suitable to be used as therapy for acquired mitochondrial disorders. Our published work demonstrated that MitoCeption can repair mitochondrial mass loss due to UV radiation mtDNA damage in vitro . There is no evidence that Mitoception alters mitochondrial fusion, fission or mi tophagy in UV- irradiated cells in a negative way. In consequence, MitoCeption help reset normal m itochondrial mass and mtDNA quantity and reduce the expression of cell fate markers and deleteri ous metabolites as p53 and ROS, reducing cell mortality and restoring cellular metabolic profile. Acquired and inherited mitochondrial disorders are central issues in maternal subfertility, age-related diseases, some metabolic and degenerative disorders, and maternally inherited diseases as LHON, MERRF, MELAS, Leigh Syndrome and others. Farm animal models and murine models have proved the importance of mitochondrial mass and normal mtDNA quantity into the oocyte in relation with germplasm quality and embryo d evelopmental capability. In some cases of maternal subfertility, mitochondrial transfer, and speci ally MitoCeption to oocytes or zygotes, could restore mitochondrial mass and quality, solving the subfertility problem. In the case of maternally inherited mitochondrial diseases, t he treatment approaches for affected people include supportive treatments with mitogenic drugs, mitochondrial dietary supplementation and exercitation. Preventive approaches are limited to ooplasm micro injection and spindle or pro nuclear transfer from affected mother's oocytes or 139 zygotes to enucleated similar cells from a healthy donor woman, creating medical and et hical concerns that impair the developing and spreading of these therapies. Mitochondrial transfer/transplant technics, and specially MitoCeption, could be used to prevent inherited mitochondrial diseases by augmenting the percentage of normal mitochondria into the female germplasm without sacrifice donor's germplasm . Our last work mitochondria in murine oocytes and zygotes, withou t affecting their developmental capability. We conclude that MitoCeption could be a power ful tool in the human and animal female's subfertility and human inherited mitochondrial diseases treatment and/or prevention, through the donation of healthy mitochondria to cells with genetic mitochondrial defects. 140 References 1.
