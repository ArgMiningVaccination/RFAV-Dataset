The second edition has been revised to make it more accessible to everyone and is laid out to make it easy to find the most important information on all aspects of homeopathy quickly and concisely. Part 1 - An introduction to the principles of homeopathy as a self-contained curative system. The basics of anthroposophy, biochemical tissue salts and flower remedies are also explained. Part 2 - 56 flow charts (decision trees) which will help properly target the most appropriate homeopathic remedy for a wide range of commonly seen acute conditions, whether you are an experienced practitioner or newcomer to homeopathy. The charts are complemented by supplementary materia medica notes to further inform your choice of remedy.

It gives you confidence; it provides a footing for quick homeopathic action when time is of the essence. No theory, no prolonged intellectual discussion, just a guide to the action needed, here and now.\" - Ivo Wiesner in the Homeopathic Links "}
