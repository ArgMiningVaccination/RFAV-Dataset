It is a vibrant community known for arts, culture, education and music. Austin's vision is to become the most livable city in the country. This vision is supported through: city council priorities; organizational values; comprehensive planning; and corporate initiatives. The City of Austin is committed to providing the highest level of service to its citizens, and comprehensive planning is integral in realizing the City's vision. Austin's comprehensive planning structure is established as a pyramid. The first three layers of the pyramid focus on overarching long-term planning efforts: city vision, council priorities and long-range council policies and plans. This level of detail provides the framework for the mid and short-range planning documents that are more responsive to changes in the environment and are easily refined and revisited on a regular basis. Moving down the planning pyramid, more flexibility is allowed while modifications stay confined to the vision and council priorities. Section 1 - Introduction City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 2 One objective to meeting the city council priority of maintaining a healthy and safe city is protecting lives and property. The City accomplishes this through wise planning, including the development of mitigation plans, commonly referred to as Hazard Mitigation Action Plans (HMAP). Despite the planning mechanisms that the City currently has in place, Austin can be subject to natural and man-caused or technological hazards. These life-th reatening hazards can destroy property, disrupt the economy and lower the overall qua lity of life for individuals. While it is impossible to prevent a hazard event from occurring, the impact of hazards can be lessened in terms of their effect on people and property. This concept is known as hazard mitigation, which is defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects1. Communities participate in hazard mitigation by developing hazard mitiga tion plans. The Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) and FEMA have authority to review and approve of hazard mitigation plans through th e Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The City of Austin initially developed a Hazard Mitigation Action Plan in 2003, which was one of the first mitigation plans approved by FEMA in 2004 for the State of Texas. This plan, titled, \"Disaster Ready Austin: Building a Safe, Secure and Sustainable Community2\" was developed between the city and the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA). The mitigation planning regulation of the Disaster Mitigation Act requires that mitigation plans be 1www.fema.gov 2 The 2004 FEMA-approved plan can be found at: http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/disasterready/mitplan.htm Section 1 - Introduction City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 3 reviewed and revised within five years of approval to maintain eligibility for mitigation grant funding3 Since FEMA originally approved the Austin HMAP in 2004, the City began the process of develo ping a Hazard Mitigation Action Plan Update (hereinafter \"Update\" or \"Plan Upda te\") in order to maintain eligibility for grant funding within the five-year window by applying for a Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) planning grant in 2008. The City was awarded grant funds in September of 2008 and selected the consultant team of H2O Partners, Inc. and subcontractor Post, Buckley, Schuh & Jernigan, Inc. (PBS&J) to write and develop the Update, which provides an opportunity for the City to evaluate successful mitigation actions and explore oppo rtunities to avoid future disaster loss. It is widely accepted that the most effe ctive mitigation measures are implemented at the local government level, where decisions on the regulation and control of development are ultimately made. A comprehensive update to mitigation plans addresses hazard vulnerabilities that exis t today and in the foreseeable future. Therefore it is essential that projected pa tterns of future development are evaluated and considered in terms of how that growth will increase or decrease a community's overall hazard vulnerability. The Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) is responsible for overseeing the development of the Plan Update for the City of Austin. Scope This Hazard Mitigation Action Plan Update for the City of Austin, Texas is intended as a blueprint for future hazard mitigation. This Plan Update is designed to help maintain a sustainable community that, when confronted by natural or man-caused disasters, will sustain fewer losses and recover more quickly. 3 44 CFR \u00a7201.6(d)(3) Section 1 - Introduction City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 4 The focus of the Plan Update is to mitiga te those hazards classified as \"high\" or \"moderate\" risk as determined through a detailed hazard risk assessment conducted for the City of Austin. Hazards th at pose a \"low\" or \"negligible\" risk will continue to be evaluated during future updates to the plan, but they may not be fully addressed until they are determined to be of high or moderate risk. This enables the City to prioritize mitigation actions based on hazards which are understood to present the greatest risk to lives and property. The geographic scope (i.e., the planning area ) for the Plan Update includes all areas within the City of Austin and its extraterritorial jurisdictions4 as displayed in Figure 1-1 below. Figure 1\u00ad1. Area Covered in the Plan Update 4 Texas allows cities to make ce rtain decisions about the land beyond a their incorporated limits. Section 1 - Introduction City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 5 Purpose The overarching goal of the Update is to minimize or eliminate long-term risks to human life and property from known hazards by identifying and implementing cost- effective mitigation actions. The purpose of the Update is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of disaster response and recovery. Through this update process, the City seeks to: Provide a comprehensive update to the 2004 HMAP; Minimize disruption to the City of Austin following a disaster; Streamline disaster recovery by articulating actions to be taken before a disaster strikes to reduce or eliminate future damage; Demonstrate a firm local commitment to hazard mitigation principles; Serve as a basis for future funding th at may become available through grant and technical assistance programs offered by the State or Federal government. The Plan Update will enable the city to take advantage of rapidly developing mitigation grant opportunities as they arise; and Ensure that the City of Austin maintains its eligibility for the full range of future Federal disaster relief. The Mission Statement for the Update is, \" Maintaining a secure and sustainable future through the revision and development of targeted mitigation actions to protect life and property.\" Authority The updated plan will be tailored specifically for the City of Austin and its planning partners5, and will reflect conditions that have changed since the completion of the 2004 plan. When complete, the Plan Update will comply with all requirements promulgated by the TDEM and all applicable provisions of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Section 104 of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) (P.L. 106-390), and the Bunning- Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-264), which amended the National Flood Insurance Act (N FIA) of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001, et al). 5 For a full list of planning partners, see Appendix A. Section 1 - Introduction City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 6 It will also comply with FEMA's February 26, 2002 Interim Final Rule (\"the Rule\") at 44 CFR Part 201 which specifies the crite ria for approval of mitigation plans required in Section 322 of the DMA 2000. The updated plan will also be developed in accordance with FEMA's Community Rating System (CRS) Floodplain Management Plan standards and policies. Summary of Sections Sections 1 and 2 of the Plan Update outline the purpose and the process of development. Section 3 describes the City as a whole in terms of population and demographics, economy and education. Th is section is designed to provide a snapshot of the community and planning ar ea to assist officials in recognizing factors that play a role in determinin g community vulnerability to hazards. Section 4 identifies the people and property at risk as well as hazards facing the City, including the process of identifica tion and risk assessment methodologies utilized. Sections 5 and 6 complete the Risk Assessment by profiling, analyzing and assessing the natural and man-caused hazard s that present an overall risk to the City of Austin. The Risk Assessment builds on available historical data from past hazard occurrences, establishes detailed prof iles for each hazard, and culminates in a hazard risk ranking based on conclusi ons about the frequency of occurrence, spatial extent and potential impact of each hazard. Section 6 also identifies repetitive loss properties. Through an inventory of existing plan s as well as a detailed questionnaire submitted by local officials, a Capability Assessment was developed to assess and examine the city's capabilities, including: planning and regulatory capability; staff and organizational (administrative) cap ability; technical capability; fiscal capability; and political capability. Information from surveys and previous plans was compiled and analyzed to determine any ex isting gaps in planning capabilities. This information is fo und in Section 7. Section 8 discusses mitigation strategy and consists of broad mitigation goal statements as well as an analysis of haza rd mitigation techniques for the City to consider in reducing hazard vulnerabilities. The specific local mitigation actions are fo und in Section 9. This section contains not only new mitigation actions, but also all previous mitigation actions from the Section 1 - Introduction City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 7 2004 Plan. For previous actions, a brief an alysis is included after each action stating whether the action has been completed, is deferred for the Update, or should be deleted for feasibility reasons. Section 9 also includes mitigation actions to maintain compliance with the Nation al Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Section 10 identifies plan maintenance procedures. This includes the measures that the City will take to ensure the continuous long-term implementation of the Update. The procedures also include the manner in which the Plan Update will be regularly evaluated and updated to rema in a current and meaningful planning document. Appendix A contains a list of Planning Team members and stakeholders. Public survey results are analyzed in Appendix B. Appendix C contains a list of toxic sites for the area, and Appendix D lists critical facilities6. Appendix E contains documentation of meetings in the form of newspaper ads, sign in sheets and online announcements7.

This s ection provides an overview of the planning process, highlighting key steps as well as providing detailed description s of how stakeholders and the public were involved. Overview of the Plan Update The City of Austin received funding under the Hazard Mitig ation Grant Program (HMGP) to complete an update for their 2004 HMAP . The purpose of this Plan Update is to meet FEMA's requirement to provide updated hazard mitigation plans every five years. Although many of the current natural and man -caused disast ers that affect the City of Austin are the same as those identified for the 200 4 Plan, an update is necessary Section 2 - Planning Process City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 2 to take into account all modified or revised data from the past five years, including evolving demographics and mitigation strategies. This 2009 Update began in January of 2009 with a Kickoff Workshop at the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM). At this workshop and later meetings, the following factors were taken into consideration when reviewing and updating the 200 4 Plan : Whether the goals address current and expected conditions; If the nature or magnitude of risks have changed; If there are current resources available for implementing the Plan; Whether implementation problems, such as technical, political, legal or coor dination issues hinder development; If outcomes have occurred as expected; and How communities, agencies and partners participated in the implementation process. Planning Team The planning team was established using a direct representation model. Key members of H2O Partners, Inc. developed the plan, corresponding with HSEM who acted as Direct Representatives for the City of Austin. Several partners in planning were also instrumental at meetings throughout the process. These team members included repres entatives from the Austin Independent School District, the Seton Hospital System, Austin Community College and the Austin Climate Protection Program under Austin Energy. These planning team members as well as a list of stakeholders can be found in Appendi x A. Some of the responsibilities of the planning team included: providing input regarding the identification of hazards, revising mitigation goals to reflect modified conditions, and developing new mitigation strategies. Figure 2 -1. Mitigation Planning Process Section 2 - Planning Process City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 3 Members of the Planning Team at the Kickoff Workshop Planning Process The process u sed to prepare this Plan Update included four major steps beginning in January of 2009. Each of these planning steps resulted in critical work products and outcomes that collectively make up the updated plan. Documentation for participation at each works hop is found in Appendix E1 Kickoff Workshop . The initial Kickoff Meeting was held at HSEM offices on January 7, 2009. This initial meeting was an opportunity to inform participa nts about the planning process, develop a timeline, solicit input about the previous plan and collect critical information. In addition to the Kickoff presentation, all team members received presentation folders with the following information: background paperwork about the plan update; public participation survey for distributi on 2 capability assessment survey for completion ; and Hazard Identification Planning team members developed the list of significant hazards included in this Plan Update by reviewing : the 200 4 Plan ; the State of Texas Hazard Mitigation Plan; and initial resu lts from reputable sources such as federal and state agencies. Based on this initial analysis, the team identified a total of 1 4 natural and man - caused hazards that could affect the area. Risk Assessment An initial risk assessment for the City was complet ed in April of 2009 , with the final product produced in September of 2009. The results of the initial assessment were presented at workshop for the City held on April 27 , 2009. Participants and 1 This appendix will not be disclosed to the public as it is exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 2 This survey was also posted on the city's website and promoted from January 2009 to October 2009. Section 2 - Planning Process City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 4 stakeholder groups were invited to the Risk Assessment Works hop. At this workshop, the characteristics and consequences of each hazard were evaluated to determine how much of the area would be affected, in terms of potential danger to property and citizens. Potential dollar losses from each hazard were estimated , using the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Hazards U.S. (HAZUS) Multi -Hazards (MH) Model (HAZUS -MH) and other HAZUS -like modeling techniques. The assessments examined the impact of various hazards on the built environment, including general buildin g stock (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial), critical facilities, lifelines, and infrastructure. The resulting risk assessment profiled hazard events, provided information on previous occurrences , estimated probability of future events , and detail ed the spatial extent and magnitude of impact on people and property. Each participant was also given a risk ranking sheet to determine the level of risk for each hazard in terms of the probability or frequency of occurrence , extent of spatial impact, and magnitude of impact. The assessments were also used to set priorities for mitigation based on potenti al dollar losses and loss of lives. Mitigation Review and Development The mitigation strategy development for the Plan Update involved revising mitigation goals included in the 200 4 Plan, providing analyses for past actions and developing new mitigation actions. A Mitigation Workshop was held at the HS EM office on July 8, 2009. At the Mitigation Workshop, after an initial presentation regarding type s and examples of actions and the importance of mitigation planning, participants were asked to review the mitigation goals and objectives from the 200 4 Plan and determine what changes, if any, should be made. Though the team decided to keep the same goal s as the 2004 Plan, the order and priority of the goals were revised. This change is reflected in Section 8. Each participant and appropriate City department received a copy of the mitigatio n actions submitted for the 200 4 Plan and provided an analysis for the 2009 U pdate. This analysis includ ed stating whether each past action had been completed , should be deleted or would be deferred for the Plan Update . If an action was determined impracticable or unattainable, comments were included to explain the delet ion of the action. The analysis of each action can be found in Section 9 along with the newly -developed actions . Section 2 - Planning Process City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 5 An inclusive and structured process was used to develop and prioritize new mitigation actions for this Plan Updat e, which included the following steps: Review of the mitigation goals and objectives from the 200 4 Plan . A \"menu\" of optional mitigation actions was developed based on plan reviews, studies , and interviews with Federal, state and local officials. The participants reviewed the optional mitigation actions and narrowed the list down to those that were most applicable to their area of responsibility , most cost-effective in reducing risk, most easily implemented, and most likely to receive institutional and community support. Potential federal and state funding sources to assist implementing proposed actions were inventoried. Information was collected including the program name , authority, purpose of the program, types of assistance and eligible projects, conditions on funding, ty pes of hazards covered, matching requirements, application deadlines, and a point of contact. The information appears in the Funding Guide presented in Appendix F . Mitigation team members considered benefits that would result from the mitigation actions v ersus the cost of those projects. Detailed cost -benefit analyses were beyond the scope of this Update . However, economic evaluation was one factor that helped t eam members select one mitigation action from competing actions . Team members then selected and prioritized mitigation actions. Each team member evaluated and prioritized actions based on FEMA's STAPLE+E criteria , which includes considering the social, technical, administrative, political, legal, economic and environmental factors necessary for the implementation of each action . As a result of this exercise, an overall priority was assi gned to each mitigation action. The overall priority was denoted within each action by team members identifying actions as High (H), Moderate (M), or Low (L) as shown in Section 9 . Team members developed action plans identifying proposed actions, costs and benefits, the responsible organization(s), effects on new and existing buildings, implementation schedule, priority, and potential funding sources. On Decem ber 7, 2009, the draft of the Plan Update was made available on the HSEM website for review and comment by team members, stakeholders and the general public . Section 2 - Planning Process City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 6 Review and Incorporation of Existing Plans A variety of existing studies, plans, reports, and tec hnical information were reviewed as part of the planning process. Sources of the information included FEMA, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Texas Forest Service, the U.S. Fire Admini stration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA) , the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) , the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCE Q), the State Comptroller, the Texas State Data Center, the Texas Railroad Commission and information provided by the Texa s Division of Emergency Management (TDEM). The hazard -specific sections of the Update (Sections 4-6) summarize the findings from sources such as the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) through NOAA's website, which provide histories of disasters in the area. Studies from the USACE the TWDB were reviewed for grant funding and included at Section 7 . Materials from FEMA and the TDEM were reviewed and referred to throughout the planning process for guidance on plan development requirements. Existing plans were also reviewed by planning t eam members as a source of hazard information and potential mitigation actions. Public and Stakehold er Involvement Important components of mitigation planning include public participation and stakeholder involvement. Input from individual citizens and the community as a whole provides the planning team with a greater understanding of local concerns and increases the likelihood of successfully implemented mitigation actions. If citizens and st akeholders, such as local businesses, non -profits, hospitals and schools, are involved, they are more likely to gain a greater appreciation of the hazards present in their community and take steps to reduce their impact. Public Participation Public involv ement in the development of the City of Austin Hazard Mitigation Plan Update was sought at three separate periods of the planning process3 3 Documentati on of meeting attendance and notices for meetings is found at Appendix E : (1) during the beginning of the planning process ; (2) during the drafting stage of the Plan; and Section 2 - Planning Process City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 7 Community Members at a Public Meeting in Feb. 2009 (3) upon completion of a final draft Plan but prior to official plan approval and adoption. Public input was sought using three methods: (1) open public meetings ; (2) survey instruments ; and (3) making copies of draft Plan Update deliverables available for public review on the City's website . Locations and Notification of Public Meetings Three series of open public meetings were held during the development of this Update . For each series , four separate meetings were held throughout Austin. During each series of meetings, p resentations were given at the following libraries: Oak Springs Branch Library in East Austin; Manchaca Branch Library in South Austin; Spicewood Springs Branch Library in North Austin; and the Howson Branch Library in West Austin. The meetings were advertised through a variety of means including : notices in the Austin American -Statesman ; notices on the City of Austin HSEM website, Austin 360.com, craigslist.org and neighborhood association websites ; invitations sent via e -mail to community members; notices posted at Senior Activity Centers; flyers posted at libraries; and notices on Channel 6 and the News 8 Neighborhood Events Calendar. Further , a press conference was held on the morning of April 23, 2009 where City Council Members Laura Morrison an d Mike Martinez and City Manager Marc Ott discussed the importance of mitigation planning and informed citizens of upcoming public meetings. The press conference was aired on Channel 6, the City of Austin Government access channel. First Series of Publi c Meeting s The first series of open public meetings w ere held on February 10 and 11 at four locations throughout the City. These meetings were scheduled specifically for seeking public and stakeholder input. T opics of discussion for this first series of Section 2 - Planning Process City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 8 meeting s included : the purpose of hazard mitigation; the reason for the update; and options for hazards both natural and man -made . Second Series of Public Meeting s The second series of open public meetings w ere held on April 26 and April 27 . These m eetings were scheduled specifically for seeking public and stakeholder input. Like the first series of meetings, the second series of meetings were held at four library branches throughout the city. Attendees from the first series of meetings were invited via e -mail as well as community members who included contact information on public surveys filled out online. As this series of meetings coincided with the Risk Assessment Workshop, the topics discussed included overall hazard rankings as well as the pr eliminary results from public surveys collected 4 . Third Series of Public Meeting s The third series of open public meetings w ere conducted at the same libraries as the first and second series on July 7 and July 8, with the exception of the Howson Branch Library. This library was unavailable and the meeting was held at the Yarborough Branch Library. The dates selected coincided with the Mitigation Workshop . For this series of meetings, the consultant team provided an update on the planning process and mitigation actions considered . Attendees were asked to provide comments on the mitigation goals selected by the planning team and to suggest areas where mitigation activities would be needed. 4 See Appendix B for final survey results. Figure 2 -2. Press Release for Apr. 23 Conference/Meetings Section 2 - Planning Process City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 9 Public Participation Survey In addition to the open public meetings, the City was able to solicit input from citizens and stakeholders through the use of a public participation survey. This survey was designed to obtain data and information from residents in the City of Austin. Copies of the p ublic participation survey were distributed at each of the public meetings held throughout the process and made available online on the HSEM website . A total of 156 responses to the survey were received either from hard copies filled out, or surveys completed online. The in formation received provided valuable input in the development of the Plan Update, and a summary of the survey findings is provided in Appendix B. Stakeholder Involvement Stakeholders provide an essential service in hazard mitigation planning; therefore, throughout the planning process, members of state and federal agencies, community groups, local businesses, schools, and hospitals were invited to workshops held throughout the planning process. An initial stakeholder meeting was held on February 1 1, 2009 at City Hall. At this meeting attendees were informed of the process and invited to the Risk and Mitigation Workshops as well as all future public meetings. Input from stakeholders was also sought during W ildfire Awareness Week. The consultant tea m attended an event on April 4, 2009 during Wildfire Awareness Week to promote wildfire awareness through demonstrat ions, lectures and educational activities at the Austin and Nature Science Center. Public surveys were distributed and groups such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife and the Texas Forest Service were informed of the planning process and asked to participate at the Risk Figure 2 -3. Wildfire Awareness Invite Section 2 - Planning Process City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 10 Assessment and Mitigation Workshops. A full list of stakeholder members that were invited to meetings can be found at Appendix A .

What was initially a small settlement began to grow with the construction of the permanent capitol building and Governor's Mansion in the 1850s and the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central Railway in 18711. Soon thereafter the Austin skyline began to ta ke shape with the establishment of the University of Texas in 1883 and the opening of the Driskill Hotel in 1886. Along with the changing skyline, the population of Austin became more diverse in the early and mid 1900s when large numbers of Germans, Swedes and Mexicans migrated to the area. Several neighborhood communities began to spring up in the early part of the 19th century, including the community of Clarksville, which was settled by Charles Clark, a freeman, in 1871. The Clarksville area became the heart of the African-American community2. This community later migrated east of downtown, and had a significant influence in the development of jazz and blues clubs and Austin's early music scene3. In 1918 the City acquired Barton Springs, a spring-fed pool that is still a popular tourist attraction today. In 1924 the City adopted a council-manager government, focusing on city planning and beautification. After the development of the City Plan in 1928, Austin passed a bond that provided for the funding of streets, sewers, libraries, hospitals and multiple parks. This offer of profuse parks, pools and recreational areas, combined with the development of the first municipal airport in 1930, attracted many to the area. By 1936 the student population for the University of Texas had 1 Source: Handbook of Texas Online, available at: http//www.tshaonline.org/handboo Austin Visitor Center, available at: http://www.austintexas.org/visitors/a bout_austin/history__heritage/ Section 3 - Community Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 3 Image of State and Paramount Theatre - SXSW Festival. Photo by Euge ne Hernandez/IndieWire almost doubled from its inception, and the City had funded more municipal projects than any other city in Texas. As Austin continued to grow, it soon beca me known as a leader in music, film and most recently, technology. Austin has gained worldwide attention, not only from businesses and entrepreneurs, but families, mu sicians, artists and st udents as well. It is a green and welcoming community, appropriately referred to as the \"Live Music Capital of the World\" as it is home to over 200 live music venues and festivals such as the Austin City Limits Festival and the South by Southwest (SXSW) Festival, which is a film, music and interactive festival. The city also has a strong theatre and film culture with dozens of theatre companies and notable festivals such as the annual Austin Film Festival. This combination of music, art, film, technology and abundant natural resources attracts 19 million tourists to the area annually4. Government The City of Austin is a home rule city, meaning that the City Charter operates as the Constitution for the city and creates st ructure for all city ordinances. The City Charter for Austin also establishes the community as a council/manager form of government. The Austin City Council is made up of six members plus the Mayor, all of whom are elected at large to a three-year term. The Mayor and Council Members may serve in their respective se ats for a maximum of six years, or two consecutive terms. The City Manager is appointed by the City Council, and has overall responsibility for the manageme nt of all city employees and the administration of all city affairs. 4 Source: Austin Visitor Center , available at: http://www.austintexas.org/visitors/about_austin// Section 3 - Community Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 4 Austin City Hall View from Mt. Bonnell There are no political subdivisions in the City of Austin, but the City has over 30 different departments organized under six broad service categories: Capital Improvement/Management; Development and Environmental Services; Community Services; Transportation Services; Public Safety; and Financial/Administrative Support The various departments are either financed from an Enterprise fund, set up like a business where customers are charged a fee for services, or through a General fund, financed through taxes and fees. Geography and the Environment Geography Austin is located primarily in Travis County, although part of the City extends into Williamson and Hays Counties. It is situated on the Colorado River and is located at the eastern edge of the Hill Country and Edwards Plateau, about 236 miles from the Mexican Border. Due to its situation by the Hill Country, the western portion of Austin is made up of scenic rolling hills and limestone rock, whereas the eastern portion is more flat. Interstate 35 runs through the City, which occupies Section 3 - Community Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 5 a total land area of 301.86 square miles5 in the Central Texas Hill Country. The City is approximately 541 feet above sea level6 and is known for its parks and green space, including greenbelts, lakes, includ ing three man-made lakes within the city limits: Lady Bird Lake, Lake Austin, and Lake Walter E. Long. Additionally, the foot of Lake Travis, including Mansfield Dam, is located within the city's limits. The City contains a mixture of soils from silty clays to fine sandy loams and clay loams over limestone. A popular limestone formation is Mount Bonnell, which overlooks Lake Austin on the Colorado Ri ver and is approximately 780 feet above sea level. Austin is also within the Lower Colorado River Basin, which encompasses 21,000 square miles of contributing drainage ar ea, and receives an average of 30 to 40 inches of rain per year. A total of 123 wa tersheds exist in Austin, of which 13 are urban and 120 are in surrounding, non-urban areas. Of these 123 watersheds, 50 are monitored as part of the Environmental Integrity Index (EII), which measures water quality with parameters such as chemical, recreational, aesthetics, and macroinvertebrates scores.7 Environment One of the priorities of the City Council under the vision for the City of Austin is to be a Green community.8 To meet this goal the city has begun a Green City Initiative, which is \"a partnership between the City of Austin and the community, with the goal of preserving and protecting Austin's environment.\"9 Environmental accomplishments10 for the City include, but are not limited to: Reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 16.5 tons with the development of \"green\" buildings; Reducing electrical consumption at the airport by 12 percent annually; Installing over 66 miles of bike lanes; 5 City of Austin Demographer, available at : http//www.ci.austin.tx.us/demographics 6 Source: United States Census Bureau 7 City of Austin Watershed Development 8 See Section 1 for a discussion of the City of Austin's Vision. 9 City of Austin website, available at: http ://www.ci.austin.tx.us/gree ncityfest/default.htm 10 Ibid, available at: http://www.ci.austin.tx.u s/greencityfest/gcaccomplishments.htm Section 3 - Community Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 6 Shifting to alternatively-fueled mowers for the Parks and Recreation Department; Implementing a smoking ban in public places; Planting thousands of trees annually to ensure a healthy urban forest and mitigation the urban heat island effect; Reducing the annual total of sewage over flow from 13 million gallons to about 1 million; Banning coal tar-based pavement seal ants to cut the use of polycyclic automatic hydrocarbons in half; Increasing recycling through the innova tive Pay-As-You-Throw Program; Diverting yard waste from landfills th rough the use of brush chipping; and Providing educational programs and fe stivals to encourage environmental protection within the community. Austin has established over 20 environm ental programs to help maintain a sustainable community, conserve energy and protect: the climate of the city; the health of citizens; air and water quality; and the landscape and habitat. Representatives from one these programs, the Austin Climate Protection Program (ACPP), participated actively as a stak eholder group throughout the planning process. The ACPP's goal is to establish Austin as a leading city in the fight against climate change.11 To meet this goal, ACPP has begun implementing the Austin Climate Protection Plan, which was passed by the City Council in 2007. Part of the plan includes creating a Climate Action Team with representatives from all City of Austin departments and working with the community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 11 ACPP website, available at: http ://www.ci.austin.tx.us/acpp/acpp.htm Section 3 - Community Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 7 Population and Demographics According to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS), the 2008 population estimate for the City of Austin is 757,688, and the City of Austin Demographer estimates the population at 782,967 as of the September of 2009. For the purposes of the Risk Assessment (found in Sections 4-6), however, the population total from the 2000 U.S. Census, 691,986 will be used. Figure 3-1 shows the extent of the core study area (the incorporated limits of the City of Austin) along with the population distribution in this area at the census block level (based on Census 2000 populati on data derived from HAZUS-MH MR3). Figure 3\u00ad1. Population Distribution Section 3 - Community Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 8 A numeric breakdown of the population, including two groups of special needs populations: elderly (persons over the ag e of 65) and low income (less than $20,000) is shown in Table 3-1. Table 3\u00ad1. Population Distribution/Special Needs Populations TOTAL POPULATION (CENSUS 2000) SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS Elderly (Over 65) Low Income (< $20,000) 691,986 18,352 25,046 Population estimates from 1970 to 2007 and population projections from 2010 to 2040 are listed in Table 3-2 and illustrated in Figure 3-2, as provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Over the past four de cades the City of Austin has become increasingly more developed and urbanized (92 percent urban as of 2005). The City's total population in 1970 was 251,8 08 and increased by 38 percent to 656,562 by 2000. Between 2000 and 2006, the population increased 7.6 percent. (The percent change for the state of Texas between 2000 and 2006 was 12.7 percent.) By 2040, the City's population is projected to nearly double the 2007 population, for a projected population count of 1,476,783. Austin is one of the top five fastest growing metropolitan areas in the U.S. Table 3\u00ad2.

City of Austin Census Totals, Population Estimates, and Projections (a) = actual census data (e) = population estimate (p) = population projection Age and Sex According to the ACS, males make up 52. 2 percent of the City of Austin's population, a slight majority over fema les at 47.8 percent. Even though males make up a majority of the population over all, females make up the majority of the population age 65 and older. According to the 2008 ACS estimates, 58.6 percent of the population of people 65 and older is fema le. The median age for the city is 31.4, with 71.2 percent of the popu lation over the age of 21. Ethnicity The demographic components of Austin's rapid population growth are transforming it into an urban place that hosts four ra cial groups: Caucasian, Hispanic, African American, and Asian. The Hispanic share of Austin's total population increased from 30.5 percent in 2000 to 35.9 percent in 2008, and the Asian share of the total population went from 4.7 percent in 2000 to almost 5.5 percent in 2008. As estimated by the US Census projections in 2000, Austin is becoming a Majority- Minority city. Eventually there will not be a single ethnic or demographic group Section 3 - Community Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 10 that makes up a majority of the population , as the city's Caucasian population drops below 50 percent.12 While there has been growth in the total number of Anglo households in Austin, other ethnic groups have outpaced that growth. Figure 3-3, below, depicts this ethnicity trend. Table 3-3 displays the percentage of language spoken at home other than English among Austin, the State of Texas and the U.S. Figure 3\u00ad3.

While the United States and Texas each have a higher percentage for high school graduates and those with some college or an Associate's degree among citizens age 25 and older, the City has a higher percentage of citizen's that have obtained a Bachelor's, graduate or professional degree. Among those residents age 25 and older, 26.1 percent have a Bachelor's degree or higher, while 16.1 percent have a graduate or professional degree, which is almost double the percentage for the state as a whole. Table 3-4 below depicts educational attainment for residents age 25 and older for the City of Austin compared with Texas and the U.S. The larg est educational institutions for the City are depicted in Table 3-5.

Section 3 - Community Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 12 Allied Health Careers Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary Southern Careers Institute DeVry University Capital City Trade and Technical School Episcopal Theological Seminary Housing and Household Income According to estimates by the ACS, there were 303,355 housing units for the city in 2008. This number is expected to increase to 311,035 in 2010 according to the City of Austin Demographer. The average household size for the City of Austin is 2.4 people, compared with 2.7 for the state16. For family households, the city also maintains a lower number with 53.3 percent compared to 71 percent for Texas. An emerging trend for the City is the decline in the number of households consisting of families with children.17 Even though the overall number of families has increased, the to tal number of households consisting of families with children has decreased.18 The percentage of families with children has declined from a little over 32 percent in 1970 to just fewer than 14 percent in 200019. Median home values in Austin are the hi ghest in Texas at $178,800. Statewide, median home values in metropolitan areas are $113,800, compared to $181,800 nationally (Table 3-6). Table 3\u00ad6. Median Value of Owner\u00adOccupied Housing \u00ad 2007 Austin MSA Texas United States $178,800 $113,800 $181,800 According to a 2008 study by the City of Austin Demographer, the Austin MSA median family income is $69,100, which is down 0.3 percent from 2007, yet still above the state and national median income as shown in Table 3-7. 16 U.S. Census Bureau 17 R.

However, there are many indicators that the City is still faring well as the rate of unemployment is below both state and national rates as shown in Table 3-8. In June, the City was named the third strongest metropolitan economy based on an evaluation of changes in employment, wa ges, output and housing by the Brookings Institute.20 Table 3\u00ad8. Unemployment Rate - Summer 200921 Austin MSA Texas United States 7.3% 7.9% 9.4% Despite a temporary downturn in the econ omy, the future outlook for Austin's economy is positive. Employment oppo rtunities grew 14.8 percent from 2004 to 2008, and in June of 2009, Austin was name d the best city for recession recovery22. Austin's resiliency throughout the recession stems from the fact that it is home to the University of Texas, the state govern ment, and has a diverse labor base with a large percentage of high tech industries. In addition the city was mostly protected from the real estate collapse and is expected to see future growth in business sectors dealing with health care and education.23 Another factor that has helped the local ec onomy is Austin's leadership in wireless technology. The City was named one of the hottest wireless cities by Newsweek magazine in 2004. Drawing on the same expertise in high technology and innovation, the City is venturing into the biomedical and pharmaceuticals industry. The University of Texas at Austin is a pr imary asset in this arena. It has world- 20 Austin Business Journal 21 Austin Chamber of Commerce 22 Source: \" The Best and Worst Cities for Recession Recovery\" , Forbes.com, June 2009. 23 Ibid.

Austin also has a history of success in st riving to attract regional offices and national headquarters. Dell Inc. is not only based in the Austin area, it is one of the area's largest employers (See Table 3-9). A diverse array of companies also elected to make Austin their headquarters from National Instruments Corp. to Whole Foods Market, Inc. Figure 3-3 below illustrates the growth rate for jobs in Austin from 1991 to 2008 (projection). Figure 3\u00ad3. Austin Job Growth: 1991\u00ad200824 24 City of Austin Demographer Employment Loss Projected '08 Section 3 - Community Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 15 Austin strives to serve citizens by influencing and increasing economic development. To this end the City has established an Economic Growth and Redevelopment Services Office (EGRSO). EGRSO is directed by the City Council and is responsible for implementing economic development policy to increase economic viability. In 2005, the City developed an economic policy to outline measures adopted by the City Council and evaluate projects based on fiscal impact and the impact on City services. In 2007 the City evaluated it s economic context and forecast, which showed that indicators of job growth, ta x revenue and building activity were all positive. The City also offers incentive programs such as tax abatements, enterprise zone exemptions, public utility incentives and financing programs for new and existing companies.

The purpose of this section is to provide background information for the hazard identification process as well as descriptions for the natural and technological hazards identified. Hazards Consid ered Upon a review of the full range of natural hazards suggested under FEMA planning guidance, the City has identified fourteen hazards that are to be addressed in the Plan Update. These hazards were identified through an extensive process utiliz ing input from planning team members, research of past disaster declarations, review of the 2004 Plan and a review of the current State of Texas Hazard Mitigation Plan (\"State Plan\") . Readily available online information from reputable sources such as federal and state agencies was also evalu ated to supplement information as needed . Disaster Declarations In order to identify risks to the area, an examination of historic trends was conducted for relevant background information. This include d reviewing disaster declarations for the area. The S tate of Texas claims the highest number of disaster declarations, at 83, for any state or territory from 1953 to 2008. From 2000 to 2008, the state experienced fifteen declared disasters , including Hurricanes Dolly and Ike . In 2008 alone the Sect ion 4 - Hazard Identification City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 2 state suffer ed 36 fat alities, 103 injuries and over 15 million dollars worth of property damage. The City of Austin, located in Travis County, has had a significantly lower amount of declarations than th e state as a whole. Table 4- 1 lists disaster declarations from 1991 to 2009 for Travis County.1 Table 4 -1. Disaster Declarations for Travis County, Texas (1991- 2009)2 Year Event Declaration Number 2007 Severe Storms/Floods DR 1709 2006 Extreme Wildfire Threat DR 1624 2005 Hurricane Rita3DR 1606 2002 Severe Sto rms/Floods DR 1425 1998 Fall Floods DR 1257 1996 Central Texas Floods DR 1179 1991 Christmas Flood DR 0930 State and Local Plan Review In addition to the Presidential Disaster Declarations depicted in Table 4 -1, the City of Austin has experienced many small -scale hazards . Because these smaller scale disasters threaten public safety and can cost the city government, business es and residents millions of dollars in direct and indirect damages, an extensive range of hazards were considered in the identifi cation process. This included an evaluation of the 2004 Plan, the State Plan, and federal and state resources. Table 4- 2 on the following page lists the full range of natural and technological hazards initial ly identified for consideration. The table documents the evaluation process used for determining the significance of each hazard . Only hazards identified as significant were included in the Plan Update. Hazards not identified for inclusion at this time may be addressed during future evaluations an d updates. 1 Disaster Declarations are recorded by county rather than by pl ace. 2 Data is unavailable for declarations by county prior to 1991. 3 Travis County was not directly affected by Rita, but all counties in Texas were declared for Public Assistance for debris removal and emergency protective measures. Sect ion 4 - Hazard Identification City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 3 Table 4 -2. Hazard Identification Process Hazard Considered Identified as Significant Reason for Determination Dam Failure YES Included in the State Plan and 2004 Plan. Although the risk is low, the hazard should be included as the C ity is exposed to four dams. Drought YES Included in the State Plan and 2004 Plan. Drought can occur throughout the state and Austin experienced a period of extreme drought in 2009. Earthquake NO According to the State Plan, an earthquake occurrence for the South Central Region, where Austin is located, is considered rare. Although a small event is possible, it would pose little to no risk for the area. Expansive Soils NO While expansive soils are listed as a threat in the State Plan for coastal counties, t he impact of this hazard is limited and the frequency is occasional. Extreme Heat YES Included in the State Plan and 2004 Plan; high f requency of occurrence . Flood YES Included in the State Plan and 2004 Plan; high frequency of occurrence. Hail YES Included in the State Plan and 2004 Plan; high frequency of occurrence. Hurricane Wind YES The City has a potential risk for hurricane winds . Land Subsidence NO There is no historical occurrence of land subsidence for the City. The impact would be limited a nd the frequency of occurrence is unlikely according to the State Plan. Thunderstorm YES Included in the 2004 Plan; high frequency of occurrence. Tornado YES Included in the State Plan and 2004 Plan; high frequency of occurrence. Winter Storm YES Review of the State Plan, the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and the 2004 Plan indicate that winter storms are a significant threat. Wildfire YES Included in the State Plan and 2004 Plan; high probability of occurrence. Windstorm NO The NCDC does no t list a historical hazard windstorm event for the region separate from hurricane winds or winds associated with severe thunderstorms. Infectious Disease YES Communicable diseases can occur at any geographic location. In addition, Austin has been affec ted by the 2009 Sect ion 4 - Hazard Identification City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 4 Hazard Considered Identified as Significant Reason for Determination outbreak of H1N1 (\"Swine Flu\"). Hazardous Materials Release YES Hazardous Material Releases were included in the 2004 Plan, and also in this Update as toxic releases can have a substantial impact. Such events can cause multiple deaths, completely shut down facilities for 30 days or more, and cause more than 50 percent of affected properties to be destroyed or suffer major damage. Pipeline Failure YES Fuel pipelines are located throughout the C ity, and frequent incidents of pipeline failur e occur according to the Texas Railroad Commission. Terrorism YES Although there has been no past occurrence in the City , the potential impact of a Terrorism event could be great. Hazard Descriptions The fourteen hazards identified as significant accor ding to Table 4 -2 are divided into two main categories: natural and technological. Natural hazards include hazards categorized as atmospheric, hydrologic , and other. Atmospheric hazards are events or incidents associated with weather generated phenomeno n. Atmospheric hazards identified as significant from Table 4 -2, include: extreme heat; hail; hurricane wind events ; thunderstorms; tornado es; and winter storms . Hydrologic hazards are events or incidents associ ated with water related damage and account for over 75 percent of Federal disaster declarations in the United States . Hydrologic hazards i dentified as significant include drought and inland flooding . For the purposes of th e risk assessment, \"other\" natural hazards consist of wildfire and infecti ous disease. The term \"technological hazards\" refers to the origins of incidents that can arise from human activities such as the construction and maintenance of dams; the use of gas and oil pipelines; the manufacture, transportation, storage, and use of hazardous materials ; and an act of terrorism . These hazards are distinct from natural hazards primarily in that they originate from human activity. While the risks presented by natural hazards may be increased or decreased as a result of human activity, they are not inherently human -induced. Sect ion 4 - Hazard Identification City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 5 Table 4- 3 provides descriptions for each of the natural and technological hazards included in the Plan Update. Table 4 -3. Hazard Descriptions Hazard Description ATMOSPHERIC Extreme Heat Extreme heat is th e condition whereby temperatures hover ten degrees or more above the average high temperature in a region for an extended period. Hailstorm Any storm that produces hailstones that fall to the ground; usually used when the amount or size of the hail is c onsidered significant. Hurricane Wind Hurricanes and tropical storms are classified as cyclones and defined as any closed circulation developing around a low -pressure center in which winds rotate counter -clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (or clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) with a diameter averaging 10 to 30 miles across. When maximum sustained winds reach or exceed 39 miles per hour, the system is designated a tropical storm, given a name, and is closely monitored by the National Hurricane Center . When sustained winds reach or exceed 74 miles per hour the storm is deemed a hurricane. The primary damaging forces associated with these storms are high -level sustained winds, heavy precipitation and tornadoes. Coastal areas are also vulnerable to the additional forces of storm surge, wind -driven waves and tidal flooding which can be more destructive than cyclone wind. Due to the distance from the coast, only hurricane wind will be considered for the City of Austin. Thunderstorm A thunderstorm occurs wh en an observer hears thunder. Radar observers use the intensity of the radar echo to distinguish between rain showers and thunderstorms. Lightning detection networks routinely track cloud -to-ground flashes, and therefore thunderstorms. Tornado A tornad o is a violently rotating column of air that has contact with the ground and is often visible as a funnel cloud. Its vortex rotates cyclonically with wind speeds ranging from as low as 40 mph to as high as 300 mph. The destruction caused by tornadoes range s from light to catastrophic depending on the intensity, size and duration of the storm. Winter Storm Severe winter storms may include snow, sleet, freezing rain, or a mix of these wintry forms of precipitation. Blizzards, the most dangerous of all winte r storms, combine low temperatures, heavy snowfall, and winds of at least 35 miles per hour, reducing visibility to only a few yards. Ice storms occur when moisture falls and freezes immediately upon impact on trees, power lines , communication towers, Sect ion 4 - Hazard Identification City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 6 Hazard Description structures, roads and other hard surfaces. Winter storms and ice storms can down trees, cause widespread power outages, damage property, and cause fatalities and injuries to human life. HYDROLOGIC Drought A prolonged period of less than normal precipitation such that the lack of water causes a serious hydrologic imbalance. Common effects of drought include crop failure, water supply shortages, and fish and wildlife mortality. Flood The accumulation of water within a water body, which results in the overflow of excess water onto adjacent lands, usually floodplains. The floodplain is the land adjoining the channel of a river, stream , ocean, lake or other watercourse or water body that is susceptible to flooding. Most floods fall into the following three categor ies: riverine flooding, coastal flooding, or shallow flooding . OTHER Infectious Disease Illness due to a specific infectious agent or its toxic products that arises through transmission of that agent or its products from an infected person, animal, or r eservoir to a susceptible host, either directly or indirectly through an intermediate plan or animal host, vector, or the inanimate environment. Wildfire An uncontrolled fire burning in an area of vegetative fuels such as grasslands, brush, or woodlands. Heavier fuels with high continuity, steep slopes, high temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall, and high winds all work to increase the risk for people and property located within wildfire hazard areas or along the urban/wildland interface. Wildfires are part of the natural management of forest ecosystems, but most are caused by human factors. TECHNOLOGICAL Dam Failure Dam failure is the collapse, breach, or other failure of a dam structure resulting in downstream flooding. In the event of a dam failure , the energy of the water stored behind even a small dam is capable of causing loss of life and severe property damage if development exists downstream of the dam. Hazardous Materials Release Hazardous materials come in the form of explosives, flammable and combustible substances, poisons, and radioactive materials. A hazardous material (HAZMAT) incident involves a substance outside normal safe containment in sufficient concentration to pose a threat to life, property, or the environment. Pipeline Failure An estimated 2.2 million miles of pipelines in the United States carry hazardous materials such as oil and natural gas. Pipelines are out of sight and unnoticed, yet have caused fires and explosions that have killed more than 200 people and injured more than 1,000 people nationwide in the last decade. Sect ion 4 - Hazard Identification City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 7 Hazard Description Terrorism Terrorism is the use of force or violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often us e threats to create fear among the public, to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism and to get immediate publicity for their causes.

Each hazard is discussed in terms of location, extent, historical occurrences and probability of future events , including any specific or detailed items noted by the planning team as it relates to historical hazard information. A full vulnerability assessment for each is included in Section 6. The detailed profiles in this section ar e discussed according to category, and included in the following order: Atmospheric o Extreme Heat o Hail o Hurricane Wind o Thunderstorm o Tornado Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 2 o Winter Storm Hydrologic o Drought o Flood Other Natural Hazards o Infectious Disease o Wildfire Technological / Man-Caused o Dam Failure o Hazardous Materials Release o Pipeline Failure o Terrorism Extreme Heat Austin has a humid subtropical climate, characterized by humid summers, where temperatures average around 90 degrees Fa hrenheit. The combination of high temperatures mixed with humidity leads to heat waves or periods of extreme heat. Although heat can damage buildings and facilities, it presents a more significant threat to the safety and welfare of citizens and animals. The major human risks associated with severe summer heat include: heat cramps; sunburn; dehydration; fatigue; heat exhaustion; and even heat stroke. The most vulnerable population to heat casualties are children and the elderly or infirm, who frequently live on low fixe d incomes and cannot afford to run air- conditioning on a regular basis. This po pulation is sometimes isolated, with no immediate family or friends to care for their well being. Location Though injuries or deaths from extreme heat have been recorded at different locations throughout the city, there is no specific geographic scope to the extreme heat hazard. Extreme heat could occur at any area of the city. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 3 Extent The magnitude or intensity of an extrem e heat event is measured according to temperature in relation to the percentage of humidity. According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), th is relationship is referred to as the \"Heat Index,\" and is depicted in Figure 5- 1. This index measures how hot it feels outside when humidity is combined with high temperatures. Figure 5\u00ad1. Extent Scale for Extreme Summer Heat The extent scale in Figure 5-1 displays varying degrees of caution depending on the relative humidity combined with the temperature. For example, when the temperature is at 90 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, caution should be exercised if the humidity level is at or above 40 percent. The shaded zones on the chart indicate varying symptoms or disorders that could occur depending on the magnitude or intensity of the event. \"Caution\" is the first level of intensity where fatigue due to heat exposure is possible. \"Extreme Caution\" indicates that sunstroke, muscle cramps or heat exhaustion are possible, whereas a Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 4 \"Danger\" level means that these symptoms are likely. \"Extreme Danger\" indicates that heat stroke is likely. The National Weather Service (NWS) initia tes alerts based on the Heat Index as shown Table 5-1. Table 5\u00ad1. Extreme Summer Heat Warnings Warning Detailed Description Heat Advisory Heat Index is expected to exceed 105 \u00b0F to 110 \u00b0F. Excessive Heat Warning Heat Index above 105 \u00b0F for 3 hours or more during the day and at or above 80 \u00b0F at night. Due to its location, and its urban makeup, th e City of Austin can expect an extreme heat event each summer. Citizens, especially children and the elderly, should exercise caution by staying out of the heat for prolonged periods when a heat advisory or excessive heat warning is issued. Also at risk are those working or remaining outdoors for prolonged periods of time. Due to the abundance of concrete and metal infrastructure, the effects of an extreme heat event can be intensified. Concrete and metal absorb heat energy an d emit that energy at night, thereby trapping heat, and causing the temperature to feel as much as 10 degrees higher than surrounding areas. This is kn own as the \"heat island\" effect. Previous Occurrences From 1999-2004, there were 258 deaths reported among Texas residents with exposure to excessive natural heat as the underlying cause of death1. Of these 258, 17 deaths occurred in Travis Co unty as shown in Table 5-2. 1 Texas Department of State Health Services Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 5 Table 5\u00ad2. Deaths due to Extreme Heat COUNTY OF DEATH 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 TOTAL TEXAS 67 81 42 58 62 53 363 TRAVIS 3 5 0 3 5 1 17 Although the Texas Department of Stat e Health Services does not provide a breakdown of injuries or fatalities by plac e, Austin experienced record heat in the summers of 1980, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009, according to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Previous occurrences for extreme heat and all other natural hazards for this Plan Update are derived from the NCDC. The NC DC is a national data source organized under NOAA. The NCDC is the largest arch ive available for climate data; however, the only incidents recorded are those that are reported to the NCDC. In the tables that follow throughout this section, some occurrences seem to appear multiple times in one table. This is due to reports from various locations throughout the City. In addition, property damage estimates are no t always available. When this occurs, estimates are provided. Where an estimate has been provided in a table for losses, the dollar amounts have been altered to indicate the damage in 2009 dollars. According to heat related incidents located solely within the City of Austin from the NCDC reports, three fatalities were report ed in the summer of 1999 from incidents on July 29, August 14 and August 16. Victims from two of these fatalities were over the age of 75. Another three fatalities were reported in the City the following summer, which also marked a record high temperature of 112 degrees with another two deaths occurring in the county. On July 5, 2000 a 26-year old man died from heat stroke after working outdoors for a pr olonged period. A two-year old boy, who was left unattended in a sun room, and a 72-year old woman, were also victims to extreme heat in July, 2000. Although no fatalities or injuries were reported for 2001 for the City or Travis County, the City experienced a record heat wave of 21 consecutive days of temperatures at or above 100 degrees. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 6 The summer of 2009 marked another period of extreme heat for the City. Warnings were issued at the end of June of 2009 du e to almost two weeks of continuous 100 degree or higher temperatures. One fatalit y was reported to the NCDC on July 15, 2009. Probability of Future Events The likelihood or future probability of excessi ve summer heat in the City of Austin is high, meaning there is more than a 50 percent chance of an event in any given year. Hail Hailstorms are a potentially damaging outgrowth of severe thunderstorms. Early in the developmental stages of a hailstorm, ice crystals form within a low-pressure front due to the rapid rising of warm air into the upper atmosphere and the subsequent cooling of the air mass. Frozen droplets gradually accumulate on the ice crystals until having developed sufficient we ight they fall as precipitation\u2014as balls or irregularly shaped masses of ice greater than 0.75 inches in diameter. The size of hailstones is a direct function of the size and severity of the storm. High velocity updraft winds are required to keep hail in suspension in thunderclouds. The strength of the updraft is a result of the in tensity of heating at the Earth's surface. Higher temperature gradients relative to elevation above the surface result in increased suspension time and hailstone size. Location Hailstorms can vary greatly in terms of si ze, location, intensity and duration but are considered frequent occurrences througho ut the City of Austin. It is assumed that the entire City is unifo rmly exposed to hailstorms. Extent The National Weather Service classifies a stor m as severe if hail of \u00be of an inch in diameter or greater is imminent based on ra dar intensity or seen by observers. The intensity of a hailstorm depends on the damage potential related to size as depicted in the NCDC Intensity Scale at Table 5-3. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 7 Table 5\u00ad3.

Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 8 The City experienced two of the worst hailstorms in its history in May of 2008 and March of 2009. Reports indicate that th e magnitude of the March 25, 2009 event was close to an H8 or H9 in terms of size and may have caused up to $160 million dollars in damages. The May 2008 event caused approximately $50 million dollars in damages with a magnitude of H9. Althou gh both storms were rare, they indicate the potential destructiveness and danger of an intense hailstorm. Previous Occurrences Historical evidence shows that most of the City is vulnerable to hail events, which typically result from severe thunderstorm activity. Figure 5-2 presents a map of historical hail events by size that impacted the City of Austin and the surrounding area between 1993 and 2008, and Table 5-4 shows details for hail events specifically associated with the City of Austin3.

An event of similar magnitude occurred on March 25, 2009. With little to no warning time, areas of the city were inundated with golf ball sized hail, damaging more than 22,000 vehicles, 15,000 homes and causing an estimated $160 million in damages. Figure 5\u00ad2. Historical Locations (1993\u00ad2008) - NCDC Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 13 Probability of Future Events Because severe thunderstorm events will remain a frequent occurrence in the City of Austin, the probability of future occurre nces of hail is also highly probable, meaning that an event is expected to occur yearly. It can be expected that future hail events will continue, at the very least, to cause minor damages to property and vehicles throughout the city. Most hails torms occur during the spring months of March, April, and May and in the fall during the month of September. Hurricane Wind As an incipient hurricane develops, the ba rometric pressure (measured in millibars or inches) at its center falls and winds increase. If the atmospheric and oceanic conditions are favorable, it can intensify into a tropical depression. When maximum sustained winds reach or exceed 39 miles per hour, the system is designated a tropical storm, given a name, and is closely monitored by the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. Wh en sustained winds reach or exceed 74 miles per hour the storm is deemed a hu rricane. Hurricane intensity is further classified by the Saffir-Simpson Scale (Table 5-4), which rates hurricane intensity on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most intense. Location Hurricanes and tropical storms threaten th e entire Atlantic and Gulf seaboard of the United States, and while coastal areas are most directly exposed to the brunt of landfalling storms, their impact is often fe lt hundreds of miles inland. Although Austin is far from the coast, it is still su sceptible to the accompa nying hazard effects of extreme wind, flooding and tornadoes. Since there are no exact geographic boundaries for hurricane wind, an even t could occur throughout the City. Extent Table 5-5 describes the intensity of a hurricane in terms of wind speed, surface pressure and storm surge. Since the City would not experience a storm surge due to its distance from the coast, magnitude will be measured in terms of wind speeds. Table 5\u00ad5. Saffir\u00adSimpson Scale Category Maximum Sustained Wind Speed (MPH) Minimum Surface Pressure (Millibars) Storm Surge (Feet) 1 74-95 Greater than 980 3-5 2 96-110 979-965 6-8 Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 14 Category Maximum Sustained Wind Speed (MPH) Minimum Surface Pressure (Millibars) Storm Surge (Feet) 3 111-130 964-945 9-12 4 131-155 13-18 5 155 + than 920 19+ Source: National Hurricane Center The Saffir-Simpson Scale categorizes hurricane intensity linearly based upon maximum sustained winds, barometric pre ssure and storm surge potential, which are combined to estimate potential damage. Categories 3, 4, and 5 are classified as \"major\" hurricanes, and though hurricane s within this range comprise only 20 percent of total tropical cyclone landfalls , they account for over 70 percent of the damage in the United States. Previous Occurrences The City has not been directly impact ed by a hurricane, but narrowly dodged intense winds from Hurricane Ike in September of 2008. Probability of Future Events Table 5-6 profiles the potential wind speeds in miles per hour (MPH) that could be expected in the City of Austin during a hurricane event for various return periods (ranging from a 10-year event to a 1,000-year event). Table 5\u00ad6. Average Hurricane Wind Speeds in the City of Austin by Return Period WIND SPEED [MPH] PER RETURN storms are generally considered a common occurrence in the City of Austin. Typical thunderstorms are 15 miles in diamet er and lasts an average of 30 minutes. Despite the short time span, thunderstorms can be extremely dangerous as they are often strong and fast in their approach and can be accompanied by flash flooding, lightning, hail, tornadoes, and high winds. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 15 Lightning damage can result in electrocution of humans and animals; vaporization of materials along the path of the strike; fire caused by the high temperature produced by the strike, and sudden power surges that can damage electrical and electronic equipment. Millions of dollars of direct and indirect damages result from lightning strikes on electric utility substations and distribution lines. While property damage is the major hazard associated with lightning, it should be noted that lightning strikes kill nearly 100 people each year in the United States13. Location Thunderstorms occur randomly, and therefore it is impossible to predict where they will strike within the City. Thus, it is as sumed that the City of Austin is uniformly exposed to the threat of thunderstorms. Extent A severe thunderstorm event is typically defined by NCDC based on wind magnitude. It is also important to note th at high wind events associated with other hazards such as tornadoes, hurricanes, an d winter storms are included in those respective sections. Table 5-7 depicts inte nsity for thunderstorms according to wind magnitude published by the World Me teorological Organization (WMO). Table 5\u00ad7.

If another Beaufort event of 10 or higher were to occur, the City would be susceptible to structural damage to structural facilities, especially roofs and windows. Injuries may also occur as a result of debris that is carried by strong gusts or twigs and branches that are broken off from the fo rce of the wind. Traffic disruptions may also occur as traffic lights could be damaged or flying debris could cause accidents on the road. This would hinder the ability of critical services staff to travel to and from work. The spatial extent of the damages could affect 25% to 50% of the population of Austin.

Given this regular frequency of occurrence, it can be 17 Location: Central Austin 18 Location: One mile East, Southeast of Camp Mabry 19 Location: One mile Northeast of Camp Mabry Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 19 expected that future thunderstorms will co ntinue to threaten life and cause minor20 property damages throughout the City of Austin. Tornado A tornado is a violent windstorm characte rized by a twisting, funnel-shaped cloud extending to the ground. Tornadoes ar e most often generated by thunderstorm activity (but sometimes result from hurrica nes and other tropical storms) when cool, dry air intersects and overrides a layer of warm, moist air forcing the warm air to rise rapidly. The damage caused by a tornado is a result of the high wind velocity and wind-blown debris, accompanied by lightning or large hail. According to the National Weather Service, tornado wind speeds normally range from 40 to more than 300 miles per hour. The most violent tornadoes have rotating winds of 250 miles per hour or more and are capable of causing extreme destruction and turning normally harmless objects into deadly missiles. On average, over 800 tornadoes are reported nationwide each year, resulting in an average of 80 deaths and 1,500 injuries (NOAA, 2007). They are more likely to occur during the months of March through May and can occur at any time of day, but are most likely to form in the late afternoon and early evening. Most tornadoes are a few doze n yards wide and touch down briefly, but even small short-lived tornadoes can inflict tremendous damage. Highly destructive tornadoes may carve out a path over a mile wide and several miles long. Location Tornadoes occur randomly, and therefore it is impossible to predict where they will strike within the City. Therefore, it is a ssumed that the City of Austin is uniformly exposed to this hazard. Extent The destruction caused by tornadoes ranges from light to inconceivable depending on the intensity, size and duration of the storm. Typically, tornadoes cause the greatest damage to structures of light construction such as residential homes, 20 Minor damages mean the potential to destroy or substantially damage more than ten percent of property or shutdown facilities for one week. For more detail, please see Table 6-4 in Section 6. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 20 particularly mobile homes. It should be noted that tornado magnitudes prior to 2005 were determined using the traditional ve rsion of the Fujita Scale (Table 5-9). Tornado magnitudes that were determined in 2005 and later were determined using the Enhanced Fujita Scale (Table 5-10). The Enhanced Fujita Scale for Tornadoes was developed to measure tornado strength and associated damages (Table 5-10). Table 5\u00ad9. The Fujita Scale (Effective Prior to 2005) FSCALE NUMBER INTENSITY WIND SPEED TYPE OF DAMAGE DONE F0 GALE TORNADO 40-72 MPH Some damage to chimneys; breaks branches off trees; pushes over shallowrooted trees; damages to sign boards.

F2 SIGNIFICANT TORNADO 113-157 MPH Considerable damage. Roofs torn off frame houses; mobile homes demolished; boxcars pushed over; large trees snapped or uprooted; light object missiles generated.

F4 DEVASTATING TORNADO 207-260 MPH Wellconstructed houses leveled; structures with weak foundations blown off some distance; cars thrown and large missiles generated. F5 INCREDIBLE TORNADO 261-318 MPH Strong frame houses lifted off foundations and carried considerable distances to disintegrate; automobile sized missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 meters; trees debarked; steel reenforced concrete structures badly damaged. F6 INCONCEIVABLE TORNADO 319-379 MPH These winds are very unlikely. The small area of damage they might produce would probably not be recognizable along with the mess produced by F4 and F5 wind that would surround the F6 winds. Missiles, such as cars and refrigerators would do serious secondary damage that could not be directly identified as F6 damage. If this level is ever achieved, evidence for it might only be found in some manner of ground swirl pattern, for it may never be identifiable through engineering studies.

It is likely that a high num ber of occurrences have gone unreported over the past 58 years. Figure 5-3 presents a map of historical to rnado point locations that hit the City of Austin study area from 1950 to 2008.

However, when all fields of the NCDC records are compared, there are differences (such as unique spatial coordinates or hand-written accounts) that establish these as individual events. Similarities in dollar losses and magnitudes can likely be attributed to estimations. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 23 Table 5\u00ad11.

Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 24 Probability of Future Events The likelihood or future probability of occurre nce of a tornado in the City of Austin is low, with a 25 percent possibility of an event occurring in any given year. Winter Storm Winter storms that threaten the City of Au stin usually begin as powerful cold fronts that push south from central Canada. Alth ough the City is at risk to ice hazards and extremely cold temperatures, as well as snow, the effects and frequency of winter storm events are generally mild and short-lived. As indicated in Figure 5-4, on average, the area experiences less than 10 extreme cold days a year, meaning less than 10 days at or around freezing temperatures. During these times of ice and snow accumulation response times will in crease until public works road crews are able to assist in making the major roads passable. Figure 5\u00ad4. Extreme Cold Days 1960\u00ad2003 (NWS) City of Austin Travis Count y Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 25 Location Because winter storm events are not confined to specific geographic boundaries, all existing and future buildings, facilities and populations are considered to be exposed to this hazard and could potentially be impacted. Extent Table 5-12 below displays the magnitude of severe winter storms. The wind-chill factor is further described in Figure 5-5 on the following page. This is an index developed by the National Weather Service, although the chart is not applicable when temperatures are over 50\u00b0 or winds are calm. Wind chill temperature is a measure of how cold the wind makes real air temperature feel to the human body, similar to the heat index for extreme heat (Figure 5-1). Since wind can dramatically accelerate heat loss from the body, a blustery 30\u00b0 day would feel just as cold as a calm day with 0\u00b0 temperatures. Table 5\u00ad12. Extent Scale for Severe Winter Storm Winter weather advisory This alert may be issued for a variety of severe conditions. Weather advisories may be announced for snow, blowing or drifting snow, freezing drizzle, freezing rain, or a combination of weather events. Winter storm watch Severe winter weather conditions may affect your area (freezing rain, sleet or heavy snow may occur separately or in combination). Winter storm warning Severe winter weather conditions are imminent. Freezing rain or freezing drizzle Rain or drizzle is likely to freeze upon impact, resulting in a coating of ice glaze on roads and all other exposed objects. Sleet Small particles of ice, usually mixed with rain. If enough sleet accumulates on the ground, it makes travel hazardous. Blizzard warning Sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph are accompanied by considerable falling or blowing snow. This alert is the most perilous winter storm with visibility dangerously restricted. Frost/freeze warning Below freezing temperatures are expected and may cause significant damage to plants, crops and fruit trees. Wind chill A strong wind combined with a temperature slightly below freezing can have the same chilling effect as a temperature nearly 50 degrees lower in a calm atmosphere. The combined cooling power of the wind and temperature on exposed flesh is called the windchill factor. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 26 The City of Austin has never experienced a blizzard, but based on previous occurrences, has been subject to winter storm watches, warnings, freezing rain, sleet, snow and wind chill. In January of 2007 and 2009 (see Table 5-12), the city experienced icing on the roadways due to freezing rain. Schools were closed for periods of two to three days to prevent tra ffic collisions. Road closures were also instigated to mitigate property damage an d injury, resulting in a minor disruption to city operations. Figure 5\u00ad5.

If a wi nter storm does occur, the spatial extent would be limited. Drought Drought is a normal part of virtually all climatic regions, including areas with high and low average rainfall, and is considered a major threat to Texas agricultural industries and water supplies. Drought is the consequence of a natural reduction in the amount of precipitation expected over an extended period of time, usually a season or more in length. Droughts can be classifi ed as meteorological, hydrologic, agricultural, and socioeconomic. Table 5-15 presents definitions for these different types of drought. Table 5\u00ad15. Drought Classification Definitions METEOROLOGICAL DROUGHT The degree of dryness or departure of actual precipitation from an expected average or normal amount based on monthly, seasonal, or annual time scales. HYDROLOGIC DROUGHT The effects of precipitation shortfalls on stream flows and reservoir, lake, and groundwater levels. AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT Soil moisture deficiencies relative to water demands of plant life, usually crops. SOCIOECONOMIC DROUGHT The effect of demands for water exceeding the supply as a result of a weather related supply shortfall. Location Drought can occur throughout the City and is not confined to any specific location. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 29 Extent Droughts are slow-onset hazards, but over time can have very damaging affects to crops, municipal water supplies, recreational activities, and wildlife. If droughts extend over a number of years, the direct and indirect economic impact can be significant. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), developed by W. C. Palmer in 1965, measures the extent or magnitude of drought for the area as depicted in Table 5-16. The classifications for soil conditions are based on a soil moisture algorithm that takes into account tempe rature, precipitation and the available water content of the soil. Table 5\u00ad16. Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) Drought Index Drought Condition Classifications Extreme Severe Moderate Normal Moderately Moist Very Moist Extremely Moist Z index 2.75 and below 2.00 to 2.74 1.25 to 1.99 1.24 to +2.49 +2.50 +3.00 +4.00 and above Source: U.S. Drought Monitor Even when a drought is not localized for the City of Austin, the City can be affected if the state is experiencing drought. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in a summit for drought conditions, the Central Texas region is considered the hardest- hit region for Texas and the nation as a whole. Drought conditions now affect 97.4 percent of Texas. From May of 2008 to October of 2009, the City experienced periods of moderate, severe and extreme drought, both agricultural and hydrological, according to the PDSI classifications and U.S. Drought Monitor. In response to a drought of this magnitude, the City had to enforce stricter watering restrictions for residential and commercial buildings. The surrounding lakes were at their Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 30 lowest levels in over 20 years, resultin g in reduced recreational use. The real danger with drought of this magnitude is the amount of crop failure and the potential for wildfire outbreaks.

Because specific reporting was unavailable for individual communities throughout Texas, an estimate for damages was used. In addition to the events reported to the NCDC in Table 5-17, the City of Austin and the state as a whole experienced record drought in the summer of 2009. High temperatures, combined with rainfall 20 inches below normal levels resulted in a hydrologic and agricultural drought that did not begin to wane until October of 2009. Although estimates are not available at this time for damage to the City al one, Texas farmers and ranchers suffered approximately $3.6 billion in economic damage. Probability of Future Events The likelihood or future probability of a drought occurrence in the City of Austin is \"Likely\", with an event probable in the next two to three years. The spatial extent of drought is \"Large,\" expected to affect more than fifty percent of property in the city. Flood Flooding is generally considered to be the most serious natural hazard for the Austin area and constitutes a year-round threat. Flooding due to rainfall alone depends on basin topography, precipitation amounts, dominating weather patterns, soil moisture conditions, and the amount of permeable surface available to absorb the rain. Floods resulting from excessive precipitation can be classified under two categories: general floods, precipitation over a given river basin for an extended period of time combined with storm-induced wave or tidal action; or flash floods, the product of heavy localized precipitation in a short time period. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 32 The primary types of general flooding include riverine, coastal and urban flooding24. Riverine flooding is a function of excessive precipitation levels and water runoff volumes within the watershed of a stream or river. Some river floods occur seasonally when winter or spring rainfalls fill river basins with too much water, too quickly. Torrential rains from decaying hurricanes or tropical systems can also produce river flooding. Urban flooding occurs where manmade development has obstructed the natural flow of water and decreased the ability of natural groundcover to absorb and retain surface water runoff. Urban flooding occurs as land is converted from fields or woodlands to roads, buildings and parking lots and when the natural land loses its ability to absorb rainfall. Urbanization ch anges the natural hydrologic systems of a basin, increasing runoff two to six times over what would occur on natural terrain. During periods of urban flooding, streets can become swift-moving rivers, while highway underpasses and underground park ing garages can become death traps as they fill with water. Most flash flooding is caused by slow-mov ing thunderstorms in a local area or by heavy rains associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. However, flash flooding events may also occur from a dam or levee failure within minutes or hours of heavy amounts of rainfall, or from a su dden release of water held by a retention basin or other stormwater control facility. Although flash flooding occurs most often along mountain streams, it is also comm on in urbanized areas where much of the ground is covered by impervious surfaces. Location For mapping purposes, Digital Q3 Flood Data is also shown for neighboring counties of Hays and Bastrop as well as the Austin area as a whole in Figure 5-7. The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Mate (DF IRM) data provided by FEMA for Travis County shows the following flood hazard areas: Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event generally determined using a pproximate methodologies. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) or flood depths ar e shown. Mandatory flood insurance requirements and floodplain management standards apply. 24 Coastal flooding will not be discussed herein as only riverine and urban flooding affect the Austin area. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 33 Zone AO: Areas subject to inundati on by 1-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on slop ing terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Averag e flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply. Zone X Protected by Levee: Areas protected from the 1-percent-annual- chance flood hazard by a levee system. These areas are now indicated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and DFIRM panels as Zone X (shaded) and are typically considered to be at moderate risk of flooding. 0.2% Annual Chance Flood Hazard: This is the boundary of the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Figure 5\u00ad7. Inland Flooding Potential Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 34 Table 5-18 provides a description of flood zones as indicated below. Table 5\u00ad18. Flood Zones Flood Zones Zone A The 100year or Base Floodplain. There are six types of A zones: A The base floodplain mapped by approximate methods, i.e., BFEs are not determined. This is often called an unnumbered A zone or an approximate A zone. A1 30 These are known as numbered A zones (e.g., A7 or A14). This is the base floodplain where the firm shows a BFE (old format). AE The base floodplain where base flood elevations are provided. AE zones are now used on new format FIRMs instead of A130 zones. AO The base floodplain with sheet flow, ponding, or shallow flooding. Base flood depths (feet above ground) are provided. AH Shallow flooding base floodplain. BFE's are provided. A99 Area to be protected from base flood by levees or Federal flood protection systems under construction. BFEs are not determined. AR The base floodplain that results from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100year or greater level of flood protection Zone V and VE V The coastal area subject to velocity hazard (wave action) where BFEs are not determined on the FIRM. VE The coastal area subject to velocity hazard (wave action) where BFEs are provided on the FIRM. Zone B and Zone X (shaded) Area of moderate flood hazard, usually the area between the limits of the 100year and the 500year floods. B zones are also used to designate base floodplains or lesser hazards, such as areas protected by levees from the 100year flood, or shallow flooding areas with average depths of less than one foot or drainage areas less than 1 square mile. Zone C and Zone X (unshaded) Area of minimal flood hazard, usually depiction FIRMs as exceeding the 500year flood level. Zone C may have ponding and local drainage problems that do not warrant a detailed study or designation as base floodplain. Zone X is the area determined to be outside the 500year flood. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 35 Flood Zones Zone D Area of undetermined but possible flood hazards. Source: Understanding Your Risks, identifyin g hazards and estimating losses, FEMA 386-2 Extent The severity of a flooding event is typica lly determined by a co mbination of several factors including: stream and river basin topography and physiography; precipitation and weather patterns; recent soil moisture conditions; and degree of vegetative clearing and impervious surfac e. Generally floods are long-term events that may last for several days. A 100-year flood or one-percent-annual chance constitutes a threat to the City of Austin. Structures built in the Special Fl ood Hazard Area are subject to damage by rising waters and floating debris. Moving flood water exerts pressure on everything in its path and causes erosion of soil and solid objects. Utility systems, such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning, fuel , electrical systems, sewage maintenance systems and water systems, if not elevated above base flood elevation, may also be damaged. Many people do not understand the risk of living in a floodplain. There is a 26 percent chance that a non-elevated home in the floodplain will be damaged during a 30-year mortgage. The chance that a major fi re will occur during the same period is only one percent. Table 5-19 below details the extent of large- scale flood events for the City of Austin. Where available, damages and estimates of structures destroyed are included and detailed descriptions are found in the sectio n on previous occurrences that follows. Table 5\u00ad19.

Austin Watershed Study Area Previous Occurrences The following events describe major flood o ccurrences for the City. Where available, data is included showing the exte nt of each flood in Table 5-19. July 6, 1869 There were no dams in the City of Austin; therefore, the Colorado River was referred to as a stream. In July there was heavy rainfall throughout the City and Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 38 Damage from the 1935 Flood centered on the Colorado River. Several storms during July caused the river to rise over 51 feet and overflow at a fast rate. No damages were recorded for this event. April 7, 1900 This storm began in North Texas, filling th e Colorado River and sending torrents of r a i n t h r o u g h t h e C i t y o f A u s t i n a s w e l l a s B a s t r o p . T h e f l o o d i n g a n d r a i n b r o k e through the McDonald Dam, and this even t became known as \"The Day the Dam Broke.\" There were several fatalities for this major flood event, but no records or details of damages were recorded. April 23, 1915 Flash flooding occurred primarily in the Wa ller Creek Watershed, resulting in the deaths of 35 people. Many people drowned in their homes and properties were destroyed. Primary watersheds affect ed were Shoal and Waller Creek, which overflowed, sending homes, livestock and people into the Colorado River. Detailed data in terms of structure damage is unavailable for this event. September 8-10, 1921 This record storm is known as \"The Great Thrall/Taylor Storm\". It lasted for 18 consecutive hours. This storm began in th e Gulf Coast of Texas as a hurricane then moved north, centering on Thrall and Taylor. Across Central Texas counties, including Travis County, a tota l of 224 fatalities were recorded. Austin received 18 inches of rain in 24 hours, which resulted in six fatalities. Onion Creek watershed was hit the hardest with the rains washin g out three steel bridges. Walnut Creek watershed also received damage in the form of washed out roads. Property damages were not recorded for this event. June 15, 1935 In three hours, Austin received 22 inches of rain during this event. Between 2,500 and 3,000 residents in East Austin were left homeless after waters receded. South Congress Avenue between Barton Springs Road and the Texas School for the Deaf was demolished. Infrastructure and commercial properties al so suffered: bridges, sewer lines, water Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 39 lines and businesses were destroyed. April 24, 1957 This rain event ended drought conditio ns for the City, but quickly turned dangerous, dropping up to 10 inches of rain in a very short amount of time. April 24 became known as \"The Day of the Big Cloud. \" Rains poured on the City for a total of 32 days resulting in numerous floods. Ba rton Springs Pool was destroyed, and in the 1970s a flood diversion tunnel was built to mitigate future flood damages. No property damage or fatalities report. October 28, 1960 The October storm occurred in the evening, which resulted in more damage and injury because there was no warning. Torre ntial rains poured on the City, resulting in eleven fatalities. Property damage was valued at $2.3 million dollars and 200 people were left homeless. Several low-water crossing were washed out. November 23, 1974 Area thunderstorms dropped between four and ten inches of rain over Central Texas. There was widespread minor and major flooding throughout the City of Austin. Total fatalities were reported at 13 in the Austin area, but there are no records or data for property damage for this event. May 24, 1981 This flood event is known as \"The Memorial Day Flood.\" It was an intense storm, but short in duration, dumping over 10 inches of rain in four hours and resulting in $36 million in damages and 13 deaths. Waters heds affected include: Shoal Creek, Walnut Creek, Little Walnut, Waller, and Bee Creek. December 20, 1991 This storm caused record peak discharges along many creeks in Central Texas during a week of heavy rains. Flooding occurred in Lake Travis, Shoal Creek, Williamson, Bull Creek, and Walnut Cree k. Approximately 200 homes were destroyed. October 17, 1998 Large scale flooding occurred across the stat e and hit Austin on October 17, 1998. Property damage and losses statewide reached almost one billion dollars. As shown in Table 5-19, 237 structures were damage d, including six that were destroyed. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 40 November 15, 2001 On November 15, 2001 a slow-moving storm sy stem remained over west Austin and moved up Interstate 35, leaving rainfall tota ling five to eight inches. Isolated cells of the storm dropped more than 15 inches of rain in some areas within a six-hour period. Several creeks overflowed their banks. There was widespread flood damage as indicated in Table 5-19, and one fatality. July 2007 The flash flooding in July of 2007 resulted in Presidential Disaster Declaration DR- 1709 for neighboring Burnet County when 20 inch es of rain fell on the area in a 24- hour period. Although Austin was not affected to that great of an extent, the City still experienced residential and commercial property damage. An event of lesser magnitude caused far worse damage in 1935. In both April and May of 1935, about 9 inches of rain fell on the area. Due to th e lack of run-off channels the results were far-reaching. Floodwaters caused the Colora do River to crest at 50 feet in Austin, overwhelming the Congress Avenue Bridge, pr actically cutting the City in half. The flood hazard is one of the most frequent hazard events for the City of Austin. The following historical occurrences report ed from the NCDC are depicted in Table 5-20 below. Table 5\u00ad20.

Flooding occurs in seasonal patterns. Thunderst orms form when warm, moist air collides with cooler, drier air. Since these masses tend to come together during the transition from summer to winter, most thunderstorms and resulting flooding occur during the spring months of April, Ma y and June and fall months of October, November, and December. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 43 Wil dfire Texas has seen a huge increase in the numbe r of wildfires in the past 30 years. More and more people are placing their homes in woodland settings in or near forests, rural areas, or remote mountain sites. Many of these homes are nestled along ridgelines, cliff-edges, and other fi re-interface hazard zones. There, homeowners enjoy the beauty of the environment, but they also face the very real danger of wildfire. Years of fire suppres sion have significantly disturbed natural fire occurrences\u2014nature's renewal proces s. The result has been the gradual accumulation of understory and canopy fuels to levels of density that can feed high- energy, intense wildfires and further incr ease the hazards from and exposure to interface problems. Location Figure 5-9 graphically illustrates the pote ntial wildfire hazard areas listed above and provides an indication of where there is potential for damage to property and loss of life in the City of Austin. Know n historical wildfire occurrences, in and around the city, are also sh own in Figure 5-10. GIS data depicting the Federal Register de finition of the wildland-urban interface in Texas based on the integration of U. S. Census and USGS National Land Cover Data was used to identify the follo wing areas of possible concern: High Density Interface Medium Density Interface Low Density Interface Intermix Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 44 Figure 5\u00ad9. Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) Areas and Known Historical Events Greater Than 10 Acres (2008) Extent Fire risk is measured in terms of magn itude and intensity using the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), a mathematical system for relating current and recent weather conditions to potential or expected fire behavior. The KBDI determines forest fire potentia l and is based on a daily water balance, where a drought factor is balanced with precipitation and soil moisture (assumed to have a maximum storage capacity of 8-inch s) and is expressed in hundredths of an inch of soil moisture depletion. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 45 Figure 5\u00ad10. KBDI County Averages - November 2009 Each color on the map represents the drou ght index at that location. The drought index ranges from 0 to 800, where a drou ght index of 0 represents no moisture depletion, and an index of 800 repr esents absolutely dry conditions. These numbers correlate with pote ntial fire behavior as follows: 0 - 200 Soil and fuel moisture are high. Most fuels will not readily ignite or burn. However, with sufficient sunlig ht and wind, cured grasses and some light surface fuels will burn in spots and patches. 200 - 400 Fires more readily burn and will carry across an area with no gaps. Heavier fuels will still not readily igni te and burn. Expect smoldering and the resulting smoke to carry into and possibly through the night. 400 - 600 Fire intensity begins to signific antly increase. Fires will readily burn in all directions exposing mineral soils in some locations. Larger fuels may burn or smolder for several days creating possible smoke and control problems. 600 - 800 Fires will burn to mineral soil. Stumps will burn to the end of underground roots and spotting will be a major problem. Fires will burn City of Austin Travis Count y Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 46 thorough the night and heavier fuels will actively burn and contribute to fire intensity. From the extent scale in Figure 5-10, the City of Austin is located in an area with a KBDI of 0-200 for the fall of 2009. The soil and fuel moisture are high resulting in low risk for ignition. Although this is a relatively low level of risk, it does not indicate that there is an absence of risk. There is still the capacity for fuels to burn with sufficient sunlight. Fuels could burn, but not readily. The KBDI is a good measure of the readin ess of fuels for wildland fire. Caution should be exercised in dryer, hotter conditions, and the KBDI should be referenced as the area experiences changes in precipitation and soil moisture. Figure 5-11 o details regional risk levels and intensity. The City of Austin, located in the Central Region, is at Risk Level II where fire is a possibility, but large fires are rare. No long term severity or control problems would be expected. The different levels of risk ar e identified in Table 5-21. Figure 5\u00ad11. Regional Fire Risk Levels Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 47 Table 5\u00ad21. Regional Fire Risk Levels Fire Risk Level Description Level I Low fire danger: occasional fire possible with no control problems. No long term severity. Level II Moderate fire danger: occasional multiple fire days; normal control problems; large fires are rare. No long term severity. Level III HIgh fire danger; multiple fire days are common with initial attack fails; occasional night fires and large fires; region moving into long term severity Level IV Very high fire danger; multiple large fires; difficulty to control fires; long term severity Level V Extreme fire danger; extreme fire occurrence; long term severity Figure 5\u00ad12. Fire Danger Class Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 48 The City is currently at a Class 1 as indi cated by Figure 5-12. The Fire Danger Rating System is established by NOAA and characterizes fire danger by evaluating the approximate upper limit of fire behavior in a fire danger rating area during a 24-hour period. The calculation is based on fuels, topography and weather. All of the classes are described in Table 5-22. Table 5\u00ad22. Fire Danger Rating (NOAA) National Fire Danger Rating System Rating Basic Description Detailed Description CLASS 1: Low Danger (L) COLOR CODE: Green fires not easily started Fuels do not ignite readily from small firebrands. Fires in open or cured grassland may burn freely a few hours after rain, but wood fires spread slowly by creeping or smoldering and burn in irregular fingers. There is little danger of spotting. CLASS 2: Moderate Danger (M) COLOR CODE: Blue fires start easily and spread at a moderate rate Fires can start from most accidental causes. Fires in open cured grassland will burn briskly and spread rapidly on windy days. Wood fires spread slowly to moderately fast. The average fire is of moderate intensity, although heavy concentrations of fuel - especially draped fuel may burn hot. Shortdistance spotting may occur, but is not persistent. Fires are not likely to become serious and control is relatively easy. CLASS 3: High Danger (H) COLOR CODE: Yellow fires start easily and spread at a rapid rate All fine dead fuels ignite readily and fires start easily from most causes. Unattended brush and campfires are likely to escape. Fires spread rapidly and shortdistance spotting is common. High intensity burning may develop on slopes or in concentrations of fine fuel. Fires may become serious and their control difficult, unless they are hit hard and fast while small. CLASS 4: Very High Danger (VH) COLOR CODE: Orange fires start very easily and spread at a very fast rate Fires start easily from all causes and immediately after ignition, spread rapidly and increase quickly in intensity. Spot fires are a constant danger. Fires burning in light fuels may quickly develop highintensity characteristics such as longdistance spotting and fire whirlwinds, when they burn into heavier fuels. Direct attack at the head of such fires is rarely possible after they have been burning more than a few minutes. CLASS 5: Extreme (E) COLOR CODE: Red fire situation is explosive and can result in extensive property damage Fires under extreme conditions start quickly, spread furiously and burn intensely. All fires are potentially serious. Development into highintensity burning will usually be faster and occur from smaller fires than in the Very High Danger class (4). Direct attack is rarely possible and may be dangerous, except immediately after ignition. Fires that Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 49 National Fire Danger Rating System Rating Basic Description Detailed Description develop headway in heavy slash or in conifer stands may be unmanageable while the extreme burning condition lasts. Under these conditions, the only effective and safe control action is on the flanks, until the weather changes or the fuel supply lessens. The City of Austin is currently at a low risk based on the extent scales in Figures 5- 10 to 5-12. As the magnitude of an even t can change based on the weather, it's important to maintain awareness of the Fire Danger Class, KBDI and Regional Fire Risk Levels to mitigate against future wildfire occurrences. Previous Occurrences A total of 95 acres of land are reported to have burned in 2008 as a result of three wildfire events greater than 10 acres each (Table 5-23). According to the City of Austin Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management25, Austin is at risk for wildfire year-round and the highest wild fire risk is considered to be in west Austin where houses mix with wooded, hilly areas. Table 5\u00ad23.

Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 50 While exact incidents were not reported, historic occurrences for the Central Region are illustrated by county in Figure 5-13 from 1985 to 2008. Figure 5\u00ad13. Historical Wildfires, 1985\u00ad2008 Probability of Future Events Wildfires can occur at any time of the year. Climatic conditions such as severe freezes and drought can significantly increas e the intensity of wildfires since these conditions kill vegetation, creating a prime fu el source for these types of fires. The intensity of fires and the rate at which th ey spread are directly related to wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity. Due to these factors, the probability for a wildfire occurrence for the City of Austin is highly likely, meaning that an event is probable in the next year or expe cted to occur on an annual basis. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 51 Infectious Disease An infectious disease is defined as a clin ically evident disease resulting from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents. According to FEMA, infectious diseases are a major threat around the world, killing millions globally each year. Transmission of an infectious disease may occur through one or more means including physical contact with infected individuals. These infecting agents may also be transmitted through liquids, food, bodily fluids, contaminated objects, airborne inhalation or throug h vector-borne dissemination. Infectious disease is usually classified as endemic, epidemic or pandemic. An endemic is present at all times at a low frequency (e.g., chicken pox in the United States). An epidemic is a sudden severe outbreak of disease (e.g., the bubonic plague during Medieval times) and a pandemic is an epidemic that becomes very widespread and affects a whole region, a co ntinent, or the world (e.g., the 1957 flu pandemic caused at least 70,000 deaths in the United States and 1-2 million deaths worldwide). The term \"pandemic\" refers to geographic scope rather than intensity. A flu virus can become a pandemic depending on the geographic spread of the virus, and can occur when a new fl u virus emerges. Location Pandemics are random, with a few happe ning every century. Wherever and whenever it starts, the disease impacts a ll areas of the world, and all areas are vulnerable. Third world countries have fe wer resources to fight disease and may be more vulnerable than more industrialized na tions. In the United States, the public health system works at the federal, state and local levels to monitor diseases, plan and prepare for outbreaks and prevent epidem ics where possible. But, in the age of air travel and worldwide shipping, it is becoming increasingly difficult to contain localized outbreaks as infected or expo sed people travel and work, sending the disease across the globe in a matter of hours. Extent The severity index for infectious disease is measured in terms of projected number of deaths or the case-fatality ration (CFR) as shown in Figure 5-14. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 52 Figure 5\u00ad14. Intensity Scale - Infectious Disease The severity of a pandemic virus can be ev aluated from two perspectives: that of the infected individual and from the population level - that is, how many complications and deaths might be expected as a whol e. Measuring severity from either perspective in real time is a major challenge. The most common measure of severity is the case-fatality rate (CFR) as depicted in Figure 5-14. The magnitude of a pandemic event is also evaluated from the population level in terms of warnings. Figure 5-15 illustrates the various warning levels for pandemic. Dr. Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced in June of 2009 that H1N1 had reached Phase 6, Pandemic.

Although speculation still exists as to the exact origins of the 1918 27 Disease added to the report in 2005. 28 Texas Department of Health 29 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Je ffery K. Taubenberger and David M. Morens. 1918 Influenza: the Mother of All Pandemics , January, 2006 Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 56 Pandemic, a large factor contributing to the spread of the disease was worldwide travel and modern transportation. The first case appeared in Austin at Camp Mabry on September 27, 1918, but by early October, 900 cases were confirmed30. The City took action by closing schools, churches and theaters, and eventually ado pting an ordinance that banned all public gatherings31. By the beginning of November the cases had begun to decline for the City and areas statewide, and the City's ban on public gatherings was repealed, effective November 3, 191832. In total, it is estimated that 277 people died from the 1918 flu in Austin and Travis County33. H1N1 In March of 2009, a novel strain of Influenza A (H1N1 or \"Swine Flu\") virus was detected in Mexico and the United States. The virus has since spread worldwide. As of September 27, 2009, more than 340,000 cases of Swine Flu have been confirmed worldwide and approximatel y 4,100 deaths have been reported34. The most commonly reported symptoms include cough, fever, sore throat and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiti ng and diarrhea. Most cases with H1N1 did not require hospitalization and had sy mptoms that lasted approximately four days35. Since June 9, 2009, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has reported antigenic characterization results from 25 novel in fluenza A (H1N1) viruses and 1 seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus received from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Laboratory since April 26, 2009. Figure 5-16 illustrates the percentage of visits to Texas hospitals for influenza-like symptoms. Figure 5-17 displays nationwide influenza activity. 30 City of Austin Office of Emergency Management, Atkins, Billy, No Just Cause for Alarm , available at: World Health Organization 35 Carrat, F. et al.

As of August 1, 2009, H1N1 case totals for Travis County include 36 hospitalized and six deaths related to influenza. The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department no longer reports the cases of novel H1N1 influenza as the data and case counts have become less reliable. For example, many people may have contracted and recovered from a mild case of H1N1 without seeking treatment. In addition, some reports were on ly included from hospitalized patients. The city and county are now conducting more routine surveillance to focus on illness, hospitalizations and death36. Probability of Future Events Historical evidence shows that the population of City of Austin is vulnerable to disease outbreak, and the probability of future infectious disease or pandemic events is possible. Local public health officials maintain surveillance in hopes of identifying disease prominence and containi ng potential threats before they become epidemics. Of particular concern is the reduction and treatment of H1N1 flu virus. Dam Failure Dams are water storage, control, or diversion barriers that impound water upstream in reservoirs. Dam failure is a co llapse or breach in the structure. While most dams have storage volumes small en ough that failures have little or no repercussions, dams with large storage amounts can cause significant flooding downstream. Dam failures can result from any one or a combination of the following causes: Prolonged periods of rainfall and flood ing, which cause most failures; Inadequate spillway capacity, result ing in excess overtopping flows; Internal erosion caused by embankment or foundation leakage or piping; Improper maintenance, including failure to remove trees, repair internal seepage problems, or maintain gates, valves, and other operational components; 36 The City of Austin and the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department have develop a preparedness and response plan for pandemic influenza, available at: http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/pandemicflu/downloads/flu_plan.pdf Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 59 Improper design, such as use of improper construction materials; Failure of upstream dams in the same drainage basin; Landslides into reservoirs, which caus e surges that result in overtopping; High winds, which can cause significant wave action and result in substantial erosion; Earthquakes, which typically cause long itudinal cracks at the tops of the embankments, leading to structural failure. Location The City of Austin has four major dams which are addressed in this risk assessment: Decker Lake, Longhorn, Ma nsfield, and Tom Miller. The general location of these dams is shown at a broad scale suitable for hazard mitigation planning purposes in Figure 5-18. Also shown in Figure 5-18 are hazard area buffers explained in detail later in this section. Figure 5\u00ad 18. General Locations of Major Dams in the City of Austin Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 60 Table 5-27 contains general hazard-relat ed information about each dam based on information available from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) National Inventory of Dams. Table 5\u00ad27. General Hazard\u00adRelated Information on Major Dams in the City of Austin DAM NAME RIVER YEAR COMPLETEDAGE OF DAM (AS OF 2009) MAXIMUM STORAGE CAPACITY DOWN STREAM HAZARD POTENTIAL Decker Lake (also called Decker Creek) Decker Creek 1967 42 45,200 High Longhorn Colorado River 1960 49 6,850 Significant Mansfield (also called Marshall Ford) Colorado River 1942 67 3,223,000 High Tom Miller Colorado River 1939 70 73,100 High Source: National Inventory of Dams Extent Dam failure is at times difficult to mitiga te due to the fact that any initial steps require determination of ownership. In Te xas, there are a total of 7,590 dams. Of these 890 are high hazard dams, with an other 802 as significant hazard dams. Almost 90% are over 25 years old. Responsibility for dams lies with the owners and managers of each dam. Prior to 2009, High-hazard-potential dams were defined as those at which failure or mis-operation would probably cause loss of human life. Significant-hazard-potential dams are those at which failure or mis-oper ation probably would not result in loss of human life but could cause economic loss, environmental damage, disruption of lifeline facilities, or other significant damage. Low-hazard-potential dams are those at which failure or mis-operation probably would not result in loss of human life but would cause limited economic and/or enviro nmental losses. Losses would be limited mainly to the owner's property. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 61 Table 5\u00ad28. Previous Dam Classifications, National Inventory of Dams Hazard Potential Classification Loss of Human Life Economic, Environmental, and Lifeline Losses Low None expected Low and generally limited to owner Significant None expected Yes High Probable. One or more expected Yes (but not necessary for this classification) In 2008, the Texas Commission on Envi ronmental Quality (TCEQ) proposed new rule changes including changing dam classifi cation definitions. Effective January 1, 2009, dam classifications are labe led as shown in Table 5-29. Table 5\u00ad29. Dam Classifications Effective January 1, 2009 Hazard Potential Classification Loss of Human Life Economic, Environmental, and Lifeline Losses Low None expected Minimal economic loss Significant Probable (1 to 6) Economic loss appreciable High Loss of life expected (7 or more). Economic loss excessive Source: Texas Commission on Environmental Quality The new classifications place a greater impact on high and significant hazard dams. Now a significant classification indicates a probable loss of life, whereas before no loss of life was expected in the event of dam failure. A High Hazard dam breach is now indicative of an expected loss of life of seven or more persons versus a probable chance in pre-2008 classifications. All of the dams located in the City of Au stin are either classified as \"High\" or \"Significant\" (See Table 5-27). Longhorn Dam is classified as \"Significant\", meaning if the dam were to fail, the potential impact would be great with appreciable economic loss and a probable loss of life of one to six people. Decker, Mansfield and Tom Miller dams are all classified as \"Hig h\" hazard dams. A dam failure event at any of these dams would result in excessi ve economic loss and greater than seven deaths. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 62 Remnants from the Austin DamPrevious Occurrences There are about 80,000 dams in the United States today. Catastrophic dam failures have occurred frequently throughout the past century. Between 1918 and 1958, 33 major dam failures in the United States caused 1,680 deaths\u2014an average of 42 deaths a year. From 1959 to 1965, ni ne major dams failed worldwide. According to the TCEQ, there have been a total of 98 dam failures from 1970 to 2008 in the State of Texas. Of these 13 were high hazard dams, 28 were significant, and 55 were low 37. Two major dam failures have affected the City of Austin. The first occurred in 1900 when the Austin Dam gave way when the Colorado River rose eleven feet after torrential rains in the area. The destruct ion of the dam impoverished the City of Austin for several years, but the dam was rebuilt in 1909 and completed in 1912. It failed again in 1915. The structure was not repaired for more than two decades until it was rebuilt by the then newly- created Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) in 1938 and named Tom Miller Dam. After a series of high profile failures throughout the United States during the 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation mandating insp ections and strict safety requirements for all governmental and privately operated dams. Since that time the number of failures and deaths has dramatically decreased. 37 These dams total 96 as one of the dams that failed is no longer classified, while the other has been removed from inventory. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 63 Probability of Future Events Failure of a major dam for the City of Austin is an unlikely event. The frequency of occurrence for dam failure is possible, with less than ten percent chance of an occurrence in any given year. The spatial extent is expected to be minima l, affecting less than 10 percent of people and/or property in the planning area. Hazardous Materials Release In a hazardous materials incident, solid, liquid and/or gaseous contaminants are released from fixed or mobile containers, although this profile focuses on fixed sites. Weather conditions will directly a ffect how the hazard develops. The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is a pu blicly available database from the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that contains information on toxic chemical releases and other waste management activities reported annually by certain covered industry groups as well as federal facilities. This inventory was established under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) and expanded by the Pollutio n Prevention Act of 1990. Each year, facilities that meet certain activity thresh olds must report their releases and other waste management activities for listed toxic chemicals to the EPA and to their state or tribal entity. A facility must report if it meets the following three criteria: The facility falls within one of the following industrial categories: manufacturing; metal mining; coal mining ; electric generating facilities that combust coal and/or oil; chemical wholesale distributors; petroleum terminals and bulk storage facilities; RCRA Subtitle C treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) facilities; and solvent recovery services. Has 10 or more full-tim e employee equivalents. Manufactures or processes more than 25,000 pounds or otherwise uses more than 10,000 pounds of any listed chemical during the calendar year. Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) chemicals are subject to different thresholds of 10 pounds, 100 pounds or 0.1 grams depending on the chemical. Tier 2 data is a publicly available data base from the Texas Department of State Health Services Tier 2 Chemical Report ing Program. Under the community right- to-know program laws upheld at the state and federal level, all facilities that store Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 64 significant quantities of hazardous chem icals must share this information with state and local emergency responders and pl anners. Facilities in Texas share this information by filing annual hazardous chemical inventories with the state, with Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs ), and with local fire departments. The Texas Tier 2 Reports contain facility identification information and detailed chemical data about hazardous ch emicals stored at a facility. A facility must report if it meets the following criteria: Any company using chemicals that could present a physical or health hazard must report them, according to Tier 2 requirements. I f a n i n d u s t r y h a s a n O S H A d e e m e d hazardous chemical that exceeds the appropriate threshold at a certain point in time, then the chemical must be reported. These chemicals may be on the list of 356 Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS) or could be one of the 650,000 reportable hazardous substances (not on the EHS list). This reporting format is for a \"snapshot in time\". EHS chemicals have to be reported if the quantity is either greater than 500 pounds, or if the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) amount is less than 500 pounds. Location Figure 5-19 shows the locations of available georeferenced TRI and Tier 2 listed toxic sites in and around the City of Austin study area. For fixed site analysis, only toxic sites that have georeferenced data available were analyzed and the circle buffers are drawn around each hazardous ma terial site. Two sizes of buffers, 500 and 2,500 meters are assumed in respect to the different levels of effect- immediate (primary) and secondary. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 65 Figure 5\u00ad19. Fixed HAZMAT Analysis Locations and Buffers Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 66 Figure 5\u00ad20. Mobile HAZMAT Analysis Corridors and Buffers Extent Hazardous materials or toxic releases can have substantial impact on communities. Such events can cause multiple deaths, completely shut down facilities for 30 days or more, and cause more than 50 percent of affected properties to be destroyed or suffer major damage. In a hazardous materials incident, solid, liquid and/or gaseous contaminants may be released from fixed or mobile containers. Weather conditions would directly affect how the hazard develops. The micro-meteorological effects on buildings and terrain can alter travel patterns and duration of agents. Shielding in the form of permanent shelter can protect people from harmful effects. Non-compliance with fire and building codes, as well as failure to maintain existing Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 67 fire and containment features can substantially increase damage from a hazardous materials release. The duration of a ha zardous materials incident can range from hours to days. Warning time is minimal to none. Probability of Future Events The likelihood or future probability of occurrence of a hazardous materials release i n t h e C i t y o f A u s t i n i s l o w , w i t h m o r e t h a n a 2 5 p e r c e n t c h a n c e o f a n e v e n t occurring in a given year. The spatial extent of a hazardous material release is minimal or expected to affect less than 10% of people or property. Pipeline Failure The City of Austin has extensive exposure to a pipeline breach due to the numerous natural gas pipelines runni ng through the city. Location Figure 5-21 shows the location of energy pi pelines (gas and oil) in and around the City of Austin. If any of these energy pipe lines, oil or gas, were to rupture, such an event could endanger property and lives in the immediate area (up to 500 meters for immediate [primary] impact and up to 2,500 meters for secondary impact). Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 68 Figure 5\u00ad21.

Terrorism The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) categorizes terrorism in the United States as one of two types\u2014domestic terrorism or international terrorism. Domestic terrorism involves groups or in dividuals whose terrorist activities are directed at elements of our government or population without foreign direction. 39 Natural Gas Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 78 International terrorism involves groups or individuals whose terrorist activities are foreign-based and/or directed by countries or groups outside the United States, or whose activities transcend their national boundaries. A terrorist attack can take several forms, depending on the technological means available to the terrorist, the nature of issue motivating the attack, and the points of weakness of the terrorist's target. Bombings are the most frequently used terrorist method in the United States. A terrorist using a chemical or biological weapon is of particular concern to officials. Special training and equipment is needed in order to safely manage a WMD incident. Biological agents are infectious microbes or toxins used to produce illness or death in people, animals or plants. Biological agents can be dispersed as aerosols or airborne particles. Terrorists may use bi ological agents to contaminate food or water as they are extremely difficult to detect. Chemical agents kill or incapacitate people, destroy livestock, or ravage crops. Some chemical agents are odorless and tasteless and are therefore difficult to detect. They can have an immediate effe ct (a few seconds to a few minutes) or a delayed effect (several hours to several days). The Department of Defense estimates that as many as 26 nations may possess chemical agents and/or weapons and an additional 12 may be seeking to develop them. The Central Intelligence Agency re ports that at least ten countries are believed to possess or to be conducting research on biological agents for weaponization. Terrorist incidents - as with other natural and technological disasters - involve the application of one or more modes of harmfu l force to the built environment. These modes include contamination (as in the case of chemical, biological radiological or nuclear hazards), energy (explosives, arson, and even electromagnetic waves), or denial of service (sabotage, infrastructu re breakdown, and transportation service disruption). Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 79 Location There is no distinct geographic boundary to the threat of terrorism. An event is possible throughout the City Extent The Homeland Security Advisory System , issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, is a color-coded terror ism warning system that sets out five threat levels. Terrorism Warning Threat Levels are described in Table 5-31. Table 5\u00ad31. Terrorism Warning System Threat Levels40 Color Threat Level41 Governmental actions to be taken Green Low: Low risk of attacks. Requires \"protective measures\" such as regularly assessing facilities for weaknesses and finding ways to reduce them, and making sure State and local government employees are trained to handle terrorism situations. Blue Guarded: General risk of attacks. Requires government agencies to review and update emergency response procedures and communications systems, as well as provide the public with necessary information. Yellow Elevated: Significant risk of attacks. Includes increasing surveillance of critical locations, coordinating emergency plans with nearby jurisdictions and implementing contingency and emergency response plans. Orange High: High risk of attacks. Requires coordinating necessary security efforts with armed forces or law enforcement agencies, taking additional precautions at public events, preparing to work at an alternative site or with a dispersed workforce and restricting access to essential personnel. Red Severe: Severe risk of Includes assigning emergency response personnel and setting up specially trained teams; monitoring, redirecting, or constraining transportation 40 Department of Homeland Security 41 Current threat levels can be found at: http://www.dhs.gov/xinfoshare/program s/Copy_of_press_release_0046.shtm. Section 5 - Hazard Profile City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 80 Color Threat Level41 Governmental actions to be taken attacks. systems; closing public and government facilities; and increasing or redirecting personnel to address emergency needs. The Red Cross also issues Advisory System Recommendations for individuals, families, neighborhoods, schools and businesses for each alert level. These may be found at: www.redcross.org. There are heightened periods for terrorism risk based on intelligence and other information. A potential terrorist event could devastate the community physically, economically and psychologically for many years to come. Warning time for terrorism is minimal to none. Previous Occurrences The history of terrorism on United States soil includes the attacks of September 11, 2001, on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. and the ensuing anthrax attacks; the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City; and earlier bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. The City of Austin has not experienced a terrorist act. While complete prevention of an attack may not be attainable, the Ci ty can lessen the likelihood and/or the potential effects of an incident. Austin continues to improve its readiness to respond to a terrorist incident through participation in state and federal programs that provide training and equipment for agencies that would respond to a local terrorist incident, and in exercises that help to improve agency coordination and test local response plans. Probability of Future Events The types, frequencies, and locations of many natural hazards are identifiable and, even in some cases, predictable. The la ws of physics and nature govern them. Malevolence, however, cannot be forecast with any accuracy. There is, therefore, some potential for most, if not all, types of intentional terrorist acts to occur anywhere and at any time.

The primary objective of the vulnerability assessment is to quantify exposure and potential loss estimates for each hazard. In so doing, the City and its planning partners better understand their unique risks to identified hazards , which helps when evaluating and prioritizing mitigation actions. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 2 This section begins with an explanation of the methodology applied to complete the hazard vulnerability assessment, followed by a summary description of the asset inventory as compiled for the City1 Atmospheri c . The remainder of this section focuses on the results of the vulnerability assessment, and is organized by hazard as listed below. o Extreme Heat o Hail o Hurricane Wind o Thunderstorm o Tornado o Winter Storm Hydrologic o Drought o Flood Other Natural Hazards o Infectious Disease o Wildfire Technological / Man -Caused o Dam Failure o Hazardous Materials Release o Pipeline Failure o Terrorism Method ol ogy This risk assessment was conducted using two distinct methodologies : utilizing GIS-based analysis and statistical risk assessment methodology. Each approach provides estimates for the potential impact of hazards by using a common, systematic framework for eva luation, including historical occurrence information. A GIS -based analysis was conducted for five hazards: Hurricane Wind Flood Pipeline Failure Hazardous Materials Release 1 Toxic Sites and Critical Facilities found in Appendix C and D are not repeated in this Section for privacy concerns. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 3 Wildfire A statistical risk assessment approach was used to analyze four hazards: Hail Thunderstorm Drought Tornado An analysis of historical data was used to analyze five hazards: Extreme Heat Infectious Disease Dam Failure Terrorism Winter Storm GIS-Based Analysis For the GIS-based assessment, geospatial data was collected from l ocal, state and national sources , with local data being used to the maximum extent possible . ESRI\u00ae ArcGIS 9.2 was used to assess risk by utilizing digital data such as local tax records for individual parcels and georeferenced point locations for critica l facilities. Using these types of data layers, risk was evaluat ed by estimating the assessed building value associated with parcels determined to be located in identified hazard areas. HAZUS -MH MR3 (September 2007) was also used to model hurricane winds and inland (riverine) flood ing and estimate potential losses for these hazards. Census 2000 data (at the census block level) was derived from HAZUS -MH and used t o estimate potentially exposed population s in hazard areas. The objective of the GIS -based analysis was to determine the estimated vulnerability of people, buildings and critical facilities to the identified hazards for the City of Austin using the best available data. In so doing, local databases made available through the City of Austin, such as local tax assessor records, parcel boundaries, building footprints and critical facilities data, were used in combination with digital hazard data. The results of the analysis provided an estimated number of people, as well as the numbers and values of buildings and critical facilities determined to be potentially at risk to those hazards with delineable geographic hazard boundaries. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 4 HAZUS -MH is FEMA's standardized loss estimation methodology built upon an integrated GIS platform ( Figure 6-1) to condu ct analysis at a regional level, rather than a structure -by-structure basis. The HAZUS -MH risk assessment methodology is parametric, in that distinct hazard and inventory parameters (e.g., wind speed and building types) were modeled using the HAZUS -MH sof tware to determine the impact (i.e., damages and losses) on the built environment. This risk assessment applied HAZUS -MH to produce a countywide profile and estimate losses for two hazards at the jurisdictional level (flood and hurricane wind) . The resul ts of the HAZUS -MH model analysis includes annualized loss estimates. HAZUS -MH MR3 uses Census 2000 for p opulation ; Census 2000 and Dun & Bradstreet 2002 for building count ; 2006 RS Means for b uilding valuation ; and 2006 Dun and Bradstreet for commercial data. Figure 6-1. Conceptual Model of HAZUS -MH Methodology Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 5 Statistical Risk Assessment Methodology The statistical risk assessment methodology was applied to analyze hazards of concern outside the scope of HAZUS -MH and the GIS -based risk assessment. This methodology uses a statistical approach and mathematical modeling of risk to predict a hazard's frequency of occurrence and estimated impacts based on recorded or historic damage information. This methodology was used to assess risk to the hail, tor nado, winter storm and drought hazards. Available historical data for each hazard was used and statistical evaluations were performed using manual calculations. The general steps used in the statistical risk assessment methodology are summarized below and illustrated in Figure 6 -2: 1. Compile data from local, state and national sources, as well as literature . 2. Clean up data, including removal of duplicate records and update losses to account for inflation . 3. Identify patterns in frequency, intensity, vulnerabil ity and loss . 4. Statistically and probabilistically extrapolate the patterns . 5. Produce meaningful results, including the development of annualized loss estimates. Figure 6-2. Conceptual Model of the Statistical Risk Assessment Methodology A significant por tion of the historical data used in this risk assessment comes from the National Climatic Data Center ( NCDC), a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NCDC is the world's largest active archive of climate data. The econom ic loss results are presented here using two interrelated risk indicators: Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 6 1) The Annualized Loss (AL), which is the estimated long -term weighted average value of losses to property in any single year in a specified geographic area (i.e., county). 2) The Annualized Loss Ratio (ALR), which expresses estimated annualized loss normalized by property replacement value. The impact for each hazard is presented in terms of annualized losses, whenever possible. For other hazards where the statistical approach w as used, the computations are based primarily on the observed historical losses. In general, presenting results in the annualized form is useful on three fronts: 1. Contribution of potential losses from all future disasters is accounted for with this approac h. 2. Results in this form from different hazards are readily comparable and hence easier to rank. 3. When evaluating mitigation alternatives, use of annualized losses is the most objective approach for this purpose. Annualized losses (for the hazards where the parametric approach is utilized ) are computed in a three -step process (see Figure 6 -3): 1. Compute / estimate losses for a number of scenario events with different return periods [e.g., 10 -year, 100- year, 200- year, 500- year, etc...]. 2. Approximate the Probability versus Loss Curve through curve fitting. 3. Calculate the area under the fitted curve to obtain annualized losses. Figure 6 -3. Graphical Representation of the Annualized Loss Methodology Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 7 The estimated Annualized Loss (AL) addresses the key idea of risk: the probability of the loss occurring in the study area (largely a function of building construction type and quality). By annualizing estimated losses, the AL factors in historic patterns of frequent smaller events with infrequent but larger events to pr ovide a balanced presentation of the risk. The Annualized Loss Ratio (ALR) represents the AL as a fraction of the replacement value of the local inventory. This ratio is calculated using the following formula: ALR = Annualized Losses / Total Exposure The annualized loss ratio gauges the relationship between average annualized loss and replacement value. This ratio can be used as a measure of vulnerability in the areas and, since it is normalized by replacement value, it can be directly compared across different geographic units such as metropolitan areas or counties. Study Area and Asset Inventory Hazard identification consists of (1) defining the study area in terms of scale and coverage; and (2) collecting and compiling a list of prevalent hazards in the study area to help narrow the focus of the analysis. Study Area The core study area is the incorporated limits of the City of Austin as well as three additional areas associated with the city for general reference: the Limited Purpose Planning Zone, 2 -mile ETJ and 5- mile ETJ.2 This study area is presented on the following page in Figure 6 -4. 2 An ETJ is an extraterritorial jurisdiction. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 8 Figure 6-4. Community Profile Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 9 Asset Inventory Table 6-1 provides estimated parcel count and total estimated dollar exposure (i.e., improved value) of parcels in or intersecting the City of Austin. Table 6 -1. Parcel Inventory TOTAL ESTIMATED NUMBER OF PARCELS* ESTIMATED NUMBER OF PARCELS WITH IMPROVED VALUES TOTAL ESTIMATED IMPROVED VALUE OF PARCELS 187,361 40,352 $23,858,922,856 A homestead is defined by the Travis County Tax Office as a building occupied by the owner of the freehold and his or her family, with the primary intention of making it their home, together with the parcel of land on which it stands and the other improvements attached to it. The State of Texas offers a homestead exemption that essentially removes a portion of the value of the property from taxation (thus lowering the tax bill). The parcel data available for the City of Austin includes both homestead exemption values a nd non -homestead exemption values. For the purposes of this risk assessment, non -homestead exemption values were used. It is also worth noting that r eplacement values can be higher than assessed value s due to the local housing market , homestead exemption s of $51,000 3 for those over 65 years of age and those with disabilities, the tendency for post - disaster construction costs to increase due to adherence to new building codes and NFIP requirements, and increases in demand for skilled contractors and buildi ng materials as the supply of both decrease. Critical Facilities Table 6-2 provides the total number and estimated value of critical facilities in the City of Austin (Appendix D contains a more detailed list ing of the se facilities ). Figure 6-5 provides a map of these assets indicating their approximate locations within the planning area. It is important to note that data derived from HAZUS - MH MR3 for communications facilities, emergency operations facilities, fire departments, hospitals, police stations and schools was used for the HAZUS -based 3 Travis County Tax Office. 2009, available at: http://www.traviscountytax.org/goPropertiesRatesExemptions.doc .

First, the default inventory used by HAZUS may not be as current and/or accurate as data available locally. Second, the analyses for hurricane wind and flood were conducted at the census tract and census blo ck levels respectively and the aggregation of the data at these levels may lead to minor discrepancies in building counts.

Less than 10 percent of property destroyed or with major damage. 5 Sources: Railroad Commission of Texas; City of Austin, TRI/Tier II lists Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 13 Extreme Heat Because extreme heat events are not confined to specific geographic boundaries, all existing and future buildings, facilities, and populations are considered to be exposed to this hazard and could potentially be impacted. Given the lack of historical data and l imited likelihood for structural losses resulting from extreme heat occurrences in the City of Austin, annualizing potential structural losses over a long period of time would most likely yield a negligible annualized loss estimate for the city. Typically more than twelve hours of warning time would be given before the onset of an extreme heat event. Even though only minor property damage would result, the potential impact of excessive summer heat is considered m ajor as an event could cause permanent inj uries or deaths to citizens . Hail Because hail events are not confined to specific geographic boundaries , all existing and future buildings, facilities , and populations are considered to be exposed to this hazard and could potentially be impacted. It is important to note that only reported hail events have been factored into this vulnerability assessment 6 and only events with georeferenced point data have been included in the point locations map . To estimate losses due to hail, NCDC historical hail lo ss data was used to develop a hail stochastic model. In this model: Losses were scaled to account for inflation. Average historic hail damageability was used to generate losses for historical hail events where losses were not reported. Expected annualiz ed losses were calculated through a non -linear regression of historical data. 6 It is possible that additional hail events may have occ urred since 1950 that were not reported to NCDC and are not accounted for in this analysis. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 14 Probabilistic losses were scaled to account for would -be losses where no exposure/instrument was present at the time of the event. Table 6- 5 shows potential annualized losses fo r the City of Austin . Table 6-5.

The severity of a hailstorm impact is considered to be limited since they generally result in injuries treatable with first aid, shut down critical facilities and services for 24 hours or less, and less than ten percent of affected properties are destroyed or suffer major damage. Hurricane Wind HAZUS -MH wind speed data, inventory and damage functions, and methodology were used to determine the annual expected loss at the census tract level for the census tracts intersecting the City of Austin incorporated limits . This includes census tracts that extend into neighboring Williamson and Hays counties. Because the analysis was c onducted at the census tract level, some margin of error can be expected a s some census tracts only partially intersect the core study area. Table 6 - 6 shows potential annualized property losses by occupancy type and Table 6 -7 shows the annualized percent loss ratio. Table 6 -6.

It is important to note that only reported thunder storms have been factored in to this vulnerability assessment. As with hail, a stochastic model was developed to estimate exposure and losses. Table 6 -10 shows the results in terms of potential annualized property losses for the city from a thunderstorm event. Table 6 -10.

More than 10 percent of person al and commercial property could be damaged and critical facilities could be closed for more than one week. Tornado As with other atmospheric hazards, tornado events are not confined to specific geographic boundaries . Because all new and existing buildin gs could be exposed, a stochastic model was used to determine losses based on those reported to the NCDC. Table 6-11 shows potential annualized property losses the City of Austin could sustain from a tornado .

The impact of tornadoes can be substantial. They can cause multiple deaths, completely shut down facilities for thirty days or more, and cause more than fifty percent of affected properties to be destroyed or suffer major damage. Winter St orm A non -linear regression of historical data was also used to estimate losses for winter storms (Table 6- 12). Like tornados, thunderstorms and hail events, a winter storm is not confined to any specific geographic location. Table 6 -12.

Winter storms for the City are generally mild. The severity of impact of winter storms is generally minor. Winter storms can cause injuries and completely shut down facilities for more than one week, and cause more than ten percent of affected properties to be destroyed or suffer major damage. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 19 Drought Nineteen years of statistical data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and 2002 USDA agriculture data (for non-irrigated agriculture products ) was used to analyze drought hazard risk and estimate potential losses at the county level .7 This analysis is based upon a total agricultural products exposure of $17,116,000 yielding an annualized loss estimate (in dollars) of $11,104,260 and a percent loss ratio of 64.88 percent for Travis Coun ty. It is likely and worth noting that a large portion of this agricultural exposure is outside the City of Austin, but data does not currently exist to demonstrate this and indicate the exact percentage that should be allocated to the study area identif ied for this risk assessment. It is also important to mention that many historical drought occurrences are recorded at a regional level as droughts typically impact large geographic areas. This adds another layer of difficulty in isolating specific figur es for a municipal -level study. Therefore, while the annualized loss estimate and ratio presented above are valid for Travis County as a whole, drought vulnerability for the City of Austin would be much lower. Droughts are slow onset hazards. Warning t ime for drought is long, since drought events take place over long periods of time. Drought warnings are issued by the State Drought Preparedness Council, as directed by H.B. 2660, based upon input from NOAA, the Office of the State Climatologist, the U.S . Geological Service, the Texas Water Development Board, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service. Warnings utilize five \"levels of concern\" and take into account assessments of 7 This analysis was conducted at the county level due to data limitations (inherent with drought information) and to remain consistent with prevailing methodologies for assessing drought hazard risk. This county -level assessment is also consistent with information presented in the regional risk assessment conducted for the Texas Colorado River Floodplain Coalition. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 20 climatology, agriculture, and water availability . The potential impact of drought is \"Minor\" resulting in few, if any, injuries. There is only minor property damage and minimal disruption to the quality of life. Any shutdown of facilities is temporary. Flood In order to assess exp osure to the flood hazard, digital fl ood hazard data was compared with census block data and parcel information provided by the city to determine the total estimated population, total estimated number of parcels, and total improved value of parcels intersecting three flood hazard areas. The three flood hazard areas analyzed consist of the 1 -percent -annual -chance flood hazard (based on mapped A and AE Zones), the 0.2 -percent -annual -chance flood hazard, and the areas marked as \"X protected by levee.\" Table 6-13 show s the results of each analysis . Table 6 -13.

It is also important to note that this reflects more of a nighttime population than a daytime popul ation as the census estimates are based on place of residence. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 21 The HAZUS analysis conducted for the flood hazard (which applies to the following three tables) was performed at the census block level. Table 6-14 shows potential annualized property losses by occupancy type resulting from this analysis and Table 6-15 shows the annualized loss ratio. Table 6 -14.

For flood analysis, residential building stock is further broken down into the categories of pre- FIRM and post -FIRM. A pre -FIRM structure is one that was built prior to the effective date of the first Flood Insuran ce Rate Map (FIRM) for a community and is therefore considered to be more likely to be vulnerable to the flood hazard (assuming that the structure would have been built prior to the community enacting comprehensive floodplain management regulations through the National Flood Insurance Program). In the case of the City Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 22 of Austin, 1981 was used as the threshold for pre -FIRM designation as that is the date of the community's first FIRM.8 Table 6 -16.

This should not , however, be used to assume that damages or interruption of operation is not poss ible during an actual flood event, merely that 8 According to the NFIP Community Status Book. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 23 Congress Avenue during the historic floods in 1935 the HAZUS -MH analysis did not provide indication of potential monetary losses based on the scenarios run. Major flooding and flash flooding events would have a \" Substantial\" severity of impact as floods can cause multiple deaths, completely shut down facilities for thirty days or more, and cause more than fifty percent of affected properties to be destroyed or suffer major damage. Repetitive Loss Properties There are 111 repetitive loss properties associat ed with the City of Austin (See Table 7 -2 in Section 7). A repetitive loss property, as defined and tracked by the NFIP and FEMA, is any insurable building for which two or more claims of more than $1,000 were paid by the NFIP within any rolling 10 -year p eriod, since 1978. A repetitive loss property may or may not be currently insured by the NFIP. According to City of Austin records, 21 of these 11 1 properties have been mitigated, leaving 9 0 properties presumably still at risk to future floods. Wildf ire Table 6-17 also shows the number of parcels with improved values exposed to the wildfire hazard and an estimate of those values.

As described in Secti on 5, risk of wildfire varies considerably by month. Warning time for wildfire events is often minimal or none. The severity of impact of major wildfire events can be substantial. Such events can cause multiple deaths, completely shut down facilities f or thirty days or more, and cause more than fifty percent of affected properties to be destroyed or suffer major damage. Infectious Disease Estimated potential losses are difficult to calculate because infectious disease causes little damage to the buil t environment and damages generally are experienced through public health response and medical costs as well as lost wages by patients. Therefore, it is assumed that all buildings and facilities are exposed to disease but would experience negligible dama ge in the occurrence of an outbreak . For example, upkeep and maintenance of buildings and facilities would fall behind due to the high absenteeism of employees or the closing of facilities. The costs to the public health sector , however, in Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 25 terms of responding to an outbreak as well as impact to health as a whole, m ay be substantial . Even though a pandemic event would affect mainly people, critical infrastructure services, such as emergency services , utility services, water services and telecommunicati ons can be limited by an event. With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, most of the people affected will have mild illness and not require hospitalization. People at the highest risk for developing complications from H1N1 include children younger than 5, adults 65 year of age and older and pregnant women. People who have medical conditions such as: asthma, heart disease; chronic lung disease; blood, endocrine, kidney, liver or metabolic disorders; or a weakened immune system, can experience a worsening of existing conditions if they contract the H1N1 virus . It is still yet to be determined how the 2009 H1N1 pandemic will impact not only the City, but also the state and nation. Each community is facing the challenge of limited vaccines, antiviral supplies and manag ing the demands of health -care resources. Dam Failure Total exposure to the dam failure hazard was estimated using Census 2000 population data from HAZUS -MH MR3 (at the census block level) and parcel data from the City of Austin , in combination with the location and maximum storage capacity of high hazard dams (Table 6-18). For high hazard dams with a maximum storage capacity of 100,000 acre -feet or more (i.e., Mansfield Dam) , all census blocks within 5 miles were considered to be at risk to potential d am failure hazards.9 9 It is important to note that Mansfield Dam is located outside the incorporated area of Austin covered in this risk assessment. Therefore, despite the larger buffer area of 5 miles used in the analysis, a smaller number of people and parcels have been determ ined to be at potential risk compared to the other buffer areas due to the dam's location and the limited number of census blocks and parcels that the buffer area intersects . For high hazard dams with a maximum storage capacity between 10,000 and 100,000 acre-feet (i.e., Decker Lake Dam and Tom Miller Dam) , all census blocks within 3 miles were considered to be at risk to potential dam failure hazards. For significant hazard dams with a maximum storage capacity of less than 10,000 acre -feet (i.e., Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 26 Longhorn Dam) , all census blocks within 1 mile were considered to be at risk to potential dam failure hazards.

In the unlikely event of a failure of a major dam, the severity of impact could be substant ial. It could cause multiple deaths, completely shut down facilities for thirty days or more, and cause more than fifty percent of affected properties to be destroyed or suffer major damage. Flooding -related dam failure would most likely occur during the months of spring and fall, which are more susceptible to flood conditions. Warning time for dam failure, or the potential speed of onset, varies with the causes of dam failure, but is estimated to be three to six hours of warning. Hazardous Materials Re lease Table 6-19 uses census block data to estimate toxic release exposure of people and parcels by jurisdiction for fixed sites. Primary and secondary impact distances were selected based on guidance from FEMA 426, Reference Manual to Mitigate Potential Terrorist Attacks Against Buildings and engineering judgment. Because many sites containing hazardous materials are located in densely populated areas, there are population and structures that could be susceptible to a release from more than one site.

All of the population, buildings, critical facilities, infrastructure and lifelines and hazardous materials facilities are considered exposed to the hazard s of terrorism and could potentially be affect ed. Terrorist events can have a substantial severity of impact. They can cause multiple deaths, completely shut down facilities for thirty days or more, and cause more than fifty percent of affected properties to be destroyed or suffer major damage. Devel opment Trend s The Austin skyline has seen many recent additions with numerous condominium complexes that have sprung up in recent years \u2014a testament to the City's Smart Growth planning tha t steered development into the urban core and away from the environmentally sensitive western realm. According to a Comprehensive Housing Market Study submitted in March 2009 to the City of Austin Neighborhood Housing & Community Development department 10 , Austin's growth is expected to continue and will put pressure on housing supply. According to the study, Austin has a \"very large need for affordable rentals\" and it is predicted that by 2020 the City will need to have developed 12,000 rental units (1,000 per year) priced at an affordable monthly rate to meet the growing needs of low income renters. 10 Comprehensive Housing Market Study Final Report prepared for City of Austin Nei ghborhood Housing & Community Development by BBC Research & Consulting and submitted March 3, 2009 (http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/housing/downloads/austin_comprehensive_housing_market_study.pdf). Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 30 In general, the study indicates that the City is at a critical juncture with regard to choosing how to address its existing and future housing needs and that there are essentially three ways of dealing with the city's projected growth: intentional \"slow growth,\" increased density, and increased sprawl. Slow growth means Austin can intentionally slow down growth within its city limits and rely on communities outside of Austin to fill the demand for new housing. Increased density would mean that Austin could grow denser to accommodate increased housing demand. Increased sprawl would mean that Austin could grow out to accommodate increased housing demand, as long as developable land is available. Hazard Ranking Economic loss results are presented in Table 6 -27 using Annualized Loss (AL) estimates (the estimated long -term value of losses to the general building stock in any single year in a specified geograph ic area) and Annualized Loss Ratios (ALRs) (which represent the AL as a fraction of the replacement value of the local inventory) . The AL addresses the two key components of risk: the probability of the hazard occurring in the study area and the conseque nces of the hazard, largely a function of building construction type and quality, and of the intensity of the hazard event. By annualizing estimated losses, the AL factors in historic patterns of frequent smaller events with infrequent but larger events t o provide a balanced presentation of the risk. The ALR gauges the relationship between average annualized loss and replacement value. Table 6 -27. Summary of Annualized Loss Estimates and Annualized Loss Ratios HAZARD ANNUALIZED LOSS ESTIMATE ANNUALIZED L OSS RATIOS Hail $42,517,506 0.18% Hurricane Wind $4,296,500 Winter Storm $175,502 0.00% Hazard ranking depends on the severity, area of impact, and p robability of occurrence (return period). Table 6-28 provides the hazard ranking for each hazard. Section 6 - Vulnerability Assessment City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 31 Each hazard was given a rating of high (H), moderate (M), low (L), very low (VL), or not applicable (N/A) based on how vulnerable the City of Austin is to t hat hazard. The rating of N/A was used if the results for loss or potential impacts were zero. The rating is based on a combination of factors such as population and building exposure, or annualized loss (or ALRs) when available. The ranking of hazards was based on a review of historical incidents, existing plans, and risk assessment results. ALRs were considered in the develop ment of the ratings for hail, hurricane wind, inland flooding, thunderstorm, tornado , and winter storm hazards. Potential impa cts were considered in the development of ratings for dam failure, H AZMAT release, fuel pipeline failure , and wildfire. Table 6- 29 portrays the results of the City's self assessment for hazard ranking based on the preliminary results of the risk assessmen t as presented at the Risk Assessment Workshop in April, 2009. This table also takes into account local knowledge regarding previous occurrences and impact. Because Table 6 -29 is not limited to loss results, the following additional hazards are included: infectious disease; extreme heat; and terrorism. Table 6-28.

In addition to providing an inventory of the jurisdiction's pr ograms and plans in place, the capability assessment also helps communities to prioritize actions through an analysis of the social, technical, administrative, political, legal, economic and environmental considerations, collect ively known as \"STAPLEE\" evaluation criteria. This evaluation criteria helps de termine if mitigation actions are practical and likely to be implemented over time given the local planning and regulatory framework, level of administrative and technical support, amount of fiscal resources and current political climate. Further, a capability assessment highlights the positive mitigation measures already in place or being implemented at the local government level, which should continue to be supported and enhanced through future mitigation efforts. Section 7 - Capability Assessment City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 2 The capability assessment serves as a critical planning step and integral part of the foundation for designing an effective hazard mitigation strategy. When combined with the Risk Assessment, the Capability Assessment helps planning team members to specify mitigation actions and ensure that those actions are achievable given current capabilities and limitations. Process During the Kickoff Workshop, a deta iled Capability Assessment Survey was distributed to planning team members. The survey requested information regarding existing local plans, policies, pr ograms or ordinances that contribute to and/or hinder the ability to implement hazard mitigation actions. Other indicators included information related to each jurisdiction's fiscal, administrative and technical capabilities, such as access to local budgetary and personnel resources for mitigation purposes. Survey respondent s were also asked to comment on the current political climate with respect to hazard mitigation. The results of the survey provide an invent ory of existing plans and ordinances for the City of Austin. In addition planning team members ranked the city's specific capabilities in a self-assessment, which is sh own at Table 7-2. This allows for the identification of any ga ps or weaknesses. Assessment Findings The findings of the capability assessment are summarized in this Plan Update to provide insight into the relevant capacity of the City of Austin to implement hazard mitigation activities. While the city has a multitude of plans and planning mechanisms in place, the focus for this survey is to identify those areas where mitigation activities could be incorporat ed, or where other planning mechanisms and goals can be integrated into the Plan Update. All information is based upon the input provided by planning team memb ers through the Capability Assessment Survey. Planning and Regulatory Capability Planning and regulatory capability is bas ed on the implementation of plans, ordinances and programs that demonstrate the City's commitment to guiding and managing growth, development and redevelopment in a responsible manner, while maintaining the general welfare of the comm unity. It includes emergency response and mitigation planning and comprehensive land use planning as well as plans to Section 7 - Capability Assessment City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 3 protect environmental, historic and cult ural resources in the community. These planning initiatives present significant opportunities to integrate hazard mitigation principles and practices into the local decision making process. Hazard Mitigation Action Plan (HMAP) A Hazard Mitigation Action Plan (HMAP) represents a community's blueprint for how they intend to reduce the impact of natural and human-caused hazards on people and the built environment. Elements of a hazard mitigation plan include a risk assessment, capability assessment and mitigation strategy. In 2003 the Austin City Council approved the first HMAP for th e City entitled, \"Disaster Ready Austin: Building a Safe, Secure and Sustainable Co mmunity.\" FEMA approved the City's HMAP in 2004, which was one of the first plan s to be approved for Texas. The City began the process of updating the plan in 2009. Disaster Recovery Plan A Disaster Recovery Plan serves to guide the physical, social, environmental and economic recovery of a community, including the physical reconstruction process following a disaster. The City currently has a Disaster Recovery Plan in place. Emergency Operations Plan An Emergency Operations Plan outlines the responsibilities of those responding to an emergency or disaster and the means by which resources are deployed. The City of Austin has an Emergency Operations Mast er Plan in place, which is overseen by the Office of Homeland Security and Emer gency Management (HSEM). As part of this effort, the City also has an Evacuation Plan. Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) A Continuity of Operations Plan establishes a clear chain of command, line of succession, and plans for backup or alternate emergency facilities in case of an extreme emergency or disaster. The City has a COOP in place. Comprehensive Plan A Comprehensive Plan establishes the over all vision for a community and helps to guide municipal decision making. The City has a comprehensive plan in place and is currently in the process of updating the plan1. 1 Updates can be found at: http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/compplan/ Section 7 - Capability Assessment City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 4 Capital Improvement Plan A Capital Improvement Plan guides the scheduling of spending on public improvements. A Capital Improvement Plan can serve as an important mechanism to guide future development away from identified hazard areas. Limiting public spending in hazardous zones is one of the most effective long-term mitigation actions available to local governments. Su rvey results indicate that the City has a Capital Improvement Plan. Historic Preservation Plan A historic preservation plan is intended to preserve historic structures or districts within a community. An overlooked aspect of the historic preservation plan is the assessment of buildings and sites located in areas subject to natural hazards to identify the most effective way to reduce future damages. 2 This may involve retrofitting or relocation techniques that account for the need to protect buildings that do not meet current building standards or are within a historic district that cannot easily be relocated out of a haza rd-prone area. The City of Austin has a historic preservation plan, which is over seen by the City of Austin Historic Preservation Office (CHPO). The CHPO protects and enhances neighborhoods, buildings and sites that reflect elements of Austin's cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history. Floodplain Management Capability Flooding represents the greatest natural haza rd facing the City of Austin. At the same time, the tools available to reduce the impacts associated with flooding are among the most developed when compared to other hazard-specific mitigation techniques. In addition to the Floodplain Management Plan and Floodplain Ordinance, which provide a framework for corrective and preventative actions, the City has also established similar projects and programs under the broad goal of reducing flood-related impacts. 2 See Protecting the Past from Natural Disasters. 1989. Nelson, Carl. National Trust for Historic Preservation: Washington, D.C. Section 7 - Capability Assessment City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 5 Stormwater Management Program Stormwater management is typically focused on design and construction measures intended to reduce the impact of more fr equently occurring minor urban flooding. The City of Austin follows a Stormwater Management Program that provides for the planning and design of drainage improvements to further protect against floods. Watershed Protection Master Plan The City of Austin Watershed Protection Department3 developed a Watershed Protection Master Plan in 2001. The purp ose of this effort was to assess flood, erosion and water quality issues for seventeen watersheds throughout the City under the overarching goal of protecting lives, property and the environment. Figure 7-1 illustrates the locations of the watersheds that will be assessed in the plan. The Stream Restoration Program wa s developed for erosion control services including stream stability and planning to address erosion issues identified in the Watershed Protection Master Plan. Figure 7\u00ad1. Austin Watershed Study Area - Watershed Protection Master Plan 3 More information is available at: http:// www.ci.austin.tx.us/watershed/masterplan.htm Section 7 - Capability Assessment City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 6 Flood Response In order to develop proactive remediation measures to minimize flood hardships and losses, the City of Austin has establishe d a Flood Early Warning System (FEWS). FEWS is designed to monitor rainfall and water levels daily, providing real time gauge data4. If the data indicates a potential for flooding, the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) is immediately notified and appropriate actions are taken. National Flood Insurance Program and Community Rating System The City of Austin participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)5 to allow citizens to purchase flood insurance. As an additional indicator of floodplain management responsibility, the City part icipates in FEMA's Community Rating System (CRS). This is an incentive-based program that allows communities to undertake flood mitigation activities that go beyond NFIP requirements. CRS mitigation activities are given a range of point values. As communities complete these activities they are given a rating from 10 to 1, which results in a reduction of flood insurance (See Table 7-1). The city's cu rrent rating is 7, which allows citizens up to a 15 percent reduction in flood insurance costs. Table 7\u00ad1. CRS Premium Discounts CRS Rating Premium Deduction 1 45% 2 40% 3 35% 4 30% 7 15% 8 10% 9 5% 10 0 4 Rainfall totals by gauge are provided at: http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/fews/rainfall.cfm 5 For mitigation actions regarding the NFIP, see Table 7-3. Section 7 - Capability Assessment City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 7 Repetitive Loss The Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) Grant Program under FEMA provides federal funding to assist states and communities in implementing mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk of flood damage to severe repetitive loss residential structures insured under th e NFIP. The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) administers the SRL grant program for the State of Texas. Severe Repetitive Loss properties are defined as residential properties that are: covered under the NFIP and have at leas t four (4) flood related damage claim payments (building and contents) ov er $5,000.00 each, and the cumulative amount of such claims pa yments exceed $20,000; or for which at least two (2) separate cl aim payments (building payments only) have been made with the cumulative am ount of the building portion of such claims exceeding the market value of the building. In either scenario, at least two (2) of the referenced claims must have occurred within any ten-year period, and must be greater than 10 days apart.6 Table 7-2 shows repetitive loss and severe repe titive loss properties for the City.

These include a Wildfire Contingency Plan and a Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP). The City also has a Prescribed Burn Plan in place and is developing a Strategic Plan for 2010 under the auspices of the Austin Fire Department. Growth Management and Protection Plans In addition to Neighborhood10 and Smart Growth11 Plans, the City has developed protections programs and plans, which pr ovide solutions for protecting land and resources for growing communities. 10 Neighborhood Plans available at : http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/zoning/ 11 More information on Smart Growth is availa ble at: http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/smartgrowth/ Section 7 - Capability Assessment City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 13 Open Space Management Plan The Open Space Management Plan describes a process and recommends strategies and solutions for handling open space i ssues for outdoor re creational or open habitat areas of land. The City of Austin has developed a Parks and Open Space Master Plan in order to improve the qualit y of downtown parks under the main goal making the City the most liv able city in the country. Austin Climate Protection Plan As discussed in Section 3 of this Update, the Austin Climate Protection Program (ACPP) was established to protect Austin from the effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The ACPP began implementing the Austin Climate Protection Plan in 2007 after the City Council passed a resolution directing the city to take action by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through five main components: a Municipal Plan, to make City of Austin facilities, fleets and operations carbon neutral by 2020; a Utility Plan, to implement the most aggressive utility greenhouse gas reduction plan in the nation through dramatic increases in conservation, efficiency and renewable programs; a Community Plan, to develop a comprehensive plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissi ons from sources community wide; a \"Go Neutral\" Plan, to provide citizens with tools to reduce their carbon footprint; and Homes and Buildings Plan, to make Austin building codes for both residential and commercial properties th e most energy efficient in the nation. Conclusions on Capability The success of future mitigation efforts in a community can be gauged to some extent by its previous and continual pla nning efforts. The City of Austin has implemented a multitude of programs and plans to maintain safety and sustainability. Despite the widespread mechanisms in place to further hazard mitigation measures, planning team member s still see room to grow as indicated in the Self Assessment. Self Assessment 12 In addition to the inventory and analysis of specific local capabilities, the Capability Assessment Survey required planning te am members to conduct their own self 12 Information is based upon the input provided by planning team members through the Capability Assessment Survey, rather than all City employees. Section 7 - Capability Assessment City of Austin| Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 14 assessment of capability to implement hazard mitigation activities by considering barriers to implementing mitigation strate gies or mechanisms that could enhance mitigation strategies. Planning team members were composed of representatives from various City departments, but did not include all City employees. A description of how the planning team was composed can be found in Section 2. Team members ranked each level of capability, by marking it as \"limited\", \"moderate\" or \"high.\" Table 7-4, below, su mmaries the results from each returned questionnaire. Table 7\u00ad4. Self\u00adAssessment for Capability Capability Rank Planning and Regulatory Capability Moderate Administrative and Technical Capability Moderate Fiscal Capability Moderate Political Capability Moderate Overall Capability Moderate The conclusions of the Risk Assessment and Capability Assessment serve as the foundation for the development of a meaningful hazard mitigation strategy. During the process of identifying specific mitigati on actions to pursue, the City of Austin considered not only its level of hazard risk but also the existing capability to minimize or eliminate that risk.

PLAN MAINTENANCE MAINTAINING A SAFE , SECURE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY Overview ........................................................................................................................ 1 Monitoring ...................................................................................................................... 1 Updating ........................................................................................................................ 2 Plan Amendments ...................................................................................................... 2 Five (5) Year Review .................................................................................................. 2 Implementation/Incorporation/Evaluation ................................................................... 3 Implementation .......................................................................................................... 3 Incorporation .............................................................................................................. 4 Evaluation ................................................................................................................... 5 Continued Public Involvement ...................................................................................... 5 Public Involvement Over the Past Five Years .......................................................... 5 Public Involvement Going Forward ........................................................................... 6 Overview Periodic revisions of the updated p lan are required to ensure that the goals, objectives, and mitigation action plans are kept current. More important, revisions may be necessary to ensure that th e updated plan is in full complianc e with federal regulations and s tate statutes. This portion outlines the procedures for completing such revisions and updates. Monitoring Designated Hazard Mitigat ion Team Members (see Appendix A ) are responsible for yearly monitoring of components of the hazard mitigation plan that pertain to their respective department or organization within the C ity. Section 10 - Plan Maintenance City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 2 Updating Plan Amendments At any time, minor technical changes may be made to the plan to keep it up dated . Howev er, any changes to the mitigation actions or modifications in the overall direction of the P lan or the policies contained within it must be subject to formal adoption by the City Council . Any amendment to the Plan must un dergo an open public process. The City will seek public comment on any material change to the Plan during a formal review and comment period of not less than 30 days. At the end of the comment period, the proposed amendment and a summary of all comments will be forwarded to the Austin C ity Council . If no comments are received from the reviewing parties within the specified review period, this will also be noted. The City Council will then review the proposed amendment and comments received and vote to accept, reject, or amend the proposed change. Upon ratification, the amendment will be transmitted to the Texa s Division of Emergency Management. In determining whether to recommend approval or denial of a plan amendment request, the following factors will be considered: Errors or omissi ons made in the identification of issues or needs during the preparation of the plan ; New issues or needs that were not adequately addressed in the plan ; and Changes in information, data, or assumptions from those on which the plan was based. Five (5) Yea r Review The Plan will be thoroughly reviewed by the planning team at the end of three years from the date of adoption by the City Council to determine whether there have been any significant changes that necessitate changes in the types of mitigation acti ons proposed. New development in identified hazard areas, an increased exposure to hazards, disaster declarations, the increase or decrease in capability to address hazards, and changes to federal or state legislation are examples of factors that may affe ct the content of the updated plan. Section 10 - Plan Maintenance City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 3 The plan review provides the City with an opportunity to evaluate successful actions and document potential losses avoided due to the implementation of specific mitigation measures. The plan review also provides the opportunity to address mitigation actions that may not have been successfully implemented as assigned. It is recommended that the planning team meet to review the plan at the end of three years, as grant funds may be necessary for the development of a five -year update. Due to the timelines for grant cycles, it is wise planning to begin the review process in advance of the five -year deadline. Following the review, any revisions deemed necessary will be summarized and utilized according to the reporting pro cedures and plan amendment process outlined herein. Upon completion of the review and update/amendment process and after being approved by the City Council , the revised plan will be submitted to the Texas Division of Emergency Management for final review and approval in coordination with FEMA. Implementation/I ncorporation /Evaluation Implementation Each participating C ity department or team member will be responsible for the development and/or implementation of the mitigation action s in this Plan. Each action has been assigned to a specific organization within the City of Austin . The potential funding sources listed for each identified action may be used when the planning team member (s) begins to seek funds to implement actions. An implementation time period or a specific implementation date has been assigned to each action as an incentive for completing each task and gauging whether actions are implemented in a timely manner. Team member s will integrate implementation of their mitigation action plans with other existing plans for the C ity, such as the Capital Improvement Plan , which is currently being updated for 2010, as well as the Emergency Operations Master P lan for the C ity. Existing plans for the City will be reviewed in light of the Plan Updat e and will incorporate any mitigation policies and actions into these plans, as appropriate. Team members will ensure that the actions in the mitigation plans are reflected in other planning efforts. Section 10 - Plan Maintenance City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 4 Incorporation Upon formal adoption of the Update by the City Council , team members will work to integrate the hazard mitigation strategies into existing plans as listed in Section 7 - Capability Assessment. Participating team member s will conduct periodic reviews of plans and policies and analyze the need f or amendments in light of the approved Plan Update . The planning team will ensure that future capital improvement planning will be consistent with the goals of this hazard mitigation plan to reduce the long -term risk to life and property from all hazards by annually reviewing active plans for consistency. Table 10- 1 identifies ways in which the City will incorporate the Update into other planning mechanisms. Table 10.1 - Examples of Incorporation Planning Mechanism Incorporation of Plan Update Grant Ap plications The Plan Update will be consulted by planning team members whenever grant funding is sought for mitigation projects. If a project is not in the Update, an amendment may be necessary . Annual Budget Review Each City department that participated in the planning process will review the Update and mitigation actions therein when conducting their annual budget review. Emergency Planning The Plan Update will be consulted when the City reviews or revises their Emergency Operations Plan, Disaster Reco very Plan and Continuity of Operations Plan. Capital Improvements The City currently has a Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) in place. Before any updates to the CIP are conducted, the City will review the risk asses sment and mitigation strategy sections of the HMAP Update, as limiting public spending in hazardous zones is one of the most effective long -term mitigation actions available to local governments. Floodplain Management and Fire Protection The Plan Update will be utilized in updating the Watershed Protection Plan, as the goals of both planning mechanisms are similar. As the Austin Fire Department is currently developing fire protection Section 10 - Plan Maintenance City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 5 plans, the Plan Update consulted in conjunction with the development of these plans for overlapping strategies. Climate Protection The Austin Climate Protection Program participated in the Plan Update, and will review the Plan for any actions or strategies when refining the Austin Climate Protection Plan Evaluation As part of the evaluation process, team members will meet quarterly (or at the call of HSEM) to: Assess any changes in risk and recommend additional mitigation actions as appropriate ; Report on the implementation status of the mitigation actions in this plan; if the implementation is on schedule or if th ere are any implementation problems (such as technical, political, legal or coordination issues ); Identify any changes in land development or programs that affect mitigation priorities in their respective department or organization . Continued Public Inv olvement Public Involvement Over the Past Five Years The City has maintained public involvement since FEMA approval of the 2004 Plan in a variety of ways. The City implemented Disaster Ready Austin 1 Promoting the Small Business Administration Pre -Disaster Mitigation Loan Program; , a public education campaign that detailed the natural a nd man -caused or technological threats included in the 2004 Plan. The City informed the public about hazards and steps to take in preparation for a hazard event. Though grant funding is no longer available to continue some of the efforts under Disaster R eady Austin, the HSEM has implemented several public education programs and campaigns since 2004, including : 1 More information can be found at: http://www.ci.aust in.tx.us/disasterready/ Section 10 - Plan Maintenance City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 6 Educating the public about the dangers of low -water crossings and mitigation activities as part of the Texas Flash Flood Alley War Council,; and Training citizens for the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), which currently has over 250 trained volunteers. Throughout the past five years, the City has also kept the 2004 Plan available on their website for download for citizens. Public Involvement Going Forward Input from the public was an integral part of the preparation of this updated plan and will continue to be essential as the plan grows and changes. As note d above, a significant change to this plan will require opportunities for the public to make its views known. This Plan will be posted on the HSEM website, http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/oem/, where officials and the public will be invited to provide ongoing feedback. A copy of the updated plan also will be kept for public review at the HSEM office. The City also uses social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, to keep citizens involved with mitigation planning. If necessary, HSEM may also designate volunte er citizens or willing members of the private sectors as members of the planning team as well as utilize local media to notify the public of any maintenance or periodic review activities taking place.

APPENDIX B MAINTAINING A SAFE , SECURE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY Figure B- 1. Public Survey Overview ........................................................................................................................ 1 Survey Results ............................................................................................................... 2 Overview The City of Austin prepared public surveys that asked a wide r ange of questions concerning the opinions of the public regarding natural and man- caused hazards. This fifteen-question survey was made available on the city website, www.ci.austin.tx.us/oem . This survey was also distributed in hard copy format at public meetings and stakeholder events throughout the planning process. A total of 156 surveys were collected, the results of which are analyzed in this Appendix. The purpose of the surveys was twofold: 1) to solicit public input during the planning process and 2) to help the city to identify any potential a ctions or problem areas. Survey results are depicted on the following pages showing the percentage of responses for ea ch answer. For questions that were not multiple choice , such as questions 13 and 14, or that required an explanation, such as questions 2 and 6, comments are included as they were entered on the survey itself.

Appendix B - Survey Results City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 10 13. In your opinion, what are some steps your local government could take to reduce or eliminate the risk of future hazard damages in your neighb orhood? Prevention and readiness Provide incentives for hazard preparedness Educate the public Test reverse 911 system periodically Be more proactive to reduce threats More upstream flood control Stricter building codes Provide tips and resources to the p ublic explaining what they can do now to mitigate Land use planning and zoning practices that are hazard specific. Also, stop allowing insurance to build in a hazard prone area in the first place! Emergency plans that are thought out, practiced and appropr iate training in place for the people/departments/groups that will be responding to emergency type situations. Being prepared and trained for unexpected hazards/disasters would ben efit citizens and emergency responders. Have a better information system (e .g. city website). Put the electric wires underground. That would eliminate power outages caused by trees without having to whack all the trees. Limit impervious cover in floodplains, stop granting variances to people in Allandale who want to infringe on th e floodplain. Stop promoting the erosion of land by over -developing \"prime real estate\" in the name of economic sustainability, and preserve the natural land we have now. Mandate rain barrels for irrigation, offer rebates for gutters, continue to offer rebates for low -flow fixtures Stop encouraging excessively dense development that promotes flooding and impedes evacuation Create an action plan to prevent and respond to potential disasters. Put electric spark reduction barriers on electric pole transformers . Keep pruning trees around power lines. Limit development along Walnut Creek watershed that is causing erosion and flooding downstream. Start offering voluntary immunizations Better the 311 communications process Financial incentives for storm proofing improvements to homes Appendix B - Survey Results City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 11 Question 13 continued... Reinforce all existing structures that protect against hazards (like levees). Also force apartment homes and Condos to meet strict codes for protection against tornados and other severe storms (at least do annua l checks to make sure they are structurally sound). Reduce or eliminate the red tape that the city, county, state, and federal gover nment has. This is southeast Austin, a lower -middle income, working -class neighborhood. Our local government is not very con cerned with this part of town, except when it needs a place to put an airport, a city dump, or a temporary housing development for the homeless. So, the first step would be to get our city and county governments to recognize that hazard mitigation in south east Austin is just as important as it is in the gated communities of north and west Austin. Example: We have wildfire programs to educate the owners of the million -dollar homes in the wooded areas of far west Austin but those programs don't extend to the people who live in the wooded --and much more heavily populated --areas of southeast Austin. 14. Are there any other issues regarding the reduction of risk and loss associated with hazards or disasters in the community that you think are important? Insuranc e reform and a local high -risk insurance pool to cover low -income homeowners and renters who cannot afford or who are not eligible for standard insurance coverage. Keep buildings out of floodplains, get all utilities underground, and fine anyone who drives into running water, especially if they then have to be rescued. Require a sticker on all 4WD vehicles explaining that they CANNOT stop faster than anyone else, they skid just as well as anyone else, and they need to slow down in bad weather just like ever yone else. Converting older power lines to underground installations. Often power is lost due to tree damage. Overall costs to maintain trees does not fix the problem. Heat, lack of clean water, food supplies, structures to use as storm shelters, unavailab ility of medicines, over crowed hospitals, stupid people driving, communications down, generators used inside houses, panic. These are the risks as I see them. To reduce risks you need informed people in every neighborhood. To inform them I would suggest t he weather band emergency radios (like those available at HEB storm season). Make emergency radios available and batteries - information booklets, maybe a central location in Appendix B - Survey Results City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 12 each neighborhood (like HEB or Walgreens) with a station set up with a learning ro om, with seats please. Broadcast for adults and kids a short to the point message, pri nt pamphlets, stickers for kids, offer coupons for radio purchase and battery purchase (consider long life batteries). Demand long life batteries. Another option - contact the Girl Scouts of America and the Boy Scouts of America and talk about a badge to earn and make it a hard one which requires educating others. School projects for Student Counsels, same idea. Publically known plan for emergency services (including fire, ambulance and law enforcement) when 911 services are severed due to natural disaster. Yes, pass an ordinance that bans begging or panhandling and get people out of the streets and off of corners begging for money or soliciting. A full evaluation of all haz ards that may effect the area to include man made threats such as toxic chemical release or pipeline disasters It seems evident that emergency services are greatly hampered when there is a loss of power for an extended period of time. Solar on hospitals, p olice substations, fire stations, water purification plants and at facilities that would serve as emergency shelters would add a level of security not currently in place. An aggressive plan for increasing xeriscape and rainwater collection. Prevent constru ction in floodplains, implement voluntary buyout program for those in floodplains coupled with regular information campaigns to make sure neighborhoods know about changing conditions and implementing an alert and evacuation plan when flooding is predicted. Reliance on structural controls produces unrealistic sense of security and structural solutions are expensive to maintain and prone to failure. And when they fail, the loss is greater because of the reliance on them as infallible. Less impervious cover . Being aware of at least 2 exit routes from your home, work, school etc Appendix B - Survey Results City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 13 15. A number of community -wide activities can reduce our risk from hazards. In general, these activities fall into one of the following six broad categories. Please tell us how im portant you think each one is for your community to consider pursuing. PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AWARENESS Actions to inform citizens about hazards and the techniques they can use to protect themselves and their property. Examples include: outreach projects , school education programs, library materials and demonstration events. EMERGENCY SERVICES Actions that protect people and property during and immediately after a hazard event. Examples include: warning systems, evacuation planning, emergency response training, and protection of critical emergency facilities or systems. STRUCTURAL PROJECTS Actions intended to lessen the impact of a hazard by modifying the natural progression of the hazard. Examples include: dams, levees, seawalls, Appendix B - Survey Results City of Austin | Hazard Mitigation Plan Update Page 14 detention/retenti on basins, channel modification s, retaining walls and storm sewers. NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION Actions that, in addition to minimizing hazard losses, also preserve or restore the functions of natural systems. Examples include: floodplain protection, ha bitat preservation, slope stabilization, riparian buffers, and forest management. PROPERTY PROTECTION Actions that involve the modification of existing buildings to protect them from a hazard or removal from the hazard area. Examples include : acquisitio n, relocation, evaluation, structural retrofits, and storm shutters. PREVENTION Administrative or regulatory actions that influence the way land is developed and buildings are built. Examples include: planning and zoning, building codes, open space, pr eservation, and floodplain regulations. APPENDIX F - FUNDING GUIDE PROTECTED PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 2010 PROTECTED PROPRIETARY INFORMATION II Introduction A major challenge faced by local and re gional governmental entities seeking comprehensive hazard-mitigation planning solutions is to secure funding in an era of constrained resources at all levels of government. A wide range of financial and technical assistance is available from the State of Texas and the Federal Government to protect public and private entities from floods and other natural and human- caused disasters and preserve and enhance the safety and security of the environment. This Guide was prepared by H2O Partners, In c. of Austin, Texas. It is a tool for public and private entities to use in levera ging state and federal resources to support their mitigation planning efforts. It identifies and briefly describes funding programs available to help the jurisdiction mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural and human-caused hazards. This guide is organized into two parts. Th e first includes state-authorized programs, and the second includes federally-authorized programs. Programs are listed alphabetically by agency. The authority for each program is described, as are funding source, purpose, types of assistance and eligible projects, conditions of use, hazards or topics covered, matching requir ements, application deadlines and contact points for further information.

Texas Commission on Environ- mental Quality (TCEQ) To maintain and improve the quality of surface water resources within each river basin in Texas. The Program is a partnership involving TCEQ, other state agencies, river authorities, regional entities, local governments, industry, and citizens. It uses a watershed management approach to identify and evaluate surface water quality issues, establish priorities for corrective action, and outline strategies to implement those actions. It encourages comprehensive and cooperative watershed planning; maintains basin-wide water quality monitoring; focuses on priority issues and addresses local initiatives; identifies, analyzes, and reports on water quality issues and potential causes of pollution; and identifies and evaluates alternatives for preventing and reducing pollution. Only entities designated in the Act are eligible. Water quality No match required The law mandates pass-through of funds to the River Authorities. There is no specific application process.

Sections 375.1 - 375.4; and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) To provide a perpetual fund to provide low interest loan assistance for the planning, design, and construction of wastewater treatment facilities; wastewater recycling and reuse facilities; collection systems; stormwater pollution control projects; and nonpoint source pollution control projects. There is a set-aside within the Clean Water State Revolving Fund for the Nonpoint Source Pollution Loan and Estuary Management Program. Assistance is in the form of loans at below market interest rates, for a period not to exceed 20 years; or the purchase or refinance of bonds at below market rates; or guarantees or purchase of insurance for local debt obligations. Eligible projects include construction of waste treatment works and nonpoint source pollution control and abatement projects. For entities that are fully authorized to issue bonds, loans are in the form of purchase of bonds, rather than requiring entities to sell them on the open market. Eligible costs include: (a) preliminary planning to determine the feasibility of a project; (b) engineering, architectural, environmental, legal, title, fiscal, or economic studies; (c) the expense of any condemnation or other legal proceeding; (d) surveys, designs, plans, working drawings, specifications, procedures; and (e) the building of a project or the inspection or supervision of any of the foregoing items. An approved Water Conservation Plan is required. The TWDB will also consider environment-al, social and economic impacts and whether the proposed action is or is not detrimental to the public welfare. Water quality No match required. However, funds received from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund may generally be used as a non- Federal match for Federal grants, such as the EPA Nonpoint Source Grant Program (Section 319). After a Pre- application Conference, TWDB solicits proposed pro- jects for an Intended Use Plan. Then, TWDB sends Notice of Avail- ability of Funds and solicits applications. Applicants are generally given 4 months from the Notice, or until August 31, whichever is sooner, to submit applications. Applications for Nonpoint Source projects are funded on a first-come, first-served basis until available funds are used. Suzanne Lucignani, Texas Water Development Board Stephen F. Austin Bldg. P.O.

The Fund provides for three grant programs: (1) Regional Planning for Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment and Collection program provides funding to prepare plans for regional water supply and wastewater facilities. (2) Water Research Grants are dedicated to enhancing planning, management, conservation, development or protection of Texas's water resources ; and (3) Flood Protection Planning Grants provide funds for regional flood protection planning, considering the needs of the entire watershed, including upstream or downstream effects of proposed solutions. Regional Planning for Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment and Collection Grants support preparation of plans to develop regional water-supply and wastewater facilities. The facilities must be regional, i.e., systems that incorporate two or more service areas or serve an area involving two or more political subdivisions. Grants have been awarded for nonpoint source pollution control, ground- water protection and recharge, plumbing retrofit programs, reuse of surface water to increase the dependable supply of a reservoir, and watershed yield augmentation. Eligible activities under Flood Protection Planning include studies and analyses to identify problems resulting from or relating to flooding; determining views and needs of the affected public; identifying potential solutions; estimating benefits and costs of solutions (structural and nonstructural); evaluating environmental, social, and cultural factors; and recommending feasible solutions to flooding. Flood Protection Planning Grants are only awarded to participating NFIP communities. Applicants must consider structural and non- structural flood protection measures; and plan for an entire watershed rather than localized drainage improvements. Water quality, water supply, flooding Grants for Regional Planning and Flood Protection are limited to 50% of total project costs, except in areas of high unemployment rates or low per-capita income. In-kind services may be used for any part of the local share. Grants may be awarded for up to 100% of the cost of a Water Research project. As funds become available and needs are identified, TWDB publishes a notice in the Texas Register. Generally, applications for the Flood Protection Planning are due the first week of January.

Under this program, the State TWDB absorbs some of the initial costs of projects, but ultimately recovers the actual cash expenditure of funds used in providing assistance. Assistance is in the form of sale, transfer or lease by the State of regional water and wastewater projects, including water storage acquisition and flood retention basins. The State assumes a temporary ownership interest in a regional project when local sponsors are unable to assume debt for the optimally sized facility. Loan payments that would have been required, if the assistance had been in the form of a loan, are deferred. Ultimately, the cost of funding is repaid to the State when the State's ownership interest is bought out. A Master Agreement will be established with the TWDB to govern the funding arrangements, including provisions for a defined source of revenue that will be used to purchase the State's portion of the facility. Environment-al Review and an approved Water Conservation Plan are required. The project cannot be reasonably financed without State participation assistance, and the optimum regional development of the project cannot be reasonably financed without State participation. Flooding, water supply TWDB's participation is limited to a maximum of 50% of the project costs and to the portion of the project designated as excess capacity. The remaining costs of the project may be funded through other TWDB programs. Application materials must be submitted by the first business day of the month preceding the month during which the applicant desires TWDB Board consideration. Completed applications are considered by the Board on the third Wednesday of each month.

Because flood hazard conditions change over time due to natural and manmade changes in watersheds and floodplains, FEMA provides grant funds to designated Cooperating Technical Partners (CTPs) and others to develop up-to-date flood hazard data; provide maps and data in digital format; integrate FEMA's community and State partners into the process; and raise public awareness of flood risks. Assistance includes financial assistance in the form of grants to Cooperating Technical Partners and other entities; and FEMA technical assistance, support and data. Financial assistance is provided for activities such as refinement of Zone A boundaries; hydrologic and hydraulic analyses and floodplain mapping; Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) production; and re-delineation of floodplain boundaries using updated topographic data. FEMA technical assistance services are provided in the form of base map inventory; digital base map data sharing; DFIRM maintenance; hydrologic and hydraulic review; assessment of community mapping needs to support the Map Needs Update Support System; and technical standards agreements. Generally, funding flows through Cooperating Technical Partners which have signed a formal agreement to work with FEMA. Flooding Cost shares are negotiated between FEMA and recipients; generally a 20% hard or soft match is sought. Map needs should be included in FEMA's Mapping Needs Update Support System (MNUSS) database. Assistance is requested by letter to the FEMA Region.
