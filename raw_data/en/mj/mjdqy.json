Every bottle promises to unlock a newer, healthier you \u2014 More energy! Better memory! Stronger immune function! Less body fat! \u2014 and all it takes is a small, easily ingested daily dose. Your mind races with questions as you navigate the aisle. What does \"IU\" stand for again? Why does bioavailability matter? How many different types of magnesium are there? Do supplements even do anything? Looking at that dizzying assortment of options is enough to make anyone long for the simpler days of Flintstones vitamins. Although you already know the importance of maintaining good health through diet and exercise, supplements may be a valuable addition to your health regimen. Many of us take supplements not just to replace nutrients we're missing, but also because we hope to give ourselves an extra wellness boost \u2014 a preventive buffer to optimize our health today and ward off future health concerns. At Young Naturopathic Center for Wellness, we take a holistic, proactive approach to health that combines time-tested natural therapies with advanced clinical science. Our experienced practitioners can help you understand your dietary needs and develop a customized supplementation routine that supports your health goals. Introducing the Young Naturopathic Center Virtual Dispensary We appreciate that your relationship with our office is a vital part of your wellness plan. We also know that, due to a variety of circumstances, you can't always get to our office in person. You may not even be able to leave your home. Thankfully, that does not have to prevent you from \"visiting\" us and enjoying the benefits of [Dr. Young](/about/dr-young/) ['](/about/)s and [Dr. Chrystal's](/about/dr-sana-chrystal-nd-dc/) care. With our virtual dispensary administered by FullScript, you can order high-quality supplements from anywhere and have them delivered to your doorstep. It's a safe and convenient option for patients who are unable to make it into the office or who prefer to order online. Our online dispensary is for your convenience and directly supports our practice. Once you have consulted with one of our practitioners and created an account, we invite you to browse our inventory. Dr. Young and Dr. Chrystal have hand-selected their favorite recommendations to address various health needs, including unique products that are not typically found in local pharmacies or health stores. You can also access personalized prescriptions and dosage instructions for products that have been recommended for you. The Importance of Total Wellness and Preventative Care You know that annual maintenance is a critical part of keeping your car running well, and yet so many of us do not apply the same reasoning to our own health. Making healthy choices daily can help you minimize future health problems, save money and enjoy a higher quality of life both now and well into your senior years. Western healthcare systems tend to focus on treating symptoms. When there's an injury or illness that requires attention, conventional medicine springs into action to reduce discomfort and save lives. There is no doubt that this side of healthcare is important, but we should not neglect the equal importance of prevention. We believe in supporting individuals through their entire health journey. By identifying and improving the root causes of poor health, such as nutrition deficiencies, inadequate sleep, lack of exercise and stress, we help patients maintain good health before there's something serious to address. Our online dispensary is just one of the ways we help our patients experience the benefits of preventative care. Why Supplements Belong in a Well-Rounded Wellness Routine Dietary supplements are designed to complement your regular daily intake of nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs and enzymes. Including the right supplements in your daily regimen may: - Improve bone health - Support [immune](/immune-health/)function - Increase energy - Boost metabolism - Promote digestion - Improve fitness - Support healthy skin, hair and nails - Regulate stress and [mood](/health-wellness/im-moody/) - Reduce the risk of chronic disease When you discuss your needs with Young Naturopathic Center, our team will take time to understand your unique concerns and create a supplementation plan that is customized for your body. Who Can Benefit From Dietary Supplements? You strive for balance every day. You try to eat right, exercise often, reduce stress and sleep better. But sometimes, even when you're doing your very best, you need a boost. A nutritious diet is crucial for maintaining health and wellness. Unfortunately, you may not be getting the essential nutrients you need from the foods you eat. Some people eat a diet that is filled with nutrient-deficient foods. Others have digestive issues that impair nutrient absorption. Individuals who require exceptionally high doses of nutrients may struggle to meet their bodies' needs. Over time, insufficient nutrient intake can prove problematic, particularly for women in their childbearing or menopausal years, strict vegetarians or vegans, and the elderly. That's where supplements come in. Proper supplementation can fill your nutrient gaps and increase your body's ability to deal with the dietary deficiencies, stress, [lack of sleep](/health-wellness/i-cant-sleep/) and mental demands that come from a busy life. It's important to remember that supplements are not a replacement for a well-balanced diet and choosing supplements should be an informed decision. You may not feel measurable benefits from specific supplements if they are not the right ones for your body, and the wrong supplements could have negative interactions with any medications you take. Talk with a health practitioner about which supplements and what doses might be appropriate for you. Some Common Dietary Supplements - Calcium - Echinacea - Fish Oil - Ginseng - Glucosamine - Melatonin - B Vitamins - Vitamin C - Vitamin D - Zinc - Reishi Mushrooms - Iron - Magnesium - Probiotics - Fish Oil - Saw Palmetto - Fiber - St John's Wort - Selenium - Chondroitin Choosing and Using Supplements Wisely Nutrition needs are very individual and supplementation should be the same. If you want to take a dietary supplement, it's important to talk to a doctor. Supplements can be harmful if taken in certain combinations, can interact with prescription or over-the-counter medications, or could contain active ingredients that can cause adverse reactions in some people. Some supplements can also have unwanted effects during medical procedures. Ask your doctor what supplements they recommend based on your current diet and health. Also ask what dosage they recommend and what benefits and risks their recommended supplements can have. Make sure you discuss any supplements and medicines you're currently taking. If you do add a supplement to your daily routine, make sure you take it as directed. We appreciate you using our online store and supporting our small business. It means a lot to all of us here at Young Naturopathic Center.
