Photodynamic therapy is a treatment for the eyes. It uses a laser and a special medicine that works when exposed to a certain type of light. It is done to treat age-related maculardegeneration (AMD). AMD is a condition that can lead to loss of vision. The retina is the layer of cells in the back of your eye that converts light into electrical signals. Your retina then sends these signals to your brain. AMD affects your macula. The macula isthe sensitive, central part of your retina. This area is responsible for your detailed,central vision. AMD damages yo ur macula. The macula may be come thinner as a result. Blood vessels may start growing beneath your retina. This can cause fluid to leak beneath your macula. This excess flui d can lead to vision loss. Just before the procedure, an eye doctor injects a medicine into a vein in your arm. This medicine is sensitive to light. It collects in the abnormal blood vessels under your macula. Youare then given an anesthetic eye drop. Using a special contact lens, the eye doctor thenshines a laser into your eye. The light from the laser activates the medicine. The medicinethen creates blood clots in your abnormal blood vessels. This seals off the vessels. This can help prevent more vision loss. Why might I need photodynamic therapy for age-related macular degeneration? Photodynamic therapy is one type of treatment for AMD. AMD is a common cause of significant loss of eyesight in older adults. Rarely, it can lead to total blindness. Because it affects your macula, you may still have your side (peripheral) vi sion if you have AMD. It may cause a sudden or gradual loss of your central vision. AMD comes in two main subtypes: dry type and wet type. Abnormal blood vessel growth is present in only the wet type. Photodynamic therapy is recommended only as a possible therapy for the wet type of the disease. Photodynamic therapy can't restore vision that you have already lost. But it may slow down the damage to your central vision. Photodynamic therapy is an option only for certain people with wet type AMD. It may be advised if your vision loss comes on slowly over time, instead of suddenly. The treatment is used less often now that there are new drugs to decrease abnormal blood vessel growth. But your healthcare provider may advise the therapy in addition to these new drugs. What are the risks of photody namic therapy for age-related macular degeneration? All procedures have risks.
