Stress can have an impact on both your ability to lose weight and to keep the weight off. Although you can't control the stresses in your life, it can help you to learn to manage how you respond to stress to minimise the impact it has on how you eat and on your mental and physical health. Learning to manage stress can help you to lose weight and have a noticeable impact on your sense of wellbeing, empowering you to make more healthy lifestyle choices. Let's take a closer look at how stress can impact your health and your ability to lose weight. We will also present some strategies to support you to keep those pounds off! Stress is often unavoidable in life. A certain amount of stress can be positive, by helping to motivate you. However, too much stress can lead to weight gain or getting you off track with your healthy habits. This means finding ways to manage excessive stress is not just vital for your wellbeing, it can also help you to lose weight. Stress can have a significant impact on your overall health (1). If poorly managed, for example stress can lead to issues with your heart, gut and mental health. Long term stress can also impact your immune system and hormonal balance (1). When you experience ongoing stress you produce larger amounts of the stress hormone, cortisol, which has been found to increase your appetite (2). Long term stress that is unmanaged can have an impact on your body weight, some people will gain weight (3) whilst others will notice they lose weight. If you find that you gain weight when you're stressed it's important to manage how you respond to stress. You can do this by focusing on what and when you're eating and drinking and by introducing some relaxation strategies to build your resilience. Focusing on these can help prevent unwanted weight gain. Let's explore the damaging effects of stress and some evidence based tips on how to manage your stress better. Cortisol and its effect on weight gain and loss Research has found that people with larger tummy measurements have higher levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, which contributes to this weight gain (4). Higher levels of cortisol are also associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and obesity. The foods you eat can also affect your hormone balance, which can lead to an increased blood cortisol level. Foods that are high in sugar and convenience foods high in processed fats and sugars can increase blood sugar, which then leads to an increased production of cortisol (5). When cortisol is continuously high it can contribute to the background level of inflammation in your body. This is concerning because high levels of inflammation increase your risk factors for a number of diseases. Regularly eating foods high in sugar and saturated fats can cause you to crave more of these foods due to the dysregulated blood sugars that can result, this leads to an increased risk that you'll overeat. If you regularly over eat or eat when you're stressed and emotional this can cause weight gain. Poor sleep will also increase levels of cortisol which can again contribute to weight gain (7). High levels of stress hormones cause an increase in your appetite, especially for high sugar and fatty foods (8), which if eaten regularly have been found to increase the risk of weight gain and obesity. You can find that when you're under constant stress you end up in a vicious cycle, so it's vital for both your weight loss and your health in general, to develop habits that increase your resilience to stress. Stress can cause a variety of different symptoms. If you're stressed, it's likely you'll be experiencing some of the following common signs and symptoms of stress. People often report that they feel a sense of irritability or anger, or may feel tense, anxious or overwhelmed. For some, stress will lead to a loss of interest in life and trigger low mood or depression. You may notice that you have lost your sense of humour and feel tense or worried. Some people experience physical symptoms when stressed including nausea, stomach problems and headaches. It is very common when you're experiencing regular stress to notice you have a loss of libido or sexual desire. For some, being stressed can lead to experiencing a faster heart rate. If you recognise any of these symptoms and you are concerned, please book an appointment with your GP for a review. As you can see, being stressed can make you feel quite unwell.
