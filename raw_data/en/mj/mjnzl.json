Managing hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) poses an array of challenges. This chronic inflammatory skin condition causes multiple symptoms \u2014 among them, painful abscesses in skin folds that ooze and give off a foul odor \u2014 each of which may need to be dealt with separately. What's more, \"Some people [with HS] are frustrated with traditional treatments. They may be tired of taking antibiotics or other medications, or they're concerned about long-term side effects,\" says [Rita O. Pichardo, MD](https://www.wakehealth.edu/Providers/P/Rita-O-Pichardo), a dermatologist at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who runs a clinic for HS patients. For that reason, many turn to alternative therapies to help manage the condition. In fact, according to [research published in January 2020 in JAMA Dermatology](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2759748), this is the case for around 84 percent of people who have HS. As is typical of nontraditional medical treatments, most that have been touted to help treat HS have not been proven to work, but several have a good deal of anecdotal evidence to back them up and may be worth trying, with a dermatologist's guidance. \"HS is like a puzzle, and we have different pieces to manage it \u2014 and every piece counts,\" says Dr. Pichardo. 1. Aloe Vera The thick, fleshy leaves of this succulent contain a gel that's used for an array of medicinal purposes. It can moisturize [dry skin](/beauty-pictures/7-surprising-causes-of-dry-skin.aspx), soothe sunburns, and ease irritation and itching. It's often added to lotions, creams, and other products. What it does: Although [aloe vera](/diet-nutrition/diet/aloe-vera-benefits-risks-uses-more/) hasn't been shown to heal HS wounds, it can help ease pain, thanks to its cooling properties, says Pichardo. How to use it: You can harvest the aloe vera gel by making a lengthwise slit in a leaf and squeezing it out. Apply the gel to affected skin and cover with gauze. 2. Diluted Bleach When used full strength, bleach is added to laundry to brighten whites and to cleaning solutions to kill germs. As it turns out, it may also help treat some skin conditions, including HS. What it does: Bleach can help dry up areas of HS that are oozing. It's also an antibacterial that may help prevent open abscesses from getting infected. How to use it: It may seem almost dangerous to purposely put bleach on your skin, but it only takes a little to be effective. Pichardo advises diluting a quarter cup of household bleach in a full tub of bathwater. \"Soak for 10 to 15 minutes, three times a week,\" she says. 3. Epsom Salts Epsom salts are naturally occurring mineral salts that contain magnesium and sulfate. It's inexpensive and easy to find at pharmacies, supermarkets, and other stores, as well as online. What it does: Proponents claim the minerals in Epsom salts are absorbed into the skin, although there's little evidence that's true. But, Pichardo says, \"An [Epsom salt](/drugs/magnesium-sulfate) bath can help dry the pus coming from HS lesions, and it will help overall with inflammation.\" How to use it: Create a bath soak by adding about one and a quarter cups of Epsom salts to a full tub of water. Pichardo also says you can dampen a clean cloth with a solution of Epsom salts and warm water to use as a compress, applied directly to lesions. 4. Honey The honey you drizzle on toast or into tea may have benefits that extend beyond sweetening. \"There are anecdotal reports honey can help in HS,\" says Pichardo, \"and I've had patients tell me it has helped them.\" What it does: Honey, particularly a variety called manuka, \"is antimicrobial, it has healing properties, and it is anti-inflammatory,\" she says. [Laboratory studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5661189/) have found evidence to suggest honey is able to modulate the skin's immune system. It's even used to treat infected wounds. How to use it: Honey can be used a few ways for HS, says Pichardo. \"You can apply it directly to lesions on its own or use a mixture of honey and [turmeric](/drugs/turmeric). You can also take it by mouth, either alone or mixed in tea or another beverage.\" 5. Turmeric Turmeric is a bright yellow spice that makes a colorful addition to curry powder, stews, marinades, sauces, and more. What it does: Turmeric has been found in [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4022204/) to have several potential health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, and is often used to help treat inflammation in dermatology and rheumatology, says Pichardo. How to use it: Turmeric capsules are available at pharmacies, health food stores, and online. Look for a [supplement that combines turmeric with piperine, the active ingredient in black pepper](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/why-you-should-combine-turmeric-and-black-pepper/), as this common pantry staple has been found in [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9619120/) to enhance the absorption of curcumin \u2014 and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power itself. Powdered turmeric also can be mixed with water to make a paste, which you can apply directly to HS lesions,\" says Pichardo. 6. Vicks VapoRub This over-the-counter ointment is typically used as a [cough](/cough/guide/) suppressant when breathed in or to ease aches and pains when rubbed on [sore muscles](/fitness/quick-fixes-for-sore-muscles.aspx). What it does: Some people who have HS say [Vicks VapoRub](/drugs/vicks-vaporub) can help relieve pain when applied directly to lesions. This may be due to its active ingredients: camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol. Among the inactive ingredients, nutmeg oil may help reduce swelling and kill germs, and thyme oil, an antifungal, may relieve itching around lesions, according to [hopeforhs.org](https://hopeforhs.org/), a nonprofit organization focused on education on and advocacy around hidradenitis suppurativa. Many people also like the strong menthol and eucalyptus scent, which can help mask odors related to HS, Pichardo says. How to use it: Vicks VapoRub is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat HS, so there are no medically sanctioned guidelines for how to use it. Most people apply a thin layer to closed lesions and cover it with a bandage. The important thing to remember is that Vicks VapoRub should never be applied to open or draining abscesses, says Pichardo. 7. Zinc [Zinc](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/zinc/) is an essential trace mineral that helps shore up the immune system, speeds wound healing, and may even help lessen the severity of colds. Most people need only a small amount each day: According to the [National Institutes of Health](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-Consumer/), healthy adult males need 11 milligrams (mg) of zinc per day, and females need 8 mg. It's found in foods that are high in protein, such as oysters, lobster, crab, beef, poultry, and beans, as well as mushrooms. What it does: According to Pichardo, zinc may help regulate the immune system. It also is sometimes recommended for relieving inflammation and swelling. How to use it: Oral zinc supplements are included in the [lifestyle factors and alternative treatment recommendations](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(19)30367-6/fulltext#secsectitle0060) for HS, although the evidence of its effectiveness is weak. \"I recommend 90 to 100 mg of [zinc gluconate](/drugs/zinc-gluconate) daily,\" says Pichardo. \"The over-the-counter tablets are typically 50 mg each, so take two of those.\" Should You Try a Home Remedy for HS? If you aren't happy with your current treatment, you may want to talk to your doctor about adding an alternative therapy to your current regimen. According to a [ study published in October 2021 in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34636524/), which compared traditional HS treatments to alternative therapies, \"People who use alternative treatments report a higher quality of life.\" (Pichardo coauthored the research.) Keep a couple of things in mind, though. One is cost: Nearly half of people with HS who use unconventional treatments report spending anywhere from $11 to $50 a month, and 1 in 4 spend $50 to $100. The other is safety and efficacy. \"More studies on alternative therapies and HS are needed,\" says Pichardo. In her own practice, she uses the experiences of her patients, existing research, and the properties of these therapies to guide recommendations. Check with your own dermatologist before you try something new to treat HS. They can help you figure out which home remedies may show the most potential for you and are safe to use alongside your existing treatment. "}
