A great deal of planning went into the educational program you will experience over the next few days. It begins with our theme, Food Allergy: Advances in Prevention and Treatment, which reflects the increasingly important role food allergy is playing in our specialty. This role will only continue to increase as the disease becomes more prevalent and treatments become available. Thus it is crucial to keep up to date on the ever changing world of food allergy\u2014and the theme sessions we have programmed will allow you to do that. We want to remind you that while the theme covers about 20% of our sessions, the remaining 80% were developed through member submissions. Please look for the labels and keys inside this program to help you determine which sessions relate to the theme or to our other various session tracks. See You at the Plenary and Keynote Sessions Join us at the Presidential Plenary, \"Optimal Care of the Food Allergic Patient,\" on Friday from 2:15 to 3:45 pm in Moscone Center South, Exhibition Level, Hall A. You will learn about optimal diagnostic and testing strategies to confirm food allergies, optimal use of emerging treatments, and novel therapies in development. Our plenary sessions continue Saturday morning with \"Outcomes, Education and Healthcare Delivery in Allergic Diseases.\" Sunday morning offers our plenary on \"Systemic Regulation of Susceptibility and Pathogenesis of Allergic Inflammation, and we wrap up Monday morning with Atopic Dermatitis: Bench to Bedside and Back.\" Saturday afternoon also offers our Keynote presented by Eric Schadt, PhD, Dean for Precision Medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. His talk is titled, \"Constructing Individualized Health Course Trajectories to Construct Better Models of Asthma and Other Immune/Inflammation Disorders.\" Download the Annual Meeting App and Join the Social Media Conversation by Using #AAAAI19 We hope you packed your smartphone or tablet. Remember to download the official 2019 Annual Meeting app, which allows you to: interact with other attendees; access session handouts, abstracts and evaluations; search by speakers and add their sessions to your schedule; learn about last minute program changes and navigate Moscone Center South with interactive maps and exhibitor information. Keep in mind that the app offers the only way to complete session evaluations, and we need your feedback to make future programming improvements. You can download the app from the App Store or Play Store on your device. We know many of you are active on social media, so make sure to use #AAAAI19 when you tweet during the meeting to start conversations and share what you're learning with your patients as well as your colleagues who could not be here. Save Time for Some Fun at the AAAAI Foundation Benefit and 5K Run/Walk Of course, we also hope you make time for camaraderie with your fellow attendees at the AAAAI Foundation's two events: Saturday evening's AAAAI Foundation Benefit at the Park Central San Francisco Hotel and Sunday's 5K Run/Walk at AT&T Park. By registering and attending, you are showing your support for allergy/immunology dedicated research. Enjoy your educational and networking experience here in San Francisco, and we hope to see you next year at the 2020 Annual Meeting in Philadelphia. Sincerely, Robert A. Wood, MD FAAAAI David D.

DUPI XENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATION: DUPI XENT is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to dupilumab or any of its e xcipients. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including generalized sickness or serum sickness-like reactions, reported in <1% of subjects who received DUPI XENT in clinical trials. If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue DUPI XENT. Conjunctivitis and Keratitis: Conjunctivitis and keratitis dermatitis subjects who received DUPI XENT. Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported eye disorder in these patients. Advise patients to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare provider. Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage: Do not discontinue systemic, topical or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation with DUPIXENT. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy. Atopic Dermatitis Patients with Comorbid Asthma: Advise patients not to adjust or stop their asthma treatments without consultation with their physicians. Parasitic (Helminth) Infections: It is unknown if DUPIXENT will influence the immune response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with DUPIXENT. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with DUPIXENT and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with DUPIXENT until the infection resolves. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions (incidence >1%) in atopic dermatitis patients are injection site keratitis, eye pruritus, other herpes simplex virus infection, and dry eye.

Please see brief summary of full Prescribing Information on the following page.see the evidence of DUPIXENT use Rx Only Brief Summary of Prescribing Information 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Atopic Dermatitis DUPIXENT is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. 1.2 Asthma DUPIXENT is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate- to-severe asthma aged 12 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. Limitation of Use DUPIXENT is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS DUPIXENT is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to dupilumab or any of its excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including generalized urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum and serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions, were reported in less than 1% of subjects who received DUPIXENT in clinical trials. Two subjects in the atopic dermatitis development program experienced serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions that were associated with high titers of antibodies to dupilumab. One subject in the asthma development program experienced anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue DUPIXENT [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] . 5.2 Conjunctivitis and keratitis in atopic dermatitis subjects who received DUPIXENT. Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported eye disorder. Most subjects with conjunctivitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. Among asthma subjects the frequency of conjunctivitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Keratitis was reported in <1% of the DUPIXENT group (1 per 100 subject-years) and in 0% of the placebo group (0 per 100 subject-years) in the 16-week atopic dermatitis in 4% the DUPIXENT + TCS group (12 per 100 subject-years) and in 0% of the placebo + TCS group (0 per 100 subject-years). Most subjects with keratitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. Among asthma subjects the frequency of keratitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Advise patients to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare provider. 5.3 Eosinophilic Conditions Patients being treated for asthma may present with serious systemic eosinophilia sometimes presenting with clinical features of eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, conditions which are often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia. Cases of eosinophilic pneumonia and cases of vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis have been reported with DUPIXENT in adult patients who participated in the asthma development program. A causal association between DUPIXENT and these conditions has not been established. 5.4 Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease DUPIXENT should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Do not use DUPIXENT to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with DUPIXENT. 5.5 Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage Do not discontinue systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with DUPIXENT. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy. 5.6 Atopic Dermatitis Patients with Comorbid Asthma Advise atopic dermatitis patients with comorbid asthma not to adjust or stop their asthma treatments without consultation with their physicians. 5.7 Parasitic (Helminth) Infections Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. It is unknown if DUPIXENT will influence the immune response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with DUPIXENT. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with DUPIXENT and do not respond to antihelminth treatment, discontinue treatment with DUPIXENT until the infection resolves. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Conjunctivitis and Keratitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Atopic Dermatitis Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3) and one dose-ranging trial (Trial 4) evaluated the safety of DUPIXENT in subjects with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The safety population had a mean age of 38 years; 41% of subjects were female, 67% were white, 24% were Asian, and 6% were black; in terms of comorbid conditions, 48% of the subjects had asthma, 49% had allergic rhinitis, 37% had food allergy, and 27% had allergic conjunctivitis. In these 4 trials, 1472 subjects were treated with subcutaneous injections of DUPIXENT, with or without concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS). A total of 739 subjects were treated with DUPIXENT for at least 1 year in the development program for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Trials 1, 2, and 4 compared the safety of DUPIXENT monotherapy to placebo through Week 16. Trial 3 compared the safety of DUPIXENT plus TCS to placebo plus TCS through Week 52. Weeks 0 to 16 (Trials 1 to 4) : In DUPIXENT monotherapy trials (Trials 1, 2, and 4) through Week 16, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1.9% in both the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W and placebo groups. Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W monotherapy groups, and in the DUPIXENT + TCS group, all at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups during the first 16 weeks of treatment.Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in 1% of the DUPIXENT Monotherapy Group or the DUPIXENT + TCS Group in the Atopic Dermatitis Trials through Week 16 a Pooled analysis of Trials 1, 2, and 4 b Analysis of Trial 3 where subjects were on background TCS therapy c DUPIXENT 600 mg at Week 0, followed by 300 mg every two weeks d Conjunctivitis cluster includes conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, viral conjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis, eye irritation, eye but excludes eczema herpeticum. Safety through Week 52 (Trial 3) : In the DUPIXENT with concomitant TCS trial (Trial 3) through Week 52, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1.8% in DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W + TCS group and 7.6% in the placebo + TCS group. Two subjects discontinued DUPIXENT because of adverse reactions: atopic dermatitis (1 subject) and exfoliative dermatitis (1 subject). The safety profile of DUPIXENT + TCS through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 16. Asthma A total of 2888 adult and adolescent subjects with moderate-to-severe asthma (AS) were evaluated in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration (AS Trials 1, 2, and 3). Of these, 2678 had a history of 1 or more severe exacerbations in the year prior to enrollment despite regular use of medium- to high- dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) (AS Trials 1 and 2). A total of 210 subjects with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus up to two additional controllers were enrolled (AS Trial 3). The safety population (AS Trials 1 and 2) was 12-87 years of age, of which 63% were female, and 82% were white. DUPIXENT 200 mg or 300 mg was administered subcutaneously Q2W, following an initial dose of 400 mg or 600 mg, respectively. In AS Trials 1 and 2, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 4% of the placebo group, 3% of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group, and 6% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group. Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups in Asthma Trials 1 and 2. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in 1% of the DUPIXENT Groups in Asthma Trials 1 and 2 and Greater than Placebo (6-Month Safety Pool) a Injection site reactions cluster includes erythema, edema, pruritus, pain, and inflammation b Eosinophilia = blood eosinophils 3,000 cells/mcL, or deemed by the investigator to be an adverse event. None met the criteria for serious eosinophilic conditions [see Section 5.3 Warnings and Precautions] Injection site reactions were most common with the loading (initial) dose. The safety profile of DUPIXENT through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 24. Specific Adverse Reactions : Conjunctivitis During the 52-week treatment period of concomitant therapy trial (Trial 3), conjunctivitis was reported in 16% of the DUPIXENT + TCS group (20 per 100 subject-years) and in 9% of the placebo + TCS group (10 per 100 subject-years). Among asthma subjects, the frequency of conjunctivitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo [see (5.2)] The rate herpeticum was similar in the placebo and DUPIXENT groups in the atopic dermatitis trials. Herpes zoster was reported in <0.1% of DUPIXENT groups (<1 per 100 subject-years) and in <1% of the placebo group (1 per 100 subject-years) in the 16-week atopic 1% the DUPIXENT + TCS group (1 per 100 subject-years) and 2% of the placebo + TCS group (2 per 100 subject-years). Among asthma subjects the frequency of herpes zoster was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in <1% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects. These included serum sickness reaction, and anaphylaxis [see Contraindications (4), Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Eosinophils DUPIXENT-treated subjects had a greater initial increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count compared to subjects treated with placebo. In subjects with atopic dermatitis, the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 100 and 0 cells/mcL respectively.

The incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (500 cells/mcL) was similar in DUPIXENT and placebo groups. Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in <2% of DUPIXENT-treated patients and <0.5% in placebo- treated patients. Blood eosinophil counts declined to near baseline levels during study treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Cardiovascular (CV) In the 1-year placebo controlled trial in subjects with asthma (AS Trial 2), CV thromboembolic events (CV deaths, non-fatal myocardial were in 1 (0.2%) of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group, 4 (0.6%) of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group, and 2 (0.3%) of the placebo group. In the 1-year placebo controlled trial in subjects with atopic dermatitis (Trial 3), CV thromboembolic events (CV deaths, non-fatal MIs, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.9%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg Q2W group, 0 (0.0%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg QW group, and 1 (0.3%) of the placebo + TCS group. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to dupilumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Approximately 6% of subjects with atopic dermatitis or asthma who received DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; ~2% exhibited persistent ADA responses and ~2% had neutralizing antibodies. Approximately 9% of subjects with asthma who received DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; ~4% exhibited persistent ADA responses, and ~4% had neutralizing antibodies. Approximately 5% of subjects in the placebo groups in the 52-week studies were positive for antibodies to DUPIXENT; ~2% exhibited persistent ADA responses, and ~1% had neutralizing antibodies. The antibody titers detected in both DUPIXENT and placebo subjects were mostly low. In subjects who received DUPIXENT, development of high titer antibodies to dupilumab was associated lower serum dupilumab concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Two subjects who experienced high titer antibody responses developed serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions during DUPIXENT therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Live Vaccines Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with DUPIXENT. 7.2 Non-Live Vaccines Immune responses to vaccination were assessed in a study in which subjects with atopic dermatitis were treated once weekly for 16 weeks with 300 mg of dupilumab (twice the recommended dosing frequency). After 12 weeks of DUPIXENT administration, subjects were vaccinated with a Tdap vaccine (Adacel\u00ae) and a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Menomune\u00ae). to tetanus toxoid and serogroup C meningococcal polysaccharide were assessed 4 weeks later. Antibody responses to both tetanus vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were similar in dupilumab- treated and placebo-treated subjects. Immune responses to the other active components of the Adacel and Menomune vaccines were not assessed. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports and case series with DUPIXENT use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Human IgG antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, DUPIXENT may be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with asthma in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In an enhanced pre- and post- natal developmental study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring born to pregnant monkeys after subcutaneous administration of a homologous antibody against interleukin-4-receptor alpha (IL-4R) during organogenesis through parturition at doses up to 10-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-fetal Risk In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, evidence demonstrates that there is an increased risk of preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. The level of asthma control should be closely monitored in pregnant women and treatment adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal control. Data Animal Data In an enhanced pre- and post-natal development toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered weekly subcutaneous doses of homologous antibody against IL-4R up to 10 times the MRHD (on a mg/kg basis of 100 mg/kg/week) from the beginning of organogenesis to parturition. No treatment-related adverse effects on embryofetal toxicity or malformations, or on morphological, functional, or immunological development were observed in the infants from birth through 6 months of age. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of dupilumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal and limited systemic exposure to dupilumab on the breastfed infant are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for DUPIXENT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from DUPIXENT or from the underlying maternal condition.8.4 Pediatric Use Atopic Dermatitis Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients (<18 years of age) with atopic dermatitis have not been established. Asthma A total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with moderate to severe asthma were enrolled in AS Trial 2 and received either 200 mg (N=21) or 300 mg (N=18) DUPIXENT (or matching placebo either 200 mg [N=34] or 300 mg [N=34]) Q2W. Asthma exacerbations and lung function were assessed in both adolescents and adults. For both the 200 mg and 300 mg Q2W doses, improvements in FEV1 (LS mean change from baseline at Week 12) were observed (0.36 L and 0.27 L, respectively). For the 200 mg Q2W dose, subjects had a reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations that was consistent with adults. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients (<12 years of age) with asthma have not been established. Dupilumab exposure was higher in adolescent patients than that in adults at the respective dose level which was mainly accounted for by difference in body weight [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The adverse event profile in adolescents was generally similar to the adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1472 subjects with atopic dermatitis exposed to DUPIXENT in a dose-ranging study and placebo-controlled trials, 67 subjects were 65 years or older. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger subjects, the number of subjects aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Of the 1977 subjects with asthma exposed to DUPIXENT, a total of 240 subjects were 65 years or older. Efficacy and safety in this age group was similar to the overall study population. 10 OVERDOSE There is no specific treatment for DUPIXENT overdose. In the event of overdosage, monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and institute appropriate symptomatic treatment immediately. 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patients and/or caregivers to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use) before the patient starts using DUPIXENT and each time the prescription is renewed as there may be new information they need to know. Administration Instructions Provide proper training to patients and/or caregivers on proper subcutaneous injection technique, including aseptic technique, and the preparation and administration of DUPIXENT prior to use. Advise patients to follow sharps disposal recommendations. Hypersensitivity Advise patients to discontinue DUPIXENT and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of systemic hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Conjunctivitis and Keratitis Advise patients to consult their healthcare provider if new onset or worsening eye symptoms develop [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Eosinophilic Conditions Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they present with clinical features of eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Not for Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease Inform patients that DUPIXENT does not treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Inform patients to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with DUPIXENT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Reduction in Corticosteroid Dosage Inform patients to not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids except under the direct supervision of a physician. Inform patients that reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Asthma Advise atopic dermatitis patients with comorbid asthma not to adjust or stop their asthma treatment without talking to their physicians [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] .

The incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (500 cells/mcL) was similar in DUPIXENT and placebo groups. Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in <2% of DUPIXENT-treated patients and <0.5% in placebo- treated patients. Blood eosinophil counts declined to near baseline levels during study treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Cardiovascular (CV) In the 1-year placebo controlled trial in subjects with asthma (AS Trial 2), CV thromboembolic events (CV deaths, non-fatal myocardial were in 1 (0.2%) of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group, 4 (0.6%) of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group, and 2 (0.3%) of the placebo group. In the 1-year placebo controlled trial in subjects with atopic dermatitis (Trial 3), CV thromboembolic events (CV deaths, non-fatal MIs, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.9%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg Q2W group, 0 (0.0%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg QW group, and 1 (0.3%) of the placebo + TCS group. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to dupilumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Approximately 6% of subjects with atopic dermatitis or asthma who received DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; ~2% exhibited persistent ADA responses and ~2% had neutralizing antibodies. Approximately 9% of subjects with asthma who received DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; ~4% exhibited persistent ADA responses, and ~4% had neutralizing antibodies. Approximately 5% of subjects in the placebo groups in the 52-week studies were positive for antibodies to DUPIXENT; ~2% exhibited persistent ADA responses, and ~1% had neutralizing antibodies. The antibody titers detected in both DUPIXENT and placebo subjects were mostly low. In subjects who received DUPIXENT, development of high titer antibodies to dupilumab was associated lower serum dupilumab concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Two subjects who experienced high titer antibody responses developed serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions during DUPIXENT therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Live Vaccines Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with DUPIXENT. 7.2 Non-Live Vaccines Immune responses to vaccination were assessed in a study in which subjects with atopic dermatitis were treated once weekly for 16 weeks with 300 mg of dupilumab (twice the recommended dosing frequency). After 12 weeks of DUPIXENT administration, subjects were vaccinated with a Tdap vaccine (Adacel\u00ae) and a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Menomune\u00ae). to tetanus toxoid and serogroup C meningococcal polysaccharide were assessed 4 weeks later. Antibody responses to both tetanus vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were similar in dupilumab- treated and placebo-treated subjects. Immune responses to the other active components of the Adacel and Menomune vaccines were not assessed. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports and case series with DUPIXENT use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Human IgG antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, DUPIXENT may be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with asthma in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In an enhanced pre- and post- natal developmental study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring born to pregnant monkeys after subcutaneous administration of a homologous antibody against interleukin-4-receptor alpha (IL-4R) during organogenesis through parturition at doses up to 10-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.
