Attempts to classify subtypes of colorectal cancer 53 to develop treatment strategies has been attempted by Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) classification. 54 However , the cellular etiology of CMS classification is incompletely understood and controversial. Here, 55 we generated and analyzed a single -cell transcriptome atlas of 49,859 CRC cells from 16 patients, validated 56 with an additional 31,383 cells from an independen t CRC patient cohort. We describe subclonal 57 transcriptomic heterogeneity of CRC tumor epithelial cells, as well as discrete stromal populations of 58 cancer -associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Within CRC CAFs, we identify the transcriptional of 59 specific subtypes (CAF -S1 and CAF -S4) in more than 1,500 CRC patients using bulk transcriptomic data 60 that significantly stratifies overall survival in multiple independent cohorts . We also uncovered two CAF - 61 S1 subpopulations, ecm-myCAF and TGF\u00df -myCAF , known to be associated with primary resistance to 62 immunotherapies. We demonstrate that scRNA analysis of malignant, stromal, and immune cells exhibit a 63 more complex picture than portr ayed by bulk transcriptomic -based Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) 64 classification. By demonstrating an abundant degree of heterogeneity amongst these cell types, our work 65 shows that CRC is best represented in a transcriptomic continuum crossing tradition al classification systems 66 boundaries. Overall, this CRC cell map provides a framework to re -evaluate CRC tumor biology with 67 implications for clinical trial design and therapeutic development. 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 .

Approximately one-third of patients experience disease relapse following curative - 79 intent surgical resection and chemotherap y3. Despite the high incidence and mortality of advanced CRC, 80 few effective therapies have been approved in the past several decades4. One barrier to the development of 81 efficacious therapeutics is the biological heterogeneity of CRC and its variable clinical course. While 82 landmark studies from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have defined the somatic mutational landscape 83 within CRC, several studies have shown that stromal signatures, including fibroblasts and cytotoxic T cells, 84 are likely the main drivers of clinical outcomes5-9. These findings suggest that the clinical phenotypes of 85 CRC and by extension, its tumor biology is shaped by a complex niche of heterotypic cell interactions 86 within the tumor microenvironment (TME). 87 88 Bulk gene expression analyses by several independent groups have identified distinct CRC subtypes10-12. 89 Based on bulk transcriptomic signatures, a n international consortium published the Consensus Molecular 90 Subtypes (CMS) that classified CRC into CMS1 hymal) sub types12. Unfortunately, association s between CMS and meaningful 92 therapeutic response s to specific agents have been inconsistent across studies13-16. Further, there has been 93 a lack of concordance between primary and metastatic CRC tumors within the CMS framework , limiting 94 its overall utility in clinical decision making16-18. Thus, an improved CMS classification , or an alternative 95 classification system , is needed to improve clinical utility. 96 97 To overcome the limitations of bulk -RNA sequence profiling, we utilized single -cell RNA sequencing 98 (scRNA -seq) to more thoroughly evaluate the C RC subtypes at the molecular level, including within the 99 context of the currently defined CMS classification. We dissected heterotopic cell states of tumor epithelia 100 and stromal cells, including a cancer -associated fibroblast (CAF) population. The CAF population's clinical 101 .

Altogether, we captured and retained 49,589 high-quality 107 single cells after performing quality control for downstream analysis ( Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1 ). 108 All scRNA -seq data were merged and normalized to identify robust discrete clusters of epithelial cells 109 myeloid cell s (LYZ+ ) using canonical marker genes (Fig. 1 b-c). Additionally, each 111 cell type compartment was analyzed separately. Clust ree (v0.4.1 ) and manual review of differentially 112 expressed genes in each subcluster were studied to choose the best cluster resolution without cluster 113 destabilization (see methods)19. Cell population designation was chosen by specific gene expression, and 114 SingleR was also utiliz ed for unbiased cell type recognition (see methods)20-23. 115 116 In addition to cancer cells, we identified diverse TME cell phenotypes, including phenotypes ( na\u00efve, mem ory, germinal TAMs) ( Fig. 1d, Extended Data Figs. 1 -3, Extended Data Tables 1 -4)20-22,24. 123 124 We also profiled an independent CRC dataset for validation and retained 31 ,863 cells after quality control 125 and strict filtering of cells expressing hybrid markers25. The re -clustering of individual compartments 126 further refined our analysis, and cells that expressed hybrid or distinct lineage markers within a cluster were 127 .

Thus, a total of 128 81,242 high -quality cells were profiled to produce a single -cell map of 39 colorectal cancer patients. The 129 results of the primary CRC cohort (49,859 single -cells) are available at the Colon Cancer Atlas 130 (www.websiteinprogre ss.com ). 131 132 Malignant colon cancer reveals tumor epithelial cell subclonal heterogeneity and stochastic behavior. 133 We detected 8,965 tumor benign epithelial cells ( EPCAM+, KRT8+, and KRT18+ ) and, on re - 134 clustering, produced 17 epithelial clusters (designated C1 to C17) ( Fig. 2a -b). Tumor cells were confirmed 135 to be of malignant origin by inferring chromosomal copy number alterations ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). 136 Clusters were chiefly influenced by colonic epithelial markers, including those for CHGA ) (Supplementary Table 2 ). Tumor cells exhibited a high degree of 139 de-differentiated state of plasticity , possibly accounting for lasting cancer growth ( Supplementary Fig. 140 2b)26. Distinct tumor -derived cluster s were predominantly patient -specific, reflecting a hig h degree of inter - 141 patient tumoral cell heterogeneity (Fig. 1d). In contrast, epithelial populations derived from normal colon 142 tissue samples across multiple patients clustered together, a pattern observed in previous studies confirming 143 both normal tissue homeostasis and limited sample batch effects ( Fig. 1d)27,28. 144 145 We next aimed to identify gene expression programs shared across these clusters using hallmark pathway 146 analysis29. A strong overlap was observed for multiple pathways such as activation of inflammatory, 147 epithelial -mesenchymal tran sformation (EMT), immune response, and metabolic pathways ( Fig. 2 b). 148 Interestingly, high microsatellite instability (MSI -H) and microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC tumors, 149 considered clinically separate entities, demonstrated similar pathway program activation within the tumor 150 epithelial populations (Fig. 2b). Some clusters also showed activation of unique pathways such as activation 151 of apical junctions and angiogenesis (C6), hypoxia and fatty and Notch 152 .

However, MSI-H tumors differed from MSS tumors based 153 on immune cell infiltration (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). 154 155 Since intratumoral heterogeneity is recognized as a key mechanism contributing to drug resistance, cancer 156 progression, and recurrence, we next focused on dissecting potential transcriptomic states to identify 157 heterogeneity within each tumor30-32. We found that each tumor specimen contained 2 -10 distinct tumor 158 epithelial clusters ( Fig. 1d). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was performed on cells from individual 159 tumor samples and illustrated the sub -clonal transcriptomic heterogeneity within each specimen 160 (Supplementary Fig. 2c )33. Clusters identified in individual pathway analysis demonstrated the up - or 161 down -regulation of crucial metabolic and oncogenic pathways between samples, suggesting wide 162 phenotype variations between cells from the same tumor34. 163 164 Given the evidence of intratumoral epithelial heterogeneity, we next performed trajectory inference using 165 pseudotime analysis to identify potential alignments or lineage relationships (i.e., right versus left -sided 166 CRC), CMS classification, or MSI status35,36. This analysis also served as a control for inter -patient 167 genomic heterogeneity and provided an orthogonal strategy to confirm the transcriptomic trends we 168 identified. We detected five mol ecular states (S1n/t to S5n/t) with malignant and normal epithelial cells 169 intermixed and aligned along a common transcriptional trajectory (Fig. 2 c)37,38. In both normal and 170 tumor cells, each transcriptional state pathway activation was shared and related to colon epithelial 171 function of nutrient absorption, maintaining the colon homeostasis, and the ac tivation of cancer -related 172 pathways such as apoptosis and cell development39. However, these cell states showed differential gene 173 enrichment activation between normal and tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. 3 , Supplementary Table 174 3). 175 176 Additionally, tumor cells showed upregulation of embryogenesis (S2t), consistent with previous findi ngs 177 that tumor cells revert to their embryological states in cancer development ( Supplementary Table 3)40. 178 .

Hence, in our analysis, CRC oncogenesis represent the hijacking of the normal epithelial 181 differentiation pathways coupled with the acquisition of embryonic pathways37,40. 182 183 CRC -associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment exhibit diverse phenotypes, and specific 184 subtypes are associated with poor prognosis. 185 We next focused on CRC TME subpopulations. 819 high-quality fibroblasts were re -clustered into eight 186 clusters, and then phenotypically classified into two major subtypes to assess for further CAF heterogeneity. 187 These phenotypic subtypes were found to be 3 a-b, Supplementary Table 4 )41,42. This fibroblast cluster 189 dichotomy was also observed in the independent CRC patient scRNA -seq dataset of 31,383 cells 190 (Supplementary Fig. 5 )25. 191 192 The CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 subtypes showed striking resemblances to (extracellular matrix) and 193 vCAF (vascular) fibroblast subtypes, respectively, as previously described in a mouse breast cancer 194 model43. Most clusters were found in multiple patients, albeit in vary ing proportions, signifying shared 195 patterns in CAF transcriptomic programs between patients. Fibroblasts derived from MSI -H tumors were 196 distributed similarly throughout these clusters (Fig. 1d ). 197 198 CAF -S1 cells exhibited high chemokine such as CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL12, CXCL14, and 199 molecules including TNFRSF12A Table S4). Additionally, CAF -S1 200 cells expressed extracellular matrix genes including matrix -modifying enzymes ( LOXL1 and LOX)43. To 201 determine this population's functional significance, we compared the CAF -S1 population transcriptomes to 202 those described recently in breast cancer, lung cancer, and head and neck cancer44. We recovered five CAF - 203 S1 subtypes that included ecm-myCAF (extracellular; CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Among these f ive 207 subtypes, ecm-myCAF and TGF -myCAF are known to correlate with immunosuppressive environments 208 and are enriched in tumors with high regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) and depleted CD8+ lymphocytes. 209 Additionally, these subtypes associated with primary immunotherapy resistance in melanoma a nd lung 210 cancer44. 211 212 The CAF particular CAF subtype is vessel -associated, with hypoxia 214 potentially contributing to invasion and metastasis, as has been shown in another study (Fig. 3a -b, 215 Supplementary Table 4 )43. CAF -S4 clustered into t he immature phenotype ( RGS5+, and MYH11+ ) (Supplementary Table 4)42. 217 218 Given the correlation between CMS 4 and fibroblast infiltration, we next sought to test the existence of 219 CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 signatures in bulk transcriptomic data and their association with clinical outcomes12. 220 To this end, we interrogated and carried out a meta -analysis of eight colorectal cancer transcriptomic 221 datasets comprising 1,584 samples and confirmed the presence of CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 gene signatures in 222 CRC and other cancer types ( Fig. 4 a). We detected a strong and positive correlation between specific genes 223 differentially expressed between each CAF subtype in CRC (Fig. 4a -d)43. We also confirmed the presence 224 of CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 signatures in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=118) and -small cell lung cancer 225 (NSCLC, n=80) cohorts ( Fig. 4 a) (see methods for datasets). Gene signatures were specific to each CAF - 226 S1 and CAF -S4 in bulk transcriptomic datasets thus confirming their existence in TME of CRC and other 227 tumor types. 228 229 .

Additionally, 231 CAF signatures stratified the CMS4 subtype into high - and low -risk overall survival in all datasets, thus 232 identifyin g additional heterogeneity and providing prognostication in this aggressive patient subgroup ( Fig. 233 4b-d). Here, using scRNA -seq, we show for the first time that high CAF infiltration in CRC is associated 234 with poor prognosis across all molecular subtypes, and which further stratifies the CMS4 subgroup into 235 high and low -risk clinical phenotypes in CRC cohorts. 236 237 Single -cell RNA sequencing reveals heterogeneity beyond Consensus Molecular Subtypes in 238 colorectal cancers and offers therapeutic opportun ities. 239 The lack of association between tumor epithelia and CMS classification, as well as the survival differences 240 between high - and low -risk CAF signatures across CRC molecular subtypes suggest CRCs are less well 241 defined than the traditional classificat ion systems have indicated (e.g. those systems defined by somatic 242 alterations, epigenomic features, and bulk gene expression data)10-12,45,46. 243 244 To test our hypothesis, we estimated every cell type fraction using single -cell data in a discovery cohort 245 (GSE3985211, n=58 5) with a machine -learning algorithm, CIBERSORTx47. Cell type fractions were then 246 validated in two independent cohorts of 177 (GSE1753648) and 290 (GSE 1433349) tumors9. When we 247 compared epithelial, immune, and stromal cell populations among the CMS subtypes, we did not det ect a 248 distinct pattern of tumor, immune, or stromal cell abundance across the four subtypes (Fig. 5a-b, 249 Supplementary Figs. 7a-b, 8a-b). Although, we noted some trends in cell pattern enrichment amongst a 250 few cell types consistent with CMS classification (CAFs were enriched in CMS4; dendritic cells, monocytes 251 and TAMs were enriched in CMS1/CMS4; epithelial cells were enriched in CMS3) overall cellular 252 phenotypes were present in varying proportions withou t a clear distinction between the four subtypes. The 253 discovery and validation cohorts showed significant discordance in terms of cell phenotype enrichment 254 with respect to each CMS subtype (Fig. 5a -b, Supplementary Figs. .

The authors analyzed bulk transcriptomic data using a novel 261 computational framework in which denovo , unsupervised clustering methods -negative factorization, and consensus clustering) best classified CRC tumors in a transcriptomic continuum52-263 54. They further carried out principal component analysis and robustly validated two principal components, 264 PC Cluster Subtype Scores 1 and 2 (PCSS1 and PCSS2, respectively) . Using this framework, we reasoned 265 that single -cell data could elucidate the biological underpinnings of a CRC continuum model, and resolve 266 stromal confounding seen using bulk transcriptomes50,55. 267 268 We evaluated every cell fraction (epithelial, stromal, and immune components) using the Ma et al. 269 algorithm on our discovery and validation cohorts , focusing on the validated PCSS1 and PCSS2 . Upon 270 projecting bulk transcriptomes onto the four CMS quadrants , we analyzed single cell -specif ic gene 271 signatures after deconvolu tion. Intriguingly, we noted that each ce ll type not only projected in the 272 expected quadrant but some of these same cell types also projected on other CMS quadrants (Fig. 6a-b, 273 supplementary 9a-b, 10a -b, Supplementary table 5 -6). For example , epithelial cells, in addition to 274 projecting on CMS2/CMS3 quadrants , also projected on other CMS quadrants and exhibited continuum . 275 These data reflect significant intra -tumoral heterogeneity among all the cellular components that makeup 276 the tumor ecosystem . Thus , it appears that CRC exists in a transcriptomic continuum not only with 277 respect to the tumor cell s themselves but also all the other cell types that make up the TME. These aspects 278 would n ot have been apparent based on bulk transcriptomics analysis alone . 279 280 .

Our analysis show no reliability in classifying CRC 282 into immune -stromal rich (CMS1/CMS4) or immune -stromal desert (CMS2/CMS3) subtypes as proposed 283 previously16. Thus, confirming continuous scores rather than discrete subtypes may improve classifying 284 CRC tumors and may explain -to-tumor variability, tumor/TME -to-tumor/TME and TME -to-TME 285 variabilities within CMS subgroups as has been previously described 51. While CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 were 286 present across all CMS groups these CAFs exhibited high PCSS1 and PCSS2 scores correlating with 287 increased enrichment in the CMS4 group . Thus, our analysis identified CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 as the cells 288 of origin for biological heterogeneity in CMS4 subtypes associated with poor prognosis (Supplementary 289 table 5 -6). 290 291 DISCUSSION 292 In the present study, we evaluated the CMS classification system of CRC that has been established using 293 bulk RNA -seq through the lens of single -cell transcriptomics. We identified significant intratumoral 294 transcriptomic heterogeneity of cell states within tumor epithelial cells. These findings are consistent with 295 a prior DNA -based multi -omics approach by Sottoriva et al. which proposed a 'big bang model' of 296 CRC56. This model su ggests that at initiation, CRC is composed of a mixture of subclones, underscoring 297 the significant heterogeneity inherent in CRC biology and potentially reflecting non -linear pathways 298 during CRC evolution and progression. Furthermore, both our findings (using s cRNA -seq and 299 pseudotime trajectory analysis) and Sottoriva et al. agree with clinical observations that tumors with 300 diverse clonal populations respond unpredictably to monolithic treatment strategies \"targeted\" to average 301 expression profiles based on bulk sequencing. Thus, targeting sub -clonal transcriptomic patt erns is likely 302 to be more effective when designing personalized CRC therapies 56 57. Interestingly, a recent study in 303 gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) that employed therapies to target dominant sub -clonal 304 populations in metastatic GEA patients demonstrated improved survival as compared to standard 305 monolithic treatment strategies58. 306 .

These recent studies employing bulk transcriptomic s demonstrated that the degree of 310 stromal infiltration is associated with prognosis , while a small scRNAseq study utilizing 26 fibroblasts 311 showed poor survival particularly among the CMS4 s ubtype CAF -enriched CRC tumors61. By using a much 312 larger sample set of 1,182 high -quality fibroblasts, our current work identif ies the CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 313 subtype s to be the cell s of origin associated with poor prognosis across all CRC patients and not just those 314 with CMS4 classified tumors61. CAF signatures are able to stratify patients by median overall survival (Fig. 315 4b-d). These findings are significant since the CMS4 subtype, is primarily stromal -driven and is enriched 316 in more than 40% of metastatic CRC samples from patients with worse outcomes17,18. Thus, targeting CAFs 317 to remodel the tumor microenvironment may lead to improved and much -needed therapeutic development 318 for metastatic CRC patients17,18. 319 320 Targeting of CAFs in solid tumors is being explored in multiple clinical trials with variable results62,63. Such 321 studies likely failed to address CAF heterogeneity and their complex interactions with the other cells of 322 TME. Our study suggests that CRC may be intricately entwined with the stroma, and therefore may be 323 amenable to stromal targeted combinatoric approaches, including monoclonal antibodies that abrogate 324 CAF -S1 function. In future studies, the treatment of CRC patient s should involve stroma targeted therapies 325 and take the above aspects into consideration63,64. The scRNA -seq or bulk -RNA -seq signature s 326 corresponding to CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 may serve as suitable biomarkers for tumors that are reliant on this 327 axis. 328 329 Immunotherapy responses in MSS CRC, which comprise almost 95% of CRC, are lacking65; 330 CAF subpopulations within the TME may be suppressing immune responses in these tumors . Based on our 331 analysis we speculate that targeting ecm-myCAF and TGF -myCAF subtypes (responsible International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Functional validation and clinical 334 studies will be required to confirm the clinical utility of targeting these CAF populations in CRC. 335 336 More importantly, our study's single -cell resolution enables us to investigate whether tumor cell 337 transcriptomes, and by extension, biological phenotypes, are the primary determinant of CMS 338 classification. Based on our findings, it appears that bulk analysis may have been confounded by varying 339 degrees of tumor microenvironment population enrichment, and that tumor cells within each patient do not 340 segregate into static phenotypes but rather exhibit considerable plasticity. Our single -cell analysis 341 uncovered complex and mixed cellular phenotypes among each cell -specific subpopulation, which 342 projected in a transcriptomic continuum across the CMS groups .These findings were further supported by 343 our scRNA -seq CMS classification analysis that assigned each CRC sample to multiple CMS groups , 344 thereby suggesting CMS heterogeneity within each CRC tumor ( Fig. 1d, Supplementary Table 1)16,66. 345 These findings may also explain why CMS -defined populations of tumors have not been readily observed 346 in transcriptomic data from independent CRC cohorts9,17. Our results suggest that attempts to divide CRC 347 phenotypes into the current discrete subtypes may un dermine optimal patient stratification in the clinical 348 trial setting9. The only prospective study to date that utilized the CMS classification (specifically the CMS4 349 subtype ) for patient selection based on dual PD-L1/TGF -\u00df expression signature s was halted due to futility , 350 suggesting CMS classification may adversely impact clinical trial design67. 351 352 Previous studies relying on bulk transcriptomics had concerns that stromal content may conceal subtle 353 critical gene signals originating from other key cellular phenotypes within the CRC spectrum, and thus 354 affect CRC classification8,9,50. Our extensive single -cell analysis allowed for detailed evaluation of all 355 cellular subtypes of CRC simultaneously , thereby uncovering contributions of the different components 356 making up the complex cellular milieu within the CMS classification schema.

These data contribute to the conceptual advances in 363 understanding CRC pathogenesis, clinical management, a nd therapeutic development. We suggest 364 revisiting CMS -like classifications that define CRCs into distinct static subtypes while , in reality CRC 365 tumors exist in a continuum. We caution in using CMS to stratify patients for drug development and 366 clinical trial design. Future studies should concentrate on developing biomarkers (such as CAF's ) and 367 therapeutic agents that can stratify CRC patients beyond traditional classification system boundaries. 368 Ultimately, newer single -cell multiomic technologies will allow us to detect transcriptomes, proteomes, epigenomes and metabolomes in real-time at the single -cell resolution to 370 better guide more individualized and improved therapies. 371 372 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 373 This study was supported by the startup fund provided to A.M. by the Rush University Medical Center; the 374 OCM grant to A.M by Rush University Cancer Center.

Patients with resectable untreated CRC who underwent 753 curative colon resection at Rush University Medical Center (Chicago, IL, USA ) were included in 754 this Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved study. CRC specimens from 16 patients including 755 nine Caucasian, six African American and one Asian patient with corresponding 8 adjacent normal 756 tissue samples were processed immediately afte r collection at Rush University Medical Center 757 Biorepository and sent for scRNA -seq. Thus, our scRNA -seq atlas represent diverse patient 758 population. The study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards and all patients provided 759 written informed co nsent. 760 761 Droplet based scRNA -seq - 10\u00d7 762 -seq) was performed using 10X Genomics Single Cell 5' Platform. Tumors and samples were enzymatically dissociated ( pelleted after centrifugation at 300 in DAPI -FACS buffer (PBS, 0.04% BSA). 765 Samples were sorted and viable singlets were gated on the basis of scatter properties and DAPI 766 exclusion. Approxima tely 3000 cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS, and cells underwent 767 single cell droplet -based capture on 10X Chromium instruments according to the 10X Genomics 768 Single Cell 5' Platform protocol. Transcriptome libraries end -repair, and A - 769 tailing double -sided size selection, and subsequent adaptor ligation also followed the 770 manufacturer's protocol. Illumina NextSeq 550 was used for library sequencing and data were 771 mapped gene -expression quantification, dimensionality reduction, and 774 identification of cell clusters. Cell Ranger was utilized to process the raw gene expression matrices 775 per samples and all samples from multiple patients were combined in R p ackage (v3.6.3 2020 -02- 776 29] -- \"Holding the was used in this integrative multimodal 777 analysis68. Genes detected in fewer than three cells and cells expressing less than 200 detected 778 genes were filtered out and excluded from analysis. In addition, cells expressing > 25% 779 mitochondria were removed. Cell cycle scoring was performed, (for the S phase and the G2M 780 phase) and the predicted cell cycle phases were calculated. Doublet detection and any higher -order 781 multiplets that were not dissociated during sample preparation were removed via the 782 DoubletFinder (v2.0.2) package using default settings69. Following quality control one normal 783 colon sample (B -cac13) was discarded due to poor data quality. Finally, 49,859 cells remained and 784 were uti lized for downstream analysis. 785 786 We adopted the general protocol described in Stuart et al. (2019) to group single cells into different 787 cell subsets68. We employed the following steps: clustering the cells within each compartment 788 (including the selection of variable g enes for each dataset based on a variance stabilizing 789 transformation [VST]), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to remove batch effects among the 790 samples, reduction of dimensionality, and projection of cells onto graphs 70,71. Principal component 791 analysis (PCA) was carried out on the scaled data of highly variable genes72. The first 30 principal 792 components (PCs) were used to cluster the cells a nd to perform a subtype analysis by nonlinear 793 dimensionality reduction (t -SNE) and to construct Uniform Manifold Approximation and 794 Projection (UMAP) for cell embeddings73,74. We identified cell clusters under the optimal 795 resolution by a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity optimization -based clustering method. 796 We implemented the FindClusters function of the Seurat package, which first calculated k-nearest 797 neighbors and constructed the SNN graph. We implemented the origi nal Louvain algorithm 798 (algorithm = 1) for modularity optimization. Additionally, we utilized Clustree (v0.4.3) and manual 799 review for identifying the best clustering resolution19. 800 801 .

To identify all major cell types, we evaluated 802 differentially expressed markers in each identity cell group by comparing them to other clusters 803 using the Seurat FindAllMarkers function. We used positively expressed genes with an average 804 expression of >/= 2 -fold higher in that subcluster than the average expression in the rest of the other 805 subclusters. We used known marker genes, which have the highest fold express ion in that cluster 806 with respect to the other clusters. We also utilized SingleR ((v0.99.10, R Package), which leverage 807 large transcriptomic datasets of well -annotated cell types and manual annotation for cell -type 808 identification27,75 -77. Depending on the presence of known marker genes the clusters were grouped 809 as: epithelial 27,39,43,75,78 -81. The cells were eventually 812 assembled into DGE matrices within each compartment, containing all six cell types. 813 814 Major -cell type subclustering and data visualization. Each major cell type, including epithelial 815 cells, endothelial cells, T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, and fibroblasts was reclustered and 816 reanalyzed to study each compartment at a higher resolution to detect granular cellular 817 heterogeneity in CRC. Clustree (v0.4. 3) and manual review were utilized for optimal cluster 818 detection. For cell annotation of each cell type, we utilized published literature gene expression 819 signatures and manual review of differential genes among clusters. Additionally, we again utilized 820 SingleR (v0.99.10, R Package) for unbiased cell annotation. Interestingly, reclustering of major 821 compartments individually also detected clusters expressing hybrid markers as well as cell clusters 822 expressing markers from distinct lineages (such as T cell clus ters expressing B cells); these were 823 removed and excluded for further analysis. We utilized UMAP for visualization purposes. For 824 validation, we analyzed 65,362 cells from 23 patients and applied the similar quality control metrics 825 as outlined above . In add ition, we also applied vars.to.regress function to remove low quality cells 826 in an unbiased manner. We retain ed 31,383 high -quality single cells for further analysis25. These 827 high-quality cells were analyzed utilizing the same pipelines and parameters as that for our primary 828 cohort ( Supplementar y Figs. 4 -5 and 11-12). 829 830 The InferCNV (v1.2.1) package was used with default paramets to identify the evidence for 831 somatic large -scale chromosomal copy number alteration in epithelial cells ( EPCAM+, KRT8+, 832 KRT18+ )82. Normal epithelial cells were used as the control group. 833 834 Trajectory analysis. We used Monocle v.2 (v2.14. 0), a reverse graph embedding method to 835 reconstruct single -cell trajectories in tumor and normal epithelium83. In brief, we used UMI count 836 matrices and the negbinomial.size () parameter to create a CellDataSet object in the default setting. 837 We grouped p rojected cells on UMAP in default settings for visualization of monocle results. We 838 defined the cumulative duration of the trajectory to show the average amount of transcriptional 839 transition that a cell undergoes as it passes from the starting state to the end state. The cells were 840 also ordered in pseudotime to explain the transition of cells from one state to another. 841 842 Pathway - Gene set variation analysis (GSVA). Pathway analysis was performed on the 50 843 hallmark gene sets downloaded from Molecular Signatur es Database (v7.2) . We used GSVA 844 (v1.34.0), a non -parametric, unsupervised method to estimate the gene set variations and 845 evaluation of pathway enrichment, and pathway scores were calculated for each cell using standard 846 settings 29,33. 847 848 DNA and bulk RNA library construction. DNA and bulk RNA sequencing was performed as 849 previously described84. One hundred nanograms of DNA from each tumor was mechanically 850 sheared to an average size of 200 bp. Using the KAPA Hyper Prep Pack , DNA libraries were 851 packed, hybridized into the xT probe package, and amplified the KAPA HiFi HotS tart 852 .

For uniformity, each sample needed to have 95% of all targeted base pairs sequenced 853 to a minimum depth of 300x. One hundred nanograms of RNA per tumor sample was heat 854 fragmented to a mean size of 200 base pairs in the presence of magnesium. Using random primers, 855 the RNA was used for first -strand cDNA synthesis, followed by second -strand synthesis and A - 856 tailing, adapter ligation, bead -based cleanup, and amplification of the library. After library 857 planning, the IDT xGEN Exome Test Panel was hyb ridized with samples. Streptavidin -coated beads 858 and target recovery were carried out, accompanied by amplification using the KAPA HiFi library 859 amplification package. The RNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 using 860 patterned flow cell techn ology to achieve at least 50 million reads. 861 862 Detection of somatic variation on DNA sequencing data. The tumor and normal FASTQ files 863 were paired. For quality management measurement, FASTQ files were evaluated using FASTQC 864 and matched with Novoalign (Novocr aft, Inc.)84,85. SAM files were generated and c onverted to 865 BAM files. The BAM files were sorted, and duplicates were marked. Single nucleotide variations 866 (SNVs) were called after alignment and sorting. For discovery of copy number alterations, the de - 867 duplicated BAM files and the VCF generated from the variant calling pipeline were processed to 868 computate read depth and variance of heterozygous germline SNVs between the tumor sample and 869 normal sample. Binary circular segmentation was introduced and segments with strongly 870 differential log 2 ratios between t he tumor and its comparator were chosen. From a combination of 871 differential coverage in segmented regions and estimation of stromal admixture provided by 872 analysis of heterozygous germline SNVs, an estimated integer copy number was determined 873 874 Microsatellite instability status. Probes for 43 microsatellite regions were developed using Tempus 875 xT assay84. Tumors were categorized into three groups by the MSI classification algorithm as 876 described by Tempus: microsatellite microsatellite stable (MSS) or 877 microsatellite equivocal (MSE). MSI screening for paired tumor -normal patients used reads 878 mapped to the microsatellite loci with at least 5 bps flanking the microsatellite. The sample was 879 graded as MSI -H if there was a >70% chance of MSI -H classification. If the likelihood of MSI -H 880 status was 30 -70%, the test f indings were too ambiguous to interpret and those samples were listed 881 as MSE. If there was a <30% chance of MSI -H status, the sample was called MSS. Additionally, 882 IHC results were used to classify tumors into MSS or MSI molecular subtypes. Both of these 883 modalities were concordant and produced the same results. 884 885 Bulk transcriptomics analysis. We downloaded and pooled eight colorectal dataset (GSE6216590) and a non -small cell 888 lung cancer dataset (GSE3353291) to validate our findings from the single cell compartments by 889 deconvoluting the bulk gene expression profiles into pseudo single -cell re solutions. We used Affy 890 (v1.64.0) for the data analysis and for exploration of Affymetrix oligonucleotide array probe level 891 data92. Batch correction was carried out using the removeBatchEffect (v3.42.2) function of the 892 LIMMA program and CMScaller for the CMS classification (see below)93. Three datasets 893 (GSE1753649, GSE3311388, and GSE3958211) were utilized for clinical outcome analysis93,94. 894 895 Correlation patterns in bulk gene expressions for CAF compartments. To identify the top 896 correlated CAF -marker genes within the combined eight CRC datasets, three bulk CRC gene 897 expression sets individually, pancreas cancer and lung cancer datasets. We first transformed the 898 bulk gene expression sets with log 2 transformation. Next, marker genes with an average log 2 FC>/= 899 0.5 and p<0.05 obtai ned from the single cell data of CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 compartments were 900 separately intersected with the bulk gene expression sets. Genes with an average Spearman 901 correlation score greater than 0.8 were kept as the CAF signatures within the bulk gene expressio n. 902 Heatmaps illustrating the correlation patterns within and between the CAF compartments were 903 .

Heatmaps illustrating the correlation patterns w ithin and between the CAF 905 compartments were prepared using the ggplot package (v3.1.1) utilizing the Pearson correlation 906 coefficient95. 907 908 The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to examine the significance of 20 cell 909 types from scRNA -seq in bulk expression data. Each cell type's marker genes with an average 910 logFC>1 and adjusted P<0.05 were intersected with the bulk expression datasets separately. We 911 only kept the marker genes with a high correl ation with each other in bulk, which provides an 912 average correlation score of > 0.8. The average bulk expression of each cell type's remaining marker 913 genes was calculated and used in the hazard regression model as the representative of this cell type. 914 For analysis of relationships with patient outcome, univariate models were calculated using Cox 915 proportional hazard regression (coxph function from survival R package)96. 916 917 Deconvoluting public bulk gene expression profiles into pseudo single -cell expressions. We used 918 CIBERSORTx v1 to estimate composition of various cell populations in GSE3958211, 919 GSE1433348, and GSE1753649 datasets47. Signature gene matr ices were created using the 920 expression profiles of 49,859 cells as the reference single cell profile. We ran the 'hires' module 921 with default parameters except for the 'rmbatchBmode,' and the bulk -mode batch correction 922 argument was set to true. After the de convolution process, we normalized the gene expressions 923 according to the cell fractions in each sample and calculated each gene's Z -transformed expression 924 values. The average normalized expression of each cell type across all samples was plotted with 925 the h eatmap.3 R function of the GMD package (v0.3.3)97. A signature matrix highlighting marker 926 genes of the different cell types was prepared with a heatmap.2 R function of gg plot (v3.1.1). 927 928 Consensus molecular subtyping of colorectal cancer (CMS Classification). We used R package 929 CMScaller(v0.9.2), a nearest template prediction (NTP) algorithm, for the classification of gene 930 expression datasets94. We set the permutation number to 1000 to predict the CMS classes of the 931 samples in the GEO datasets with a p -value < 0.05. We ran CMScaller with default parameters. 932 933 Continuous subtype discovery using scRNA -seq analysis. Bulk mRNA exp ression profiles of the 934 GEO dataset (GSE3958211), composed of 585 samples in total, were deconvoluted into the pseudo 935 single -cell expression profiles via CIBERSORTx utilizing the expression data consisting of 20 936 different well known cell types from our scRNA -seq dataset47. We transformed the deconvoluted 937 expression matrix with log2 transformation. The principal components cluster subtype scores 938 (PCSSs) of the CMS among the samples, were determined separately for each cell type using an 939 algorithm published by Ma et al51. To obtain the PCSSs, the average loading vectors were used. 940 The results obtained for 20 cell types were projected on the first two PCSSs (PCSS1 and PCSS2) 941 as they were validated by Ma et al. in their analysis using 18 datasets. We also analyzed tw o datasets 942 (GSE1433348, GSE1753649) to independently confirm reproducibility of continuous scores. 943 944 Statistics and reproducibility. All statistical analyses and graphs were created in R (v3.6.3) and 945 using a Python -based computational analysis tool. Schematic representations were made using the 946 Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/) software. Dim plots, bar plots and box plots were generated using 947 the dittoSeq (v1.1.7) package with default parameters98. Violin plots were generated using the 948 patchwork (v1.1.0) package and ggplot2 (v3.3.2) package in R with default paramet ers. Heatmaps 949 were generated using Morpheus.R with default parameters99,100. ANOVA and pair -wised t -tests for 950 the CMS classes across the deconvoluted expression profiles were performed in R using the ggpubr 951 R (v0.4.0) package101. The Box and Whisker plots were generated using the boxplot function of the 952 R base package at default parameters. The mean of the log 2 transfor med deconvoluted expression 953 value of the samples in each CMS group was demonstrated with a horizontal straight line within 954 .

The length of a boxplot corresponds to the interquartile range (IQR), which is defined as 955 the range between the first and t hird quartiles (Q1 and Q3), whereas the whiskers are the upper and 956 lower extreme values of the data (either data's extremum values, or the Q3+1.5*IQR and Q1 - 957 1.5*IQR values, whichever was less extreme). To test for differential score based on CIBERSORTx 958 cell abundances between different molecular subtypes pairwise t -test with Benjamini -Hochberg 959 correction was used. 960 961 Survival analysis. Survival curves were obtained according to the Kaplan -Meier method survfit 962 (v3.2 -7), and differences between survival distrib utions were assessed by Log -rank test. The 963 patients were divided into two groups (high/poor and low/good risk) according to their median 964 expression values (survminer (v0.4.8)). The surv_cutpoint function uses the maximally selected 965 rank statistics and impl ements standard methods for the approximation of the null distribution of 966 maximally selected rank statistics (maxstat (v0.7 -25)). 967 968 The proportional hazard assumption was tested to examine the fit of the model for survival of the 969 samples in three GEO datase ts (GSE1753649, GSE3311388, and GSE3958211) with respect to the 970 deconvoluted bulk mRNA expressions. For analysis of the relationships with patient outcome, 971 multivariate models were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard regression (coxph survival 972 R package)96. 973 974 .

Description: We reclustered and analyzed 22,525 cells from both tumors and adjacent, normal tissue samples and identified 11 CD4+ T cell and 12 CD8+ T cell clusters. We used known canonical markers .

We identified conventional CD4+ T cells, CD4+ Tregs, CD8+ (naive/memory, cytotoxic, and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Among the conventional CD4+ T cells, we identified t he central memory/naive like state (CCR7+, SELL+, and TCF7+) enriched in non -malignant samples. In contrast, Th17 cells expressing IL -17, known as critical anti -tumor effectors, were enriched in tumor samples. CD4+ Tregs (FOXP3+) expressing immune checkpoin t markers and costimulatory molecules were among the most abundant T cells in the colorectal TME compared to non -malignant tissue. Among the CD8+ T cell states, CD8+ cytotoxic cells were distributed across three clusters that we labeled CD8+ effector 1, CD 8+ effector effector clusters expressed cytotoxicity genes and chemokines as previously described in other tumor types. CD8 effector3 was predominantly enriched in MSI -H CRC patients and represented 77% of the total CD8+ effect or 3 population among the 2 MSI -H CRC samples. This cluster expressed ITGAE, LAYN, CXCL13, and T cell exhaustion markers (LAG3, HAVCR2, and CD96), possibly explaining this CD8+ cell state 's role in the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in MSI -H colorectal tumors. Gene -set enrichment of CD8+ effectors further confirmed their distinct states. CD8+ effector 2 was a proliferative cluster with MYC activation, and EF2 targets. CD8+ effector(s), CD8+ MAIT cells, and NK cells were enriched in tumors, whereas Tissue -resident memory (Trm) cells were depleted in tumor tissue. Trm induction was recently seen to enhance cancer vaccine efficacy in other tumors, suggesting a possible therapeuti c target in CRC. .

Description: To illustrate characteristics of B cells in CRC we reclustered 9,289 B cells that clearly identified naive cells, memory cells, plasma cells, and germinal center (G C) B cells. All B cell subtypes from the CRC TME and the non -malignant colonic tissue clustered together exhibiting transcriptional similarity among non -tumor and tumor -derived cells. Memory B cells and plasma cells were enriched in tumors, while naive and GC B cells were enriched in nonmalignant tissue. .
