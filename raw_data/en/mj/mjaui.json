Advisers from these countries were posted throughout thesecurity ministries, where their presence, access, andinfluence ironically became asecurity problem fortheAngolan government.

Historical andcompara- tivepatterns suggest thatcrimes against property increased with urban growth andthatjuveniles accounted formost oftheincrease. Available evidence, although fragmentary, indicated thatthe crime ratewas rising. Smuggling, particularly ofdiamonds and timber, wasfrequently reported asamajor criminal offense, occa- sionally involving senior government andparty officials.
