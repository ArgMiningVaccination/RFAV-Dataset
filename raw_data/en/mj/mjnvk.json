There are two examples of attempts to use the HPV virus-like particle vaccine strategy to improve the immune response to antigens from other pathogens; fusion of chlamydial MOMP to the HPV vaccine,[ [148](javascript:void(0);)] protein to vaccine.[ [149](javascript:void(0);)] Additionally, V. cholerae ghosts expressing Chlamydia subunit vaccine antigens have been tested in animal models as a means of harnessing the adjuvant properties of the cholera toxin.[ [150](javascript:void(0);), [151](javascript:void(0);)] In a similar strategy Igietseme expressed the MOMP of C. trachomatis in an attenuated strain of the influenza virus.[ [94](javascript:void(0);)] Following intranasal immunization with the recombinant virus mice were partially protected against genital challenge with Chlamydia. This approach to 'piggy back' on approved successful vaccines could represent a fast and effective step forward for the field and we look forward to the outcomes from these and similar studies. These elegant adaptations of existing efficacious (and clinically approved) adjuvants or delivery systems will likely increase the progress of vaccine development for two reasons. First, these available systems have already passed toxicity and safety trials in humans. Second, these systems may provide a means of increased efficacy due to proven effective adjuvant properties. The abundance of genome sequencing data is going to have a positive impact on the vaccine field, in fact genome-mining approaches have already been used successfully in the detection of vaccine antigens for N. meningitidis.[ [152](javascript:void(0);)] This has also enabled in silico approaches to identify vaccine antigens, such as a recent study from our own team, which identified several novel chlamydial antigens.[ [153](javascript:void(0);)] The opportunities for improved vaccine design from these genome sequencing advances appear immense, for example, direct evidence of the level of conservation of any potential antigen across serovars and the ability to apply rational design and in silico approaches previously not available to identify new candidates. Given that the agents involved in RTI discussed in this review (particularly Chlamydia and Neisseria) have been the target of failed attempts to develop a vaccine using the traditional means the potential impact of these emerging methods is important to highlight.
