It was re-named as Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy with acronym as AYUSH in November, 2003. In keeping with the policy of the Government to lay focused thrust on the Indian Traditional Systems of Medicine, the Department of AYUSH was granted the status of Ministry with effect from 09.11.2014. The Ministry is responsible for policy formulation, development and implementation of programmes for the growth, development and propagation of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) systems of Health Care. s owa Rigpa is the recent addition to the existing family of AYUSH systems. 1.2 v ision and Mission of the Ministry:- The Vision of the Ministry is to position AYUSH systems as the preferred systems of living and practice for attaining a healthy India. The Ministry has identified its Mission in terms of seven broad thematic areas of AYUSH activities. The thematic areas are as follows: (i) effective human Resource development:- To ensure availability of quality education and training to AYUSH Doctors/Scientists/Teachers; To ensure availability of quality paramedical, pharmacy and nursing education and training in AYUSH; To provide opportunity for quality AYUSH education throughout the country; To empower AYUSH professionals with improved skills and attitudes; and To promote capacity building of Institutions, Centres of Excellence (COE), National Institutes etc. (ii) provision of Quality A yush s ervices:- Delivery of Quality AYUSH health care services to entire population; AYUSH to be an integral part of the health delivery system through mainstreaming of AYUSH; To ensure healthy population through AYUSH interventions; To ensure creation of enabling uniform legal framework for AYUSH practices and therapies; and Utilization of trained AYUSH doctors at all levels of Health Care services. (iii) information, e ducation and Communication:- To propagate and promote AYUSH within the country; To strive for global acceptance of AYUSH formulations; To disseminate AYUSH practices and therapies for better health; and To encourage behavioural change through communication for better health. (iv) Quality Research in A yush:- To promote quality research in AYUSH with the objective of validating the systems scientifically, and evaluation of AYUSH remedies from the angle of safety and efficacy; To encourage research for validation of fundamental principles of AYUSH Systems; To encourage development of new drugs for high priority diseases of national importance; To preserve through documentation of local health traditions and folklore for their utilization for new drug development;Chapter 1 BACK gRound of the MinistR y4 | Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 Ministry Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in AYUSH systems; and To encourage research in preventive an d promotive health through AYUSH. (v) growth of the Medicinal plants s ector:- To ensure sustained availability of quality raw material from medicinal plants; To ensure conservation of medicinal plants; and Capacity building in medicinal plants sector. (vi) drug Administration:- To accelerate the Pharmacopoeial/ standardization work on AYUSH drugs; To ensure availability of high quality AYUSH drugs; To ensure enabling legal framework for production and distribution of safe and quality AYUSH drugs; To strengthen regulatory infrastructure in Central and State Governments; and To encourage AYUSH drug industry to produce high quality AYUSH medicines for national and international needs. (vii) international exchange p rogramme/s eminars/Workshops on A yush:- To propagate and promote AYUSH systems outside the country and to ensure their global acceptance as systems of medicine; To collaborate with International bodies e.g. World Health Organisation for cross disciplinary standardization, global recognition and propagation of AYUSH systems; Global legal recognition of qualifications and practice of AYUSH; To promote collaborative research and education in AYUSH with other countries; and Protection of Traditional Knowledge. 1.3. National Health Policy, 1983 observed that the country has a large stock of health manpower comprising private practitioners in various systems. This resource has not so far been adequately utilized. The practitioners of AYUSH systems enjoy high local acceptance and respect and consequently exert considerable influence on health beliefs and practices. It is, therefore, necessary to initiate organized measures to enable each of these systems of medicine and health care to develop in accordance with their strengths. Simultaneously, planned efforts should be made to dovetail the functioning of the practitioners and integrate their service, at the appropriate levels, within specified areas of responsibility and functioning, in the over-all health care delivery system, especially with regard to the preventive, promotive and public health objectives. Well-considered steps would also be required to be taken to move towards a meaningful phased integration of the indigenous and the modern systems. The significance of the Alternative Systems of Medicine was further emphasized in the National Health Policy, 2002, which stated that Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy have a substantial role because of the inherent advantages, such as diversity, modest cost, low level of technological input and the growing popularity of natural plant based products, especially in the under-served, remote and tribal areas. The Policy also envisaged the consolidation of documentary knowledge contained in these systems to protect it against attack from foreign commercial entities by way of malafide action under the Patent laws in other countries. National Health Policy, 2017 has also envisaged the integration of the Ayush system in the NHP and contribution in larger aspect including the Non- Communicable Diseases. 1.4 The National Policy on Indian Systems of Medicine & Homoeopathy, 2002 enunciated following as its objectives:Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 | 5 Ministry of Ayurved A, hoMeop Athy Ayush(1) To promote good health and expand the outreach of health care to our people, particularly those not provided with health cover, through preventive, promotive, mitigating and curative intervention through ISM&H;

AYUSH is an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha & Sowa Rigpa, and Homoeopathy. Ayurveda is the oldest system with documented history of its practice since more than 5000 years whereas Homoeopathy is in practice in India for around 100 years. These systems are being practised in the country with diverse preferences of people and infrastructural facilities. Ayurveda is more prevalent in the States of Unani System is largely prevalent in Andhra Gujarat and the Siddha system is practised in Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry and Kerala. Recently recognized Sowa Rigpa system of medicine is prevalent in Himalayan regions including Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. Besides, there are a few educational institutes of Sowa Rigpa in UP and Karnataka also. AYUSH services in the country as a whole are provided by public, private and voluntary sector organizations and the range of their distribution varies from State to State. 2.2 A yuR ved A systeM 2.2.1 'Ayurveda' literally means \"Science of Life\" . Ayurveda is evolved from the various Vedic hymns rooted in the fundamental philosophies about life, disease and health.The Charak Samhita and Sushruta Samhita, developed around 2500 BC, are the main treatises of Ayurveda fully available today. Accordingto Ayurveda, health is considered a pre-requisite for achieving the goals of life i.e.,Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. Ayurveda takes an integrated view of the physical, mental, spiritual and social aspects of human beings and about the interrelationships among these aspects. 2.2.2 The philosophy of Ayurveda is based on the theory of Panchmahabhutas (five Primordial elements), which postulate that all objects and living bodies are composed of five elements Aakasha, Vayu, Agni, Jala and Prithvi. The combinations of these five elements are represented in the form of Tridoshas viz. Vata (Ether+ Air), Pitta These three `Doshas' are physiological entities in living beings, whereas Satva, Rajas and Tamas are the mental attributes. The structural entities of the human body are the matrix of Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa, Meda, Asthi, Majja and Shukra. Ayurveda aims to keep these structural and functional entities in a state of equilibrium which signify good health (Swasthya). Any imbalance due to internal or external factors causes disease and the treatment consists of restoring the equilibrium through various interventions including therapeutic procedures, regimens, medicines and lifestyle management. 2.2.3 Ayurveda considers the human being a microcosm (Yatha pinde tatha brahmande) which is a replica of the macrocosm (Universe).The treatment in Ayurveda is holistic and individualized. The preventive aspect of Ayurveda is called Svastha-Vritta and it includes personal hygiene, regular daily routine, appropriate social behavior and use of Rasayana.The curative aspect consists of three major categories (i) Aushadhi Chapter 2 Ayush systeMs8 | Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 procedures including Panchakarma and Surgery and (iii) Satvavajaya (Methods for Mind control). 2.2.4 Practice of Ayurveda as a system of medicine has been recognized under IMCC Act 1970. The education of Ayurveda is regulated by a statutory body known as Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM). Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 regulates manufacturing and sales Ayurvedic drugs. During the Samhita period (1000 BC), Ayurveda developed with eight branches or specialities, due to which it is called as Ashtanga Ayurveda. Following are the specialities of clinical medicine in Ayurveda: - (1) Kayachikitsa (Internal Medicine) (2) Kaumar Bhritya (Paediatrics) (3) Graha Chikitsa (4) Shalakya and Dentistry) (5) Shalya Tantra (Surgery) (6) Agada-Tantra (Toxicology) (7) Rasayana (Immuno-modulation and Gerentology) (8) Vajikarna (Science of fertility and healthy progeny) 2.2.5 The above eight branches have over the years and specifically during the last 50 years expanded into 22 specialities for post-graduate education as follows: (1) Ayurveda Siddhanta (Fundamental Principles of Ayurveda) (2) Ayurveda Samhita (3) Rachna and Swasth-Vritta (Social and Preventive Medicine) (10) Kayachikitsa (Internal Medicine) (11) Rog Nidana avum Vikriti Vigyan (Diagnostics 2017-18 | Vigyan (Radiology) 2.2.6 Courses of study for award of Bachelor, Master and Doctorate degrees in Ayurveda are imparted through various universities of India. 2.2.7 Three volumes of Ayurvedic Formulary of India (AFI) containing 980 compound formulations and eight volumes of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) Part-1 containing 600 monographs on single drugs and three volumes of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) Part-II containing 152 monographs on compound formulations have been published. 2.3 siddhA systeM 2.3.1 The Siddha System of medicine is one of the ancient systems of medicine in India having its close association with Dravidian culture. The term Siddha means achievements and Siddhars are those who have achieved perfection in medicine. Eighteen Siddhars are said to have contributed towards the systematic development of this system and recorded their experiences in Tamil language. 2.3.2 The Siddha system of Medicine emphasizes on the patient, environment, age, sex, race, habits, mental frame work, habitat, diet, appetite, physical condition, physiological constitution of the diseases for its treatment which is individualistic in nature. Diagnosis of diseases is done through examination of pulse, urine, eyes, study of voice, colour of body, tongue and status of the digestion of individual patients. The system has unique treasure for the conversion of metals and minerals as drugs and many infective diseases are treated with the medicines containing specially processed mercury, silver, arsenic, lead and sulphur without any side effects. The strength of the Siddha system lies in providing very effective therapy in the case of Psoriasis, Rheumatic disorders, chronic liver disorders, benign prostate hypertrophy, bleeding piles, peptic ulcer including various kinds of Dermatological disorders of non psoriatic nature. 2.3.3 There are nine Siddha Medical Colleges and one National Institute exists in our country. In these, three Post Graduate courses are available. During the last six decades, there has been continuous development in Siddha medical education and this has led to the establishment of the National Institute of Siddha at Chennai as an apex Institute having six specialities in Post-Graduate teaching leading to the award of M.D(S) Degree. 2.3.4 For development of focused research in Siddha System of medicine, the Govt. has constituted Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS), an autonomous body by bifurcating Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS). In CCRS Work of Madhu Meham (Diabetes), Leucoderma, Hypertension etc. is being carried out. 2.4 unAni MediCine 2.4.1 The Unani System of Medicine originated in Greece and passed through many countries before 10 | Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 Ministry of Ayurved A, hoMeop Athy Ayushestablishing itself in India during the medieval period. It is based on well-established knowledge and practices relating to the promotion of positive health and prevention of disease. The fusion of traditional knowledge of ancient civilizations like Egypt, Arabia, Iran, China, Syria and India was in the backdrop of the genesis of this system of medicine. It emphasizes the use of naturally occurring substances mostly herbal medicines and also uses some medicines of animals, marine and mineral origin. This system of medicine was documented in Al- Qanoon,a medical classics, by Sheikh Bu-Ali Sina (Avicena) (980-1037) AD), in Al-Havi by Razi (850-923 AD) and in many other books written by the Unani physicians. 2.4.2 The Unani System is based on the humoral theory i.e. the presence of blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile in every person. The temperament of a person can accordingly be Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic depending on the presence and combination of the Humors. According to Unani theory, the humors and the drugs themselves are assigned temperaments. Any change in quantity and quality of the humors bring about a change in the status of the health of the human body. A proper balance of humors is required in the maintenance of health. 2.4.3. The treatment consists of four components, namely, Preventive, Promotive, Curative and Rehabilitative. Unani system of medicine has been found to be efficacious in many conditions, particularly Chronic and Degenerative disorders e.g. Rhumatoid Arhritis, Hepatitis, Filariasis, Eczema, Sinusitis and Bronchial Asthma etc. 2.4.4. For the prevention of disease and promotion of health, the Unani system emphasizes on six essential pre-requisites of life (Asbab-e-Sitta Zarooria) - (i) Pure air (ii) Food and Beverages (iii) Physical movement and Rest (iv) Psychic movement and Rest (v) Sleep and Wakefulness and (vi) Retention of useful materials and Evacuation of waste materials from the body. 2.4.5. There are four forms of treatment in Unani Yad]. Regimen therapy (Ilaj-bit-Tadbir) is a speciality under which various methods of treatment are used for treating specific and complicated disease. 2.4.6 Education and Practice of Unani as a system of medicine has been recognized under IMCC Act 1970. The education of Unani is regulated by a statutory body known as Central Council of Indian Medicine [CCIM]. The manufacturing and sale of Unani drugs are regulated by Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 . 2.4.7 During the last 50 years ,10 Post Graduate specialities have been developed in (i) Kulliyat (Fundamental of Unani System of Medicine ), (viii) National Formulary of Unani Medicine (NFUM) containing 1228 compound formulation and six volumes of Unani Phamacopeia of India (UPI) containing 298 monographs on single drugs have been published. Two volumes of Pharmacopoeia on compound formulations containing 100 compound drugs have also been published. 2.4.9 There are 46 Educational Institutions of Unani Medicine in the country, out of which 8 Institutions are awarding MD degree in Unani Medicine. Goverment Of India has a established a National Institute Of Unani Medicine (NIUM) at Bangalore for Post Graduate courses. This Institute is a Premier Centre for higher Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 | 11 Ministry of Ayurved A, in all aspects of Unani Medicine. Apart from this a Ph.D programme in Moalajat has been recently started in the Institutes. 2.4.10 For the Propagation and Development of Unani Medicine,the Govt. of India has created Unani Chair in the University of Western Cape at Cape Town, South Africa. 2.4.11 Having vast infrastructure of Unani medicine in terms of Health care delivery system, Research & Educational Institutions and Drug Manufacturing Industries, India is considered a world leader in the field of Unani Medicine. 2.5 homoeopathy 2.5.1 The Physicians from the time of Hippocrates (around 400 B.C.) have observed that certain substances could produce symptoms of a disease in healthy people similar to those of people suffering from the disease. Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician scientifically examined this phenomenon and codified the fundamental principles of Homoeopathy. Homoeopathy was brought into India around 1810 A.D. by European missionaries and received official recognition by a Resolution passed by the Constituent Assembly in 1948 and then by the Parliament. 2.5.2 The first principle of Homoeopathy 'Similia Similibus Curentur' , says that a medicine which could induce a set of symptoms in healthy human beings would be capable of curing a similar set of symptoms in human beings actually suffering from the disease. The second principle of 'Single Medicine' says that one medicine should be administered at a time to a particular patient during the treatment. The third principle of 'Minimum Dose' states that the bare minimum dose of a drug which would induce a curative action without any adverse effect should be administered. Homoeopathy is based on the assumption that the causation of a disease mainly depends upon the susceptibility or proneness of an individual to the incidence of the particular disease in addition to the action of external agents like bacteria, viruses, etc. 2.5.3 Homoeopathy is a method of treating diseases by administering drugs, which have been experimentally proved to possess the power to produce similar symptoms on healthy human beings. Treatment in Homoeopathy, which is holistic in nature, focuses on an individual's response to a specific environment. Homoeopathic medicines are prepared mainly from natural substances, such as plant products, minerals and from animal sources, nosodes, sarcodes etc. Homoeopathic medicines do not have any toxic, poisonous or side effects. Homoeopathic treatment is economical as well and has a very broad public acceptance. 2.5.4 Homoeopathy has its own areas of strength in therapeutics and it is particularly useful in treatment for allergies, autoimmune disorders and viral infections. Many surgical, gynaecological and obstetrical and paediatric conditions and ailments affecting the eyes, nose, ear, teeth, skin, sexual organs, etc. are amenable to Homoeopathic treatment. Behavioral disorder, neurological problems and metabolic diseases can also be successfully treated by Homoeopathy. Apart from the curative aspects, Homoeopathic medicines are also used in preventive and promotive health care. In recent times, there is an emergence of interest in the use of Homoeopathic medicines in veterinary care, agriculture, dentistry, etc. Homoeopathic medical education has developed in seven specialities in post-graduate teaching, which are Materia Medica, Organon of Medicine, Repertory, Practice of Medicine, Paediatrics, Pharmacy and Psychiatry.12 | Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 Ministry Yoga is essentially spiritual and it is an art and science of healthy living which focuses on bringing harmony between body and mind. The word 'Yoga' has two meanings; the first comes from the root 'Yujir' or 'Union' , the second is derived from a different root 'yuja' which means 'Samadhi' - the highest state of mind and the absolute knowledge. These two are the most important meanings of the word Yoga according to 'Panini' , the most well-known Sanskrit grammarian. 2.6.2 Yoga is being practised as part of healthy lifestyle and has become part of our spiritual heritage. In the present era, Yoga is popular world-wide because of its spiritual values, therapeutic credentials, its role in the prevention of diseases, promotion of health and management of lifestyle related disorders. Several clinical studies have lucidly demonstrated the therapeutic potentials of Yoga in the treatment of many lifestyle related or psychosomatic disorders. The speciality of this system is that it can get along with any other systems of health care. 2.6.3 The aim of Yoga is complete cessation of all kinds of suffering (sorrow) and its root cause ignorance and is known as Moksha or liberation. The main objectives of Yoga are health, happiness, harmony, spiritual quest, personality development, etc. 2.6.4 Yoga is as old as the human civilization is. The first archaeological evidence of existence of Yoga is found in Stone Seals of excavated from the Indus Valley. Yoga was a special feature of Indus Valley Civilization (3000 BC). Yogic literature has been found in the Vedas, the Upanishadas, the Darshanas, the Epics, the Puranas, the Aagmas, the Tantras, etc. Rich sources of Yoga have also been available in medieval, modern and contemporary literature. 2.6.5 The Yoga referred in the Vedic and Upanishadic literature has been depicted in three important texts called Prasthanatrayi: a) Vedanta (Sadhana Prasthana) These texts texts referred in Yoga are as follows: (i) Patanjala Yoga Sutra (ii) Yoga which is one of the Shad Darshanas, has been advocated by the great sage Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 | 13 Ministry of Ayurved A, around approximately 200 BC. Patanjali wrote a book known as Yoga Sutras, which contains 195 sutras. Patanjali advocates Ashtanga Yoga, which is widely practiced from the ancient times till today, they are: 1. Yama (Self-restraints) 2. Niyama (Observance) 3. Asana (Psycho-physical postures) 4. Pranayama (Control of vital energy - breath) 5. Pratyahara (Withdrawal of senses) 6. Dharana (Concentration) 7. Dhyana (Meditation) 8. Samadhi (Absorption or State of liberation) 2.6.8 The following are the doctrines and concepts adopted in Yoga Therapy: i) Doctrine of \"Panchakoshas\" (five sheaths/bodies) as found in Upanishadas. ii) Doctrine of , \"kriyayoga\"and \"astangas\" as found in Patanjala Yoga Sutras. iii) Doctrine of various kinds of \"shuddhis\" found in Patanjala Yoga Sutra and Hathayoga. iv) Doctrine of opening blocked channels of vayus and prana (nadishuddhi), opening of lotuses and chakras, kumbhakapranayamas, and dristis as found in Hatha Yoga and Kundalini Yoga. v) Working with the mind on the lines of Patanjala Yoga Sutra, Mantra Yoga and Hatha Yoga. vi) Working on the lines of \"Karma-Jnana'Bhakti\" from Bhagavad Gita. vii) Certain aspects of Tantra Yoga also get integrated in various Yoga practices. 2.6.9 The following Yogic practices are being practised for prevention and management of diseases:- i) shatkarma: These are six cleansing techniques in Yoga used to clean the internal organs and systems of the body. These are called as the process of detoxification.

It has its own concept of health and disease and principles of treatment . Naturopathy is a system of medicine that advocates harmonious living with constructive principles of Nature on physical , mental , moral and spiritual planes . It has great health promotive and restorative , and disease preventive as well as curative potential . 2.7.2 According to Naturopathy the primary cause of disease, barring accidental or surgical injury, is violation of Nature's laws and the effects of violation of Nature's laws are- 1. Lowered vitality; 2. Abnormal composition of blood and lymph; 3. Accumulation of morbid matter in the body. 2.7.3 The science of Naturopathy teaches us that the disease is Nature's effort to eliminate the morbid matter from the body to restore the health. Hence, we must not suppress the outward symptoms of disease like fever, cough, loose motions etc. but cooperate with Nature in the process of eliminating morbid matter from the body. 2.7.4 Some of the basic concepts of Naturopathy are outlined as under: a) Naturopathy believes in the concept of unity of disease and unity of cure. According to it the root cause of all diseases is one that is accumulation of morbid matter in the body and the remedy also is one i.e. elimination of those toxins from the body. b) Naturopathy considers bacteria and virus to be secondary cause of disease. The primary cause of disease is accumulation of morbid matter in the body. The microbes survive in the body only when a favourable atmosphere for their growth is established by the accumulation of morbid matter. Hence, the basic cause of disease is morbid matter and microbes are only the secondary cause. c) Acute diseases are self-healing efforts of the body. Hence, they are taken as our friends, not enemies. Chronic diseases are outcome of wrong treatment and suppression of the acute diseases. d) Human body has remarkable recuperative powers when left alone. Nature is the greatest healer. The human body is a self-healing machine. It is endowed with inherent healing power to prevent itself from disease and regain health when fallen ill. e) In Naturopathy the patient is at the centre of intervention and treatment, cure of disease is effected automatically with the increase in vitality and detoxification of body. f) Naturopathy believes in holistic treatment. It not only treats the body as a whole, instead of specific organs but also take into account intervention at mental, moral and spiritual planes. g) Naturopathy does not use medicines. According to it, \"Food is Medicine\" . h) Naturopathy accepts prayers also as a modality of treatment. According to Gandhiji \"Rama Nama is the best Natural Treatment\" meaning there by that prayer according to one's own faith is an important part of treatment. 2.7.5 Some of the important therapies/therapeutic modalities of Naturopathy which are employed not only for Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 | 15 Ministry of Ayurved A, hoMeop Athy Ayushcurative purposes but also for prevention of diseases and promotion of health are as under- (i) Upvas Chikitsa (Fasting Therapy) (ii) Aahar Chikitsa (Diet Therapy) (iii) Mitti Chikitsa (Mud Therapy) (iv) Jala Chikitsa (Hydrotherapy) Therapy) 2.8 so WA-Rigp A 2.8.1 Sowa-Rigpa is among the oldest surviving health traditions of the world with a living history of more than 2500 years. It has been in vogue and practised in Himalayan regions through out particularly in managing chronic diseases like Asthma, Bronchitis, Arthritis, etc. The basic theory of Sowa- Rigpa is explained in terms of (i)The body and the mind as the locus of treatment; (ii)Antidote, i.e. the treatment;(iii)The method of treatment through antidote;(iv)Medicines that cure the disease and lastly (v) Pharmacology. Sowa- Rigpa emphasizes the importance of the five cosmological physical elements in the formation of the human body, the nature of disorders and the remedial measures.16 | Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 Ministry hoMeop Athy Ayush3.1 The Ministry is headed by a Minister of State (Independent Charge) assisted by the Secretary to the Government of India.

India is a unique country of distinction by having codified system of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and Siddha wherein the use of medicinal plants for preventive and curative health care are described. India is also unique in possessing a substantial amount of biodiversity of medicinal plants, thanks to its varied agroclimatic regions and biodiversity hotspots. As per Rigveda, each and every plant has got medicinal value. In India, there are around 17000 flowering plants of which 8000 plant species have shown medicinal value and all these plants are being consumed by traditional healers, local people and ASUs Industry. Other than for medicinal value, these plants are consumed for their cosmetic value, neutraciticals and also used for extract preparation to be used as phytochemicals. With the increasing awareness about the benefits of traditional medicine, the demand for medicinal plants is increasing day-by-day. Based on the demand and supply study conducted by ICFRE supported by NMPB, it was found that 1192 plant species are traded for their medicinal value of which 249 species are traded in large quantity i.e. more than 100 MTs per year. The study also revealed that the total demand for medicinal plants throughout the country is 5 Lakh which is increasing at the rate of 7% per year. The report also highlighted that with the demand for export for medicinal plants increasing, some of the medicinal plants have found their way into the farmer's field. The efforts of National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) in supporting Research & Development (R&D) related activities and support for Quality Planting Material (QPM) and cultivation of MPs have led to bringing at least 50 species under cultivation. This has also contributed to increasing the share of medicinal plants obtained from cultivation source to be upto 40% by volume. Although 50 or more species are adopted by farmers and the cultivation source has gone upto 40% by volume but still a lot of medicinal plants are collected from wild. The indiscriminate and unsustainable harvest of these plants from wild has pushed many of the species to endangered category. Hence, the study recommended for more focus on bringing more and more species under cultivation aided by development of agrotechnology, QPM and training. 9.2 v ision s tatement To tap the potential and comparative advantage of India in the medicinal plants sector so that it can realize its potential of Global Leadership in this field by comprehensive development of conservation, cultivation, collection, processing, marketing, research and extension support system for the sector. 9.3 p otential of Medicinal plants (Mp s) sector in i ndia India's herbal sector is representing about 8500 licensed herbal units, thousands of extractors or semi processors, export houses and cottage-level units of herbal based products, millions of folk healers and household users of thousands of herbal raw drugs. As per the report of Pharmaxil, India is the world's Chapter 9 developing MediCinAl pl Ants seC toR in indiA102 | Annu Al RepoRt 2017-18 Ministry of hoMeop Athy Ayushsecond largest exporter of medicinal plants after China and both the countries together produce more than 70% of the total global demand for herbal products. A large number of Import and Export houses and agencies in the country are engaged in foreign trade of botanical raw drugs, herbal extract and gums through more than 100 ports. As per the survey conducted during 2014-15, the total estimated turnover of the domestic herbal industry in the country has been reported around INR 20,000 crore. The survey also concluded that the total 5,12,000 MT herbal raw drugs containing 1178 medicinal plants which has been valued around INR 7,000 crores (> one billion USD) has been consumed by the herbal industry along with the export. Out of 5,12,000 MT, 1,95,000 MT (value: 1,950 crore) has been consumed by domestic herbal industry which reflect 10% growth over the last decades; 1,67,500 MT (value: 1,675 crore) by rural households and 1,34,500 MT (value: 3,211 crore) by export reflect average annual increase of about 11% over the last decades. 9.4 s chemes and their provision: A) NMPB is currently implementing the Central Sector Scheme on \"Conservation, Development and Sustainable Management of Medicinal Plants\" .
