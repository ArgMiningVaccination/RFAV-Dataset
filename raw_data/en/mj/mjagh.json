[Energy storage system](/dictionary/energy-storage-system) means a system which stores energy and releases it in the same form as was input. [Renewable energy resource](/dictionary/renewable-energy-resource) means a resource that naturally replenishes over a human, not a geological, time frame and that is ultimately derived from solar power, water power, or wind power. Renewable energy resource does not include petroleum, nuclear, natural gas, or coal. A renewable energy resource comes from the sun or from thermal inertia of the earth and minimizes the output of toxic material in the conversion of the energy and includes, but is not limited to, all of the following: [Eligible Renewable Energy Resource](/dictionary/eligible-renewable-energy-resource) or \"ERR\" has the meaning set forth in California Public Utilities Code Section 399.12 and California Public Resources Code Section 25741, as either code provision is amended or supplemented from time to time. [Renewable Energy Standard](/dictionary/renewable-energy-standard) means the minimum renewable energy capacity portfolio, if applicable, and the renewable energy credit portfolio required to be achieved under section 28 or former section 27. [Critical Energy Infrastructure Information](/dictionary/critical-energy-infrastructure-information) means all information, whether furnished before or after the mutual execution of this Agreement, whether oral, written or recorded/electronic, and regardless of the manner in which it is furnished, that is marked \"CEII\" or \"Critical Energy Infrastructure Information\" or which under all of the circumstances should be treated as such in accordance with the definition of CEII in 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 388.13(c)(1). The Receiving Party shall maintain all CEII in a secure place. The Receiving Party shall treat CEII received under this agreement in accordance with its own procedures for protecting CEII and shall not disclose CEII to anyone except its Authorized Representatives. [Geothermal energy](/dictionary/geothermal-energy) means energy contained in heat that continuously flows outward from the earth that is used as the sole source of energy to produce electricity. [Useful thermal energy](/dictionary/useful-thermal-energy) means, with regard to a cogeneration unit, thermal energy that is: [Net energy billing](/dictionary/net-energy-billing) means a billing and metering practice under which a customer-generator is billed on the basis of net energy over the billing period. [Energy Star](/dictionary/energy-star) means the U.S. EPA's energy efficiency product labeling program. [energy storage](/dictionary/energy-storage) means, in the electricity system, deferring the final use of electricity to a moment later than when it was generated, or the conversion of electrical energy into a form of energy which can be stored, the storing of such energy, and the subsequent reconversion of such energy into electrical energy or use as another energy carrier; [distribution system operator](/dictionary/distribution-system-operator) means a natural or legal person responsible for operating, ensuring the maintenance of and, if necessary, developing the distribution system in a given area and, where applicable, its interconnections with other systems and for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the distribution of electricity; [energy service](/dictionary/energy-service) means the physical benefit, utility or good derived from a combination of energy with energy-efficient technology or with action, which may include the operations, maintenance and control necessary to deliver the service, which is delivered on the basis of a contract and in normal circumstances has proven to result in verifiable and measurable or estimable energy efficiency improvement or primary energy savings; [Electric utility steam generating unit](/dictionary/electric-utility-steam-generating-unit) means any steam electric generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25 MW electrical output to any utility power distribution system for sale.
