In someone with AML or ALL, this production process is abnormal and immature cells are produced and sent into the blood stream. In this immature state, the cells affect the production of other normal cells and ... Normally, white blood cells are produced in a controlled way by the bone marrow. In someone with AML or ALL, this production process is abnormal and immature cells are produced and sent into the blood stream. In this immature state, the cells affect the production of other normal cells and these cannot perform their usual functions. Therefore patients with AML or ALL are vulnerable to infection, anemia, and bleeding. The purpose of this study is to understand what causes the white blood cells to grow abnormally, and to determine if there are novel agents that can be used to stop this abnormal growth. In this research project, a sample of blood and bone marrow will be studied in the laboratory to learn more about the nature of the disease, and to understand what causes the defect in the growth of these cells. You may be eligible for this research study if you have been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which are cancers of the blood that affect white blood cells.

STU00010003 Genetics of BRCA2-related Prostate Cancer Recruiting Research Participants for a New Study on the \"Genetics of Prostate Cancer\"At the time of conception, fertilization of the egg by the sperm brings together the genetic material (DNA) from both parents, half from the mother and half from the father, producing the embryo. In the very early ... Recruiting Research Participants for a New Study on the \"Genetics of Prostate Cancer\" At the time of conception, fertilization of the egg by the sperm brings together the genetic material (DNA) from both parents, half from the mother and half from the father, producing the embryo. In the very early stages of embryonic development, the embryo is made up of cells that have the potential to develop into all types of cells, like skin, muscle, liver, brain, pancreas, breast, ovary, fallopian tube, or prostate cells. Because of this ability, these cells are called \"pluripotent\" embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, about a week after fertilization, the embryonic cells lose their ability to develop into all of the different cells and tissues of the body and gradually \"differentiate\" into the various tissues and organs that have different specific functions. So, there is a relatively narrow window during which pluripotent ESCs exist in the embryo. At the end of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process for couples undergoing subfertility treatment, the doctors are usually left with one-week-old embryos. In 1998, using such embryos for research, scientists figured out how to grow pluripotent ESCs in the lab that can stay in their pluripotent state if the right growth conditions are present. Changing the growth conditions in certain ways, scientists learned how to stimulate the ESCs to go through a process called \"differentiation,\" in which the stem cells can develop into any of the different cell types present in the body. ESCs were used in the early animal cloning experiments that produced the cloned ewe named \"Dolly;\" however, cloning human cells is illegal. While ESCs offer promising and exciting opportunities, like the possibility of growing organs in the lab, because their production involves technical and ethical problems, efforts were directed to produce pluripotent stem cells from mature cells to avoid the use of embryos. In 2007, Japanese researchers found an amazing way (for which they received a Nobel Prize) to transform mature cells, like regular skin or blood cells, directly into stem cells without using human eggs. They found a combination of proteins that, if injected into mature cells, gradually reprogrammed them into induced pluripotent stem cells, abbreviated iPSCs. Research Project Drs. Dan Theodorescu and Clive Svendsen, the Principal Investigators at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California in collaboration with Dr. William Catalona, the Principal Investigator at Northwestern University are engaged in research using iPSCs to develop a model of human prostate cancer using iPSCs from men who carry BRCA2 mutations that are related to a higher risk for developing aggressive prostate cancer (the Cedars-Sinai team has already accomplished this for ovarian cancer in women who carry BRCA1 mutations). As study controls, they will also enroll men with non-BRCA2-related prostate cancer and those without prostate cancer. They will not use embryos. In the laboratory, the researchers will take the white blood cells from a blood sample back in time to when they were capable of making any cell type in the body and differentiate them forward into prostate cells carrying (or for non-BRCA2-mutation carriers, not carrying) the BRCA2 mutation in a petri dish. Using these transformed prostate cells, they will use current genetic engineering and molecular biology research methods to study the mechanisms of the transformation of normal prostate cells into aggressive prostate cancer cells. This model also can be used in cell-signaling studies and drug screening studies for designing future therapies. The bank of prostate iPSCs that they will create may be shared with research institutions around the world. These researchers are now recruiting men and their male family members who carry a BRCA2 mutation and other prostate cancer patients and controls without prostate cancer to participate in this study. This research is being performed to discover the causes of prostate cancer and how it is passed down in families using the BRCA2 mutation as a model system and also can be applied to non-BRCA2-related cancers. This study is called \"The genetics of prostate cancer\" and is approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Northwestern University (STU00018651) and Cedars Sinai, whose function is to protect the rights of research subjects and to oversee ethical issues. Participation in this study will involve having up to 50 ml of your blood drawn (10 teaspoons), and completing family history questionnaires (baseline and follow-ups) and clinical follow-up questionnaires, if applicable. The time involved includes the time required to read the 10-page consent form, and the time required to travel to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Galter Pavilion, 675 North St. Clair Street, Chicago, IL 60611 for the research blood draw.If it is not convenient for you to come to our clinic you may be able to get blood drawn at a clinic of your choice and we will arrange to have it shipped to Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, California. It will take about 20 to 40 minutes to complete the questionnaire. In the case that your family history suggests familial prostate cancer, Dr. Catalona may want your family members to participate in the study as well. You may be asked to contact your relative(s) about the study. We will follow up with a family history follow-up questionnaire annually, which takes 15 to 30 minutes to finish, to update the file. If you develop prostate cancer, we will want you to fill out a clinical follow-up questionnaire about prostate cancer and follow you up with the questionnaire annually as well, which takes 10 minutes to finish. In addition, we may request up one or more additional blood samples of 10 to 20 ml (2-4 teaspoons) from you at a later date, depending on the evolving needs of the study. You may refuse to provide these follow-up blood samples without affecting your participation in this study. The blood sample(s) will be saved for future analysis. Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research studies and medical records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this institution. Research results will not be available to you or your physician except under extraordinary circumstances. These are situations in which a life-threatening medical disorder is discovered for which medical treatment is available to prevent or alleviate long-term medical complications. If such a situation should occur, we will contact you via phone, email or mail. Those interested in participating may contact Dr. Catalona at 312 695-4471 or william.catalona@nm.org.

Purpose This study is evaluating an on-line registry for kidney cancer patients called \u00db\u00cfMyQOL,\u00db which stands for My Quality of Life. Overview A registry is a repository (database) of information about a group of people who share a common characteristic - in this case, kidney cancer. MYQOL registry participants enter information about their disease, treatment, symptoms, health status, and quality of life into an on-line, password-protected database on a regularly scheduled basis. Participants can use the registry to track many of their symptoms and their health status over time and to compare themselves (anonymously) with other groups of people (for example, how their level of fatigue compares with the average level of fatigue reported by other participants in the registry). Participants can also choose to share relevant information about themselves (from the registry) with their health care provider(s), by printing copies of their completed forms. Registry participants will be offered opportunities to join in other research studies when available. Description of Treatment Participants in this study will be asked to do the following for a 1-year trial period: 1) enroll in the on-line registry; 2) complete questionnaires about their health and treatment every 3 months ; and 3) be willing to have MYQOL researchers contact them confidentially about participating in other research studies. This does not mean that participants are obligated to participate in future research studies; only that they agree to be contacted. Some of the eligibility criteria include: - Participants must have a kidney cancer diagnosis. - Participants must be 18 or older. - Participants must be able to read English well enough to complete questionnaires. Note: This is only a partial list of eligibility criteria. Please contact the Lurie Cancer Center for complete screening information if you are interested in this clinical trial.

This research is significant because the high-density lipoprotein like nanoparticles (HDL-NPs) being investigated have been shown to have tremendous therapeutic properties when evaluated in in vitro and in vivo settings. Prior to initiating large-scale in vivo animal and human studies it is imperative that we obtain an in-depth knowledge of the interaction of the HDL-NPs with human blood cells using safe ex vivo experiments. Healthy, non-pregnant adult (age >18-75 years) volunteers. STU00200368 NCI 15H01: Triad1 Regulates Myelopoiesis and Functions as a Leukemia Suppressor Researchers have found that about 60% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will obtain a remission following treatment with combinations of chemotherapy drugs. However, relapse after treatment remains a problem, and can be as high as 80% in some types of AML patients. Therefore, it would be beneficial to ... Researchers have found that about 60% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will obtain a remission following treatment with combinations of chemotherapy drugs. However, relapse after treatment remains a problem, and can be as high as 80% in some types of AML patients. Therefore, it would be beneficial to identify specific treatment approaches for patients at a high risk for relapse. One characteristic associated with high relapse rates is an increase in proteins that are referred to as Hox proteins in the leukemia cells. Increase in Hox proteins prevents production of some other proteins, including a protein referred to as Triad1. An increase in Triad1 protein in bone marrow cells may be important to control the growth of such cells. Decreased Triad1 in leukemia cells may therefore promote their growth, but this has not been previously studied. The purpose of this study is to investigate if the lack of Triad1 in leukemia cells contributes to resistance of some leukemias to chemotherapy drugs. This research may prove to be helpful in the design of new and more effective treatments for leukemia in the future. At a time when you are having a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate performed as part of your standard medical care, about an additional 2.5 teaspoons (12.5 mL) of bone marrow will be collected for this research study. You may be eligible for this research study if you have been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer of the blood. STU00200435 A large-scale multicenter phase II study evaluating the protective effect of a tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC) in women with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ. ... The main purpose of this study is to determine if taking the study drug, conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene (Duavee\u00ae) causes any changes in the proliferation markers within the breast tissue of the study subjects. The study drug is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in healthy postmenopausal women to treat certain symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes. Since it is not approved in women with DCIS, its use in this study is experimental. This study will also look at whether taking the study drug causes any significant or undesirable side effects in women with DCIS. The researchers hope that this study will help them determine if taking the study drug is safe in women taking DCIS and if it can possibly reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women with DCIS. Some of the eligibility criteria include: - Participants must be postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed DCIS scheduled to undergo surgical therapy. - Patients must be able to swallow the oral medication. - Patients must be able to understand and the willing to sign a written informed consent document and comply to all procedures. Note: This is only a partial list of eligibility criteria. Please contact the Lurie Cancer Center for complete screening information if you are interested in this clinical trial. NU 15N01: Head and Neck Tissue Bank Researchers would like to create a bio-specimen bank of tissue, blood, urine and saliva, which would then be used to study cancer and find better ways to detect, prevent, diagnose, treat and provide better care for future patients.

Researchers would like to create a bio-specimen bank of tissue, blood, urine and saliva, which would then be used to study cancer and find better ways to detect, prevent, diagnose, treat and provide better care for future patients. Some of these studies may be about how genes affect the development of cancer, response or resistance to treatment as well as prognosis (course of disease and overall outcome including survival). Other studies may aim to identify measurable substances in the blood and/or urine (known as biomarkers) that can indicate early development of cancer, worsening or relapse of disease and response to treatment. Some studies may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for detection of cancer. You may be eligible to take part in our head and neck specimen banking study if you have one of the following conditions: a) You have a tumor or an abnormal area in the head and neck area, suspicious for cancer, or pre-cancerous condition or other pathology of interest, and you're scheduled to have biopsy and/or surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. b) You will receive treatment and/or regular follow up for further management for your head and neck cancer or precancerous condition, or other pathology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and/or Northwestern Medicine Developmental Therapeutics Institute (NMDTI). STU00202177 NU 15N02: Northwestern Head and Neck Cancer Registry The purpose of this registry is to collect clinical information on all consenting head and neck cancer patients seen at the Northwestern Medical Group (NMG) or Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH).

The purpose of this registry is to collect clinical information on all consenting head and neck cancer patients seen at the Northwestern Medical Group (NMG) or Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH). With this information, researchers will conduct studies to learn more about the subtypes of head and neck cancers and determine the most effective treatments. The registry will also allow us to identify possible subjects for future studies. You may be eligible to take part in this research study if you are being treated or have been treated for a tumor or cancer of the head and neck. STU00202162 ECOG-ACRIN 6141: Randomized Phase versus Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab in Patients with Unresectable Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma ... This randomized phase II/III trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab and ipilimumab when given together with or without sargramostim and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may kill tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor, by stimulating white blood cells to kill the tumor cells, or by attacking specific tumor cells and stop them from growing or kill them. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the production of white blood cells. It is not yet known whether nivolumab and ipilimumab are more effective with or without sargramostim in treating patients with melanoma. NUDB 16Z01: The OncoSET Program Database and Biobank - Combining Clinical Outcomes with Next Generation Sequencing and other Advanced Molecular Testing for Genetic Aberrations in Patients with Advanced Solid Malignancies The purpose of the study is to gather information about your cancer and the treatment you receive as a part of your routine clinical care.

The purpose of the study is to gather information about your cancer and the treatment you receive as a part of your routine clinical care. In this study, we are developing a research registry, which is a bank of information about many patients. We are interested in learning about the relationship between your cancer and the different types of tests available to identify the best treatment option for you. That is, we are interested in the tests that identify possible 'mutations' (e.g., changes) or 'drivers' within your tumor, what treatments you receive after getting these tests, and how your cancer responds to the treatments. The tests known as next generation sequencing or \"NGS\" are usually done on your cancer tissue or blood samples as a part of your routine clinical care. Your doctor can use the information to identify the best treatment option for you after discussing it with other doctors. These routine tests will be performed whether you participate in this study or not, but we want to collect the information about this process for this study. If you participate in this study, extra samples of your blood will be collected and stored, and your health information from your medical record and NGS lab results will be collected and stored. You may be eligible for this research study if you have a diagnosis of cancer and are being treated at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. STU00203944 Physical activity and DNA methylation among women with high breast density The purpose of this study is to learn more about how physical activity may influence your genes through a mechanism called DNA methylation. Our goal is to determine if being physically active may be associated with a healthy pattern of DNA methylation in your immune system cells. Exercising and being ... The purpose of this study is to learn more about how physical activity may influence your genes through a mechanism called DNA methylation. Our goal is to determine if being physically active may be associated with a healthy pattern of DNA methylation in your immune system cells. Exercising and being physically active are believed to be important for preventing cancer. It may be particularly important for women with high breast density, and may help reduce risk for breast cancer. However, we do not understand what physical activity changes within the body to alter risk of breast cancer. DNA methylation is a biological process that may help explain the relationship between physical activity and cancer risk. Generally healthy women with a history of heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts, aged 40-74 with no history of cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer), diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

The purpose of this study is to allow researchers studying and treating melanoma and other cancers to have access to tissue for research purposes only. Northwestern University may use your medical record information, as well as tumor, blood, saliva, urine, and fecal samples (collectively called \"tissue\") for research studies to help us understand melanoma and other skin cancers. Biopsies and surgery of your cancer will not be a part of this study but will be performed as part of your standard care. You may be eligible to take part in the research component of the Northwestern Melanoma and Skin Cancer Tissue Repository if you are either a new or returning patient and have a skin cancer or pre-cancer lesion. STU00204151 The Role of Positron Emission Tomography and Resonance Imaging (without Fluorodeoxyglucose or Gadolinium) in Yttrium-90 Radioembolization Treatment Planning for Patients with Liver Malignancies Patients who are already scheduled to receive Y90 radioembolization, will first be treated with Y90 radioembolization for liver cancer or metastasis in the liver. They will then have a Positron Emission Tomography (PET/MR) scan done a few hours after the treatment. You will be placed inside a small ... Patients who are already scheduled to receive Y90 radioembolization, will first be treated with Y90 radioembolization for liver cancer or metastasis in the liver. They will then have a Positron Emission Tomography (PET/MR) scan done a few hours after the treatment. You will be placed inside a small tube for 2-3 hours for the PET/MR scan. There is no contrast or radiation involved in the PET/MR scan. The purpose of the PET/MR scan is to capture specific images of the liver to see where the Y90 radioactive particles are a few hours after treatment. These images will be used to compare determine how much of the radioactive particles went to the tumor(s) compared to how much of them went to healthy liver tissue. We hope to use this information to help develop care that is more specific to the patient. Inclusion Criteria (patients must meet these criteria): 1. 18 years of age or older. 2. Diagnosed with primary liver cancer or metastasis in the liver. 3. Planning to have Y90 radioembolization treatment at Northwestern Medicine. 4. Be able to have an MRI- not claustrophobic or have any other contraindications to MRI.

Because no one really knows whether patients with low risk breast cancer need to receive regional radiotherapy, ... In addition to endocrine therapy and possibly chemotherapy, many women with node positive breast cancer will also receive radiotherapy to the whole breast/chest area and the surrounding lymph glands (called regional radiotherapy). Because no one really knows whether patients with low risk breast cancer need to receive regional radiotherapy, it is possible that some women who get it may not actually need it. These women may be exposed to the side effects of their treatment without benefit. The purpose of this study is to learn if not giving regional radiotherapy is just as good as using regional radiotherapy by comparing any good and bad effects of both approaches. The study has two randomly assigned study groups; Group 1 will receive regional radiotherapy and Group 2 will not. Patients who are of 40 years of age or older may be able to take part in this study if they have newly diagnosed breast cancer that has been treated with breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy and has not spread to other parts of the body. NU 18B05: A Phase II Study of the Determinants of Transdermal Drug Delivery to the Normal and the Radiated Breast The benefits of anti-estrogen medications taken by mouth as pills (such as tamoxifen) are well-proven to reduce the risk of breast cancer in studies with more than 10 years of follow up. However, because tamoxifen is taken by mouth, it circulates through the whole body and may cause ... The benefits of anti-estrogen medications taken by mouth as pills (such as tamoxifen) are well-proven to reduce the risk of breast cancer in studies with more than 10 years of follow up. However, because tamoxifen is taken by mouth, it circulates through the whole body and may cause harmful effects to other organs. When tamoxifen is taken by mouth, it is broken down by the liver into two main active forms, one of which is 4-hydroxytamoxifen, also called 4-OHT. Tamoxifen is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) while 4-OHT is not and is, therefore, considered investigational. However, 4-OHT has anti-cancer activity, and has been developed as a quick drying medicated gel that can be applied to the breast skin. Early results from two previous studies show that 4-OHT gel, when applied to the skin, gets into the breast and blocks breast cancer cell growth as effectively as oral tamoxifen. Unlike oral tamoxifen, the gel is concentrated in the breasts and therefore very little tamoxifen reaches the blood or other parts of the body. Also, some women lack the proteins that are responsible for the break-down of tamoxifen. It is possible that the use of 4-OHT gel will be more effective than oral tamoxifen in these women.

The purpose of this study is to compare any good and bad effects of using proton therapy to using photon therapy. Photon therapy is the usual treatment approach for brain cancer. Proton therapy uses a beam of proton particles to send radiation inside the body to the tumor. This study will allow the researchers to know whether proton therapy is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach. Proton therapy may have less negative effects on brain function than photons because less brain is exposed to radiation when proton therapy is used. However, proton therapy might also be associated with more frequent tumor recurrences. -Participants must be 18 years of age or older -Participants must be diagnosed with a brain tumor A Master Protocol To Evaluate Biomarker-Driven Therapies And Immunotherapies In Previously-Treated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Lung-MAP Screening Study) ...

Yttrium-90 Radiation Lobectomy: Dose Optimization and Prediction of FLR Hypertrophy to Enable Resection of Hepatic Malignancies In the study, there will be many patients, like you, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are eligible to receive a treatment called Y90 radioembolization and who may also be liver resection candidates.Y90 radioembolization is a non-invasive, out-patient treatment that uses radioactive beads (microspheres), which are tiny glass ... In the study, there will be many patients, like you, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are eligible to receive a treatment called Y90 radioembolization and who may also be liver resection candidates. Y90 radioembolization is a non-invasive, out-patient treatment that uses radioactive beads (microspheres), which are tiny glass particles that are loaded with radiation. The beads are injected into an artery of the liver that supplies blood to the tumor(s). The beads flow to the tumor(s) and become trapped inside. The beads release the Y90 radiation inside the tumor(s). Liver resection is used to remove the part of the liver that has the liver tumor(s). It has been shown that Y90 radioembolization can increase the untreated liver's size and volume. Patients with HCC may be liver resection candidates if they have a large enough liver. The purpose of this research is to determine if there is an ideal Y90 dose to increase liver volume. This research may help determine the best Y90 dose for future patients who need a larger liver to have a liver resection. If you participate in this study, you will have standard-of-care Y90 radioembolization as well as study-specific imaging and two optional liver biopsies. You will participate in the study for up to 3 months. Your health status will continue to be followed for up to 5 years. Patients enrolled in the study will receive up to $195.00 for their participation. You are eligible to participate in this study if: 1. You are an adult 18 years of age or older 2.

The use of the hormonal therapy drug letrozole without chemotherapy may shrink or stabilize cancer in the same way that chemotherapy also does, but without the added side effects of ... The purpose of this study is to compare the treatment of carboplatin/paclitaxel and letrozole hormonal therapy to letrozole alone. The use of the hormonal therapy drug letrozole without chemotherapy may shrink or stabilize cancer in the same way that chemotherapy also does, but without the added side effects of chemotherapy. Letrozole is a drug called an aromatase inhibitor, which indirectly stops the body from producing estrogen. This study will investigate if this approach is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach. In order to determine if the use of letrozole alone helps to improve treatment for patients with low-grade serous ovarian or peritoneal cancer compared to combined chemotherapy and letrozole, half of patients in this study will receive letrozole with paclitaxel/carboplatin and the other half will receive letrozole alone. The study doctors will be looking to see if the letrozole alone prolongs the time cancer is in remission, or the duration of time participants are alive after treatment. Letrozole is approved by the FDA for breast cancer, but is not FDA approved for ovarian cancer and is therefore considered experimental in this setting. Participants will get either the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin for four and a half months followed by letrozole or letrozole alone. Patients who are assigned to letrozole monotherapy will continue taking the letrozole for as long as they are tolerating the drug (i.e., have not developed any allergies or severe side effects with the medication) and have not experienced a recurrence or progression of their disease. After participants finish their study treatment, their doctor and study team will continue to follow their condition and watch for side effects during clinic visits or by phone. Participants will be checked every 3 months for the first 3 years after treatment. After that, this will happen every 6 months for two years.

STU00211647 Randomized controlled trial assessing transperineal prostate biopsy to reduce infection complications Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in U.S. men. There are approximately 1 million prostate biopsy performed annually in the U.S. Almost all biopsies are performed as an office based procedure in under 15 minutes. The precision of biopsy has improved over the last decade with ... Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in U.S. men. There are approximately 1 million prostate biopsy performed annually in the U.S. Almost all biopsies are performed as an office based procedure in under 15 minutes. The precision of biopsy has improved over the last decade with the introduction of MRI guidance/targeting of suspicious lesions within the prostate. However, significant limitations remain with this approach, including a significantly increasing risk of post-biopsy infection. This arises because more than 97% of all prostate biopsy are performed via a transrectal approach that introduces rectal bacteria with each pass of the biopsy needle into the sterile urinary tract. The current risk of post-transrectal biopsy infection, even with antimicrobial prophylaxis, is high at approximately 7% overall with 3% (30,000 men) requiring hospitalization annually. Transperineal biopsy is an alternate approach that eliminates the direct introduction of bacteria from the rectum to the prostate. This approach, which is perfomed without antimicrobial prophylaxis, instead passes the biopsy needle through the perineal skin and pelvic floor. Transperineal biopsy has not been widely adopted for several reasons. Historically, it has been considered too painful for patients in the clinic and thus was traditionally performed under general anesthesia. The added time, inconvenience and cost has limited its national adoptance. Second, when transrectal biopsy was initially adopted over 40 years ago, antibiotic resistance of rectal flora was not a challenge. Beyond the potential for in-office transperineal biopsy to significantly reduce or eliminate biopsy infections, transperineal biopsy may also improve cancer detection: studies of transperineal biopsy (performed under general anesthesia) demonstrate higher detection rates for prostate cancer, particularly for anterior zone tumors, compared to transrectal biopsy. This is notable, as anterior tumors are difficult to sample with transrectal. Anterior tumors are also twice as likely to occur in African American men. In fact, our research demonstrates that some of the outcomes disparities in African American men may stem from an underdiagnosis of anterior prostate cancers. Although transrectal biopsy is used widely, it is associated with a significant and increasing risk of biopsy infections due to growing antibiotic resistance, highlighting the urgent need for a safer alternative approach to prostate biopsy. The study investigators have refined a transperineal approach under local anesthesia with MRI-targeting/guidance without the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. The investigators hypothesize that transperineal MRI targeted biopsy will: (1) largely eliminate post-biopsy infections and costly hospitalizations for urosepsis; (2) be performed in the office with similar discomfort and non-infectious complications compared to transrectal MRI targeted biopsy; and (3) have significantly better detection of prostate cancer. This multi-center randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate in-office transperineal MRI targeted vs. transrectal MRI targeted biopsy, the current gold standard. This has transformative impact to change current standard of practice. This study will include allmen who are recommended to undergo prostate biopsy as part of routine clinicalcare.

The purpose of this research study is to determineif the experimental therapy called JCAR017 is effective and safe to treatFollicular Lymphoma or Marginal Zone Lymphoma. This study will have 4 cohorts or patientgroups. Assignment to one of these patient groups depends on if you haveFollicular Lymphoma or Marginal Zone Lymphoma and the number and type oftreatments that you have received in the past, as well as how long it took foryour lymphoma to return after your last treatment. Everyone in all 4 patientgroups will receive the same dose of JCAR017 T cells. JCAR017 is a type oftherapy known as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy which isco-developed with Juno Therapeutics. The visit schedule will also be the samefor all 4 patient groups. At the time you decide to take part in the study andgo through the screening procedures, it will be determined which patient groupyou will be assigned to. In this study, your immunecells will be collected from your blood in a procedure called leukapheresis.The T cells will be separated from the collected immune cells and will bemodified in a laboratory. In the laboratory, a new gene will be put into your Tcells using genetic modification techniques. After they have been modified, thecells will be grown in the laboratory to reach the expected dose for thetreatment. Adding in the new gene may enable your T cells (now called JCAR017 Tcells) to bind to the CD19 protein, which your type of cancer cells carry ontheir surface. Binding to these cells activates the JCAR017 T cells, and theyattack the cancer cells. The JCAR017 T cells will persist in your body afterattacking the cancer cells, you will be monitored during the study to evaluatehow long these JCAR017 T cells persist.

Since 2011, six immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a type of immunotherapy, have been approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in patients with cancer. These medications have been demonstrated to have great promise for treating a variety of cancers. However, there are toxicities associated with these agents, known as immune-related adverse events (AKI), some of which can be fatal. Affected organs include the skin (rash), gastrointestinal tract(diarrhea), and the kidneys (acute kidney injury [AKI]). This study, led by Drs. Shruti Gupta and David Leaf at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has the goal of collecting data on over 300 ICI-associated acute kidney injury cases from more than 30 academic medical centers worldwide. We will characterize the clinical features of ICI-associated AKI in the hope that this will help us to determine predictors of toxicity and best practices for management.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug, ALVR-105, is safe and works well in the treatment for HC. The study will compare ALVR-105 to placebo in reducing your bladder pain, reducing the amount of blood in your urine, and seeing if specific viruses are lowered in your blood and urine. This is a randomized double-blind study. \"Randomized\" means that you will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either ALVR-105, or placebo (inactive substance). You will have a 60% chance of receiving ALVR-105 and a 40% chance of receiving placebo. Your participation in this study will last approximately 6 months and include about 10 study visits to the study site. Some of these study visits will occur when you are already in the hospital in which case the study team will visit you to complete the study visit. In healthy people, T-cells defend the body against viruses. Because of the early stage / premature engraftment and /or immune suppressing therapy given for the HCT, T-cell numbers are low, and it is more difficult for the body to control viruses that are already in your body, but are not active. If you have low T-cell numbers and your body cannot control viruses, some of these viruses can cause HC. Viralym-M (ALVR-105) is a research study medicine that contains T-cells made from healthy human donors to potentially help defend your body against specific viruses. The research study medicine is \"investigational.\" It has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the health authority that approves new medicine being prescribed for use in the United States. This means that it is not approved to treat patients with hemorrhagic cystitis or any other disease. All prospective patients will undergo screening tests to determine if they are eligible to take part in the study. If you qualify, the research study medicine (ALVR-105 or placebo) will be given to you by an infusion into a vein (IV injection). You will receive a second dose of research study medicine about two weeks after your first dose. Note: This is only a partial description of treatment. Please contact the Robert H.

Eligible patients will undergo craniotomy for tumor resection. During the tumor resection and when possible, an initial low dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel will be given following sonication. In select patients, the sonication procedure may occur immediately after the test dose of chemotherapy is administered. The sonication device will be implanted at the end of the procedure. In phase 1, about two weeks after surgery, patients will undergo sonication and albumin-bound paclitaxel administration with MRI to quantify extent of blood brain barrier opening. Sonication and administration of albumin-bound paclitaxel will continue every 3 weeks until disease progression. The planned albumin-bound paclitaxel starting dose is 40 mg/m2, to be escalated in the absence of significant toxicity up to 260 mg/m2. Blood samples for circulating tumor DNA will also be collected before and after each sonication. In phase 2, pre-sonication carboplatin at AUC 5 will be added to the regimen, with a safety run-in for the first 6 patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel or 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Liposomal Irinotecan are more effective treatments for vulnerable patients over the age of 70 with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPCA). These drugs are already approved by the FDA for use in pancreatic cancer. But, it is unknown which combination is the most effective for vulnerable mPCA patients over the age of 70. This study will help the study doctors find out which approach is better at prolonging the life of patients over 70 with mPCA. To determine this, the study doctors will be looking to see which of the two approaches shows better results. Participants who participate will be randomized to either get Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel every other week or 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Liposomal Irinotecan every other week. This study has 2 study groups. Group 1 (Arm A) Participants in this group will get the combination treatment of Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel. Group 2 (Arm B) Participants in this group will get the combination treatment of 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Liposomal Irinotecan. Your doctor will continue to follow your condition for up to 2 years after you start the study, and watch you for side effects and monitor your cancer.

Prospective Molecular Profiling To Guide Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC): An Insight to Next Generation Sequencing-Matched Systemic Therapy in Liver Cancer (PROTOLIGHT STUDY) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer, making up approximately 90% of all liver cancers. It is the fourth largest contributor to cancer-related deaths worldwide. HCC is considered to be a complex tumor. Despite recent drug approvals for HCC, it has become clear that only ... Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer, making up approximately 90% of all liver cancers. It is the fourth largest contributor to cancer-related deaths worldwide. HCC is considered to be a complex tumor. Despite recent drug approvals for HCC, it has become clear that only some populations of patients benefit from certain drugs. This leads researchers to suspect that treatment for HCC would be more effective if we could match specific characteristics of a patient's tumor with a drug that targets them best. Genomic analysis using an FDA-approved method called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) could be used to potentially help physicians make such treatment decisions. The purpose of this study is to see how long patients will benefit if genomic analysis of their tumors is used to recommend more targeted treatments for HCC from a number of FDA-approved drugs. Eligible participants are at least 18 years of age and have advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) or recurrent HCC for which they have not yet received systemic therapy for, and are are not candidates for resection, transplant or liver-directed therapies.

This study isbeing done to answer the following question: Can participantswith HER2-positive breast cancer who have no cancer remaining at surgery(either in the breast or underarm lymph nodes) after 12 weeks of chemotherapyand two HER-targeted therapies eliminate further chemotherapy after surgery? This would be adecrease in the total number of chemotherapy drugs and the amount ofchemotherapy typically received to treat this type of cancer. We are doing thisstudy because we want to find out if this approach can enable you to take fewerchemotherapy drugs than the usual approach for your type of breast cancerwithout compromising your outcome. The usual approach is defined as care mostpeople get for HER2-positive breast cancer. Usual treatment includes additional chemotherapy drugs that might not benecessary, since the HER2-targeted drugs are so effective. The names of thestudy drugs involved in this study are: All chemotherapy drugs will be givenintravenously through vein for 4 cycles. A cycle consists of 3 weeks. Before surgery, paclitaxel will be givenweekly for 12 weeks; pertuzumab will be given once every cycle; and trastuzumabonce every cycle or once weekly for 12 weeks. Alternatives to paclitaxel include docetaxel that will be given once percycle or nab-paclitaxel that would be given weekly for 12 weeks. Note: This is only apartial list of eligibility criteria.

The purpose of this Managed Access Program(MAP), which is an intermediate size patientpopulation Expanded Access, is to allowtreatment with tisagenlecleucel (CTL019) for eligiblepatients diagnosed with B-cell acutelymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) large B-cell lymphomas who meet all of thefollowing criteria: are 1) consistent with the approved prescribing information,... The purpose of this Managed Access Program(MAP), which is an intermediate size patient population Expanded Access, is to allowtreatment with tisagenlecleucel (CTL019) for eligible patients diagnosed with B-cell acutelymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or large B-cell lymphomas who meet all of thefollowing criteria: are 1) consistent with the approved prescribing information,2) unable to receive commercially manufactured product due to failure of the incomingapheresis material to meet acceptance specifications or final outgoing productto meet the commercial release specifications or other specification within theprescribing information, and 3) where no overwhelming safety concerns has beenidentified for manufacture and release of the out of specification product. Participation inthis treatment plan involves an experimental approach called gene transfer forALL or large B-cell lymphoma that involves cells in your blood called B cells(your tumor cells and also normal antibody-producing cells). During thistreatment, some of your own white blood cells (T cells) will be taken andchanged to turn against your tumor cells. T cells from your body will bechanged in a way that may allow them to identify and kill your tumor cells.This change may allow your T cells to go to the tumor cells, turn\"on\" and potentially kill the tumor cells. The modification is doneby gene transfer and results in a genetic change to your T cells. This mayallow the changed T cells to recognize your tumor cells but also normalantibody-producing cells called B cells. These changed cells are calledtisagenlecleucel cells. If you are eligible andchoose to participate in this MAP, you will be asked to come to the doctor'soffice/clinic/study site at least 3 times in order to make sure you areeligible to receive the tisagenlecleucel cells, and to prepare you for theexperimental treatments. Once you receive the tisagenlecleucel cells, acaregiver, relative, or friend should be in your presence at all times for thefirst 10 days to monitor your well-being and contact your study physician incase of fever or changes in your condition. If you become ill, immediatelycontact your study physician. Additionally, you may be required to spend about4 weeks after you have received tisagenlecleucel cells in close proximity tothe trial treatment center while the doctor and study team see how thetreatment is working and monitor your safety.

The purpose of this study is to compare theusual treatment alone to adding immune system activating therapy, Pembrolizumab(MK-3475), to the usual treatment. This study will help the study doctors findout if this different approach is better than the usual approach. To decide if it is better, the study doctorswill be looking to see if the addition of pembrolizumab results in fewerdetectable leukemia using new methods. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475), is already approvedby the FDA for use in several cancers, including advanced or metastaticsmall-cell and non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer,urothelial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, among others. However, Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is notapproved by the FDA or known to be safe for use in AML either alone or incombination with standard chemotherapy. This study has 2 study groups. You will be putinto a group by chance. You will have anequal chance of being in Group 1 or Group 2 Group 1 Participants in group 1 will get the usualstudy drugs, cytarabine on Days 1-7 and either daunorubicin or idarubicin onDays 1-3. If you have evidence ofresidual leukemia in the bone marrow at Day 14, you will receive a second roundof the first part of therapy (5+2 chemotherapy), which means cytarabine on Days1-5 and either daunorubicin or idarubicin on Days 1-2. If you have a complete remission after thefirst part of therapy, you will continue with the second part of therapy thatconsists of up to four cycles of high dose cytarabine. If you remain in complete remission aftersecond part of therapy, you will be monitored without further therapy for up to3 years. If you proceed with atransplant, you will forgo any remaining protocol-defined therapy. Group 2 Participants in group 2 will get the usualstudy drugs, cytarabine on Days 1-7 and either daunorubicin or idarubicin onDays 1-3. If you have evidence ofresidual leukemia in the bone marrow at Day 14, you will receive second dose ofthe first part of therapy (5+2 chemotherapy), which means cytarabine on Days1-5 and either daunorubicin or idarubicin on Days 1-2. Regardless of your bone marrow findings onDay 14, you will receive Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) IV on Day 8. If you have a complete remission after thefirst part of therapy, you will continue with the second part of therapy thatconsists of up to four cycles of high dose cytarabine with Pembrolizumab(MK-3475). If you remain in completeremission after the second part of therapy, you will be monitored withoutPembrolizumab (MK-3475) therapy on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 2years. If you proceed with a transplant,you will forgo any remaining protocol-defined therapy. Participants between the ages of 18 and 75 who have newly diagnosed AML willbe enrolled into this study.

The purpose of this study is for the study doctors to learn if miRNA 371 is useful for predicting relapse in patients with germ cell cancer. A germ cell tumor is a type of cancer that occurs in the ovaries (for females) or the testes (for males). This tumor may also be found in the pelvis along the tailbone, the chest, the abdomen and in other structures of the body, generally along the midline of the body. A sample of your blood will be collected during regular clinic visits to look for the presence of a tumor marker called miRNA 371. The study doctors do not know if the test is as good as the usual care (tumor scans and bloodwork) in predicting when cancer will return (relapse) in patients with germ cell cancer. If better, this blood test could change the way patients are monitored for relapse in the future. If you decide to take part in this study, an extra tube of blood will be collected during your regular clinic visits for miRNA 371 analysis for up to 3 years from enrollment into the study.

The purpose of this research is to determine whether radiotherapy after surgery to remove a breast cancer can help decrease the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood. Circulating tumor cells are cancer cells that are shed from the tumor into the blood stream and are believed to be one of the first indicators that breast cancer cells may remain after surgery. Approximately 20% of women with early-stage breast cancer can be found to have CTCs in a small sample of blood taken several weeks after surgery. Radiotherapy is used after surgery to remove a breast cancer in order to sterilize any cancer cells that may be remaining in the breast. It is not known if radiotherapy can help decrease or eliminate CTCs that are found in the blood. This study aims to find out if testing for CTCs can be clinically useful for guiding radiotherapy treatment decisions. Another aim of this study is to evaluate whether CTCs can be used to measure the effectiveness of radiotherapy in an individual patient. Eligible participants are post-menopausal women that have been diagnosed with non-metastatic, ER-positive and Her2-nonamplifed breast cancer and are planning on receiving radiation and hormone therapy.

The major purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of Q702 that does not result in severe side effects, the dose that is tolerated, and once this dose is found, if it has any effect against the cancer in patients with solid cancer tumors. This study is being done: This research is being performed because improvements are needed in the treatment of patients with cancer. We are asking you to take part in this research study because you have cancer that has continued to grow despite the treatments you have already received. Either the standard drugs and therapies used to treat your disease are no longer working or there are no known treatments which work because your tumor cells may be resistant to available treatments or you are not a candidate for or intolerant of available treatment. Your cancer had been confirmed by a pathologist (a person who studies the causes and effects of diseases). This clinical trial tests a study drug, Q702. The study drug, Q702, targets certain molecules present in cancer cells that may help activate your body's immune system to fight the cancer. The study drug, Q702, is not approved for sale by the FDA.

The purpose of this study is to compare the usual treatment of SRS alone to SRS plus HA-WBRT (whole brain radiation therapy with hippocampus avoidance) and memantine for patients with cancer that has spread to the brain and come back in other areas of the brain after earlier treatment with SRS. The addition of HA-WBRT and memantine to the usual treatment could better control your brain cancer. This study will help the study doctors find out if this different approach is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach. Memantine is FDA approved for treating dementia and is commonly used off-label (that is, for a purpose for which it is not FDA approved) for patients receiving whole-brain radiation therapy for cancer that has spread to the brain. This study has 2 study groups. You will be told which group you are in. Group 1 If you are in this group, you will get the usual treatment, SRS. In addition to the usual SRS treatment, you will also receive HA-WBRT. You will also be given the drug memantine, which has also been shown to preserve memory function. Memantine will be taken for up to 6 months. Group 2 If you are in this group, you will get the usual treatment of SRS. After you finish your treatment, your doctor and study team will watch you for side effects and follow your condition. They will check you every 2 to 3 months for at least 1 year after you finish SRS. If you are receiving memantine, your doctor will continue to see you in the clinic as needed. Participants age 18 years or older who have receivedstereotactic radiosurgery to treat cancer that spread to the brain, and now thecancer has returned in other areas of the brain will be enrolled into thisstudy.

The purpose of this study is to compare the usual treatment (chemotherapy) alone to using nivolumab plus the usual treatment. This study will help the study doctors find out if this different treatment (chemotherapy plus nivolumab) is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach of chemotherapy alone. To decide if it is better, the study doctors will be looking to see if nivolumab when given with the usual treatment will slow the progression of cancer. The study drug nivolumab, is already approved by the FDA for use in different types of cancer, including lung, skin (melanoma), kidney, bladder, colorectal, and some types of liver cancers. Participants who decide to take part in this study will either get chemotherapy for up to 6 months or get chemotherapy plus a drug called nivolumab for 6 months. After the 6 months of chemotherapy, participants will continue to receive nivolumab until their cancer gets worse or up to 2 years. All of these treatments have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but the use of nivolumab with chemotherapy to treat this type of cancer is considered investigational. After treatment, participants will be followed for up to 2 years to check for side effects. Participants will visit the clinic once every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the second year. Participants ages 18 years or olderwho have anal canal cancer that has spread to some other areas in the body willbe enrolled into this study. NRG GU009: Parallel Phase III Randomized Trials for High Risk Prostate Cancer Evaluating De-Intensification for Lower Genomic Risk and Intensification of Concurrent Therapy for Higher Genomic Risk with Radiation (PREDICT-RT*) Participants ages 18 years or older who have high-risk prostate cancer will be enrolled into this study. This study is being done to answer the following questions: If you have high risk prostate cancer, a low gene risk score and plan to receive radiation therapy, is a shorter hormone ... Participants ages 18 years or older who have high-risk prostate cancer will be enrolled into this study. This study is being done to answer the following questions: If you have high risk prostate cancer, a low gene risk score and plan to receive radiation therapy, is a shorter hormone therapy treatment as effective at controlling your cancer compared to the usual 24 month hormone therapy treatment? If you have high risk prostate cancer, a high gene risk score and plan to receive radiation therapy, does adding two new hormone therapy drugs to the usual treatment increase the length of time without your prostate cancer spreading as compared to the usual treatment? The study doctors want to find out if these approaches are better, similar, or worse than the usual approach for your type of prostate cancer. This study has 4 study groups. If you have a low Decipher risk score, you will be randomly assigned to one of these two study groups: \u00b7 Group 1: If you are in this group, you will get the usual approach, hormone therapy and radiation therapy, used to treat this type of cancer. \u00b7 Group 2: If you are in this group, you will get the usual radiation treatment and a shorter period of hormone therapy used to treat this type of cancer. If you have a high Decipher risk score and/or positive pelvic node(s), you will be randomly assigned to one of these two study groups: \u00b7 Group 3: If you are in this group, you will get the usual approach, hormone therapy and radiation therapy, used to treat this type of cancer. \u00b7 Group 4: If you are in this group, you will get study drugs called apalutamide and abiraterone acetate with prednisone plus the usual approach (hormone therapy and radiation therapy) used to treat this type of cancer. After you finish your study treatment, your doctor will continue to follow your condition for at least annually and watch you for side effects. A multi-center single arm Phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of genetically engineered autologous cells expressing anti-CD20 and anti-CD19 specific chimeric antigen receptor in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational cell and gene treatment called MB-CART2019.1 that may help to eliminate cancer cells in subjects who have relapsed (responded to treatment but then returns) and/or refractory (has not responded to initial treatment) DLBCL. In order to ... The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational cell and gene treatment called MB-CART2019.1 that may help to eliminate cancer cells in subjects who have relapsed (responded to treatment but then returns) and/or refractory (has not responded to initial treatment) DLBCL. In order to produce the investigational treatment, white blood cells (T-cells) will be collected at the study center by a process called leukapheresis. Participation in this study is for up to two years, and additionally subjects must enroll in the separate Gene Therapy Long-Term Follow Up protocol for 13 years (total study participation to equal up to 15 years). The Tcells (obtained from blood) will be modified in order for them to express molecules called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surfaces. When the modified cells, called CAR Tcells, are reinfused into the body, the new receptors will enable them to bind onto specific antigens on cancer cells and by doing so destroy them. The CAR T-cells act as a \"living drug\" against your cancer cells. Before your cells are reinfused, participants will first receive a conditioning regimen consisting of two chemotherapy drugs, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The conditioning regimen helps make room in the bone marrow for new blood stem cells to grow, and helps prevent rejection of the transplanted cells, as well as helps kill any cancer cells that are in the body.

The purpose of this study is to compare the usual treatment of chemotherapy and radiation to adding MEDI4736 (durvalumab) immunotherapy to the usual treatment. This study will help determine if this different approach is better than the usual approach. To decide if it is better, the study doctors will be looking to see if the study approach increases the life of patients compared to the usual approach. This immunotherapy drug,MEDI4736 (durvalumab), is already approved by the FDA for use in metastatic bladder cancer. Participants who decide to take part in this study will either get chemotherapy and radiation for 6-8weeks, or will get MEDI4736 (durvalumab) immunotherapy in addition to chemotherapy and radiation for 6.5-8 weeks. Participants in the MEDI4736(durvalumab) Group 1 whose bladder cancer has responded (shrunk, gone away or remained stable) to treatment with chemotherapy, radiation and MEDI4736(durvalumab) will be offered more treatments with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) alone for up to 9 months. Participants who are in the arm with chemotherapy and radiation, and whose cancer has responded, will be watched closely without any additional chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Participants whose cancer has not responded, may be offered surgery or some other treatment. After study treatment is finished, participants will be followed by the study doctor for up to 3 years. Participants ages 18 years or older who have bladder cancer that has spread from the bladder to the lymph nodes will be enrolled into this study.

Participants 18 years or older who have metastatic melanoma, and the cancer has a change in the gene called the BRAF, and is not responsive to treatment with MEK and BRAF inhibitors will be enrolled. This study has two phases. Phase 1 and Phase 2. The purpose of Phase 1 is to test the safety of the study drug, tazemetostat, in combination with the usual treatment, dabrafenib and trametinib. This study tests different doses of tazemetostat with the usual dose of dabrafenib and trametinib to see which dose of tazemetostat is safest for people. Tazmetostatis not approved by the FDA for treatment of this type of cancer. All people taking part in this study will get the same dose of the usual intervention, dabrafenib and trametinib. However, people in this study will get different doses of the study drug, tazemetostat. Once the highest safe dose is found, phase 1 of the study is stopped. The purpose of Phase II is to compare the combination of tazemetostat, dabrafenib, and trametinib to tazemetostat alone. This study will help the study doctors find out if this different approach is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach. Another purpose of this study is for the study doctors to learn if a genetic test is helpful to decide if tazemetostat is more effective in patients whose cancer has an abnormal EZH2 gene. The combination of tazemetostat, trametinib, and dabrafenib, has not been administered together in patients and the combination of these agents are not FDA approved for the treatment of this type of cancer. Participants who take part in this study will either get a combination of usual approach of dabrafenib and trametinib, and the study drug, tazemetostat or will get the study drug, tazemetostat alone, until their disease gets worse or the side effects become too severe. Patient must be 18 years. Patient must have a diagnosis of BRAFV600E/K-mutated metastatic melanoma.

The purpose of this study is to compare the early treatment(before you have symptoms) of venetoclax and obinutuzumab (V-O) to the usual treatment of V-O after you have symptoms. This study will help the study doctors find out if this different approach is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach. Another purpose of this study is to find out how early V-O treatment affects patients' physical, social, and emotional well-being, compared to patients receiving the standard delayed V-O treatment. The antibody, obinutuzumab, and the drug, venetoclax are already approved by the FDA for use in patients with previously untreated CLL or SLL. Most of the time these drugs are not used until a patient has symptoms that make treatment necessary. Participants who decide to take part in this study will either get treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab (V-O) that starts before symptoms start (now), or participants will get treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab (V-O) that will start after symptoms start (later). For all patients, the treatment with V-O will continue for 12 months or until the cancer gets worse, or the side effects are too great. After treatment is finished, participants will be followed for up to 10 years after enrollment.

Most affect less than 1,000 people in the United States each year. Because these tumors are so rare, there are few proven therapies. This study will test whether the immunotherapy drug nivolumab is an effective treatment for people with rare CNS tumors. Objectives: To learn if stimulating the immune system using the drug nivolumab can shrink tumors in people with rare CNS (brain or spine) tumors or increase the time it takes for these tumors to grow or spread. Eligibility: Adults whose rare CNS tumor has returned. Design: Participants will be screened: At the start of the study, participants will have blood tests. They will answer questions about their symptoms and their quality of life. Participants will get nivolumab in a vein every 2 weeks for up to 64 weeks. Participants will have monthly blood tests. Every other month they will have an MRI and a neurologic function test. They will also answer questions about their quality of life. Genetic tests will be done on participants' tumor tissue. Participants will be contacted if any clinically important results are found. After treatment ends, participants will be monitored for up to 5 years. They will have a series of MRIs and neurological function tests. They will be asked to report any symptoms they experience.... NOTE: Based on the evidence cited in Nivolumab IB ver. 20, given that nivolumab is not a genotoxic agent, and that relevant systemic concentrations sufficient to produce a risk of fetal toxicity are not expected in WOCBP partners from exposure to a male participant s seminal fluid, male study participants will not be required to use contraceptive measures and/or a latex or other synthetic condom during sexual activity with a WOCBP partner. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Severe, active co-morbidity defined as follows: Unstable angina within the last 6 months prior to Step 2 registration.

The purpose of this study is to assess if the use of a 3D imaging device called the Clarix Imaging Volumetric Specimen Imager (VSI) can help guide and assist surgeons in identifying and removing all positive margins while in the operating room for breast conservation surgery. If you are undergoing breast conservation surgery and meet all criteria, the 3D imaging device, VSI, will be used to guide and assist the surgeon in identifying and removing all positive margins while in the operating room. The lumpectomy procedure will be performed per standard practice. If eligible, the lumpectomy procedure will be performed per standard practice. Promptly after excision, the tumor specimen will be imaged using the VSI device to take additional 3D images of the removed tissue during the standard of care surgery. During surgery, after the tumor has been removed, the investigators will use the VSI device to identify the margins on the main sample. The surgeon will use this information to remove additional tissue from the cavity. The surgeon will then complete the standard of care surgery according to standard of care practices which may include additional shaves of the remaining issue. The amount of tissue removed as a result of VSI-directed shaving will not be more than the amount that your surgeon would normally remove as part of standard of care. Participants will be asked to come for a post-operative visit as per standard of care and will be followed-up up to 2 months after surgery.

The purpose of this study is to see how well transplant works in adults with a mismatched unrelated donor using stem cells from a donor's blood. We'll look at how well the transplant treats your disease, what the side effects may be, and what your life looks like after your transplant. The study will also help us give better care to future patients. This study treatment does not include any investigational drugs. Before you begin the study, your doctor will review your test results to decide if it's safe for you to be in the study. If you join the study, you will have tests and evaluations to closely watch your health and safety. Most of these tests and evaluations are considered part of the standard care you would get if you receive a transplant and weren't in this study. You may have had some of them done already. Your study doctor will determine if any of these tests or procedures will need to be repeated for you to participate in the study. There are some surveys we will ask you to fill out before and after the transplant that are not part of routine care. The medicines and procedures in this study are also standard for transplant. You may still receive these medicines and procedures if you are not part of the study and receive a transplant. Transplant day On your transplant day (Day 0), the donor cells will be given to you through your central line, like a blood transfusion. The cells will travel to your bone marrow where they will start to make healthy, new blood cells after several weeks. After your transplant Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of transplant. It happens because of differences between the donated cells (graft) and your body's cells (host). Your new cells from your donor might see your body's cells as different and attack them. You'll get standard medicines to lower your risk of getting graft versus host disease (GVHD). You'll start these medicines around the time of your transplant, and continue taking them for many months afterwards. They may not completely prevent GVHD and you may need more medicines to treat GVHD if you develop it. The Survey Research Group (SRG) team of the Center for Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) will contact you to do the surveys 4 times during the 1 year you're in the study. Each survey will take between 15 and 25 minutes to complete. oBefore transplant oAbout 3 months after transplant oAbout 6 months after transplant oAbout 1 year after transplant Note: This is only a partial description of treatment.

The collected blood samples will be used for research projects to study the abnormal plasma cells and compare the results to current tests being done. This will provide an opportunity to better understand how a patient is responding to treatment and to assess the stage of the patient's disease. This study will use different tests that are not FDA approved. This test is being studied as a less invasive way to monitor amount of disease in a patient (versus invasive bone marrow biopsy). Current blood tests show the levels of the product of the cancer cell - not the levels of the cells themselves. Sometimes the cancer cells do not make this product and can therefore go undetected in standard tests. This study will show the number of cells. These tests will help identify, and analyze circulating plasma cells (CPCs), which are cells that have escaped into the bloodstream (a characteristic of plasma cell disorders). We will also look at any plasma cell components, such as genes in the DNA and RNA. Part of your samples will be used for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to evaluate any changes in your genes. NGS is a useful tool that determines the sequence of your DNA. You may be eligible for this research study if you have a plasma cell disorder.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an investigational drug, unesbulin. This study drug is used to treat unresectable (can't be removed with surgery) or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body), relapsed (has come back after treatment or refractory (did not respond to prior treatment) leiomyosarcoma along with Dacarbazine (DTIC). Dacarbazine is a drug that is United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of other types of cancer and recommended by the cancer treatment guidelines for sarcomas. Laboratory studies showed the combination of unesbulin and dacarbazine was significantly more effective than either agent alone in suppressing tumor growth. If the study requirements are met, patients will be assigned to one of the two groupgs: \u00b7 Unesbulin in combination with Dacarbazine: Subjects will receive Unesbulin twice a week in 3-week study treatment cycles, and Dacarbazine once every 21 days OR \u00b7 Placebo in combination with Dacarbazine: Subjects will receive placebo (pill with no active medicine) twice a week in 3-weeks study treatment cycles, and Dacarbazine once every 21 days. Twice the number of the subjects will be in the unesbulin arm vs the placebo. As a result, you are more likely to be on the unesbulin group than the placebo group. After treatment, the study doctor will also call you every 3 months via telephone for up to 2 years to monitor your health.

(xIRB NCI CIRB) ECOG-ACRIN 9213: A Phase II Study of Daratumumab-Hyaluronidase for Chemotherapy-Relapsed/Refractory Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) This study is being done to answer the following question:Can daratumumab-hyaluronidase reduce the level of MRD in T-ALL patients previously treated with chemotherapy?We are doing this study because we want to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for your ... This study is being done to answer the following question: Can daratumumab-hyaluronidase reduce the level of MRD in T-ALL patients previously treated with chemotherapy? We are doing this study because we want to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for your T-ALL. The usual approach is defined as care most people get for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The usual approach for patients who are not in a study is treatment with chemotherapy, and possibly stem cell transplant. Sometimes, combinations of these treatments are used. Currently there is no SOC treatment for MRD positive T ALL. Many patients if eligible would undergo stem cell transplant, but still have a high risk for T ALL relapse if MRD positive The purpose of this study is to test the good and bad effects of the drug called daratumumab and hyaluronidase. Daratumumab and hyaluronidase could be effective in preventing your cancer from returning, but it could also cause side effects. The study doctors hope to learn if the study drug will be effective in treating patients with MRD positive T-ALL and preventing reoccurrence of your disease.

The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug called Libtayo(cemiplimab) in patients with the diagnosis of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC,) when given before resection surgery. This investigational approach could shrink your cancer, but it could also cause side effects. Researchers hope to learn if the use of this drug before surgery will reduce the amount of cancer cells by at least 50% compared to the original amount in more than 40% of patients. Libtayo (cemiplimab) is FDA-approved to treat metastatic CSCC. Cemiplimab will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes in an outpatient setting. Cemiplimab will be used at a flat 350 mg IV dose every 21 days for a total of 9 weeks (or 12 weeks). One cycle is 21 days. After discontinuation of treatment, if the tumor is potentially resectable, the patient will proceed with surgical resection. Note: This is only a partial description of treatment. Please contact the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University for complete description of treatment.

NRG GU012: Randomized Phase II Stereotactic Ablative Unresected Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) Receiving Immunotherapy (SAMURAI) This phase II trial tests whether the addition of radiation to the primary tumor, typically given with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR), in combination with standard of care immunotherapy improves outcomes in patients with renal cell cancer that is not recommended for surgery and has spread to other places in ... This phase II trial tests whether the addition of radiation to the primary tumor, typically given with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR), in combination with standard of care immunotherapy improves outcomes in patients with renal cell cancer that is not recommended for surgery and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Radiation therapy uses high energy photons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses of radiation over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, ipilimumab, avelumab, and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Axitinib, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib are in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. They work by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Giving SABR in combination with standard of care immunotherapy may help shrink or stabilize the cancer in patients with renal cell cancer. Note: This is only a partial description of the study. Please contact the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University if you are interested in the trial.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ... This phase III trial compares the effects of nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy versus chemo-immunotherapy alone in treating patients with diagnosed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy may help treat patients with PMBCL. Note: This is only a partial description of the study.

(xIRB NCI CIRB) NRG GY026: A Phase II/III Study of Either Carcinoma Carcinosarcoma This usual chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) works to shrink tumors in patients with HER2 positive endometrial serous carcinoma or carcinosarcoma. Trastuzumab and monoclonal antibodies and forms ... This phase II/III trial tests adding usual chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) works to shrink tumors in patients with HER2 positive endometrial serous carcinoma or carcinosarcoma. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies and forms of targeted therapy that attach to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab or pertuzumab attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Hyaluronidase is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep pertuzumab and trastuzumab in the body longer, so that these medications will have a greater effect. Hyaluronidase also allows trastuzumab and trastuzumab/pertuzumab to be given by injection under the skin and shortens their administration time compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone. Paclitaxel is a taxane and in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Giving Herceptin Hylecta or Phesgo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin may shrink the tumor and prevent the cancer from coming back in patients with HER2 positive endometrial serous carcinoma or carcinosarcoma. Note: This is only a partial description of the study. Please contact the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University if you are interested in the trial. Some of the eligibility criteria include: \u00b7 Participants must have a diagnosis of Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 stage IA-IVB, or endometrial carcinosarcoma \u00b7 Participants must be 18 or older \u00b7 Patients must be within 8 weeks of primary surgery (or endometrial biopsy in patients who never undergo hysterectomy) at the time of study registration Note: This is only a partial list of eligibility criteria.

NU 22I05 Colon and rectal cancer are cancers that involve the lowest part of the digestive system: the large intestine and the rectum. A colorectal cancer that has already spread to distant sites by the time it is diagnosed is referred to as metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer (CRC). In colorectal cancer, ... Colon and rectal cancer are cancers that involve the lowest part of the digestive system: the large intestine and the rectum. A colorectal cancer that has already spread to distant sites by the time it is diagnosed is referred to as metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer (CRC). In colorectal cancer, mutations in the BRAF gene are present in approximately 10% of patients with metastatic disease. Outcomes in these patients are poor relative to patients with non-BRAF mutated colon cancer. Encorafenib and cetuximab are standard of care therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who have disease progression (worsening of disease) after a previous line of therapy. Addition of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with encorafenib has shown to overcome the tumor's resistance to encorafenib in laboratory studies. This study examines adding hydroxychloroquine to encorafenib and cetuximab in patients with worsening metastatic colon cancer on previous therapy. HCQ is an oral drug which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other indications such as for treatment of uncomplicated malaria, preventive against malaria in select geographic regions, and for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and chronic discoid lupus erythematosus in adults. It is not currently FDA approved for the indication to be investigated in this study. As such, hydroxychloroquine will be the drug to be investigated (investigational drug) in this study in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab. Another drug named Panitumumab is also FDA approved for treatment of metastatic CRC in combination with other standard therapy. Panitumumab may also be used instead of Cetuximab in the above-mentioned treatment combination, depending on the choice of your doctor.

(FORESEE Study) The FORESEE Study is a multi-center, prospective clinical trial enrolling patients with Breast or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who have suspicious or confirmed Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM). Standard of Care methods to diagnose, or assess the treatment response of LM (Clinical Evaluation, MRI and Cytology) have limited sensitivity ... The FORESEE Study is a multi-center, prospective clinical trial enrolling patients with Breast or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who have suspicious or confirmed Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM). Standard of Care methods to diagnose, or assess the treatment response of LM (Clinical Evaluation, MRI and Cytology) have limited sensitivity and specificity. This creates challenges for physicians to manage LM or determine the best course of treatment. CNSide, is a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT ) that is used commercially at the Physician's discretion in Biocept's CLIA certified, CAP accredited laboratory. CNSide can detect and quantify tumor cells in the CSF from patients with Breast Cancer or NSCLC having a suspicious or confirmed LM. The goal of the FORESEE Study is to evaluate the performance of CNSide in monitoring the LM's response to treatment and to assess the impact of CNSide on treatment decisions made by Physicians. CNSide is considered an experimental device as it has not been approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Note: This is only a partial description of the study. Please contact the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University if you are interested in the trial. Some of the eligibility criteria include: \u00b7 Participants must have been diagnosed with Breast Cancer or NSCLC who present with clinically suspected LM based on Investigator assessment of radiographic image, cytology, and clinical evaluation. \u00b7 Participants must be 18 or older Note: This is only a partial list of eligibility criteria.

The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how CGT9486 (also known as bezuclastinib) plus sunitinib affects gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) compared to just treatment with sunitinib along. You may participate in this study if you have received prior therapy with imatinib only and no other anticancer drug for GIST, and no other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Participants will receive study treatment during 28-day study treatment cycles. The total number of study treatment cycles you may have will depend on how you respond to your study treatment. If you respond well, meaning your GIST does not progress or become worse, you may continue to receive treatment in 28-day cycles for a year, or longer. If your GIST progresses, meaning it grows, spreads, or gets worse, you will no longer receive treatment with the study drug and the study doctor will review other treatment options that may be available to you outside the study. Once you have stopped taking study drug, and all safety and imaging studies are completed, you will be contacted every 3-6 months to see how you are doing for up to 5 years, or until the study is over, whichever happens first. This follow-up can be done over the phone or by other electronic means. Participants must have confirmed locally advanced, metastatic and/ or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and have documented disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib as determined by medical doctor.

A Randomized Phase II/III Trial of Modern Immunotherapy Based Systemic Therapy with or Without SBRT for PD-L1-Negative, Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer This phase II/III trial compares the addition of radiation therapy to the usual treatment (immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy) versus (vs.) usual treatment alone in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (advanced) or has spread to other places ... This phase II/III trial compares the addition of radiation therapy to the usual treatment (immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy) versus (vs.) usual treatment alone in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (advanced) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) whose tumor is also negative for a molecular marker called PD-L1. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a type of radiation therapy that uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. This method uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors with fewer doses over a shorter period and may cause less damage to normal tissue than conventional radiation therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin, pemetrexed, paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

This study is being done to answer the following question: In patients whose cancer is responding exceptionally well to hormonal medications, can stopping treatment allow for testosterone recovery while staying off treatment for 18 months or more? The usual approach for patients who are not in a study is to continue treatment with hormonal medications that decrease testosterone levels indefinitely. Patients who are not in a study usually continue potent oral hormonal medications that block growth signals from male hormones (like testosterone) until they stop working against their cancer, after which they would switch treatment to chemotherapy or other cancer-directed therapy. If you decide to take part in this study, you will stop both of your hormonal medications. You will resume them if you have any of signs of your cancer growing back. After you restart both hormonal medications, you will continue to be followed for symptoms and PSA/testosterone levels at least every 12 weeks beginning from restarting treatment and have scans at least every 24 weeks beginning from restarting treatment. You will stop the potent oral hormonal medication when your treating physician feels like it is no longer providing you benefit. After you stop this medication and start a new treatment, the study team will check on you at least every 24 weeks for up to 10 years to see what cancer treatments you have received and how you are doing. Participants must have advanced prostate cancer for which you have been receiving hormonal medications including 1) a medication to decrease testosterone levels in your body and 2) a potent oral hormonal medication to block growth signals from male hormones (like testosterone) in the cancer cells. Your cancer has been responding exceptionally well to this therapy and your doctor thinks that it is appropriate to take a break from these medications as part of this study.

This phase III trial compares the effect of the combination of ramucirumab and pembrolizumab versus standard of care chemotherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that is stage IV or that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody that may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial may help doctors find out if giving ramucirumab with pembrolizumab is more effective at treating patients with stage IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer than standard chemotherapy.

This phase II trial compares the combination of inotuzumab ozogamicin and chemotherapy to the usual chemotherapy in treating patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or Bcell a linked to a drug called CalichDMH. Inotuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD22 receptors, and delivers CalichDMH to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing them, stopping them from dividing, or spreading. Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin with chemotherapy may help shrink cancer and stop it from returning. The study subjects will either receive inotuzumab with lower doses of usual chemotherapy or get the usual chemotherapy treatment. In either treatment arm, study participants will receive two or more months (cycles) of more intensive chemotherapy. Both groups will continue with lower doses of chemotherapy for up to two years.

ETCTN 10538: Venetoclax In Combination with ASTX727, an All-ORal TherapY for Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia and Other MDS/MPN with Excess Blasts (VICTORY-MDS/MPN): a Randomized, Phase 2 Trial ... This phase II trial tests whether decitabine and cedazuridine (ASTX727) in combination with venetoclax work better than ASTX727 alone at decreasing symptoms of bone marrow cancer in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome /myeloproliferative neoplasm with excess blasts. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Cobimetinib is used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called BRAF. It is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. The combination of ASTX727 and venetoclax may kill more cancer cells in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative neoplasm with excess blasts.
