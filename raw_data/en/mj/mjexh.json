These include natural and home remedies such as ginseng and reducing alcohol consumption. Do these methods work, and are they safe? [Erectile dysfunction (ED)](/articles/5702.php) is a common condition that refers to a recurrent inability to get or maintain an erection of sufficient rigidity and duration for sexual intercourse. ED can be due to physical or psychological factors, such as problems with blood flow or anxiety over sexual performance. It is not uncommon to experience problems with erections occasionally. However, if it happens routinely and disrupts a person's life, they can try various treatments. This article discusses the various ED treatment options, including natural remedies, alternative medicine, and prescription drugs. It also explores their risks. ED happens when blood flow to the penis is limited. Determining its cause can help people find the most appropriate treatments. In some cases, ED has a physical cause, such as a treatable health condition or circulation problem. Treating any underlying conditions will help. People can take [steps to boost their circulation](/articles/320793), such as doing regular exercise, quitting [smoking](/articles/241302) if applicable, and making dietary changes. A doctor may also recommend prescription ED drugs, such as [sildenafil (Viagra)](/articles/viagra). ED can also happen due to stress, relationship factors, or emotional factors, such as [anxiety](/articles/323454), [depression](/articles/8933), or [trauma](/articles/trauma). Mental health treatments and relationship counseling can help. Some people also try natural or alternative treatments, including [over-the-counter (OTC) pills](/articles/317090), herbal remedies, and acupuncture. It is important to understand the possible risks associated with ED treatments, especially natural remedies, which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved. A person should speak with a doctor about treating ED. While many natural remedies for ED are available in stores and online, none have received FDA approval. The [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/all-natural-alternatives-erectile-dysfunction-risky-proposition) The [Urology Care Foundation](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urologic-conditions/erectile-dysfunction(ed)) agrees, saying that although supplements are popular and often cheaper than prescription drugs, they are not guaranteed to be safe or effective. There are very few studies on the safety of natural remedies for ED. Some remedies have side effects varying from mild to severe. Furthermore, a [2014 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4082836/) The following list looks at some common natural remedies that people use for ED: L-arginine [L-arginine](/articles/318174) is an amino acid, which is a building block of protein. It is a vasodilator, meaning that it can help open up the blood vessels. In theory, this could increase blood flow to the penis and help produce an erection. A study from [2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/andr.12293) However, scientific studies have not proven that taking L-arginine supplements can treat ED. More research is necessary before researchers know the safety and effectiveness of this remedy. People should avoid taking L-arginine alongside prescription ED drugs, such as Viagra, as this combination can cause blood pressure to drop too low. It can also lead to headaches or flushing. Side effects of L-arginine may include [nausea](/articles/320877), [stomach taking propionyl-L-carnitine alongside sildenafil could improve erectile function better than taking sildenafil alone. That said, more studies are needed before researchers know the actual safety and effectiveness of this treatment. Side effects are usually mild and can include a [skin rash](/articles/317999), nausea, [diarrhea](/articles/158634), and [heartburn](/articles/9151). This substance may not be safe for people with [vascular disease](/articles/257484), [high blood pressure](/articles/159283), Dehydroepiandrosterone [Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)](http://medicalnewstoday.com/articles/308684) helps create sex hormones, including [testosterone](/articles/276013) and [estrogen](/articles/277177). Natural DHEA levels decrease as a person gets older, which may cause a decrease in sexual function. While [some studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6119841/) [others](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02735.x) DHEA generally causes few side effects when people take it orally in recommended doses. Possible side effects can include [fatigue](/articles/248002), [headaches](/articles/73936), [acne](/articles/107146.php), and an [irregular heartbeat](/articles/8887). Ginkgo [Ginkgo biloba](/articles/263105) may increase blood flow to the penis, which could improve sexual desire and counter ED. However, the [ National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ginkgo) Side effects of this supplement include headaches, [dizziness](/articles/319026), [stomach upset](/articles/322047), [palpitations](/articles/318275), and [constipation](/articles/150322). It can also increase the risk of bleeding and may be dangerous for people taking blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin), or those with other [bleeding disorders](/articles/322260). Ginseng [Ginseng](/articles/262982.php), or Panax ginseng, is a popular home remedy. Certain chemicals in this plant may promote the relaxation of the body's smooth muscles, helping produce an erection. A [2012 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijir201245) The [most common](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/asian-ginseng) [insomnia](/articles/9155.php). Other side effects include increased heart rate, high or low blood pressure, and headaches. [Read more about ginseng and ED here.](/articles/316096) Yohimbine Yohimbine, the main component of an African tree's bark, is a traditional aphrodisiac. The [NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/yohimbe) Yohimbine hydrochloride, a different form of yohimbine, is available as a prescription drug for ED. This is a different product than dietary supplements made from tree bark. Studies have linked yohimbine with serious side effects, such as [heart attack](/articles/151444) and [seizures](/articles/seizure). Other side effects include stomach problems, anxiety, and high blood pressure. Horny goat weed Epimedium grandiflorum, also known as [horny goat weed](/articles/317023), is a traditional remedy for increasing [fertility](/articles/165748). A [2010 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3551978/) This supplement is often well-tolerated, but there is not enough evidence to support its use. Side effects can include nausea, [vomiting](/articles/vomiting), irregular heartbeat, and [dry mouth](/articles/187640). Certain activities or a lack of activity can affect ED. People who have not already adopted the following lifestyle measures may find that they improve the symptoms of ED: Regular exercise Exercise can benefit ED by improving blood pressure, blood flow, mood, and stamina. It is also an effective method for improving overall health. [Read about the best exercises for ED here.](/articles/exercises-for-erectile-dysfunction) A healthy diet A [healthy diet](/articles/153998) helps keep the circulatory system and the rest of the body healthy. Eating a varied, nutrient-rich diet reduces the risk of [heart disease](/articles/237191), [clogged arteries](/articles/321238), [obesity](/articles/323551), and diabetes, which are risk factors for ED. Reduce smoking and alcohol intake Smoking is a major risk factor for ED as it reduces blood flow to the penis. Drinking excess alcohol can also have an effect. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/moderate-drinking.htm) Reduce stress [Stress](/articles/145855.php) and anxiety can have a significant effect on sexual desire and erectile function. Common sources of stress include health, work, finances, and relationships. Read about [stress-relief products](/articles/stress-relief-products) and [natural ways to combat stress](/articles/322396) here. Some people try alternative therapies, such as [acupuncture](/articles/156488.php) and yoga, for ED. There are few studies available to support their effectiveness for the condition. However, they may help reduce stress, which could improve ED. People may also benefit from the [placebo effect](/articles/306437.php). A [2009 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19758285/) Prescription medications can increase blood flow to the penis. The four main FDA-approved drugs for ED are: known as [PDE5 inhibitors](/articles/list-of-pde5-inhibitors), relax the muscles in the penis to enhance blood flow. Side effects of prescription ED drugs can include: Prescription ED drugs are not safe for everybody, including people with very low blood pressure, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or liver or kidney disease. People who are taking nitrate-containing medications should also avoid these drugs. A person's psychology or emotional health can have a significant effect on sexual functioning, including ED. This includes mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety. Negative experiences in the past can also affect a person's current sexual functioning. Speaking with a [mental health professional](/articles/mental-health-professionals), such as a counselor or psychologist, can often help people overcome stresses and anxieties linked with sex, relationships, and other areas of life. Various physical devices can also help people get and maintain an erection. For instance, [vacuum devices](/articles/erectile-dysfunction-pump) are mechanical pumps that create an erection by drawing blood into the penis. Alternatively, people can try [ED rings](/articles/ed-ring), which are bands that a person places around the base of their penis to maintain an erection. A person should speak with a doctor if they are experiencing ED on a regular basis. If they would rather not speak with a doctor, people may wish to try home remedies, such as regular exercise, reducing [alcohol intake](/articles/305062), and avoiding smoking. They may also prefer to speak to a mental health professional and try talk therapy for ED. It is important to note that ED medication and natural remedies for ED can cause serious side effects. There is also a risk of interaction with existing medications. Therefore, a person should always speak with a doctor before consuming anything to treat ED. Below are some of the most common questions and answers about ED: Which foods help treat erectile dysfunction? There are no foods that help treat ED specifically. However, maintaining a varied and healthful diet may reduce some of the risk factors for ED. [Learn more about food and ED here.](/articles/foods-for-erectile-dysfunction) Can vitamins help with erectile dysfunction? There is evidence to suggest that some [vitamins](/articles/195878) may help with ED. However, further research is necessary. Furthermore, vitamins may only help to reduce symptoms of ED in people with a vitamin deficiency. [Learn more about vitamins and ED here.](/articles/vitamins-for-ed) How can I get ED medications without going to the doctor? A person will require a prescription for ED medication. However, they can use a [telemedicine](/articles/telemedicine-benefits) service instead of visiting a doctor in person. A person should not purchase any medication for ED from a service that does not require a prescription. There are many possible ways to treat the symptoms of ED, and the best options depend on the underlying cause. Where possible, a person should talk to a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements or OTC medications, as they can have side effects and interact with existing medications. The FDA does not approve OTC ED medications, which may be dangerous. A person should consider using prescribed treatments for ED or speaking with a doctor about alternative options. "}
