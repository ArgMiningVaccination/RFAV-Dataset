We are not helpless passengers in this machine that sometimes breaks down. The mind and body are intimately linked. Everything that happens in the body, including the digestive system, affects the mind. Everything that happens in the mind affects the body. This goes all the way down to our genes. Every gene is like a control panel at a music festival, with each being a slider switch. It's not fixed. Each gene is constantly adjusting itself depending on what's going on at that moment. Physically, mentally, emotionally, and environmentally I had a case this week which beautifully illustrates this truth. A woman had her first vaccination for COVID-19. She developed painful stiffness in her neck and pain in the back of her head, pressure in both under-jaw lymph nodes, and painful swallowing. This had been going on for over a week, and a visit to her chiropractor because of the neck and head pain, had brought no relief. When she came to me as her therapist, her 1st issue was a painful fear that these symptoms were from a blood clot. Even though her chiro had confirmed that she was okay and intellectually she knew she wasn't in danger. We did the usual setup shown on my website video, to prepare her for this work. Her fear was 7 out of 10. We then began our EFT Tapping on \"part of me is really afraid that my painful, stiff neck, and the pain up the back of my head might be a blood clot.\" We did two long rounds of that and a short round of Eden energy medicine tapping. At this point, to her amazement, her neck and head pain had disappeared. This took less than 10 minutes. The next issue was the pressure in the lymph nodes under her jaws and pain on swallowing. This was creating a 6/10 fear about what might be happening, because her friends hadn't experienced that. We set this up with \"even though I have this fear of what's happening with my lymph nodes, because my friends haven't experienced that, I'm going to accept myself anyway etc. Now we moved forward, with \"this fear of what's happening with my lymph nodes, because my friends haven't experienced this. What if there's something terrible. This fear of what's happening.\" After two rounds of Tapping, her fear was 0/10. Now, not only is the pain in her neck and up the back of her head gone, but the pressure in her right lymph node is also gone and that in her left is down to 4/10. Now tapping on \"this remaining pressure in her left lymph node\", it too went to 0/10. No pressure on either side. No pain on swallowing. She got a drink to test this further and after repeated swallows, managed to identify a very slight remaining pressure on the left side only, with no further pain from swallowing. We were running out of time, so finished with a reminder to her subconscious mind that there's no fight here. We're just collaborating. We used the setup: \"Even though I'm not yet finished with these old \"health worry\" programs I've had for so long, I'm going to accept myself. Even though I'm not yet finished with these old health worry programs that have carried for so long, I am going to accept myself. Including these parts of me that were trying to keep me safe the best way they thought they knew how ,with the information they had at the time when I was young.\" Once that setup was completed, we carried on going back and forth. \"I'm not yet finished, but I really changed these numbers. But that's crazy. How is that possible? But things really did change. I'm not yet finished with these old health fear programs etc.\" When she was finished, she felt an ahhhh!, relaxed moment because she'd reminded her subconscious. There's no fight here. We're just figuring out the rest of the story. Did we need that pressure? Did we need that pain? Should she have any parts of this return, it would not mean what she'd done hadn't held. They would just be different aspects and she could use the same process on those. This was a lovely example of how mind/body connections can hurt or heal. it's reassuring to know that we have that much authority over what happens in our own bodies. We are not helpless passengers in this machine that sometimes breaks down. I wish you all joy in this life that we get choose how we live. Until next time.
