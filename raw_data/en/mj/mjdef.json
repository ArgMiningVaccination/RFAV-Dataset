In Fremantle, Western Australia, and Adelaide, SouthAustralia, we conducted in-depth interviews from September 2013 -December 2015 with 29 parents who had refused or delayed some or all of their children's vaccines. Our qualitative analysis found that for many, their do-it-yourself ethic and personal agency was enhanced by self-directed CAM use, alongside (sometimes informal)CAM practitioner instruction. Reifying 'the natural, 'these parents eschewed vaccines as toxic and adulterating, and embraced CAM as a protective strategy for immune systems before, during and after illness. Users saw CAMas harm-free, and when it came to experiences that non-users might interpret as demonstrating CAM's ine ec- tiveness, they rationalised to the contrary. They also generally glossed over its pro t motive. CAM emerged as part of an expert system countering Western medicine. CAM's faces were trusted and familiar, and its cottagecapitalism appeared largely free from the taint of \"Big Pharma. \"A few parents employed a scienti c critique of CAM modalities -and a minority were dubious of its pro t motive -but others rejected the epistemology underpinning biomedicine, framing CAM as a knowledge not poisoned by avarice; a wisdom whose very evi- dence-base (anecdote and history) was demeaned by an arrogant scienti c process only permitting belief in that which could be quanti ed. However, all parents engaged with Western medicine for broken bones and, some- times, medical diagnoses. Our analysis suggests that pro-vaccination health professionals, policymakers andinformation-providers seeking to address the role of CAM in vaccine rejection face signi cant challenges due to the epistemic basis of some parents' decisions. However, we make some suggestions for professional practice and policy to enhance trust in vaccination. 1. Introduction Acceptance of vaccination is a major driver of uptake, along with issues of access, a ordability and awareness. Non-acceptance of vac- cination is a phenomenon that concerns global agencies. In 2012, a World Health Organisation (WHO) working group was formed to ad- dress vaccine rejection -named 'hesitancy '-recommending expanded research to capture factors at individual, community, contextual andorganizational levels ( World Health Organisation, 2014). One factor that interrelates with individuals' vaccine rejection is use of com-plementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (Eve Dube et al., 2013; Wardle et al., 2016). A national survey of Australian parents found thatobtaining information from alternative health practitioners was strongly associated with self-reported non-compliance with the vacci- nation schedule ( Chow et al., 2017 ). However, despite an unequivocal correlation, there has been little research that probes or challengesassumptions about causality in either direction. Causality may be ob- scured due to confounding factors; for example, income, education, and distrust of the medical system are associated with both CAM use and vaccine rejection ( Gaudino and Robison, 2012; Wardle et al., 2016 ). So, too, are high levels of agency and autonomy ( Browne et al., 2015; Ernst, 2001 ). How, then, can we best understand the relationship between CAM use and vaccine hesitancy or rejection?

Tto address the latter via policy, practice or campaigns? This paper ad- dresses this knowledge gap by exploring how vaccine rejecting and hesitant parents in two Australian cities present their use of CAM vis a vistheir vaccination decisions. Wardle et al. de ne complementary medicine as 'a diverse group of healthcare practices not generally considered part of the conventionalmedical curriculum '(2016, 2). Their literature review explored mod- alities including (but not limited to) acupuncture, aromatherapy,Chinese medicine, chiropractic, homeopathy and naturopathy. Pedersen (2013) describes alternative medicine as 'treatment not usually o ered within the ordinary health service and without public support or control, but o ered on a fee-for-service basis by non-au- thorised practitioners with varying types of training and certi cation. ' (p.56). While Pedersen's de nition makes a useful reference to the political economy of CAM -to which we will return -it is restrictive in focusing only on delivery by practitioners. By contrast, Wardle et al. (2016) distinguish between CAM as employed under the guidance of a specic practitioner, and CAM as self-prescribed and utilised, paying attention to both. The Cochrane collaboration de nition extends to considering \"accompanying theories and beliefs \"that travel with \"healing resources \"outside the \"politically dominant health system \" (Zollman and Vickers, 1999 , 693). We employ a very broad de nition to describe both the modalities of speci c practitioners and parent-di- rected use of supplements and traditional remedies. We focus speci - cally on parental perceptions and experiences of CAM, whilst re-cognising that parents undertake a much wider variety of activities to promote the health and wellbeing of their children. Finally, although CAM and biomedicine are distinct paradigms (or, as we will go on to characterize them, part of distinct expert systems), CAM is often a supplemental form of health care, rather than an alternative; many CAM users also use biomedicine ( Browne et al., 2015; Stokley et al., 2008 ). An Australian study found that 69% of a representative sample had visited a CAM provider in the last 12 months ( Xue et al., 2007 ), yet we know from Australia's vaccination coverage of 93% that most of the parents amongst this sample would still be vaccinating their children. Nevertheless, Australian data clearly shows that seeking vaccination information from CAM providers makes parents more likely to be vaccine hesitant or refusers ( Chow et al., 2017 ), hence the relationship invites deeper analysis. A spectrum of vaccine acceptance extends from active demand and full vaccination to complete rejection of all vaccines. Vaccine hesitancyfalls in the middle, where people may experience doubt and uncertainty and either fully or partially vaccinate. Parents in this study range from vaccine hesitant to vaccine rejecting. In a previous paper, we analysed how such parents view and (dis)trust expert systems pertaining to vaccination. This amounted to, in many cases, a rejection of Western medical epistemology itself and, consequently, some or all vaccines (Attwell et al., 2017). This article explores the flipside of this. Intimate with parents' distrust , we instead seek to understand their trust in al- ternative modalities. Accordingly, we have reanalysed the data to in-vestigate how and why parents used CAM, why they considered it benecial or trustworthy (unlike Western medicine) and how -if at all -they digested the notion that CAM, like pharmaceutical companies, operates for-pro t. We explore these factors in relation to individual parents 'rejection of some or all scheduled vaccines. 2. Methods Data were collected in Fremantle, Western Australia (WA) and Adelaide, South Australia (SA). The data arose from the collation oftwo, originally independent qualitative research projects, conducted by researchers who subsequently joined forces after identifying common project aims and methods (during the nal phase of data collection in SA). Both studies employed semi-structured interviews with parentswho were not vaccinating, partially vaccinating or had delayed some vaccinations for their children. All participants' reasons related topersonal choice rather than access, practical or logistic barriers. Amongother site-speci c questions, both studies explored perceptions of vac- cinations, vaccine preventable diseases, healthcare professionals andsocial systems, with a speci c focus on factors in fluencing parents' decisions. All parents were asked about vaccine related informationsources, family attitudes and their social milieu. In-depth, face-to-face interviews of more than an hour provided rich accounts of parents ' specic views, experiences and practices. Participants were incentivised with a $25 gift card (WA) and $30 cash (SA) and are referenced here with pseudonyms. Fremantle parents were interviewed by the lead author between September 2013 and April 2014 from postcodes surrounding the City of Fremantle, which at the time recorded full vaccine coverage rates at below 87 per cent for children under ve, compared to the Australian average of just over 90 per cent ( National Health Performance Authority, 2014). Parents with a child aged ve or under were recruited through posters, newspaper advertisements, social media and snow-balling, and screened to meet inclusion criteria of delay or refusal of recommended vaccines. Where possible, WA parents were interviewed twice -before and after a local vaccination social marketing campaign - but this was only possible for half the sample; one declined to be re-interviewed and three were recruited later. Adelaide (SA) parents were interviewed by PR once between October and December 2015. PR ap- proached potential participants at a suburban organic market and or- ganised initial interviews. On completion of interviews, which took place mainly in their homes, PR asked participants to share information leaflets within their social networks. The snowballed participants sub- sequently contacted PR, who were screening to check they had delayedor refused vaccination for their children. At both sites the informal snowballing method was a challenge for documenting self- and criteria- based exclusion. Researchers had aimed for 10 participants in WA and 20 in SA with these gures almost reached (9 and 20). The University of Western Australia and Flinders University Social and Behavioural Re- search Ethics Committee provided ethical approval for the projects under permit RA 4/1/5890 and project number 6976 respectively. Four di erences between the research sites and studies a ected the data; points two and three will be revisited. Firstly, WA parents were screened on whether they identi ed themselves as 'alternative lifestyle ', while the SA individuals were not asked this, but were recruited pre- dominantly through an organic market. Secondly, WA parents were asked another screening question to rule out those who identi ed as anti-vaccination, whereas the SA sample included several parents whorejected all vaccines. On this basis, the SA sample was a broader spectrum covering hesitant parents to anti-vaccination campaigners, while WA parents were more towards the hesitant/fence-sitter middle of the spectrum. Thirdly, while some SA interviews probed for CAM use and trust, CAM emerged spontaneously in WA both as a source of trust and distrust. The fact that CAM was a signi cant feature in both sites justied the re-examination of relevant data. Fourthly, but less sig- nicantly, while initially targeting parents of young children, those with older primary-school age children were later included in SA,skewing the age of participants vis a vis WA participants. The lead author (WA) and research assistants (WA and SA) tran- scribed the interviews verbatim. Following in-depth reading, the lead author developed an initial coding tree using QSR International's NVivo 10 Software. A broad CAM node was broken down to explore speci c theoretical insights arising from the literature exploring the relation-ship between trust and CAM, notably the work led by Pedersen (2013; Pedersen and Baarts, 2010; Pedersen et al., 2016 ). This way, we ex- tracted data elucidating current theories and also generated new in-sights. Transcripts of participants who reported distrust in aspects of CAM were reviewed with the aim of identifying di erences between them and CAM users, with attention paid to all parents' vaccine tra-jectories. Frequent discussions within the research team guided coding and recoding. This involved developing a visual representation of vaccination expert systems (as constructed by participants) that wouldK.
