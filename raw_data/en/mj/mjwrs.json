Background Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can be caused by psychological stress, chronic pain, and medication [ [1](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR1)]. A large number of insomnia patients are associated with different degrees of depression and anxiety [ [2](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR2)]. These symptoms can occur simultaneously with insomnia, resulting in decreased mental activity, memory loss, slow response, autonomic dysfunction, resulting in decreased immune function and memory loss [ [3](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR3)], Insomnia affects approximately 10-30% of adults worldwide [ [4](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR4)], and 6% are diagnosed with chronic insomnia [ [5](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR5)]. Drugs used to treat insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists, receptor sedative antidepressants [ [6](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR6)]. In addition, most of the current targets for anti-insomnia drugs are serotonin (5-HT) receptors [ [7](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR7)], -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors [ [8](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR8)]. However, taking these drugs will be accompanied by \"hangover\" effect, psychomotor disorder, drug dependence, addiction, tolerance, amnesia, rebound insomnia and other side effects, and their clinical efficacy is still controversial [ [9](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR9)]. Therefore, the research on new sedative and hypnotic drugs with fewer side effects and better efficacy is still continuing [ [10](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR10)]. Aromatherapy is currently used to treat chronic pain, depression, anxiety, insomnia, improve cognitive efficiency, relieve stress and other psychological and physiological conditions related disorders [ [11](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR11)]. Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils extracted from the flowers, stems, leaves, roots and fruits of various plants. It is absorbed by the body by oral, inhalation, diffusion, bathing and massage to improve mental and physical health [ [12](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR12)]. It has been reported that the main mechanism of aromatherapy may be related to the limbic system of the brain. Aroma components stimulate olfactory cells, which transmit signals to the brain and affect the autonomic nervous system and hormone secretion [ [13](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR13)]. Odor particles reach the limbic system through the olfactory nerve, producing sedative and relaxing effects that affect blood pressure, heart rate, memory and stress response [ [14](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR14)]. Essential oils act directly on the respiratory, circulatory and central nervous systems through the skin and respiratory tract [ [15](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR15)]. The chemical composition of many essential oils indicates that essential oils have a calming and hypnotic effect, but there is still a lack of systematic research on the sedative and hypnotic effects of essential oils. Some studies have shown that certain essential oils have sedative and hypnotic effects, including bergamot, sweet orange, valerian, lemon, rose, cedar and other essential oils [ [16](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR16)]. Lavender essential oils mainly include linalool and linalyl acetate. It has been reported that low-dose linalool has a sedative effect on human body by steam inhalation [ [17](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR17)]. Previous studies on aromatherapy to improve sleep used inhalation, massage, skin smear and other methods, using lavender, geranium, citrus, bergamot and marjoram and other essential oil mixture, these results also show that aromatherapy to improve sleep is significant [ [18](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR18)]. The use of essential oils may be a safe and effective treatment for or in the treatment of insomnia, which may reduce the overuse of prescription drugs and reduce the risk of sleep disorders affecting the health of the body in the short or long term [ [16](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR16)]. In addition, aromatherapy does not seem to have the side effects of many traditional psychotropic substances, which is clearly worthwhile for further clinical and scientific research [ [11](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR11)]. The clinical application of essential oils in aromatherapy has received more and more attention, and detailed research on the pharmacological activities of inhaled essential oils is increasingly needed. Inhalation is a fast and effective aromatherapy that induces central nervous system response in just 4 s. It uses respiration to start from the absorption of volatile molecules through the nasal mucosa, while volatile molecules enter the circulatory system after gas exchange into the lungs [ [19](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR19)]. The olfactory pathway not only conducts the sense of smell, but also regulates the memory, emotions, visceral activities, and advanced functions of the brain such as alertness and sleep through olfactory regulation. The neurotransmitter of olfactory transmission information and the Orexin neuronal system in the lateral region of the hypothalamus initiate neurons such as brain stem, basal forebrain, and producing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Serotonin (5-HT), etc. [ [20](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR20)]. These transmitters are closely related to the pathogenesis of insomnia and other diseases. Inhalation administration is a nondestructive way of administration, which minimizes toxic and side effects. Therefore, it may be an effective way to control and treat insomnia and other psychiatric diseases. In many cases, the role of a single medicine is limited and cannot completely solve the complex and multivariate conditions of insomnia patients. Insomnia is caused by a variety of pathogenic factors. Insomnia patients are usually accompanied by different degrees of depression and anxiety. Therefore, the use of a single essential oil maybe only achieves the effect of sedative and hypnosis, and cannot completely solve the problem of sleep disorders. Multi-herb therapy basing on Traditional Chinese Medicine theory is one of the most important characteristics of Traditional Chinese Medicine clinical practice [ [21](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR21), [22](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR22)]. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that insomnia is caused by dysfunction of organs. Clinically, it is more common in patients with Insomnia due to liver depression, which is the main cause of insomnia [ [23](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR23)]. Qi-regulating drugs have the effect of dispersing stagnated liver qi to relieve depression, and thus may be an effective medicine for treating insomnia [ [24](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR24)]. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Sweet orange, Sandalwood, Rose, Frankincense, Agarwood, Orange blossom are Qi-regulating drugs [ [23](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR23), [24](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR24)], which have the effect of dispersing stagnated liver qi to relieve depression. Sweet orange (Orange peel) and Agarwood are classic Herb pairs, which have the effect of relieving qi stagnancy in liver and resolving stagnation for tranquilization. From the perspective of Western medicine, Lavender [ [25](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR25), [26](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR26)] has sedative-hypnotic effects and anti-anxiety effects, Sandalwood [ [27](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR27)] and Agarwood [ [28](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR28)] have sedative-hypnotic effects, Sweet orange [ [29](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR29)], Rose [ [30](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR30)], Frankincense [ [31](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR31)] and Orange Blossom all have anti-depression effects. In this study, the Lavender essential oil, a commonly used in the treatment of insomnia, was combined with the Qi-regulating drugs' essential oil to prepare the Compound Anshen essential oil and its effect on sedative and hypnotic effects with inhalation administration were studied. Based on the theory of aromatherapy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, this experiment is aiming at treating insomnia from the perspective of relieving qi stagnancy in liver and resolving stagnation for tranquilization. The purpose of the study is to investigate the potential treatment on insomnia of Compound Anshen essential oil. Methods Animals ICR mice aged 6-8 weeks, half male and half female, weighing 25-35 g, provided by Jiangsu Jicui Yaokang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. License number: SCXK (su) 2018-0008.

Low temperature high speed centrifuge (2K15C, SIGMA, Germany). Microplate reader (Gene Co., Ltd. Elx800). Establishing mice models of insomnia Experimental animals except for the control group were given intraperitoneal injection of PCPA to induce animal insomnia. PCPA is an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase (TDH), and neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT). Speed enzyme, so PCPA deprives sleep by blocking 5-HT. Therefore, PCPA is used to deprive sleep by blocking 5-HT. Each mouse was accurately weighed to PCPA according to the amount of 300 mg/kg, and was mixed with weak alkaline saline to prepare a suspension. After continuous injection for 2 days, after the first intraperitoneal injection for 28-32 h, the circadian rhythm disappeared and the day and night activities continued, indicating successful modeling. Grouping and treatment 48 mice were randomly divided into 6 groups. This experiment consisted of control group, model group, diazepam group, and Compound Anshen essential oil groups (low-dose group, medium-dose group, high-dose group). After the establishment of the PCPA insomnia model, the model group did not implement the inhalation of essential oil intervention, in which the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups were daily aromatherapy for 7 consecutive days, 60 min per day. The essential oil was diluted with 1% Tween 80 Solution. The concentration of low, medium, and high doses of Compound Anshen essential oil was 1 \u00d7 10 3, 2 \u00d7 10 3, 4 \u00d7 10 3. The inhalation time was set at 8:00-16:00 daily. Diazepam was prepared into a solution of 0.1 ml/10 g with distilled water. The diazepam group was given diazepam solution by gavage for 7 consecutive days, and the dose was 1 mg/kg (the dose was converted into the dose of mice by body surface area according to the adult dose). The control group, model group, and each Compound Anshen essential oil groups were given the same volume of distilled water by gavage. Weight changes in mice Mice were weighed before the establishment of the PCPA insomnia model and at the end of the experiment, and the weight gain was calculated. Open field test After the final aromatherapy or drug administration for 30 min, mice in each group were subjected to an open field test. The mice were acclimated to the environment for 5 min, and the behavioral parameters were counted within 3 min, and the differences between the mice in each group were compared. Autonomous activity test index: Total movement distance, unit: cm; Maximum velocity, unit: s; Number of arm lifting. Pentobarbital-induced sleeping Mice in each group were intraperitoneally injected with a threshold dose of pentobarbital sodium of 45 mg/kg after the final aromatherapy or 30 min of administration. After the administration, the righting reflex of the mice disappeared for 1 min as the index of falling into sleep. The time from the injection of the drug to the disappearance of the righting reflex was latency of sleeping time, the time that the righting reflex disappeared until the recovery was duration of sleeping time, and latency of sleeping time and duration of sleeping time were recorded. Analysis of brain neurotransmitters After the open field test was completed, the mice were fasted for 6 h. The mice in each group were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the skull was removed, brain tissue was exposed, and the brain tissue was completely removed. After separating the brain, the blood and tissues were washed in ice-cold PBS buffer and weighed with an electronic balance. The mouse brain was placed in a centrifuge tube, and a certain amount of PBS buffer was added thereto, thoroughly homogenized, centrifuged (3000 r/min, 20 min), and the supernatant was taken. After treatment with the mouse 5-HT and GABA ELISA kits, the 5-HT and GABA contents were measured at 450 nm on a microplate reader.

In this experiment, the sedative and hypnotic effects of inhaling Compound Anshen essential oil were studied. Compared with the model group, mice in the low-dose group, the medium-dose group, the high-dose group and the diazepam group had glossy hair color, normal circadian rhythm and significantly increased body mass, among which the dose group had the best performance. To study the effects of inhaling Compound Anshen essential oil on spontaneous activity and pentobarbital-induced latency of sleeping time and duration of sleeping time in mice, the results showed that Compound Anshen essential oil could significantly reduce the autonomic activity. In general, decreased autonomic activity in mice indicates a sedative effect of the drug, and this change in behavior is thought to reflect a decreased excitability of the central nervous system. The inhibitory effect on autonomic activity indicates that Compound Anshen essential oil has a sedative and inhibitory effect on excitability. At the same time, Compound Anshen essential oil has synergistic effect with pentobarbital, reduce latency of sleeping time and prolong duration of sleeping time show the hypnotic effect of Compound Anshen essential oil. Dysfunction of 5-HT, GABA and other neurotransmitters is closely related to insomnia. It has been reported that therapeutic drugs induce sedation and hypnosis by regulating neurotransmission, such as the 5-HTergic system or GABAergic system in the central nervous system [ [32](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR32)]. Therefore, the analysis of 5-HT and GABA levels in the brain is of great significance for the detection of drugs for the treatment of insomnia [ [7](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR7)]. Serotonin (5-HT) plays a key role in sleep-wake regulation [ [33](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR33)]. Serotonin is thought to be a sleep neurotransmitter that produces sleep by inhibiting the midbrain's reticular activating system or the norepinephrine component of the blue spot [ [34](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR34)]. Conversely, PCPA, a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, consumes 5-HT, leading insomnia. After 24-36 h, PCPA had a strong inhibitory effect on 5-HT synthesis [ [35](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR35)]. GABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central neurosystem (CNS). GABA receptor system plays a major inhibitory role in the brain and plays a crucial role in regulating the overall balance between neuron excitation and inhibition [ [36](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR36)]. Neurons in the front of the hypothalamus release GABA, which inhibits areas of the hypothalamus and brainstem that promote wakefulness [ [37](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR37)]. Dysfunction or deficits in the GABAergic system are associated with epilepsy, pain and anxiety [ [38](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR38)]. The GABAergic neurotransmitter plays a key role in sleep regulation. The BZD binding site on GABAA receptor is the target of most sedative and hypnotic drugs [ [39](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR39)]. Barbiturates, such as pentobarbital, act on ion group complexes of GABA receptors, which are favorable for GABA binding. Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, increase the affinity of GABA to its receptors, thereby increasing the duration of pentobarbital induced sleep [ [40](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR40)]. It has been suggested that essential oil components play a sleep promoting role by regulating the 5-HTergic system or GABAergic system [ [41](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR41)]. Therefore, the effect of Compound Anshen essential oil on the levels of 5-HT and GABA in the brain is of great significance for evaluating the pharmacodynamics of Compound Anshen essential oil for the treatment of insomnia. In addition to the above reasons, this experiment uses the PCPA insomnia model, because PCPA is a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, consumes 5-HT, leading to insomnia, detection of brain 5-HT levels can reflect the successful establishment of insomnia model. In this study, the levels of 5-HT and GABA in the brain were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that the low-dose, middle-dose and high-dose groups of the Compound Anshen oil showed different degrees of 5-HT up-regulation and GABA up-regulation in a dose-dependent manner. The of 5-HT and GABA in the middle-dose and high-dose groups were similar to those in the control group and higher than those in the diazepam group. Therefore, the inhalation administration of the Compound Anshen essential oil can significantly increase the levels of 5-HT and GABA in the brain. From the experiment of weight change and the analysis of brain neurotransmitter level, the effect of Compound Anshen essential oil inhalation on insomnia is better than that of diazepam. It can be seen that inhalation of Compound Anshen essential oil may be a safe and effective treatment for or adjuvant treatment of insomnia, which may reduce the excessive use of prescription drugs such as diazepam and reduce the risk of short-term or long-term effects on sleep health. Its deeper sedative and hypnotic mechanism needs further study. On this basis, the composition of Compound Anshen essential oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 30 chemical constituents were identified, accounting for 93.39% of total volatile oil. The main components of Compound Anshen essential oil are esters, alcohols, alkenes, alkyls and other and -Santalol [ [45](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR45)] have been reported to have central nervous sedative effect. In addition, D-limonene has anti-anxiety and soothing effects [ [46](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR46)], Linalool has and effects anti-anxiety [ [48](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR48)] and stress-relieving effects [ [49](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR49)]. It is speculated that the sedative and hypnotic effect of Compound Anshen essential oil is related to its main chemical composition and activity. Based on the network pharmacology, the active components, targets and pathways of the Compound Anshen essential oil were predicted. The results of the network pharmacology analysis were published [ [50](/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2732-0#ref-CR50)]. Among the volatile chemical constituents of the compound anshen essential oil traced by GC-MS, the active ingredients related to insomnia were screened and the relevant targets and pathways were predicted. The study found that Dibutyl phthalate, Caryophyllene, Geranyl acetate, Linalool, -Terpineol, and Terpinen-4-ol played a key role in the treatment of insomnia in the Compound Anshen essential oil. The chemical components with the highest content tracked by GC-MS were D-Limonene, Linalyl acetate, -Pinene, which were also correlated with treatment of insomnia. It is predicted that the compound anshen essential oil mainly exerts pharmacodynamic effects through related ligand-receptor interaction, Cholinergic synapse, GABAergic synapse and other pathways. Based on the network pharmacology method, the active ingredients of the Compound Anshen essential oil have sedative, hypnotic, anti-anxiety and anti-depression effects, and the correlation between the active ingredients and the target and pathway. To some extent, the reliability of the study on the sedative and hypnotic effects of the Compound Anshen essential oil and the reliability of the GC-MS analysis of the chemical components were confirmed. Conclusion The study found that the inhalation of Compound Anshen essential oil has sedative and hypnotic effect, which can significantly reduce autonomic activities, shorten latency of sleeping time and prolong duration of sleeping time, increase 5-HT and GABA content in the brain. The main chemical components of Compound Anshen essential oil contain many kinds of chemical components which have the sedative and hypnotic effect on the nerve center, anti-anxiety effect and anti-depression effect.
