CARRIES 5-0. (Absent: Schabel , Pinzon ) Value -based 4 Topic: GAP Report \u2014Expanded Carrier Screening Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Public testimony 1) Peggy Flanigan, parent : Ms. Flanigan testified she is a carrier of the fragile X gene and was unaware of her carrier status when her daughter was born in the 1980s. Her daughter is also a carrier. There are effects for female carriers as well as for boys affected by fragile X. She wanted to bring awareness to screening for rare genetic disorders. She testified that discovering her carrier status influenced her decision to not have additional children. 2) Taylor Kane , Executive Director of Remember the Girls : Ms. Kane testified she is a c arrier of a rare genetic disorder. Knowledge of her carrier status has empowered her in terms of reproductive planning. She wanted to stress that l earning of one's carrier status is not overwhelming, rather it is empowering. 3) Ashley Svenson , genetic counselor with Myriad Genetics (manufacturer ): Ms. Svenson expressed support for the proposed changes which align with ACMG's recommendation. Ms. Svenson said t hese changes will help to eliminate racial bias in testing. 4) Yael We instein , genetic co unselor in Springfield , Oregon : Ms. Weinstein testified that expanded carrier screening is the only approach that allows adequate screening for patients. Not using the expanded carrier screening approach gives the patient a false -negative result. In her experience, she educates couples on their results. She can offer consults by phone. In many cases, she sees patients who have only a partial carrier screening and then needs to do additional testing. Her clinic uses a panel of 176 genes. Many screens use 14 -20 conditions. In her opinion, Oregon has the resources to offer and counsel for expanded carrier screening. 80% of children born with genetic conditions have no family history. She also noted that the labs have genetic counselor s available to assist patients/families. She will send information on the specific panels she uses in her practice to HERC staff to distribute to members. 5) Samantha Coover, parent : Ms. Coover testified she has a son with fragile X syndrome but she w as never offered prenatal screening. Expanded carrier screening could have helped her by allowing her to get early interventions in place for her child from infancy. 6) Mike Flanigan , parent : Mr. Flanigan testified that e xpanded carrier screening will reach so many more pa tients. Genetic counseling is now more available than ever due to telehealth and other advances developed during the pandemic. 7) Haywood Brown , OB/GYN and Medical Director for ACCESS ( carrier screening advocacy group ): Dr. Brown testified that an expansion in screening is a very powerful tool. He a greed with the GAP recommendation and felt it is more equitable coverage . The subcommittee members discussed that there is increased access to genetic counseling with telehealth. Hodges expressed concerns about large panels being marketed to providers that give results that are very difficult to interpret. She also expressed concern for the cost ($7 ,000 in some cases). She expressed concerns about families that decide to not have children due to a mutation that the medical community does not understand. She also expressed concern about how to operationalize the proposed guideline as it will be difficult for reviewers to deter mine if the panel being ordered meets the guideline criteria. Pinzon noted that genetic counselors should be involved in this testing, especially for larger panels. Olson noted that the guideline offers a path to coverage rather than a mandate for coverage . Pinzon suggested revisiting this topic and analyzing utilization of this technology in a year or so. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 11-18-2021 Page 5 There was a suggestion to add reference to the 2021 ACMG guideline to the prenatal and non -prenatal guidelines which was accepted . HERC staff will consider additional edits to the guideline to specify which tables in the guideline should be included as a possible consent agenda item in the future. Recommended Actions: 1) Remove CPT 81443 from line 662 CONDITIONS FOR WHICH CERTAIN INTERVENTIONS ARE UNPROVEN, HAVE NO CLINICALLY IMPORTANT BENEFIT OR HAVE HARMS THAT OUTWEIGH BENEFITS 2) Remove the entry for CPT 81443 from Guideline Note 173 as shown in Appendix A 2) Advise HSD to add CPT 81443 to the Diagnostic Procedures File 3) Modify Diagnostic Guideline D1 and Diagnostic Guideline D17 as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as amended. CARRIES 7 -0. Topic: GAP Report \u2014Whole Genome Sequencing Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Public t estimony 1) John Fox , pediatrician , former medical director of a Michigan state health plan in Michigan, and current employee of Illumina (manufacturer) : Dr. Fox testified that there is a large unmet need in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. He said that w hole exome is similar in cost to whole genome sequencing. Michigan found clinical utility in WGS as it changes management in 95% of patients as well as chang es reproduct ive decisions. Without WGS, m icroarray testing is generally done first, which adds cost. Michigan decided to add cover age for WGS as it is overall less expensive. In his health plan, the cost of WGS was $5,100 v ersus $4,900 for whole exome sequencing. Hodges noted that her CCO is approving this test by exception in complex cases. There was discussion about GAP wanting limited coverage as the medical community is just starting to understand the correct utilization for WGS. Recommended Actions: 1) Remove CPT 81425 -81427 (Genome sequence analysis) from line 662 CONDITIONS FOR WHICH CERTAIN INTERVENTIONS ARE UNPROVEN, HAVE NO CLINICALLY IMPORTANT BENEFIT OR HAVE HARMS THAT OUTWEIGH BENEFITS 2) Delete the entry on CPT 81425 -81427 from GN173 as shown in Appendi 3) Advise HSD to add CPT 81425 -81427 to DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES file 4) Modify Diagnostic Guideline D1 as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7-0. Topic: GAP Report \u2014NCCN Reference Update Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. There was no discussion about this item . Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 11-18-2021 Page 6 Recommended Actions: 1) Modify Guideline Note 3 as shown in Appendix A 2) Modify Diagnostic Guideline D25 as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7-0. Topic: OHAP Report \u2014Straightforward Items Discussion: There was no discussion about CDT code placement, porcelain crowns, or non - restorative caries treatment. Recommended Actions: 1) Add a new guideline as shown in Appendix B 2) 2022 CDT code placement as shown in Appendix C 3) Add CDT D2740 ( Crown - porcelain/ceramic ) to line 469 DENTAL CONDITIONS (E.G., CARIES, FRACTURED TOOTH) Treatment: ADVANCED RESTORATIVE (I.E., BASIC CROWNS) a. Remove CDT D2740 from line 592 DENTAL CONDITIONS (E.G., CARIES, FRACTURED TOOTH) Treatment: ADVANCED RESTORATIVE -ELECTIVE (INLAYS, ONLAYS, GOLD FOIL AND HIGH NOBLE METAL RESTORATIONS 4) Modify GN91 as shown in Appendix A MOTI ON: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7-0. Topic: OHAP Report \u2014Handicapping Malocclusion Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Allen echoed the concerns regarding implementation and cost but noted that these are beyond the HERC's purview. The index scoring requires a referral to an orthodontist for determin ation . The benefit would need to be c oordinated between CCOs and DCOs for patients who need craniofacial surgery. Public t estimony a) Christian Moller- Anderson, Executive Director for Smile for Kids (orthodontics non -profit ): Mr. Moller -Anderson testified that s tate Medicaid programs are required to cover dental treatment, including handicapping malocclusion. There is a massive barrier to health for low income populations with non -coverage, which goes against OHA's triple aim. Without equitable access to orthodontic care, low income kids have d eleterious health outcomes . b) Manu Chaudhry , dentist and President of Capital Dental Care : Dr. Chaudhry testified that he initially supported moving this forward at the OHAP meeting. However, he has since revised his position on this issue . Dental disease that is caused by handicapping malocclusion is worsen ed when treatment is applied and there is a lack of pristine hygiene post -treatment. He recommended against adding this as a benefit currently and felt cost could be better spent to address and prevent inequities in oral health. Allen asked Chaudhry about his experience with handicapping malocclusion under the California model , which C haudhry helped to implement treatment during his time as a dental director in Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 11-18-2021 Page 7 California. Chaudhry noted that kids had high rates of no -shows and extended treatment, which resulted in extensive dental disease/tooth decay from the braces. Chaudhry also stated that orthodontists in Oregon may not take Medicaid and that the s coring systems are extremely subjective. Allen noted that there is an inadequate network of orthodontists and an inadequate infrastructure to administer this benefit. His recommendation is to implement this as a biennial review item which would start Janu ary 1, 2024. Kaz Rafia, the OHA De ntal Director, was invited to address the subcommittee regarding the challenges of implementation. Dr. Rafia noted that all other states have implemented this and their experiences can be useful for Oregon to find what works well and what does not. Handicapping malocclusion does not have adequate evidence that it increases dental decay. His recommendation is to move forward but he did not have a preference for implementation date. Pinzon noted the psychological component to handicapping malocclusion that has not been addressed. Hodges noted that oral surgeons do not contract with CCOs in many cases, so there is a need for indi vidu al contracts when patients ne ed them. Recommended Actions (effective January 1, 2023 : 1) Rename line 256 DEFORMITIES OF HEAD AND HANDICAPPING MALOCCLUSION Treatment CRANIOTOMY/CRANIECTOMY; ORTHODONTIA 2) Modify GN 169 as shown in Appendix A 3) Add the following ICD -10 codes to line 256 Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 11-18-2021 Page 8 ICD-10 Code Code description K00.1 Supernumerary teeth K00.2 Abnormalities of size and form of teeth K00.5 Hereditary disturbances in tooth structure, not elsewhere classified K00.6 Disturbances in tooth eruption K00.9 Disorder of tooth development, unspecified M26.211 Malocclusion, articulation M26.25 Anomalies of interarch distance M26.29 Other anomalies of dental arch relationship M26.31 Crowding of fully erupted teeth M26.33 Horizontal displacement of fully erupted tooth or teeth M26.34 Vertical displacement of fully erupted tooth or teeth M26.35 Rotation of fully erupted tooth or teeth M26.36 Insufficient interoc clusal distance of fully erupted teeth (ridge) M26.37 Excessive interocclusal distance of fully erupted teeth M26.4 Malocclusion, unspecified M26.70 Unspecified alveolar anomaly Z46.4 Encounter for fitting and adjustment of orthodontic device MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7-0. Topic: OHAP Report \u2014Dental Screening Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Rafia noted that this service is essential to the primary care practice. Pinzon noted that as a nurse she routinely looks at the mouth and appreciates adding this code. Hodges noted that this code was used by some CCO s to encourage implementation and utilization of the First Tooth program and strongly recommended adding the code to line 3. Allen noted that this issue is neither controversial nor costly. He noted that CDT D0191 can be used by non -dental professionals u sing First Tooth and similar programs. He noted that this code could be used for mass screenings, which would be problematic. The DCOs wanted guardrails around use to prevent use in mass screenings. Hodges noted that this code is part of dental metrics. Recommended Actions: 1) Add CDT D019 0 (Screening of a patient ) to line 3 PREVENTION SERVICES WITH EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS MOTION: To recommend t he code change as presented. CARRIES 7 -0. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 11-18-2021 Page 9 Topic: BHAP report Discussion: There was minimal discussion regarding any of the BHAP report items. Recommended Actions: 1) Add ICD -10-CM F51.5 ( Nightmare disorder) to Line 173 POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER a. Remove ICD -10 F51.5 from line 606 DISORDERS OF SLEEP WITHOUT SLEEP APNEA 2) Advise HSD to add H0022 (Alcoho l and/or drug intervention service (planned facilitation) ) to the DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE file 3) Advise HSD to add HCPCS H0043 ( Supported housing, per diem to the Excluded File 4) Add HCPCS H2032 ( Activity therapy, per 15 min ) to line 4 SUBSTANCE USE DISOR DER 5) Add HCPCS H2036 ( Alcohol and/or other drug treatment program, per diem ) to line 4 SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER 6) For implementation January 1, 2022: a. Add ICD -10-CM F94.0 (Selective mutism) to Line 414 OVERANXIOUS DISORDER; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; ANXIETY DISORDER, UNSPECIFIED i. Remove F94.0 from line 474 SELECTIVE MUTISM b. Strike through line 474 SELECTIVE MUTISM 7) For implementation January 1, 2024: a. Delete line 474 SELECTIVE MUTISM MOTION: To recommend the code and line changes 6-0. (Absent: was no discussion about any of the 2022 CPT or (CPT 43497) : Hodges requested a more specific guideline note, similar to the commercial guidelines reviewed. The subcommittee agreed to adopt the wording from the PacificSource policy as modified by HERC staff. 2) Rapid culture (CPT 87154): The group discussed briefly the possible utility of this test in reducing antibiotic use and resistance. The subcommittee elected to follow the staff recommendation of placement on line 662/GN173. 3) New vaccine codes (CPT 90759): Hodges expressed co ncern that these tests would not be visible to health plans and providers if placed on the Excluded file. Staff noted that these vaccines do not have evidence of ineffectiveness which would warrant placement on either line 502 or 662; however, they do not have ACIP approval and therefore cannot be covered. The best placement was determined to be the Excluded F ile. NOTE: The intent of the VBBS is that these codes be added to line 3 PREVENTION SERVICES WITH EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS when/if they receive ACI P approval (other than the Ebola vaccine code which is a travel vaccine). Recommended Actions: 1) Place the 2022 CPT codes as shown in Appendix C 2) Modify GN148 as shown in Appendix A 3) Modify GN173 as shown in Appendix A Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 11-18-2021 Page 10 4) Add HCPCS G0424 (Pulmonary rehab) to line 399 INFLUENZA, NOVEL RESPIRATORY VIRUSES 5) Adopt a new guideline as shown in appendix B 6) Modify Diagnostic Guideline D1 as shown in Appendix A 7) Modify Diagnostic Guideline D17 as shown in Appendix A 8) Place HCPCS C1832 ( Autograft suspension, including cell processing and application, and all system components ), C1833 ( Monitor, cardiac, including intracardiac lead components (implantable) ) and G0465 (Autologous platelet rich plasma (prp) for diabetic chronic wounds/ulcers, using an fda -cleared device (includes administration, dressings, phlebotomy, centrifugation, and all other preparatory procedures, per treatment) ) on line CONDITIONS FOR WHICH CERTAIN INTERVENTIONS ARE UNPROVEN, HAVE NO CLINICALLY IMPORTANT BENEFIT OR HAVE HARMS THAT OUTWEIGH BENEFITS NOTE: after the November 18, 2021 meeting, ACIP recommendations for coverage of PCV15 and PCV20 (CPT 90671 and 90677) were identified and per VBBS/HERC intent, these codes were added to line 3 PREVENTION SERVI CES WITH EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS for 1/1/22. MOTION: To recommend the code placements, code changes, and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 6-0.

There was a q uestion about relative cost compared to other treatments. Hodges replied that this treatment is equivalent or less costly than current covered treatments for varicose veins. Public testimony 1) Alissa Doth, representing Medtronic (manufacturer) : Ms. Doth presented a slide set and agree d with staff recommendations. Her slide set included multiple private payers that are currently covering cyanoacrylate ablation. She also noted that in addition to the positive NICE review, there is a p ositive BCBS TEC review as well. Recommended Actions: 1) Add 36482 -36483 (Endovenous ablation therapy of incompetent vein, delivery of a chemical adhesive (eg, cyanoacrylate) ) to lines 379 CHRONIC ULCER OF SKIN; VARICOSE VEINS WITH MAJOR COMPLICATIONS and 639 VARICOSE VEINS OF LOWER EXTREMITIES WITHOUT ULCER OR OTHER MAJOR COMPLICATION 2) Delete CPT 36482 -36483 from line 662 CONDITIONS FOR WHICH CERTAIN INTERVENTIONS ARE UNPROVEN, HAVE NO CLINICALLY IMPORTANT BENEFIT OR HAVE HAR MS THAT OUTWEIGH BENEFITS 3) Modify GN173 as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as presented.

Olson asked whether the guideline modifications would apply to a normal child when lack of treatment might result in harms to growth. Gingerich responded that it would apply but noted treatments were subject to medical necessity review. Gingerich gave the example of a non -sedating antihistamine for allergic rhinitis as now having a pathway to coverage if a sedating antihistamine impairs school function. Recommended Actions: 1) Mod ify Statement of Intent 4 as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 6-0.

Appendix A Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 11- 18-2021 Appendix A Revised Guideline Notes STATEMENT OF INTENT 4: ROLE OF THE PRIORITIZED LIST IN COVERAGE The Commission makes its prioritization decisions based on the best available published evidence about treatments for each condition. The Prioritized List prioritizes health services according to their importance for the popula tion served and the legislature determines where to place the funding line on the Prioritized List. The Commission recognizes that a condition and treatment pairing above the funding line does not necessarily mean that the service will be covered by the Oregon Health Plan (OHP). There may be other restrictions that apply, such as the service not being medically necessary or appropriate for an individual member. Likewise, the absence of a treatment and condition pairing above the funding line is not mean t to be an absolute exclusion from coverage. Coverage may still be authorized under applicable federal and state laws, and Oregon's Medicaid State Plan and Waiver for an individual member. For example, OAR 410 -141-0480 3820 (Oregon Health Plan Benefit Package of Covered Services) includes services such as, but not limited to, the following: Diagnostic services, subject to the List's diagnostic guideline notes when applicable; Ancillary services (such as hospitalization, durable medical equipment, certain medications and anesthesia) provided for conditions appearing above the funding line, subject to the List's ancillary guideline notes when applicable; and Services paired with (or ancillary to) an unfunded condition which is causing or exacerbating a funde d condition, the treatments for the funded condition are not working or contraindicated, and treatment of the unfunded condition would improve the outcome of treating the funded condition (the \"Comorbidity Rule\" OAR 410 -141-3820 (10)) Services paired with (or ancillary to) an unfunded condition (or otherwise not consistent with the funded region of the List) which , based on the child's individual circumstances, adversely affect s the child's ability to grow, develop , or participate in school only when providing the unfunded service would improve the child's ability to grow, develop or participate in school. In addition, Oregon's 1115(a) Waiver includes coverage for services such as, but not limited to: Services on unfunded lines for children from birt h through age 1 Services provided for a condition appearing in the funded region of the List in conjunction with federal requirements for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) and Oregon's waiver As a result, the Prioritized List mu st be used in conjunction with applicable OHP provisions found in federal and state laws, the State Plan and Waiver in coverage determination. DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE D1, NON- PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING GUIDELINE A) Genetic tests are covered as diagnostic, unless they are listed below in section E1 as excluded or have other restrictions listed in this guideline. To be covered, initial screening (e.g. physical exam, medical history, family history, laboratory studies, imaging studies) must indicate that the chance of genetic abnormality is > 10% and results would do at least one of the following: 1) Change treatment, 2) Change health monitoring, 3) Provide prognosis, or Appendix A Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 11- 18-2021 Appendix A 4) Provide information needed for genetic counseling for patient; or patient's parents, siblings, or childre n B) Pretest and posttest genetic counseling is required for presymptomatic and predisposition genetic testing. Pretest and posttest genetic evaluation (which includes genetic counseling) is covered when provided by a suitable trained health professional with expertise and experience in genetics. 1) \"Suitably trained\" is defined as board certified or active candidate status from the American Board of Medical Genetics, American Board of Genetic Counseling, or Genetic Nursing Credentialing Commission. C) A more expensive genetic test (generally one with a wider scope or more detailed testing) is not covered if a cheaper (smaller scope) test is available and has, in this clinical context, a substantially similar sensitivity. For example, do not cover CFTR gene seq uencing as the first test in a person of Northern European Caucasian ancestry because the gene panels are less expensive and provide substantially similar sensitivity in that context. D) Related to diagnostic evaluation of individuals with intellectual disability (defined as a full scale or verbal IQ < 70 in an individual > age 5), developmental delay (defined as a cognitive index <70 on a standardized test appropriate for children < 5 years of age), Autism Spectrum Disorder, or multiple congenital anomalies: for individuals with intellectual disability/developmental delay; multiple congenital anomalies; or, Autism Spectrum Disorder accompanied by at least one of the following: dysmorphic featu res including macro or microcephaly, congenital anomalies, or intellectual disability/developmental delay in addition to those required to diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder. 2) CPT 81243, 81244, 81171,81172 Fragile X genetic testing is covered for individuals with intellectual disability/developmental delay. Although the yield of Fragile X is 3.5 -10%, this is included because of additional reproductive implications. 3) A visit with the appropriate specialist (often genetics, developmental pediatrics, or child neurology), including physical exam, medical history, and family history is covered. Physical exam, medical history, and family history by the appropriate specialist, prior to any genetic testing is often the most cost- effective strategy and is encouraged.

Line 558 CLOSED DISLOCATIONS/FRACTURES OF NON -CERVICAL VERTEBRAL COLUMN WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INJURY OR STRUCTURAL INSTABILITY b. The placement changes shown in attachment A were made to align with previous intent. 2) On December 28 , 2021, one c orrection w as made to Guideline 17 3 INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE UNPROVEN, HAVE NO CLINICALLY IMPORTANT BENEFIT OR HAVE HARMS THAT OUTWEIGH BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS : a. CPT code 99319 was erroneously listed as an entry in Guideline 173 instead of the correct code, CPT 93319 (3D echocardiographic imaging and postprocessing...) . This was corrected. 3) On January 10, 2022, one correction was made to Guideline Note 98 SIGNIFICANT INJURIES TO LIGAMENTS, TENDONS AND MENISCI : a. Sentence structure was revised in the first paragraph , clarifying that non -significant injuries are included on Line 608 SPRAINS AND STRAINS OF ADJACENT MUSCLES AND JOINTS, MINOR . Pneumococcal Vaccine Codes 1 Issue : At the November 2021 VBBS and HERC meetings, new 2022 CPT codes for new pneumococcal vaccines (PCV 15 and PCV20) were reviewed and added to the Excluded file as not yet having approval by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP ). The intent expressed at both of these meetings was to move these codes to line 3 PREVENTION SERVICES WITH EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS when ACIP approval was granted. After the November meeting, HERC staff became aware that ACIP had approved both vaccines for use at their October 20, 2021 meeting. From ACIP October Previously posted on CDC website: ACIP approved the following recommendations by majority vote at its October 20, 2021 meeting: Adults 65 years of age or older who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous v accination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. Adults ages 19 to 64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk facto rs* who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23.

This was simplified in the new recommendations. PPSV23 has been recommended for use in the United States since the 1980s for adults aged 65 years and for younger adults with underlying conditions that increase their risk for pneumococcal disease ( 1). PCV13 was first recommended for use in U.S. children in 2010, and indirect effects from its use in children reduced PCV13-type pneumococcal disease incidence in all adult groups ( Figure ). In 2012, ACIP recommended administration of PCV13 in series with PPSV23 for adults with immunocompromising conditions,\u00b6 cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or cochlear implants ( 2), and in 2014, the recommendation was extended to all adults aged 65 years ( 3). On the basis of review of accrued evidence, the PCV13 recommendation was changed in 2019 to shared clinical decision-making for adults aged 65 years without an immunocompromising condition, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or cochlear implant. The recom - mended pneumococcal vaccine doses and intervals between doses differ by age and underlying conditions, making adult pneumococcal vaccine recommendations complicated. \u00b6 Immunocompromising conditions are defined as chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, immunodeficiency, iatrogenic immunosuppression, generalized malignancy, HIV, Hodgkin disease, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, solid organ transplant, congenital or acquired asplenia, sickle cell disease, or other hemoglobinopathies.Recent systematic reviews continue to support the effective - ness of PCV13 against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)** and pneumococcal pneumonia among adults ( 4,5). Whereas effectiveness of PPSV23 against IPD has been demonstrated, data on effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia were considered to be inconsistent ( 3); recent observational stud - ies reported 21%-46% effectiveness against PPSV23-type pneumococcal pneumonia when PPSV23 was given <5 years before illness onset ( 6-8). Nevertheless, older adults and adults with chronic medical conditions or immunocompromising conditions, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or cochlear implants (certain underlying conditions) remain at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, accounting for >90% of adult IPD cases in 2019 (Active Bacterial Core surveillance, unpublished data, 2021). During February-October 2021, ACIP reviewed the epide - miology of pneumococcal disease and considerations for use of PCV15 and PCV20 in adults.

Within the EtR framework, ACIP considered the importance of the public health problem, benefits and harms, target populations' values and preferences, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility for PCV15 or PCV20 use. After a systematic review of the literature, the Work Group defined critical outcomes and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence rated on a scale of 1 (high certainty) to 4 (very low certainty) ( 9). \u00a7\u00a7 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/pneumo-PCV20-risk-based. Pneumococcal disease incidence in adults. During 2018- 2019, the incidence of all IPD in adults aged 65 years was 24 per 100,000 population ( Figure ), and PCV13 serotypes accounted 35% of IPD, respectively. In adults aged 19-64 years with certain underlying conditions, PCV13 serotypes accounted for of 43% of IPD, respectively. Estimates of pneumococcal pneumonia incidence are more variable. Annual incidence among U.S. adults aged <65 and 65 years hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia was estimated at 126-422 and 847-3,365 per 100,000, respec - tively, during 2010-2016 ( 10). In a multisite study of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, 4.6% of cases were caused by PCV13 serotypes, and 1.4% and 3.3% were caused by additional serotypes included in PCV15 and respectively ( 11).

Phase II and III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of a dose of PCV15 compared with a dose of PCV13 in healthy adults aged 50 years ( 12-14), adults aged 18-49 years who are Native American (a population with higher rates of IPD than the general U.S. population) ( 15) or with 1 risk condition for pneumococcal disease ( 16), and adults aged 18 years with HIV infection ( 17). Serotype-specific functional antibody responses were measured 1 month after vaccination using an opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assay. Correlates of protection have not been established for adults. In one phase III RCT among adults aged 50 years, PCV15 met the nonin - feriority criteria\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 compared with PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and had statistically significantly greater response**** for shared serotype 3 and PCV15-unique serotypes 22F and 33F ( 14). studies that immunogenicity of PCV15 or PCV13 followed by PPSV23 2-12 months later (16-18), persons who received PCV15 had numerically similar or higher OPA geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) for 9-13 shared PCV13 serotypes and a higher percentage of seroresponders\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 for 5-11 shared serotypes compared with persons who received PCV13 when measured 1 month after receipt of PPSV23. PCV15 safety. Safety of PCV15 was assessed in seven RCTs with 5,630 participants aged 18 years who received 1 dose of PCV15. Most participants were immunocompetent; however, one study included 302 adults with HIV infection. Participants included those vaccinated with PPSV23 1 year before receiving PCV15, those who received PCV15 followed by PPSV23, and those who received PCV15 concomitantly with a seasonal inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site pain, fatigue, and myalgia. The rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) within 6 months of vaccination were 2.5% among PCV15 recipients and 2.4% among PCV13 recipients. No SAEs or deaths were considered to be related to the study vaccines ( 9,19). \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 Lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio (PCV15 serotypes 22F and 33F , defined as the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio (V114 / PCV13) to be >2.0 and the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the differences (V114 PCV13) between the percentages of participants with a fourfold rise to be >0.1. For serotype 3, defined as the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the OPA GMT ratio (V114 / PCV13) to be >1.2 and the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the differences (V114 PCV13) between the percentages of participants with a fourfold rise to be >0. Range reflects the difference in results across studies. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Subjects with a fourfold or larger rise in OPA GMT titer to CRM197 ( 20). A phase II study among adults aged 60-64 years and two phase III RCTs among adults aged 18 years evaluated immunoge - nicity and safety of PCV20 compared with PCV13 and with PPSV23 for the seven additional serotypes included in PCV20 (21-23). These studies included adults with stable medical con - ditions, but none included adults with immunocompromising conditions. Compared with PCV13 recipients, PCV20 recipi - ents elicited responses that met noninferiority criteria\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 for all 13 serotypes in a phase III trial among adults aged 60 years (21); however, PCV20 recipients appeared to have lower GMTs and included a lower percentage of seroresponders to 12-13 of the 13 PCV13-shared serotypes ( 21,22). with PPSV23 recipients, PCV20 recipients had numerically higher GMTs and a higher percentage of seroresponders to six of seven (excluding serotype 8) shared non-PCV13 serotypes ( 21,23); noninferiority for serotypes ( 21). PCV20 safety. Safety of PCV20 was assessed in six trials among immunocompetent adults aged 18 years that included a total of 4,552 participants who received PCV20. Participants included those who were na\u00efve to pneumococcal vaccina - tion and those who had previously received pneumococcal vaccination. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site pain, muscle pain, fatigue, headache, and joint pain. SAEs reported within 6 months after vaccination occurred among 1.5% of PCV20 recipients and 1.8% among controls. No SAEs or deaths were considered to be related to study vaccines ( 20,24). Intervals between PCV and PPSV23. Findings from eight immunogenicity studies that evaluated the immune response after a sequence of 7-valent PCV, PCV13, or PCV15 followed by PPSV23 administered at intervals of 2, 6, or 12 months or 3-4 years were reviewed ( 16-18,25-29). Three studies com - paring intervals ranging from 2 to 6 months between admin - istration of PCV and PPSV23 found no significant difference in immunogenicity measured after PPSV23 receipt, although reactogenicity tended to be higher with shorter intervals (25-29). In a study that compared antibody responses to 1 dose of PCV13 with responses to PCV13 followed by PPSV23 1 year apart, the immune responses following PPSV23 were significantly lower compared with the responses after a dose of PCV13 for eight of 12 common serotypes ( 27). In another study that compared antibody response to 1 dose of PCV13 with responses to PCV13 followed by PPSV23 approximately 4 years apart, the immune responses following PPSV23 were significantly higher for seven of 12 common serotypes ( 26). \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 Defined as the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the ratio (PCV20 / PCV13) of opsonophagocytic geometric mean titers being >0.5.Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 28, 2022 / Vol. 71 / No. 4 113 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThese findings suggested that longer intervals between admin - istration of PCV and PPSV23 might improve immunogenicity in immunocompetent adults, although a direct comparison between a 1- versus 4-year interval was not made. Cost-effectiveness. Economic models assessed cost-effective - ness of the new policy options compared with existing recom - mendations ( 30). Three economic models assessed PCV20 alone for all adults aged 65 years; cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from cost-saving***** to $39,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. T wo economic models assessed use of PCV15 in series with PPSV23 for all adults aged 65 years; estimates ranged from cost-saving to $282,000 per QALY gained. The CDC model found cost savings in all scenarios for use of either PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 for all adults aged 65 years. Cost estimates of policy options for adults aged 19-64 years with certain underlying medical ***** Lower cost and improved health outcomes compared with previous recommendations.conditions ranged from $11,000 to $292,000 per QALY gained for PCV20 and from $250,000 to $656,000 for PCV15 in series with PPSV23. Summary. Use of PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 is expected to reduce pneumococcal disease incidence in adults aged 65 years and in those aged 19-64 years with certain underlying conditions. Findings from studies sug - gested that the immunogenicity and safety of PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 were comparable to PCV13 alone or PCV13 in series with PPSV23. Cost-effectiveness studies demonstrated that use of PCV20 alone or PCV15 in series with PPSV23 for adults at age 65 years was cost-saving. The new policy simplifies adult pneumococcal vaccine rec - ommendations ( Table 1 ) and is expected to improve vaccine coverage among adults and prevent more pneumococcal dis - ease. An amendment to recommend PCV20 for all adults aged 50 years instead of age 65 years was considered but rejected (Table 2 ).

New Pneumococcal Vaccine Recommendations Adults aged 65 years. Adults aged 65 years who have not previously received PCV or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive 1 dose of PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15). When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23 ( Table 1 ). Adults aged 19-64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors. Adults aged 19-64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk fac - tors who have not previously received PCV or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive 1 dose of PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15). When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. Clinical Guidance Dosing schedule. When PCV15 is used, the recommended interval between administration of PCV15 and PPSV23 is 1 year. A minimum interval of 8 weeks can be considered for adults with an immunocompromising condition, cochlear implant, or cerebrospinal fluid leak to minimize the risk for IPD caused by serotypes unique to PPSV23 in these vulner - able groups ( 31). Adults with previous PPSV23 only. Adults who have only received PPSV23 may receive a PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15) 1 year after their last PPSV23 dose. When PCV15 is used in those with history of PPSV23 receipt, it need not be followed by another dose of PPSV23.Adults with previous PCV13. The incremental public health benefits of providing PCV15 or PCV20 to adults who have received PCV13 only or both PCV13 and PPSV23 have not been evaluated. These adults should complete the previ - ously recommended PPSV23 series PCV20, or PPSV23 can be coadministered with QIV in an adult immu - nization program, as concomitant administration (PCV15 or PPSV23 and QIV [Fluarix], PCV20 and adjuvanted QIV [Fluad]) has been demonstrated to be immunogenic and safe. However, slightly lower pneumococcal serotype-specific OPA GMTs or geometric mean concentrations were reported when pneumococcal vaccines were coadministered with QIV compared with when pneumococcal vaccines were given alone (9,19,32,33). Currently, no data are available on coadminis - tration with other vaccines (e.g., tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine, hepatitis B, or zoster vaccine) among adults. Evaluation of coadministration of PCV15, PCV20, or PPSV23 with COVID-19 vaccines is ongoing ( 34,35). Future Research and Monitoring Priorities CDC and ACIP will continue to assess safety of PCV15 and PCV20 vaccines, monitor the impact of implementation of new recommendations, and assess postimplementation vaccine effectiveness and update pneumococcal vaccination recommendations as appropriate. For adults who have received PCV13 but have not completed their recommended pneumococcal vaccine series with PPSV23, one dose of PCV20 may be used if PPSV23 is not available. TABLE 2.

If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23.Might reduce existing pneumococcal disease disparity in adults aged 50-64 years.Rejected (4:11) Age-based recommendation is easier to implement than risk-based recommendation. Might provide more opportunities to vaccinate adults before underlying conditions develop. Adults aged 65 years who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23.Potential for waning vaccine-induced immunity makes it favorable to vaccinate later in life when risk for disease is higher.Affirmed (15:0) Consistently cost saving in cost-effectiveness analyses. Still provides an opportunity for higher PCV coverage in adults compared with current recommendations. No evidence that lowering the age-based recommendation will reduce disparity in vaccine- preventable disease compared with risk-based recommendations.

Currently, the vaccine (PPSV23) are recommended for U.S. adults. Recommendations vary by age and risk groups. What is added by this report? On October 20, 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended 15-valent PCV (PCV15) or 20-valent PCV (PCV20) for PCV-na\u00efve adults who are either aged 65 years or aged 19-64 years with certain underlying condi - tions. When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23, typically 1 year later. What are the implications for public health practice? Pneumococcal vaccination recommendations were simplified across age and risk group. Eligible adults may receive either PCV15 in series with PPSV23 or PCV20 alone. Before administering PCV20, PCV15, or PPSV23, health care providers should consult relevant package inserts ( 9,20,36) regarding precautions and contraindications. Adverse events occurring after administration of any vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by fax, or by mail.

The program is known as \"Family Connects.\" This code is currently listed as \"Never Reviewed .\" OHA added this code to the Diagnostic Procedures File effective 1/1/22 and requested that it be added to the Prioritized List at next publication date. CPT 99502 is most appropriate to add to line 3 PREVE NTION SERVICES WITH EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS to pair with Well Baby visit ICD -10-CM codes. From OHA: Statute now requires that all health insurance providers in Oregon (both commercial and public) offer nurse home visits to all newborns. OHA is working on creating this program for Medicaid beneficiaries as a joint venture between HSD, Public Health and Local Public Health Authorities . The purpose is to do assessments to identify the need for medical interventions. Medicaid will begin reimbursing for the program 1/1/22 using CPT 99502. The federal match ing funds will come from Public Health to the Health Systems Division ( HSD ). Providers will not contribute match funds. On review of Senate Bill 526, \"maternal health\" assessments are mandated as part of th ese home visits. Staff identified an additional CPT code that should be considered for addition to the Prioritized List to allow a postpartum visit: CPT 99501 (Home visit for postnatal assessment and follow -up care). This code is most appropriate on line 1 PREGNANCY to pair with ICD -10 Z39.2 (Encounter for routine postpartum follow -up). CCOs will not be responsible for paying for these during 2022 and 2023, according to OHA staff. The services will be reimbursed through the fee -for-service Medicaid progra m. This arrangement may be revisited for future years beyond 2023.

[3]Significant Ligament and Tendon Injuries Coding Corrections 1 Question : Should various diagnosis codes for ligament and tendon injuries be added to covered lines to represent complete tendon or ligament tears or other serious injuries requiring surgical treatment ? Question source : MMC, HERC staff Issue: There is a lack of specific ICD -10-CM codes for complete tears of certain tendons and ligaments. This makes it difficult to determine when an ICD -10-CM code indicates a serious injury that requires surgical repair , or when a code indicates a minor injury. To help with this issue, Guideline Note 98 was implemented after the 2012 ICD -10 Sports Medicine review to better clarify when an injury is on a funded versus an un funded line. Over the years, multiple ICD -10-CM codes were added to funded lines to allow treatment, based on GN98. HERC staff have identified additional ICD-10-CM codes on lines 608 SPRAINS AND STRAINS OF ADJACENT MUSCLES AND JOINTS, MINOR and 6 34 SUPERFICIAL WOUNDS WITHOUT INFECTION AND CONTUSIONS that need to move to lines covered by Guideline Note 98 or need to be added to additional lines to allow surgical treatment when indicated . There remain some ICD -10-CM codes on line 634 that involve injuries to ligaments or tendons, but these codes are so non -specific that staff recommends they remain on this line . GUIDELINE NOTE 98, SIGNIFICANT INJURIES TO LIGAMENTS, TENDONS AND MENISCI Lines 376, 417, 432, 608 Significant injuries to liga ments, tendons and/or menisci are those that result in clinically demonstrable joint instability or mechanical interference with motion. Significant injuries are covered on Line 376, Line 417, or Line 432 for both medical and surgical interventions non -significant injuries are included on Line 608. Iliotibial (IT) band syndrome (ICD10 M76.3) is included on Line 376 only for pairing with 2 physical therapy visits with a provider licensed to provide physical therapy services, anti -inflammatory medications, a nd primary care office visits. Otherwise, it is included on Line 608.

If so, should the line be renamed? Question source : Dr. Ben Hoffman, OHSU pediatrician (and new HERC member) Issue: Childhood pica (ICD -10-CM F98.3) is on both lines 149 FEEDING AND EATING DISORDERS OF INFANCY OR CHILDHOOD and on line 631 PICA. There are types of childhood pica ( e.g., ice) that don't require treatment. However, Dr. Hoffman points out that pica is comm on in children, particularly those with developmental disorders. Any type of pica that affects the child's growth or health would be included on the upper line (line 149) . The lower line contains the diagnosis code for adult pica (ICD -10- CM F50.89). Genera lly, hav ing a diagnosis on both a funded and an unfunded line without a guideline is confusing to reviewers.

HERC staff recommendation : 1) Make no change in the non -pairing of mid -foot arthrosis with foot arthritis Surgical Management of Posttraumatic Midfoot Deformity and Arthritis Jeffrey D. Seybold, MD and J. Chris Coetzee, MD Abstract: Posttraumatic joint disruption and deformity remains one of the most common etiologies for midfoot degenerative joint disease.Patients presenting with midfoot arthritis commonly complain of increased pain with weight-bearing activity, and tenderness over the dorsum of the foot with constrictive shoe wear secondary to dorsalosteophyte formation. Nonoperative measures assist with symptomcontrol, focusing on limiting both pain and deformity. Operative intervention is generally considered after an adequate trial of non- operative measures. Arthrodesis procedures remain the \"gold standard\"for operative treatment of midfoot arthritis. Interpositional tendonarthroplasty of the fourth and fth tarsometatarsal joints has been supported as a motion-sparing alternative to arthrodesis for patients with lateral column disease. The indications, complications, post-operative management, and techniques for posttraumatic midfootarthritis procedures are discussed in further detail below. Level of Evidence: Diagnostic Level 5. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence. Key Words: posttraumatic, arthritis, midfoot, lateral column, Lisfranc (Tech Foot & Ankle 2016;15: 79-86) HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The naviculocuneiform (NC) joints, the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints, and the intercuneiform joints dene the borders of themidfoot. The TMT articulations are further divided into 3columns: the rst TMT joint denes the medial column, the second and third TMT joints form the middle column, and the articulation between the cuboid and the fourth and fthmetatarsals dene the lateral column. 1The medial and middle columns are stiff structures, accommodating for only 4 degrees of dorsiflexion, 1 degree of plantarflexion, and 2 degrees of supination and pronation. The lateral column is much moremobile, allowing for 10 degrees of dorsiflexion, plantarflexion,supination, and pronation. 2 The exact incidence of midfoot arthritis is unknown, as many patients may never develop symptoms that require for-mal evaluation. Posttraumatic arthritis remains the most common identied Lisfranc fracture-dislocations account for only 0.2% of allfractures, the reported incidence of arthritic changes after thisinjury is as high as 30%. 3,4In a Lisfranc injury, primary dis- ruption of the weak dorsal ligaments may lead to instability of the TMT and intercuneiform joints. In more severe injuries, thestronger plantar and interosseous Lisfranc ligaments may tear,resulting in TMT joint subluxation and/or dislocation with dorsal displacement of the metatarsals. Even after early iden- tication and anatomic reduction, the cartilage and ligamentdamage sustained at the time of injury may lead to abnormal joint loading, progressive and eccentric wear patterns, and subsequent degenerative joint disease. Kuo et al 4reported outcomes for 48 patients with Lisfranc injuries, noting a 25% incidence of posttraumatic arthritis despite operative xation within 6 weeks of injury. The sole statistically signicant factor affecting the onset of posttraumatic arthritis inthis series was anatomic versus nonanatomic reduction and x-ation, with onset of degenerative changes occurring in 16% versus 60% of these cohorts, respectively. Philbin et al 5noted a signicant difference in rates of posttraumatic arthritis relative totiming of xation, with a 23% incidence of midfoot arthritis afterdelayed presentation or treatment of Lisfranc injuries (dened as over 6 wk from injury) versus a 9.5% incidence in patients treated within a 6-week postinjury window. Multiple authorshave supported these ndings, noting that the severity of injury and anatomic reduction are critical factors in limiting the development of posttraumatic degenerative changes. 6,7Un- fortunately, the incidence of missed or mistreated Lisfrancinjuries, and the resulting increase in posttraumatic degenerative changes, is likely underreported. The difculty treating patients with missed or malreduced TMT fracture-dislocations is well-described. 1,7,8Kuo et al4 observed a trend toward increased rates of posttraumatic arthritis following purely ligamentous Lisfranc injuries, which may be related to the difculty initially diagnosing the injury. As theligamentous structures of the midfoot become attenuated, thenormally rigid midfoot joints lose their support. Foot deformity progresses with forefoot abduction, midfoot pronation, medial column posterior tendon and contracture of the peroneal and Achilles occurs with continued midfoot collapse. INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Nonoperative treatment is always pursued with a focus on limiting pain and accommodating or limiting progressivedeformity. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice, and limit- ing impact activity may all decrease inflammation and pain associated with midfoot degenerative disease. Rigid orthoticdevices, such as a full-length carbon ber plate, stiffen the shoe and limit motion through the midfoot with gait. Any orthotic device should provide a soft, conforming contour that supportsthe foot but does not attempt to correct rigid deformity. Rockerbottom modications not only stiffen the shoe, but also decrease the bending moment arm at the midfoot and limit stress at the TMT joints during the toe-off stage of gait. 9 Failure of nonoperative management, manifested by per- sistent pain and diminished quality of life, after 3 months of treatment is an indication for surgery. Severe deformity asso- ciated with impending skin breakdown necessitates more urgentoperative intervention, regardless of the duration of conservative care. In general, arthrodesis procedures that include a corrective osteotomy are indicated for sagittal or transverse plane deformityat the TMT joints greater than 15 degrees or displacementFrom the Twin Cities Orthopedics, Edina, MN.

Question source : Max Kaiser, CCO medical director Issue : Guideline Note 219 CHEMODENERVATION was created last year when coding specifications regarding chemodenervation (e.g. Botox treatments) were removed from lines and consolidated into a guideline. Dr. Kaiser pointed out that GN219 is missing an entry for line 500 SIALOLITHIASIS, MUCOCELE, DI STURBANCE OF SALIVARY SECRETION, OTHER AND SALIVARY CPT 64611 (Chemodenervation of parotid and submandibular salivary glands, bilateral) . Additionally, the guideline is missing an entry for line 526 CHRONIC AN AL FISSURE which contains CPT 46505 (Chemodenervation of internal anal sphincter). Staff recommend adding these two additional lines to the guideline as it is confusing to CCOs to not include all relevant lines that deal with Botox and similar treatments. HERC staff recommendation : 1) Modify GN219 as shown below to clarify placement of chemodenervation for conditions on lines 500 and 526. GUIDELINE NOTE 219, CHEMODENERVATION Lines 292, 327, 351, 362, 378, 393, 410, 500, 517,526 Inclusion of chemodenervatio n on the Prioritized List has the following limitations for the lines specified below: Line 292 NEUROLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION IN POSTURE AND MOVEMENT CAUSED BY CHRONIC CONDITIONS Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin injection (CPT 64642 -64647) is included on this line for treatment of upper and lower limb spasticity G80 -G83) Line 327 FUNCTIONAL AND MECHANICAL DISORDERS OF THE GENITOURINARY SYSTEM INCLUDING BLADDER OUTLET OBSTRUC TION Chemodenervation of the bladder (CPT 52287) is included on this line only for treatment of idiopathic detrusor N32.81) in patients who have not responded to or been unable to tolerate at le ast two urinary Treatment is limited to 90 days, with additional treatment only if the patient shows documented positive response. Posit ive response to therapy is defined as a reduction of urinary frequency of 8 episodes per day or urinary incontinence of 2 episodes per day compared to baseline frequency.

Line 393 STRABISMUS WITHOUT AMBLYOPIA AND EYE MOVEMENTS; ANOMALIES OF EYE; LACRIMAL DUCT CHILDREN Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin injection (CPT 67345) is included on this line for the treatment of strabismus due to other neurological disorders (ICD -10-CM H50.89). Line 410 MIGRAINE chronic migr aine (CPT 64615) is included on this line for prophylactic treatment of adults who meet all of the following criteria: A) have chronic migraine defined as headaches on at least 15 days per month of which at least 8 days are with migraine B) has not respo nded to or have contraindications to at least three prior pharmacological prophylaxis therapies (e.g. beta -blocker, anticonvulsant or tricyclic antidepressant) C) their condition has been appropriately managed for medication overuse D) treatment is admin istered in consultation with a neurologist or headache specialist. Treatment is limited to two injections given 3 months apart. Additional treatment requires documented positive response to therapy. Positive response to therapy is defined as a reduction of at least 7 headache days per month compared to baseline headache frequency. Line 500 SIALOLITHIASIS, MUCOCELE, DISTURBANCE OF SALIVARY SECRETION, OTHER AND UNSPECIFIED DISEASES OF SALIVARY GLANDS Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin injection (CPT 64611 ) is included on this line for the treatment of excessive salivation. Line 517 DISORDERS OF SWEAT GLANDS Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin injection (CPT 64650, 64653) is included on this line for hyperhidrosis and with botulinum toxin injection (CPT 465 05) is included on this line for the treatment of anal fissures. Enteropathic Arthropathies 1 Question : Should enteropathic arthropathies ( various forms of inflammatory arthritis represented by ICD-10-CM M07.6 family) be moved to a funded line? Question source : HERC staff Issue : HERC staff have been reviewing unfunded diagnoses on the Prioritized List to determine if any are inappropriately prioritized. Enteropathic arthropathies are only found on line 659 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY. All other inflamma tory polyarthropathies are included on line 46 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY POLYARTHROPATHIES Enteropathic arthropathy is a spondylarthritis which occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and other gastrointestinal diseases, such as Whipple's disease, celiac disease, and intestinal bypass surgery. Enter opathic arthropathy is treated with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant medications, including immunomodulatory medications. Local treatments such as joint steroid injections a re also used. No previous review of this topic was identified. All private payers surveyed considered the ICD -10-CM M07.6 code family to be inflammatory polyarthropathies and covered a wide range of treatments for this condition. HERC staff recommendation 1) Remove ICD -10-CM M07.6 code family (enteropathic arthropathy) from line 659 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSAR Y. 2) Add ICD -10-CM M07.6 family (enteropathic arthropathy) Study Group (ESSG) criteria.

Question source : Jen nifer Smith, PharmD, pharmacy manager, Providence Health Plan Issue : Chronic renal failure with a hemoglob in level <10 was added as an indication for erythropoiesis - stimulating agents in G uideline Note 7 in 2012. The current GN7 only appl ies to Line 59 END STAGE RENAL DISEASE. Line 59 only includes ICD -10-CM N18.5 (Chronic kidney disease, stage 5) and N18.6 (End stage renal disease). Earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (ICD -10-CM N18.1 -N18.4 and N18.9) are on line 339 CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE which is not referenced in the guideline . Additionally, ICD -10- CM D63.1 (Anemia in chronic kidney disease) is only on line 574 ANEMIAS DUE TO DISEASE. According to P&T, all ICD -10 codes above the funding line ( i.e., all N18 series codes) are being funded for erythropoietin currently in their PA process. The FDA has approved erythropoietin for all stages of chronic k idney disease with a low hemoglobin level. All private insurers cover the ICD -10-CM codes noted above for erythropoietin use. FDA Epogen labeling 7/2018 : 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease Epogen is indicated for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), including patients on dialysis and not on dialysis to decrease the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. For adult patients with CKD on dialysis: Initiate Epogen treatment when the hemoglobin level i s less than 10 g/dL. If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Epogen. The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis. For adult patients with CKD not on dialysis: Consider initiating Epogen treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply: o The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and, o Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion -related risks is a goal If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Epogen, and use the lowest dose of Epogen sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfu sions. The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously. For pediatric patients with CKD: Initiate Epogen treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL. If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 12 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Epogen. The recommended starting dose for pediatric patients (ages 1 month or older) is 50 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously.

Pelvic Congestion Syndrome 1 Question : Should the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome be moved to the funded region of the Prioritized List? Question source : Carl Stevens, CCO medical director Issue: Pelvic congestion syndrome is a chronic pelvic pain syndrome of variable location and intensity, which is associated with dyspareunia and postcoital pain and aggravated by standing. The underlying etiology is thought to be related to varices of the ovarian veins, leading to pelvic vascular congestion. Becau se there are many etiologies of chronic pelvic pain, pelvic congestion syndrome is often a diagnosis of exclusion, with the identification of varices using a variety of imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or contrast v enography. However, the syndrome is still not well -defined, and it is unclear whether pelvic congestion syndrome causes chronic pelvic pain. Although venous reflux is common, not all women with this condition experience chronic pelvic pain and, conversely, chronic pelvic pain is reported by women without pelvic congestion syndrome. Initial treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome includes psychotherapy and medical therapy (e.g., nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs) and hormonal therapy. For patients who f ail initial therapy, surgical ligation of the ovarian vein may be considered. Embolization therapy and/or sclerotherapy of the ovarian and internal iliac veins has been proposed as an alternative to surgical ovarian vein ligation.

Accuracy review N=12 studies (10 ultrasound, 2 MRI vs conventio nal venography ) i. There was no single, clearly -defined criterion for a diagnosis that was reported in all of the studies included in the review. ii. The proportion of women found to have pelvic vein incompetence (PVI) who reported chronic pelvic pain (CPP) range d considerably, from 39% to 91%. b. Effusiveness review N=22 studies (1 poor quality RCT of 1208 women, 21 case series) i. Approximately one -third of patients clearly had bilateral embolisation, with metal coil placement being the dominant technique. Early subst antial relief from pain symptoms was observed in approximately 75% of women, a figure which generally increased over time and was sustained. Where pain was measured on a visual analogue scale, statistically significant reductions following treatment were o bserved in all studies. Reintervention rates were generally low. Where measured, embolisation reduced the diameter of dilated veins to a significant degree, with minimal residual reflux. There were few data on the impact on menstruation, ovarian reserve or fertility, but no concerns were noted. Transient pain was a common occurrence following foam embolisation, while there was a < 2% risk of coil migration a. Conclusions: The data supporting the diagnosis and treatment of PCS are limited and of variable method ological quality. There is some evidence to tentatively support a causative association, but it cannot be categorically stated that PVI is the cause of CPP in women with no other pathology. Embolisation appears to provide symptomatic relief in the majority of women and is safe. However, the majority of included studies of embolism were relatively small case series and only the randomi zed controlled trial was considered at risk of potential biases. Expert Guideline 1) ACOG 2020 , Practice Bulletin 218 Chronic Pelvic Pain a. Pelvic congestion syndrome is a proposed etiology of chronic pelvic pain related to pelvic venous insufficiency. Although venous congestion appears to be associated with chronic pelvic pain, evidence is insufficient to conclude that the re is a cause -and-effect relationship . In addition, there is no consensus on the definition of this condition, and diagnostic criteria are variable. Further research is needed to establish greater consistency in diagnosis and homogeneity in treatment studi es. Other payer policies 1) Aetna 2021 : Aetna considers embolization (e.g., using metallic coils or foam/gel sclerotherapy) of gonadal veins or ovarian veins, with or without the internal iliac veins, medically necessary for the treatment of pelvic congesti on syndrome (PCS) when both of the following criteria are met: a. The member has had a definitive diagnostic venography, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and b. The member has failed a trial of appropriate pharmacotherapy (e.g., anal gesics, hormonal therapy). Pelvic Congestion Syndrome 3 2) United Healthcare 2021 : Embolization of the Ovarian Vein or Internal Iliac Vein is unproven and not medically necessary for treating Pelvic Congestion Syndrome due to insufficient evidence of efficacy 3) Wellmark BCBS 2021 : Endovascular occlusion of the ovarian vein and internal iliac veins is considered investigational as a treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome because the evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on net health outcomes. Pelvic Congestion Syndrome 4 HERC s taff summary Pelvic congestion syndrome is a poorly defined entity with no standardized diagnostic criteria. Pelvic vein embolization for treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome appears promising, but the evidence base to date is very small and at high ri sk of bias. Most private insurers do not cover treatment for pelvic congestion syndrome. ACOG notes there are no agree d upon diagnostic or treatment criteria. HERC staff recommendations : 1) Add a new guideline note to line 53 2 CHRONIC PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE, PELVIC PAIN SYNDROME, DYSPAREUNIA as shown below GUIDELINE NOTE XXX PELVIC CONGESTION SYNDROME Line 53 2 Pelvic congestion syndrome is included on this line using ICD -10-CM N94.89. This condition does not pair with any vein embolization procedures due to lack of evidence of effectiveness. ACOG PRACTICE BULLETIN Clinical Management Guidelines for Obstetrician -Gynecologists NUMBER 218 Committee on Practice Bulletins \u2014Gynecology. This Practice Bulletin was developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 'Committee on Practice Bulletins -Gynecology in collaboration with Lee A. Learman, MD, PhD, and Katherine W. McHugh, MD. Chronic Pelvic Pain Chronic pelvic pain is a common, burdensome, and costly condition that disproportionately affects women. Diagnosis and initial management of chronic pelvic pain in women are within the scope of practice of specialists in obstetrics and gynecology. The challenging complexity of chronic pelvic pain care can be addressed by increased visit time using appropriate coding modifiers, as well as identification of multidisciplinary team members within the practice or by facilitated referral. This Practice Bulletin addresses the diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain that is not completely explained by identifiable pathology of the gynecologic, urologic, or gastrointestinal organ systems. When evidence on chronic pelvic pain treatment is limited, recommendations are extrapolated from treatment of other chronic pain conditions to help guide management. The evaluation and management of potential gynecologic etiologies of pelvic pain (ie, endometriosis, adenomyosis, leiomyomas, adnexal pathology, vulvar disorders) arediscussed in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1 -4). Background Definition A lack of consensus on the definition of chronic pelvic pain has impeded efforts to understand its prevalence andthe success of treatment alternatives (5). The AmericanCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and theReVITALize data definitions initiative define chronic pelvic pain as\"pain symptoms perceived to originate from pelvic organs/structures typically lasting more than6 months. It is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioral, sexual and emotional consequences as well as with symptoms suggestive of lower urinary tract, sex-ual, bowel, pelvic floor, myofascial, or gynecologicaldysfunction \"(6). Cyclical pelvic pain is considered a form of chronic pelvic pain if it has significant cogni-tive, behavioral, sexual, and emotional consequences (6).This Practice Bulletin does not address cyclic Mittelschmerz) but does dis- cuss dyspareunia as a component of chronic pelvic pain. Chronic pelvic pain differs from acute pelvic pain in several important ways. Acute pain typically arisesfrom an inflammatory, infectious, or anoxic event or traumatic injury that resolves over time with treatment and repair. When pain persists, a chronic stress pheno- type may emerge and is characterized by a vicious cycleof physical and psychologic consequences. Prolongedactivity restriction can lead to physical deconditioning.Continued fear, anxiety, and distress can lead to long-term deterioration in mood and social isolation. Althoughmood symptoms are ubiquitous in chronic pain syn-dromes, criteria for major depression are met in approx- imately 12 -33% of women across samples of women living with or seeking care for chronic pelvic pain (7 -9). Epidemiology A systematic review of high-quality studies by the World Health Organization in 2006 found the prevalence to rangefrom approximately 2.1% to 24% for 16.8% to 81% for dysmen-orrhea (10). An updated review published in 2014 useda more stringent definition (no ncyclical pain lasting at least 6 months) and found prevalence estimates that ranged from 5.7% to 26.6% (11).

In the era of public and private sector health system transformation, reaching these goals requires a focus on maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms and costs of health interventions . The Health Evidence Re view Commission (HERC ) uses the following principles in selecting topics for its reports to guide public and private payers: Represents a significant burden of disease or health problem Represents important uncertainty with regard to effectiveness or harms Represents important variation or controversy in implementation or practice Represents high costs or significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest HERC bases its reports on a review of the best available research applicable to the interven tion(s) in question. For coverage guidances, which focus on diagnostic and clinical interventions, evidence is evaluated using an adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. For more informatio n on coverage guidance methodology, see Appendix A. Multisector interventions can be effective ways to prevent, treat, or manage disease at a population level. In some cases, HERC has reviewed evidence and identified effective interventions, but has not made formal coverage recommendations when these policies are implemented in settings other than traditional health care delivery systems because effectiveness could depend on the environment in which the intervention is implemented. GRADE Table HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the GRADE system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for performing the steps involved in developing recommendations. The table below lists the elements that de termine the strength of a recommendation. HERC reviews the evidence and assesses each element, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Estimates of effect are derived from the evidence presented in this document. The level of confidence in the estimate is determined by HERC based on the assessment of two independent reviewers from the Center for Evidence -based Policy. In some cases, no systematic reviews or meta -analyses encompass the most current literat ure. In those cases, HERC may describe the additional evidence or alter the assessments of confidence considering all available information. Such assessments are informed by clinical epidemiologists from the Center for Evidence -based Policy. Unless otherwise noted, statements regarding resource allocation, values and preferences, and other considerations are the asse ssments of HERC, as informed by the evidence reviewed, public testimony, and subcommittee discussion. 4 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 Recommendations for coverage are based on the balance of benefit and harms, resource allocation, values and preferences and other considerations. See App endix A for more details about the factors that constitute the GRADE table. 5 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 GRADE Tables Should high -frequency chest wall oscillation devices be recommended for coverage for children and adults with cystic fibrosis ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource Allocation Values and Preferences Other Considerations Hospitalizations (Critical outcome) Compared to positive expiratory pressure : no significant difference. (low confidence, based on 4 RCTs, n = 128) Compared to conventional chest physiotherapy : No significant difference. (low confidence, based on 4 RCTs, n = 128) Coverage of high - frequency chest wall oscillation would add significant cost compared to chest physiotherapy or positive expiratory pressure devices. However, in situations in which chest physiotherapy is not consi stently available or tolerated and positive expiratory pressure devices are not effective or tolerated, the additional cost of the high -frequency chest wall oscillation device would be offset to the extent that it reduces hospitalizations and exacerbations . Patients may prefer treatment options that can be self - administered, confer greater independence, and ensure reliable and consistent treatment. Some patients may not be able to tolerate chest physiotherapy or positive expiratory pressure devices. Some patients may not have caregivers who are available or physically able to administer daily chest physiotherapy. Mortality (Critical outcome) No ev idence Pulmonary Exacerbations Requiring Antibiotics (Important outcome) Compared to positive expiratory pressure : significantly more exacerbations (median, 2.0; interquartile range, 1.0 to 3.0) than the positive expiratory pressure therapy group (median, 1.0; interquartile range, 0.0 to 2.0; P = .007) (very low confidence, based on 1 RCT, n = 107) Compared to chest physiotherapy : no significant difference (mean difference, -0.20; 95% CI, -2.32 to 1.92; P > .05). (very low confidence, based on 1 RCT, n = 50) Compared to other oral or external oscillatory devices : no significant difference (very low confidence, based on 1 RCT, n = 16) 6 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 Should high -frequency chest wall oscillation devices be recommended for coverage for children and adults with cystic fibrosis ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource Allocation Values and Preferences Other Considerations Exercise Capacity (Important outcome) No evidence Chest physiotherapy must be provided by a trained caregiver for 20 to 40 minutes, one or more times per day; could be provided by a paid or unpaid caregiver. Breathlessness or Cough (Important outcome) No evidence Balance of benefits and harms: Based on low -confidence evidence, high -frequency chest wall oscillation devices have similar outcomes to other chest clearance devices or chest physiotherapy for reducing hospitalizations or for reducing exacerbations for patients with cystic fibrosis. There are few harms found for hi gh-freque ncy chest wall oscillation devices. Rationale: High-frequency chest wall oscillation devices are not inferior to other alternatives, and have a low rate of harms, but much higher cost. However, w e recommend coverage because some patients may need other treatment options. The recommendation is weak because of the low quality of the evidence. Reco mmendation: High-frequency chest wall oscillation devices are recommended for coverage for patients with cystic fibrosis ( weak recommendation) when there is documentation of frequent severe exacerbations requiring antibiotics and/or hospitalization , despite either : a) having received chest physiotherapy and positive expiratory pressure therapy , OR b) documentation that chest physical therapy and positive expiratory pressure devices are not tolerated or not available (e.g., inability of a caregiver to perfo rm chest physi otherapy).

However, expert opinion supports use in this population based on data extrapolated from cystic fibrosis, which is a similar condition , but only when there is evidence of chronic airway infection or chronic daily cough. There are few harms to hi gh-frequency chest wall oscillation devices. Rationale: The evidence is equivocal regarding whether high -frequency chest wall oscillation improve s outcomes for patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis , but we recommend coverage of these devices based on low risk of harms and the fact that they may result in cost offsets if they prevent hospitalizations . Expert testimony that pathophysiologic reasoning makes extrapolating evidence from the cystic fibrosis population reasonable. The recommendation is weak because of our very low confidence in the available evidence.

Impaired airway clearance can be a characteristic of several respiratory disorders and neuromuscular diseases, including: Chronic obstructi ve pulmonary disorder (COPD) Cystic fibrosis Bronchiectasis, which is characterized by chronic cough, bronchial wall thickening, permanent expansion of the airway, and overproduction of thick mucus Multiple sclerosis Muscular dystrophy Spinal muscular atro phy Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 35,000 individuals have been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis in the US , and 16 million US individuals are living with COPD.2,3 According to a claims - data analysis using information from 2013, aproximately 340,000 to 522,000 adults receive treatment for bronchiectasis in the US, and about half of patients diagnosed with bronichiectasis have com orbid COPD.4 Failing to adequately and regularly clear mucus from the airways can result in exacerbations and worsening of chronic lung disease that require antibiotic treatment, hospitalization and other interventions.5 Therefore, a key element of managin g these diseases is to keep airways clear of excess secretions. When patients are unable to mobilize mucus secretions on their own, airway clearance techniques for patients with many respiratory disorders can include: Chest physiotherapy o Can be administered by respiratory therapists, family members, or other informal caregivers o Has been the standard of care for first -line secretion clearance for individuals with excessive or retained mucus.6 o Typically administered by a trained caregiver over 1 t o 3 sessions per day , each lasting 20 to 30 minutes, depending on disease severity.6 o May also be known as percussion and postural drainage . Breathing techniques o Typically taught to patients by pulmonary rehabilitation professionals . o Active cycle breathi ng techniques include breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises, and the forced expiration technique .6 o Autogenic drainage involves breathing techniques in 3 phases (unstick, collect, and evacuate) at different lung volumes. o Breathing techniques do not require devices or assistance and can be self - administered.6 Positive expiratory pressure devices o Increase resistance, prevent airway closure, and increase collateral ventilation.6 16 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 o Some use oscillatory mechanisms to create vibrations when a patient b reathes out.6 o Examples include TheraPEP, Resistex Mucus Clearing Device, Flutter, Acapella, Quake, and Aerobika. o The therapy from these devices can be self -administered without assistance.6 Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation o A pneumatic device that uses high -frequency oscillatory ventilation through a mouthpiece.6 o An example is the Percussionaire Corporation IPV Ventilator.6 High -frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) devices, which are described in the following section of this document. o Therapy from these devices can be self -administered.6 Indications Children and adults with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, COPD, or pulmonary complications from neuromuscular disease resulting in chronic lung disease might be prescribed HFCWO devices to assist in the clearance of mucus in airways as part of their treatment plan. HFCWO devices exert external force on the chest wall to assist in mobilizing mucus and use sound waves or pressure from inflation and deflation at variable intensities and frequencies to generate the force. They are much more expensive than the alternative forms of treatment but require less time from caregivers than che st physiotherapy.

COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder; FDA: US Food and Drug Administration; HFCWO: high -frequency chest wall oscillation. Evidence Review We identified 2 systematic reviews,6,18 4 randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ),19-21,44 and a single ongoing RCT22 for the comparative effectivenes s of HFCWO devices for children and adults with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, COPD , or pulmonary complications from neuromuscular disease resulting in chronic lung disease . We did not identify any studies of the comparative cost effectiveness of HFCWO d evices. Cystic Fibrosis We identified a single systematic review that focused on airway clearance techniques in people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, and included RCTs and quasi -randomized trials of HFCWO devices.6 The review included external chest oscil lating devices as well as oral oscillatory devices.6 Morrison and colleagues abstracted information related to the scope of this coverage guidance : exercise tolerance and frequency of exacerbations with or without hospitalization.6 Morrison and colleagues included 39 studies in the qualitative review and 19 studies in meta -analyses; they rated 85% of these studies as having unclear risk of bias.6 They rated the quality of evidence summarized in the review as very low to low across outcomes.6 We rated this systematic review as having low risk of bias, and the authors rated component studies as having unclear to high risk of bias. The studies in this review did not report symptoms of breathlessness or cough, mortality, or exercise capacity for participan ts using HFCWO devices. Exacerbations and Hospitalizations The single RCT (N = 107) that compared HFCWO devices to positive expiratory pressure therapy reported that the average number of exacerbations requiring antibiotics during the 12 -month study period was significantly higher in the HFCWO groups (median, 2.0; interquartile range, 1.0 to 3.0) than the positive expiratory pressure therapy group (median, 1.0; interquartile range, 0.0 to 2.0; P = .007).6 The single RCT (N = 50) that compared HFCWO devices to conventional physiotherapy for patients with cystic fibrosis admitted to a hospital for an acute exacerbation reported no significant difference between the groups for days of hospitalization or time to pulmonary exacerbation (mean difference, - 0.20; 95 % CI, -2.32 to 1. 92).6 The participants in this study were between 16 and 25 years of age, and 64.0% were identified as male.6 Patients in the conventional physiotherapy group received therapy from a respiratory physiotherapist 3 times per day for approxim ately 30 minutes each time , along with the use of an inhaler prior to sessions with the physiotherapist.6 Neither of the 2 RCTs that compared HFCWO devices to breathing techniques for cystic fibrosis reported exacerbations or any other outcome scoped for t his review.6 20 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 Only 1 of 6 studies compar ing HFCWO devices to other external and oral oscillatory devices assessed exacerbations (N = 16); it reported that there were no significant differences between groups for frequency of hospitalizations or use of home intravenous therapies.6 Bronchiectasis We identified a single systematic review focused on airway clearance techniques for people diagnosed with bronchiectasis,18 and a single RCT (Nicollini et al., 2020; N = 60) that was published after the search dates of the systematic review.19 We rated the systematic review as having a low risk of bias and the RCT as having a moderate risk of bias. The systematic review includ ed 7 RCTs, but only 1 included RCT used HFCWO devices in the intervention group (Nicollini et al., 2013; N = 30).23 This RCT was rated as having an unclear risk of bias by the authors of the systematic review. Both RCTs focused on adults.19,23 Neither of these RCTs reported on mortality. Exacerbations and Hospitalizations In Nicollini and colleagues' 2020 RCT, both groups that used HFCWO devices had statistically significant improvement in exacerbations during the 12 months of the study compared to the aver age exacerbations per year prior to baseline.19 Only the group that used the Respin11 HFCWO device had significantly fewer exacerbations during the 12 -month study period , compared to the pharmacological comparison group that only received standard pharmaco logical care without HFCWO or chest physiotherapy < .001).19 The 2 HFCWO devices included in this study are described in Table 1. Breathlessne ss or Cough Nicollini and colleagues' 2013 RCT , identified in the systematic review , reported a statistically significant decrease in breathlessness, cough and sputum on the Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale (BCSS) in the group treated with HFCWO dev ices compared to a control group that received chest physiotherapy (mean difference, -5.8; 95% CI, -7.21 to -4.39; N = 20; P < .05).23 This study summed the scores of items across 3 subscales, which makes it challenging to anchor this improvement in patient - response terms; publications that assess the clinical importance of change -scores for this scale rely on reporting the average score across subscales (i.e., mean -scores range from 0 to 4, and sum -scores range from 0 to 12 on this sca le). This RCT also reported that use of HFCWO devices was associated with lower scores on a dyspnea scale compared to the group that received chest physiotherapy (mean difference, - 1.7; 95% CI, -2.4 to -1; N = 20; P < .05). 23 The additional Nicollini and colleagues ' 2020 RCT also reported that the group using the Respin11 HFCWO device demonstrated statistically significant improvement on the BCSS compared to the control group that received pharmacological therapy and standard care without HFCWO ( Respin11 m ean at 12 months post -baseline , 2.8; SD, not reported; control mean at 12 months post -baseline, 6.1; SD, not reported ; P < .001). 19 The group that used the SmartVest HFCWO device did not demonstrate a significant improvement on the BCSS compared to the con trol group (SmartVest mean at 12 months post -baseline, 4.5; SD, not reported; control mean at 12 months post -baseline, 6.1; SD, not reported; P > .05). 21 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 Exercise Capacity The Nicollini and colleagues ' 2020 RCT used a 6 -minute walk test to assess exercise ca pacity but did not report the results of the walk test.19 COPD We identified a single RCT that reported on the safety and effectiveness of HFCW O devices compared to intrapulmonary percussive ventilation in patients with severe COPD, and rated this RCT as h aving a moderate risk of bias.20 The listed authors overlapped with the 2 RCTs reviewed in the bronchiectasis section, and the design of all 3 RCTs was similar.20 Participants in this study had severe or very severe (but stable) COPD and were followed for 4 weeks a fter being randomized into 3 groups: 1 group received 2 sessions per day (lasting 15 minutes per session ) of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation with a respiratory physiotherapist using a percussive ventilator; 1 group received 2 se ssions per day (lasting 20 minutes per session ) of HFCWO with a respiratory physiotherapy; and 1 group received standard pharmacological therapy alone that the investigators termed \"the best medical therapy.\"20 Most participants were 70 years or older and had more than 2 exacerbations and 1 hospitalization per year.20 This study did not report mortality, hospitalizations, exacerbations, or exercise capacity.20 Breathlessness or Cough The average BCSS score for participants in the control group worsened over time, but average BCSS scores for participants in the intrapulmonary percussive ventilation and HFCWO groups improved; both treatment groups had statistically significantly lower BCSS scores when compared to the standard treatment group (control group bas eline mean, 4.6; SD, 1.7; control group post -treatment mean, 5.5; SD, 2.1).20 Symptoms were nearly halved in the group receiving intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (intrapulmonary percussive ventilation group baseline The intrapulmonary percussive ventilation group BCSS scores were statistically significantly lower than HFCWO group scores after the 4 weeks of treatment (HFCWO group baseline mean, 6.6; SD, 2.8; HFCWO group post -treatment mean, 5.2; SD, 2.2; between -group difference, P < .01).20 In other words, the participants in the intrapulmonary percussive ventilation group improved more on symptoms of breathlessness or cough on average, compared to participants who received HFCWO device therapy . Pulmonary Complications from Neuromuscular D isease We identified 2 RCTs that assessed the safety and effectiveness of HFCWO devices for individuals diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease with pulmonary complicat ions.21,44 One RCT focused on adults diagnosed with ALS.21 Participants in this study were followed for 12 weeks after being randomized into groups that received HFCWO therapy (N = 19) or no treatment (N = 16).21 We rated this RCT as having a high risk of bias. This study did not report mortality, exacerbations, hospitalizations, or exercise capacity. The second RCT included 14 children various neuromuscular diseases (i.e ., deficiency, spinal muscular atrophy type 2, muscle -eye-brain disease, and giant axonal neuropathy).44 None of the participating children had used cough -assistive devices or intrapulmonary percussive ventilation prior to the trial, but 10 relied on nocturnal noninvasive bile vel ventilation and 1 22 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 was dependent on a ventilator.44 Participants were randomized to receive standard chest physiotherapy (N = 7) or to receive HFCWO device therapy (N = 7) for a mean of 5 months; follow -up periods varied nonsignificantly by participant and group assignment.44 An additional 9 participants in this RCT were diagnosed with cerebral palsey, but did not have neuromuscular disease diagnoses;44 we report outcomes from this study when the results were reported separately for participants with cer bral palsey and participants with neuromuscular disease (i.e., pulmonary exacerbations and hospitalizations). We rated this study as having a high risk of bias. Exacerbations and Hospitalizations The RCT that included children with neuromuscular disease re ported hospitalization and pulmonary exacerbations that required antibiotics. There was a nonsignificant difference in the number of control group participants requiring hospitalizations (2/7) compared to the HFCWO device group (0/7; P > .05), and nonsigni ficant difference between control group participants requiring antibiotics (3/7) compared to the HFCWO device group (2/7; P > .05).44 Breathlessness or Cough On average, participants in the HFCWO device group had a statistically significantly greater decrease in breathlessness (HFCWO group mean difference, -1.28; group receiving no care mean difference, 0.84; P < .05) in the RCT that included adults with ALS , but no statistically significant differences in day or night cough or dyspnea.21 Among the 21 participants with impaired lung capacity (forced vital capacity of 40% to 70%) in this RCT , this pattern of improvement in breathlessness for participants using HF CWO devices was further accentuated (HFCWO group mean difference, -1.71; untreated group mean difference, 1.51; P < .05).21 Harms of HFCWO Devices We reviewed the RCTs described above for information about harms and adverse events . We also searched the FDA 's manufacturer and user facility device experience database (MAUDE) for report s of adverse events for each of the HFCWO devices listed in the technology description. A single RCT comparing HFCWO devices to positive expiratory pressure therapy for patients with cystic fibrosis reported adverse events.24 This RCT was included in the systematic review described in the cystic fibrosis section, and used the inCourage System from RespirTech for the HFCWO device.6,24 The authors for this RCT reported that the num ber of adverse events was not statistically different between the 2 groups (HFCWO, 200 events; positive expiratory pressure, 163 events; P > .05).23 However, the HFCWO device group had significantly more lower airway adverse events (mean, 2.46; SD, not rep orted) compared to the positive expiratory pressure group (mean, 1.72; SD not reported; P = .023).24 Lower airway events included increased cough, chest infection, hemoptysis , decreased lung function and chest pain.24 Reports identified in the MAUDE databa se are listed in Ta ble 2, by device.

Comparative Cost Effectiveness of HFCWO Devices We did not identify any comparative cost -effectiveness studies of HFCWO devices. Ongoing Studies for HFCWO Devices We identified a single ongoing comparative study for HFCWO devices in the Clinical Trials Registry. This pilot study will evaluate the use of the Vest system for treatment of bronchiectasis patients in the home setting .25 This study is a nonblinded, multi -site, randomized control led trial that anticipates enrolling 70 participants, and will compare the Vest HFCWO therapy to oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) therapy for adults aged 18 years and older diagnosed with bronchiectasis.25 Assessed outcomes will include .25 The anticipated study completion date was November 2020.25 Evidence Summary For patients with cystic fibrosis , we have low confidence that HCWFO device therapy is equivalent to conventional chest physiotherapy and positive expiratory pressure devices for pre vention of exacerbations requiring antib iotics and for reducing symptoms of coughing and breathlessness. There is no evidence regarding other outcomes. For patients with bronchiectasis, we have very low confidence that HFCWO device therapy reduces hospital izations from exacerbations and improves symptoms of breathlessness and cough compared to Frequencer V2 and V2x7 January 26, 20118 SQL System9 December 19, 201310 Electromed No records The Vest Airway Clearance System Model 10511 February 21, 200312 Hill-Rom No records Respin1113 July 13, RespInnovation SAS records InCourage Vest15 June 17, 200516 Philips, via RespirTech 8 reports identified classified under injury event type o Rib bone fractures in 3 different patients o 1 vertebral fracture o 1 electromagnetic interference problem with a pacemaker o 1 hematoma o 1 pneumothorax o 1 pressure problem with co -occurring mastitis AffloVest17 March 27, 201312 International Biophysics Corporation 1 report identified Fractured ribs 24 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 pharmacological therapy with other device -delivered interventions (e.g., positive expiratory pressure mask) , and compared to pharmacological therapy without other dev ices. There is no evidence regarding other outcomes. For patients with COPD, we have very low confidence that HFCWO device therapy is associated with less improvement in breathlessness and cough compared to intrapulmonary percussive ventilation. There is no evidence regarding other outcomes. For patients with pulmonary complications from neuromuscular disease , we have very low confidence that HFCWO device therapy improves symptoms of breathlessness compared to no treatment or to standard chest physiotherapy . One study only included patients with ALS receiving HFCWO devices compared to no treatment, and the study that included children with neuromuscular disease likely had too few participants to identify whether there was a benefit to using HFCWO devices com pared to standard chest physiotherapy . We have very low confidence that HFCWO device therapy does not improve day or night cough, or dyspnea compared to receiving no treatment for patients with ALS. There is no evidence regarding other outcomes for other n euromuscular diseases resulting in chronic lung disease. We identified few reports of adverse events or harms of HFCWO devices in the reviewed studies and the FDA's database for adverse event reporting for devices. Policy Landscape Payer Coverage Policies We identified HFCWO device coverage policies for Washington State's Medicaid program, a local coverage determination from Medicare, and 4 private payers. Medicare's local coverage determination and all 4 private payer policies require documentatio n that standard treatments, such as chest physiotherapy, have failed or are not tolerated before covering HFCWO devices; these policies cover HFCWO devices for patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, but coverage for neuromuscular diseases with p ulmonary complications varies. None of these policies cover HFCWO devices for patients with COPD except when there is comorbid bronchiectasis . Medicaid The Washington Health Care Authority's (HCA) policy for respiratory care considers chest physiotherapy to be the standard of care for secretion clearance, but states that there are situations in which conventional chest physiotherapy is unavailable, ineffective, or not tolerated.26 The HCA covers HFCWO air-pulse generator system s when medically necessary for a person with a diagnosis characterized by excessive mucus production and difficulty clearing secretions .26 Other airway -clearance devices covered by the HCA include mechanical percussors, oscillatory positive expiratory pressure devices, positive expirat ory pressure devices, and cough stimulating devices, including alternating positive and negative airway pressure devices, and replacement batteries.26 Prior authorization is required, and the policy also states that the rental of a HFCWO device and generat or includes all repairs and replacements, and that the manufacturer will replace the vest according to changes in user's size during the rental and purchase period.26 The HFCWO device is considered to be purchased after 12 months of rental, and there is a limit of 1 HFCWO device per client, per lifetime.24 The fee schedule, which was last updated in October 2020, 25 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 lists the maximum allowable monthly rental fee for a HFC WO device ( HCPCS E0483 ) as $1,224.07, and maximum for replacement parts ( HCPCS A7025) as $465.90.27 Medicare The local coverage determination for HFCWO devices (L33785) for Medicare, last updated in 2020, provides the following criteria f or medical necessity28: There is a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis ; or There is a diagnosis of bronchiectasis that has been confirmed by a high resolution, spiral, or standard CT sca n and which is characterized by daily productive cough for at least 6 contin uous months and frequent exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy (2 or more times per year); chronic bronchitis and COPD in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis of bronchiectasis do not meet this criterion ; or The beneficiary has one of the following n euromuscular disease diagnoses : post -polio; acid maltase deficiency; anterior myotonic disorders; other myopathies; or paralysis of the diaphragm; and There must be well -documented failure of standard treatments to adequately mobilize retained secretions. It is not reasonable and necessary for a beneficiary to use both a HFCWO device and a mechanical in -exsufflation device . Replacement supplies, HCPCS A7025 and A7026, used with beneficiary owned equipment, are covered if the beneficiary meets the criteria listed above for the base device, HCPCS E0483. If these criteria are not met , the claim will be denied as not reasonable and necessary. Private Payers Aetna updated its policy for HFCWO devices in March 2021 and anticipates re-review in January 2022. This policy provides the following criteria for medical necessity29: Patient has a well -documented failure of standard treatments to adequately mobilize retained secretions ; and Patient has been diagnosed with bronchiectasis confirmed by CT scan, characterized by daily productive cough for at least 6 continuous months or by frequent (i.e., more than 2 times per year) exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy; or Patient ha s been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis or immotile cilia syndrome; or Patient has been diagnosed with 1 of the following neuromuscular diseases: acid maltase deficiency; anterior horn cell diseases, ar dystrophy; post -polio; or quadriplegia regardless of underlying etiology. Lung transplant recipients, within the first 6 months post -operatively, who are unable to tolerate standard chest physiotherapy. Aetna considers continuous high -frequency chest wall oscillation therapy for the treatment of bronchitis, and secretion -induced atelectasis to be experimental and investigational because there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness . Aetna considers high -frequency chest compression systems experimental and investigational for other indications in members who do not meet medical necessity criteria above (e.g., alpha 26 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 1antitrypsin deficiency, cerebral palsy, childhood atel ectasis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, coma, Cri -du-Chat syndrome, individuals with acute pneumonic respiratory failure receiving mechanical ventilation, interstitial lung syndrome; not an all -inclusive list) because their effectiveness for these indications has not been established. Cigna updated its policy for HFCWO devices in March 2021 and anticipates reviewin g this policy in September 2021. This policy provides the following criteria for medical necessity30: Patient has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and there is a failure, intolerance, or contraindication to home chest physiotherapy , or it cannot be provided; or Patient has been diagnosed with bronchiectasis confirmed by high -resolution computed tomography ; has daily productive cough for at least 6 months or requires antibiotic treatment of exacerbations 2 or more times per year; and failure of standard treatments (e.g. , pharmacotherapy, postural drainage, chest percussion, vibration) to mobilize secretions ; or Patient has been diagnosed with neuromuscular disease; that disease is characterized by excessive mucus production, infection and difficulty clearing secretions ; and there is a failure, intolerance, or contraindication to standard treatment (e.g., pharmacotherapy, postural drainage, daily chest percussion) and standard airway clearance device (e.g., mechanical percussors, positiv e expiratory pressure device) . Moda updated its policy for HFCWO devices in March 2021, and considers airway oscillating devices, mechanical percussors, positive expiration masks to be medically necessary to assist in mobilizing respiratory tract secretion s for patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, immotile cilia syndrome, or asthma. Their policy requires prior authorization and provides the following criteria for medical necessity31: Face -to-face visit with provider within 6 mo nths prior to the request; Documentation of failure of standard treatments to adequately mobilize retained secretions; Cannot request both HFCWO and mechanical in -exsufflation device; and One or more of the following conditions are met: o A high resolution, spiral, or standard CT scan documentation of bronchiectasis that is characterized by 1 or more of the following : at least 6 months of daily productive cough, or frequent exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy (i.e., more than 2 times per year); o The pa tient does not have chronic bronchitis and COPD in the absence of confirmed diagnosis of bronchiectasis o Cystic fibrosis or immotile cilia syndrome o The patient has one of the following neuromuscular diseases: acid maltase deficiency; anterior horn post -polio; quadriplegia regardless of etiology; lung transplant recipients who are unable t o tolerate standard chest physiotherapy, and who have submitted a request within the first 6 months post -operatively. 27 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 Indications for which HFCWO is considered investigational include a lpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, childhood atelectasis, cerebral palsy, c oma, leukodystrophy, scolios is, and stiff -person syndrome . Moda's policy specifically names the following devices but notes that the list is not all -inclusive: Frequencer, SmartVest, MedPulse Respiratory Vest System, The Vest Airway Clearance Sys tem, ABI Vest, Respin11 Bronchial Clearance System, and InCourage Vest/System.31 Regence BlueCross BlueShield updated their policy for oscillatory devices in July 2020 and anticipates starting a new review for their policy in June 2021. This policy require d prior authorization and provides the following criteria for medical necessity for use of HFCWO devices32: Among patients with cystic fibrosis: demonstrated need for airway clearance and documentation that standard chest physiotherapy has failed, is not t olerated, or cannot be performed. Failure is defined as continued frequent severe exacerbations of respiratory distress. Among patients with chronic diffuse bronchiectasis: demonstrated need for airway clearance; documentation that standard chest physiothe rapy has failed, is not tolerated, or cannot be performed; and high resolution or spiral chest tomography scan to document bronchiectasis, plus either daily productive cough for at least 6 continuous months, or exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy 3 or more times per year. Among patients with COPD or conditions associated with other neuromuscular disorders , HFCWO devices are considered investigational. Evidence -based Guidelines and Recommendations National Institute for Health Care and Excellence (NIC E) The NICE guidelines published in 2017 for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cystic fibrosis explicitly state that HFCWO devices should not be offered as an airway clearance technique for people with cystic fibrosis except in exceptional clinic al circumstances.33 There is a special cystic fibrosis team that decides when circumstances are exceptional; otherwise, the guidance states that based on published evidence, HFCWO is not as effective as other airway clearance techniques.33 We did not ident ify any NICE guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of bronchiectasis, COPD, or neuromuscular diseases that explicitly included HFCWO devices in the recommendations sections. European Respiratory Society The European Respiratory Society pu blished guidelines in 2017 for the management of adult bronchiectasis from determinations made by a task force comprised of respiratory medicine, microbiology, physiotherapy, thoracic surgery, primary care, and patient advocates.34 Systematic reviews of pu blished evidence were conducted, reviewed, and debated by this task force during 4 in - person meetings that took place over 21 months, with additional communication by email and teleconference when drafting the final recommendations.34 Any task force member s with conflicts of interest were forced to abstain from all voting activities during the process of developing recommendations.34 The guideline recommends that patients with bronchiectasis be taught to use an airway clearance technique 1 to 2 times daily by a trained physiotherapist, as a weak recommendation based on low quality of evidence.34 HFCWO therapy was one of multiple airway clearance techniques 28 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 that the task force considered while making this recommendation, but there was no statement of which airway clearance technique might be superior to others.34 There was a strong recommendation for use of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with impaired exercise capacity.34 European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) ENMC convened a meeting in March 2017 with 21 internationally recognized experts in airway clearance techniques for patients with neuromuscular disorders.35 Several of the participating experts had received funding, honoraria, or expenses for travel paid for by manufacturers of devices that assist in airway clearance.35 HFCWO devices were addressed in the review that the experts published after the meeting in the section related to peripheral airway clearance techniques, which also included discussion of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation, manual chest compression, and chest wall strapping.35 Other sections of the review included information about manually assisted cough, assisted inspiration and expiration, mechanical insufflation -exsufflation.35 The authors concluded that peripheral airway clear ance techniques such as HFCWO therapy may be effective, and should be considered for use in management of chronic lung disease associated with neuromuscular disorders alongside manually assisted cough or other equipment to clear secretions from airways.35 The authors noted that HFCWO devices are expensive in comparison to other available devices and techniques.35 American College of Chest Physicians The American College of Chest Physicians published an expert panel report in 2018 on treating cough due to no n-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis with nonpharma cological clearance after conducting a systematic review of published evidence.36 The authors were unable to make recommendations due to insufficient evidence, but pro vided the following consensus -based suggestions36: For children and adults with productive cough due to bronchiectasis related to any cause, we suggest that they be taught airway clearance techniques by professionals with advanced training in airway clear ance techniques. For children and adults with productive cough due to bronchiectasis related to any cause, we suggest that the frequency of airway clearance should be determined by disease severity and amount of secretions. For children and adults with pro ductive cough due to bronchiectasis related to any cause, we suggest that airway clearance techniques are individualized as there are many different techniques. American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) AARC published clinical practice guidelines ab out the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic airway clearance therapies in hospitalized patients with impaired secretion clearance, based on a systematic review of published studies.37 The guidelines provided focused recommendations for adult and pediatric patients without cystic fibrosis; adult and pediatric patients with neuromuscular disease, respiratory mus cle weakness, or impaired cough; and p ostoperative adult and pediatric patients .37 These guidelines note that HFCWO was not recommended for adult and pe diatric patients with neuromuscular disease, respiratory mus cle weakness, or impaired cough, due to insufficient evidence.37 Airway clearance techniques were not recommended for routine treatment of COPD or post -operative care.37 The authors 29 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 propose the fo llowing process questions when considering the use of airway clearance techniques in these populations37: Does the patient have difficulty clearing airway secretions? Are retained secretions affecting gas exchange or lung mechanics? Focus on patient's lev el of difficulty for mobilizing and expectorating secretions. Which therapy is likely to provide the greatest benefit with the least harm? What is the cost of the therapy in terms of the device cost and clinician time to apply or supervise the therapy? The authors note that this is especially relevant for devices or therapies to be used at home. What factors are important to the patient about performing airway clearance therapy? This is an important consideration , given the lack of high -quality evidence tha t any one technique is more effective than other techniques. Recommendations and Guidelines from Professional Societies American Thoracic Society The American Thoracic Society published a clinical practice guideline in 2011 for the diagnosis and management of stable COPD in partnership with the American College of Physician, American College of Chest Physicians, and European Respiratory Society.38 This guideline did not consider oscillation devices as part of standard management of COPD.38 Recommendations from Advocacy Organizations American Lung Association The American Lung Association does not list HFCWO devices as part of the management and tre atment of cystic Cystic Fibrosis Foundation promotes the use of clinical practice guidelines from a systematic review of the evidence that the foundation commissioned in 2009 to compare airway clearance techniques and devices.42 The review concluded that airway clearance should be part of managing cystic fibrosis to maintain lung function and improve quality of life, and assessed that this could provide a moderate net benefit based on fa ir quality body of evidence.43 No airway clearance technique or device was found to be superior to others, and the authors recommended that airway clearance technique be individualized to the patient in consideration of age, preference, and history of adve rse events.43 30 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 References 1.

GRADE Table Element Descriptions Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adheren ce to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource allocation, values and preferences and other factors. Against: The subcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recomm endation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource allocation, values and preferences and other factors. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a rec ommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource allocation, values and preferences and other factors., but further research or additional information could lead to a different conclusion. Agai nst: The subcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but further rese arch or additional information could lead to a different conclusion. Confidence in estimate rating across studies for the intervention/outcome Assessment of confidence in estimate includes factors such as risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency a nd publication bias. High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Element Description Balance of benefits and harms The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. An estimate that is not statistically significant or has a confidence interval crossing a predetermined clinical decision threshold will be downgraded. Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed in the absence of likely cost offsets \u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommenda tion is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Other considerations Other considerations include issues about the implementation and operationalization of the technology or intervention in health systems and practices within Oregon. 34 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 Moderate: The subc ommittee is moderately confident in the estimate of effect: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with some limitations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. Low: The subcommittee's confidence in the estimate of effect is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths. Very low: The subcommittee has very little confidence in the estimate of effect: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Typical sets of studies are nonrandomized studies with serious limitations or inconsistent results across studies. 35 High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices DRAFT for VbBS/HERC Meeting 3/10/2022 Appendix B.

HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 1 Table of .............. A3, A4, A6, B2-B8, C3-C6, C8 Evidence not included of HFCWO for COPD, bronchiectasis , neuromuscular disease , Most of the data submitted from commenters were not published in peer -reviewed journals (e.g., posters and conference abstracts) or used noncomparative before -after designs . Others did not appropriately include the relevant populations or appropriate outcomes to address th e Key Q uestions. One study did meet inclusion criteria and has since been added to the coverage guidance , but it did not change conclusions. B1, B2 , B9, C3 The state of the evidence for HFCWO therapy is sparse given the rare diseases it treats, lack of consensus on study endpoints, and inability to use blind ing. Lower -quality evidence obtained from real- world data (claims databases) shows this therapy is effective and cost -effective. This lower -quality evidence should be considered , and coverage should be recommended for other conditions . Although observational before -and-after studies (like those submitted by commenters) , do appear to show benefit, the study design s do not permit us to determine whether the effect was caused by HFCWO devices ; these study designs cannot control for confounding factors. More robust study designs exist, such as the randomized trial , or if that is not feasible, a matched -cohort or interrupted -time -series study. Though a randomized trial would be very challenging for the heterogenous population with neuromuscular disease , it would be feasible for COPD and bronchiectasis, as they are relatively common conditions. Initially, evidence related to non-CF bronchiectasis and neuromuscular conditions supported non -coverage. However, we have revised our recommendation to allow limited coverage based on the potential benefit and expert recommendation to extrapolate evidence from CF to other non -CF bronchiectasis and on pathophysiological reasoning . For neuromuscular conditions , the variety of disease manifestations makes HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 2 IDs/#s Summary of Issue Subcommittee Response the development of a strong evidence base for each condition unlikely . Thus, we have based our recommendation on expert input and the potential to reduce costs associated with hospitalization and chronic airway infection. A9, C2, D1, D4 Patients prefer the convenience and independence afforded by HFCWO. The availability of HFCWO devices respects patient preferences and offers several practic al advantages. Some patients with varying conditions cannot use chest physiotherapy for practical reasons or because of contraindications related to their condition s. We note patient preferences for convenience and independence in our GRADE tables and the Values and Preferences section in the report. Patient values and preferences are an important part of the rationale for coverage of HFCWO for patients with cystic fibrosis, for which evidence indicates HFCWO is comparably safe and effective to chest physiotherapy. A5, C3, C7 Medicare, most state Medicaid programs , and most commercial payers provide coverage for cystic fibrosis , neuromuscular disease, and bronchiectasis. HERC should recommend coverage for patients with these conditions for whom other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. The report describes coverage for Medicare, Washington's Medicaid program, and selected payers active in Ore gon (e.g., Aetna, Moda, Cigna, and BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon). These payers do cover HFCWO device therapy for cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis , as well as for certain neuromuscular disorders. However, the subcommittee views other payer policies as contextual information rather than evidence of effectiveness. Step therapy is an appropriate utilization management tool for facilitating limited access to higher -cost services. However, even second -line covered services need to have sufficient evidence of effectiveness for improv ing critical or important outcomes . D1-D5 Description of personal experience with a child with Rett's Syndrome and knowledge of other families whose children use the devices and are part of the Children's In -Home Intensive Waiver program. Personal experiences , including reports of variation in provider and health plan decisions and processes, provide important context for the subcommittee's decisions. HERC's coverage decisions are made at the population level based on available evidence , informed by testimony and expert opinion . These decisions are intended primarily for health plans, includi ng the Oregon Health Plan. The Children's In -Home Intensive Waiver program is not a health plan, and recommendations for that program are outside the scope of this report and outside the purview of the HERC.

AAHomecare's members are proud to be part of the continuum of care that as sures that individuals receive cost -effective medical equipment and supplies, and related services, in their homes. AAHomecare supports high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) coverage for patients with airway clearance needs and appreciates the oppo rtunity to comment on the Evidence -based Guidance Subcommittee coverage recommendations for HFCWO. HFCWO is an airway clearance therapy that healthcare professionals have long -used to treat patients with impaired mucociliary clearance and mucus hypersecret ion - specifically for the clinical management of cystic fibrosis, neuromuscular disease (NMD), bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Due to the lack of coverage criteria and fee schedule for HFCWO in Oregon Medicaid's Durable M edical Equipment (DME), Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies Thank you for your comments.

AAHomecare strongly supports the subcommittee's guidance to recommend HFCWO coverage for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and urges the committee to consider HFCWO coverage for patients with NMD, bronchiectasis and COPD for the following reasons: A2 1) HFCWO therapy is an established technology that has served chronic respiratory patients for decades and is considered the standard of care for cystic fibrosis patients with an estimated 76% of the US CF population using the therapy for airway clearance, according to the 2019 CF Foundation Patient Registry Annual Data Report. Our background section acknowledges HFCWO device therapy is a commonly used treatment option for cystic fibrosis. A3 2) Respiratory complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with NMD, and HFCWO has been shown to reduce these complications. Some NMD patients are not able t o tolerate manual CPT or be put in all of the required positions to receive the treatment. Our review found insufficient evidence that HFCWO device therapy reduces exacerbations and hospitalizations for conditions other than cystic fibrosis. A4 3) For patients with non -cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, HFCWO therapy reduces the frequency of acute exacerbations, hospitalizations, antibiotic use and costs. For bronchiectasis, our review found very -low-confidence evidence that HFCWO device therapy improve s key outcomes. A5 4) Medicare, most state Medicaid programs, and nearly all commercial payers, provide HFCWO coverage for CF, NMD and bronchiectasis patients. Our policy is to report coverage for Medic are, Washington 's Medicaid program, and selected payers active in Oregon (e.g., Aetna, Moda, Cigna, and BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon). These payers do cover HFCWO device therapy for cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis as well as for certain neuromuscular disorders. A6 5) For COPD, airway clearance devices reduce exacerbations and hospitalizations. According to a recent meta -analysis across 18 studies of airway clearance devices, future exacerbations were reduced by 50%. In addition, analysis of real -world data We identified the meta -analysis that you refer to (Daynes et al., 2021). The single included study of HFCWO devices that reported exacerbations for patients with COPD in this HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 5 ID/# Comment Disposition from the Optum claims database found that respiratory -related hospitalizations were reduced by 17% with the application of vest therapy. All -cause hospitalizations were reduced by 40%, ER visits by 27%, and office visits by 12% during the same time i n a 2017 study using the Truven MarketScan database. meta -analysis was included and summarized in the coverage guidance. The other 17 studies included in this meta -analysis did not report exacerbations for p atients with COPD in studies testing the effectiveness of HFCWO devices. The 2 other studies that you refer to (Berry et al., 2019; McEvoy et al., 2020) do not meet the study design requirement of the scope of this coverage guidance, as they were retrospec tive registry studies which additional devices and a broader set of disease entities than was included in this review. The analysis of claims from the Optum database was published as a poster (McEvoy et al., 2020), and is ineligible for inclusion. A7 6) Coverage criteria can ensure appropriate utilization by requiring patients to either try and fail other airway clearance therapies or have the therapy be contra - indicated by the patient's prescriber. Step therapy is an appropriate coverage tool for enablin g access to higher -cost services. However, even second -line covered services need to have sufficient evidence of effectiveness for improving critical or important outcomes. A8 7) It is in the best interest of the patient to give physicians access to all t herapies and devices to address specific patient needs. Thank you for your comment. A9 8) Coverage for HFCWO would respect patient preference, increase adherence to therapy, and provide assurance of reliable and consistent treatment, which would ultimately offset costs through reduced exacerbations and hospitalizations. 9) HFCWO offers practical advantages over other airway clearance approaches. For example, unlike chest physical therapy (e.g. chest physiotherapy, which is when a respiratory thera pist claps on the chest to loosen mucus from the lungs), HFCWO Our review did not look at eviden ce regarding adherence to therapy and found insufficient evidence that HFCWO device therapy reduces exacerbations and hospitalizations for conditions other than cystic fibrosis. We have noted patient preference for convenience and efficiency in our GRADE t able. HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 6 ID/# Comment Disposition devices make it easier and more efficient to perform chest physical therapy at home without the need for care delivery by a respiratory therapist or caregiver. The Values and Preferences section of the coverage guidance details how the lack of trained or willing caregivers can be a barrier to care , as well as how the use of HFCWO device therapy provides independence from caregivers. A10 HFCWO reduces respiratory complications for patients with CF, NMD, bronchiectasis and COPD. AAHomecare believes every effort should be made to facilitate access to effective therapies that can improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizati ons, and reduce f urther burdens to the healthcare system. For these reasons, AAHomecare encourages the committee to provide HFCWO coverage for CF, NMD, bronchiectasis and COPD patient populations. AAHomecare appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments. Thank you for your comments. B1 To Whom It May Concern: We reviewed the draft guidance for coverage of high -frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and are pleased with the recommendation for covera ge of cystic fibrosis (CF). Thank you for this change and for hearing my testimony at the HERC meeting on June 3. We ask that you reconsider the recommendation for denial of coverage to patients with bronchiectasis (BE), neuromuscular conditions, and COPD in light of real -world evidence that was possibly not considered in the analysis pr esented. We would first like to comment on the state of evidence for HFCWO therapy. Despite being used for over 20 years, there is a paucity of comparative evidence for any airway clearance technique and a particular paucity of randomized control trials (RCT). There are good reasons for this. Thank you for your comments. We have written responses to specific individual sections of your letter in the rows that follow. HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 7 ID/# Comment Disposition 1. HFCWO often treats rare diseases which makes it difficult to recruit cohorts of adequate size. There is little agreement on study endpoints. Prior studies did not identify or control for machine power settings or adherence. 2. Airway clearance studies cannot be blinded, making it impossible to do a double -blind study. HFCWO patients tend to be considerably sicker because of cur rent prescribing habits, making post hoc comparisons between different types of devices difficult to interpret. 3. Lastly, there seems to be little interest among independent researchers on this topic, perhaps because the therapy has been around for so long. These difficulties should be considered when setting expectations for the evidence. B2 Here we provide additional evidence about the impact of HFCWO for bronchiectasis, neuromuscular disorders, and COPD that may have been overlooked in the systematic review. This evidence is derived from several objective sources (principally healthcare claims databases) and is complemented b y patient -reported outcomes collected in a clinical registry of users of the Philips InCourage System. Collectively, real -world data supports the effectiveness of HFCWO for outcomes such as hospitalization, quality of life, and antibiotic use. We respectfu lly ask that this evidence be taken into account as you work to finalize the guidance. In 2016, your group expressed enthusiasm about our HFCWO outcomes in bronchiectasis patients and recommended that we publish the results - advice that we followed. We and others have made efforts to address evidence gaps by reporting patient outcomes as well as leveraging external databases of cleared healthcare claims. Collectively, these complementary sources have been published and/or presented at natio nal and international conferences. Based on the data overview provided at the recent HERC meeting, much of this evidence was not considered or shared with the members of the committee. Although observational before -and-after studies, such as the real -world studies you refer to, do appear to show benefit, this study design does not permit causal inference, and cannot control for confounding factors. M ore robust study designs exist, such as the randomized trial or, if that is not feasible, a matched -cohort or interrupted -time - series study . HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 8 ID/# Comment Disposition B3 The RespirTech bronchiectasis registry has been a source of outcomes for our product, the methodology and results appearing in a recent peer -reviewed publication.4 The results show a reduction in hospitalizations for bronchiectasis patients after the initiation of HFCWO (Figure 1).4 The autho rs took specific measures to reduce the risk of bias: (1) registry findings were validated against objective patient chart data, (2) all data were housed and managed by an independent actuarial firm, and (3) all statistics were conducted by a 3d -party biostatistician. While pre -post studies are subject to regression to the mean, these concerns are mitigated by the large sample and the persistent character of the improvement. The data show the response to HFCWO is sustained for up to two years; regression to the mean, if present, would become evident by this point. See response to B2 regarding study designs. Fundamentally, a before -and-after study may have other limitations in addition to regression toward the mean. In the example of a registry, confound ers can include, but are not limited to, the patient characteristics and family context of individuals who have access to HFCWO device therapy , and changes in clinical care aside from the HFCWO device therapy . B4 With a larger data set of over 12,000 pat ients, we extended the results to two years of follow -up, revealing a 72% reduction in hospitalization rate in the two years after initiating vest therapy (Figure 2).5 Regarding potential cost savings, this works out to be a bit less than one -half of an avoided hospitalization per patient per year. The avoided cost of an expensive inpatient admission compares favorably with the purchase price of the device. See respo nse to B2 regarding study designs. B5 Real -world evidence from two separate databases of cleared healthcare claims also demonstrates reductions in hospitalization in bronchiectasis patients following initiation of vest therapy. As an example, Weycker showed all -cause hospitalizations were redu ced by 33% (n=865 patients).6 A new study by Basavaraj presented at the 2021 ATS meeting reports that hospitalizations reduced by 73% in year one and by 64% in year two.7 See response to B2 regarding study designs . B6 Claims data support the benefits o f HFCWO therapy for neuromuscular patients. Analysis of claims data showed a 25% reduction in respiratory -related hospitalizations.8 In addition, a peer -reviewed publication found a corresponding 20% reduction in inpatient admissions and a 44% reduction i n inpatient days.9 Although Lechtzin et al., 2016 is a peer -reviewed publication, the study design was before -after , and the McEvoy et al., 2020 reference cited in this row was presented at a conference and not published in a peer -HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 9 ID/# Comment Disposition reviewed journal. See res ponse to B2 regarding study design. B7 Concerning COPD, we bring to your attention a new systematic review and meta - analysis which found that the use of airway clearance devices can improve exacerbation frequency.10 18 randomized controlled trials of airway clearance devices for patients with stable COPD were evaluated and reported that using devices to support everyday management reduced future exacerbations by 50%. The single included study of HFCWO devices that rep orted exacerbations for patients with COPD in this meta -analysis was included and summarized in the coverage guidance. The other 17 studies included in this meta -analysis did not report exacerbations for patients with COPD in studies testing the effectiven ess of HFCWO devices. B8 In terms of hospitalization outcomes from patients with COPD (n=219) within our registry, we found a 54.4% reduction in annualized hospitalization rate for respiratory causes.11 In addition, a study of Optum claims data found that respiratory -related hospitalization was reduced by 17% in the year after receiving vest therapy.12 Similarly, a 2017 study using MarketScan data showed that all -cause hospitalization was reduced by 40%.6 All 3 references cited in this row were presented as conference submissions and not published in peer - reviewed journals. B9 In summary, this beneficial therapy should be available in the toolkit for physicians in the treatment of patients with bronchiect asis, COPD, and neuromuscular disorders. The difficulties of designing and performing true comparative studies in this area are considerable and the likelihood of new large -scale RCTs being conducted for these disease states is low. However, recent real -world evidence directly addresses critical outcomes identified by this committee. The outcomes for HFCWO have been demonstrated using multiple independent sources. The convergent findings from these studies, specifically as it relates to reducing hospital izations and improving patient quality of life, should be considered so that this life -altering treatment is available to those who need it. Thank you for your comments. We reviewed the references that you provided and consider ed each for inclusion in the coverage guidance. Two references were excluded for not meeting the scope of the coverage guidance (Mikesell et al., 2017; Rubin, 2007). Six references were excluded beca use they were conference presentations (Barto et al., 2019a; Barto et al., al., 2020a; McEvoy et al., 2020b). Three references were excluded due to ineligible study designs (noncomparative obse rvational: Basavaraj et Lechtzin et 2016). HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 10 ID/# Comment Disposition Your work to address the evidence gaps is helpful and may motivate others to perform more rigorous research on these conditions. However, the subcomm ittee uses only peer -reviewed studies and generally requires between - group comparison for evidence of treatment effectiveness. C1 Dear EbGS Committee Members, Hillrom appreciates the opportunity to provide comment on the coverage recommendation for high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO). HFCWO therapy is an established technology that has served chronic respiratory patients for over 30 years. Hillrom strongly su pports the EbGS Committee's guidance to recommend HFCWO coverage for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Hillrom also requests the committee consider HCFWO coverage for patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD) and bronchiectasis. Thank you for your commen ts. We have written responses to specific individual sections of your comment in the rows that follow. C2 HFCWO coverage for patients with CF has expanded across the payer continuum such that at least 45 of the Medicaid fee -for-service plans cover HFCWO for CF beneficiaries. HFCWO is considered standard of care for CF as evidenced by the CF foundation's estimate that 76% of the US CF population uses HFCWO for airway clearance.1 This is largely attributable to assurance or reliable and consistent treatment, adherence to therapy, and patient preference. Accordingly, providing HFCWO coverage for the CF population would ultimately offset costs through reduced exacerbations and hospitalizations. We recognize that HFCWO device therapy is a commonly used t reatment option for cystic fibrosis . Though t he available evidence shows no difference in hospitalizations compared to chest physi otherapy, we are recommending coverage because of patient preferences and because chest physiotherapy may not be available or feasible for all patients. C3 Hillrom strongly encourages the committee also consider coverage for patients with NMD. Respiratory complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with NMD and HFCWO has been shown to reduce these complications. The rationale for the recommendation for coverage for patients with NMD starts that there is no evidence that HFCWO devices improve key outcomes compared to No economic studies met our inclusion criteria for this coverage guidance. See response to comment A5 regarding other payer coverage. HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 11 ID/# Comment Disposition standard treatments. Hillrom asserts that sufficient comparative clinical evidence is available that supports the HFCWO t herapy on improved key outcomes over standard treatments. Multiple economic outcome studies from highly reputable sources support HFCWO as a cost -saving strategy. Further, including HFCWO coverage for patients with NMD is consistent with Medicare, many Med icaid departments, and an increasing number of commercial payers. C4 The Yuan and Landon clinical studies compared the ef ficacy of HFCWO to chest physiotherapy (CPT). Both studies demonstrated significantly decreased rates of hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics and superior oxygenation for patients using HFCWO as well as superior adherence to the therapy. The investi gator - initiated Fitzgerald study demonstrated a 32% reduction in hospitalizations (P<.01) in neurologically impaired children with respiratory symptoms. These studies provide sufficient comparative evidence of the superior benefits of HFCWO over standard t reatment for this population. The Yuan et al., 2010 reference has been added to the coverage guidance since the submission of this comment. The Landon et al., 2022 reference was excluded because it was a conference abstract. The Fitzgerald et al., 2014 reference reported a before -after study. Although observational before -and-after studies, such as the real - world studies you refer to, do appear to show benefit, this study design does not permit causal inference, and more robust study designs exist, such as the randomized trial or, if that is not feasible, a matched -cohort study . C5 In addition, multiple economic outcomes data studies confirm the positive impact of HFCWO therapy on healthcare costs for neuromuscular disorders, which supports the efficacy of HFCWO when compared to standard treatment. Most notable is the 2019 research a rticle published by the National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE) which analysed the cost -effectiveness of HFCWO compared to CPT in patients with complex neurological disorders, including neuromuscular disease and cerebral palsy.5 This analysis revealed that per 1000 patients, the Vest System results in 2,422 less hospitalizations, and 49,868 less bed days compared to CPT, resulting in $8 M in cost savings over a five -year time frame.5 This reference was excluded because the cost effectiveness estimates produced for the health system in the UK are not directly related to cost effectiveness estimates for the health system in the US (Javanbakht et al., 2019). Additionally, this study included information from a before -after study and from the Yuan e t al., 2010 study that we have incorporated into the coverage guidance. HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 12 ID/# Comment Disposition C6 Another important economic data study, 2020 Pandya,6 analysed the claimed of 1008 patients from the Optum healthcare claims repository. The study demonstrated a reduction of respir atory -related hospitalizations by 24.7% (p<0.005) in patients receiving therapy. Similarly, Lechtzin demonstrated a 41.7% decrease in inpatients costs post intitation of HFCWO.7 These studies are based on thousands of patient records and clearly show the benefit of HFCWO compared to standard treatment. The Pandya et al., 2020 reference was a conference presentation of a before -after study; the other 2 references also utilized a before -after design. C7 Additionally, Medicare, most Medicaid departments , and nearly all commercial payers include HFCWO coverage for NMD patients. As of October 1, 2008, all CMS jurisdictions revised the HFCWO Local Coverage Determination to include NMD while over 40 Medicaid departments cover NMD disease state. Consistent wi th the criteria considerations included in the guidance, payer coverage policies ensure appropriate utilization by requiring patients must either try and fail other airway clearance therapies or have the therapy by contra -indicated by the patient's prescri ber. See response to comment A5 regarding other payer coverage. C8 Hillrom also strongly encourages the committee to approve coverage for patients with non -cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. In a comparative study, bronchiectasis patients on HFCWO demonstrated superior improvement in dyspnea, pulmonary function tests, and quality o f life compared to patients on PEP or CPT.8 Additional analyses suggest that HFCWO therapy reduces the frequency of acute exacerbations, hospitalizations, antibiotic use and costs in patients with bronchiectasis.9,10,11,12,13 The first reference (Nicolini et al., 2013) is already included in the coverage guidance. The Weycker et al., 2017 and Basavaraj et al., 2021 references are conference abstracts. The remaining 3 references (Barto et al., 2020; Seiver t et al., 2018; Sievert et al., 2017) references repo rt studies with noncomparative observational designs. The remaining references are addressed in the previous rows. D1 I personally know hundreds of families in the Northwest that hav e benefited from the use of the HFCWO device aka \"The Shaker Vest\" when experiencing respira tory distress. The scope of the current coverage guidance is limited to CF and bronchiecstasis. Whil e it refers to other neuromuscular disease resulting in chronic lung disease, Rett Syndrom e does not really fall into any of those categories. Thank you for your comment s and for sharing the story of a patient's care. While i ndividual stories provide context for the Subcommit tee's decisions, the Subcommi ttee makes coverage decisions on a population -level basis and HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 13 ID/# Comment Disposition Rett Syndrome is like having a child with autism, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's epilepsy and an anxiety disorder all in one. Our daughter also experiences osteoporosis, scoliosis and uses a wheelchair. She is at constant risk for aspiration which can lead to pne umonia literally in a matter of hours. The majority (>80%) of people with Rett Syndrome experience a neurological scoliosis which can require titanium rods to assist with opening the chest cavity. Otherwise, the lung is crushed and tends to fester a chronic infection in one lobe that quickly turns acute. When O2 sats drop, the shaker vest is the first step to increase O2 sat uration. In the year before her spinal surgery, [Redacted name] was hospitalized 6 times for pneumonia and t his was alw ays the protocol. O2 sats drop, use shaker vest, then on to cough assist, bi -pap, cpap and then trach in that order. If a family has a shaker vest at home, this can often be avoided and it also helps with home care after a hospital stay. During each of the se stays the therapists made sure we had this device at home despite having both primary and secondary insurance denying it. We appealed the denial over the course of a year, eventually losing all appeals because this committee has determined that CPT is c ost effective and only bronc hiecstasis and CF are coverable conditions. We were also at Randall Children's Hospital. My perso nal experience is that these devices get covered if you go to OHSU but not if you go to Randa ll. Why the inconsistency? As a parent , the unequal coverage and prescription among hospital s ystems suggests to me there are magic buzzwords being used that I am not privy to. As a family we were repeatedly assured that we had to go through the appeal and denial process - but that we would be denied eventually due to the current HERC guidance - and that Hill -Rom would gift it to us after that process. That is how I learned that Oregon is the ONLY state that doesn't cover these de vices. What is it that 49 other states saw that Oregon does not? At the end of the long and compl icated process of applications, appeals and denials, we had to send the device back to the comp any or pay them must base these decisions on evidence and other factors with respect to the population in general. Health plans c an and sometimes do make individual coverage exceptions for patient circumstances. Appeal and hearing processes are required by law, but outside the Subcommit tee's purview. The draft coverage guidance recommends coverage for certain patients with cystic fi brosis. HERC's coverage decisions are intended primarily for health plans, including the Oregon Health Plan. The Children's In -Home Intensive Waiver program is a separate program , and decisions on which services that program provides are outside the scope of this report . HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 14 ID/# Comment Disposition $16,000 for the privilege of having it on hand. We made the decision as a family that if her sats drop, we will t ake her straight to the emergency room because we don't have a shaker vest at home, even though it's the first thing the ER will do after the X -ray confirms diminished breathing in the lower lobes - every single winter....we are just one family on the hundre ds of families on the CIIS waivers. Reading this guidance the short version is that : It ONLY covers CF and bronchiectasis and other neuromuscular di sease resulting in chronic lung disease. What if you had a MEDICALLY INVOLVED person ( as defined by the Children's In Home Intensive Waiver) that resulted in multiple chronic and acute lung and respiratory -related incidents that were not considered 'disease'? D2 The current recommendation is \"weak\" but I find this term vague f or a variety of reasons - is it weak because there no empirical evidence or independent analysis on the cost -benefi t ratio on the reduction or avoidance of hospitalization? Or is it weak due to th e small sample size? IS it weak because the population is limited in scope? Any of those reasons wou ld keep the financial liability limited as well According to the subcommit tee's methodo logy (Appendix A), a weak recommendation indicates that \" The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource allocation, values and preferences and other factors, but further research or additional information could lead to a different conclusion.\" The factors leading to the recommendation are described in the GRADE table. D3 CPT is as cost effective as the shaker vest with similar results an d can be done by paid or unpaid caregivers for 20 -40 minutes per day multiple times a day - try to d o that for even 10 minutes on a girl with a T2 -Pelvis titanium rod in her back and see how effective that is! It i s exhau sting and the CPT provider is in constant fear of injuring the patient. We did not identify any cost -effectiveness studies that met our inclusion criteria and also addressed the scope of this coverage guidance with information that is relevant to the US health system. See response to co mment D1 regarding individual patient circumstances. HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 6/4/2021 to 7/6/2021 Page 15 ID/# Comment Disposition There is not enough evidence because the sample size is too small - but it always will be due to the population making it too small to fall under normal distribution confidence intervals - chicken and egg. Evidence is often insufficient, especially for rare conditions , which is why the subcommittee considers public comments and expert testimony , among other factors . D4 Evidence showing cost effectiveness has been presented as reduction or avoidance of hospital visits - this committee has disregarded such evidence because it was produced from the manufacturer. Has any analysis been done on any of the population covered by the CIIS waiver? This is the target population that would benefit from this device (even after they turn 18), allowing them to be treated in their home, saving the state money. You could extrapolate what 6 hospitalizations in one year cost the Oregon Healt h Plan even as secondary provider to determin e the cost effectiveness of the shaker vest. I am not including the multiple times that we provide d acute care at home during the same time period although there are many. While it would be a sound decision to e xpand the coverage guidance to people who meet the \"medically involve d\" definition, it would also be financially prudent to cover the shaker vest if the initial expenditur e of approximately $16k is less than the cost of even one nights hospitalization whic h is what th e unintended consequence of the current guidance has been. Thank you for your consideration. The subcommittee bases decisions regarding effectiveness on peer -reviewed evidence. The Subcommittee does not disregard evidence produced from the manufacturer merely because it was produced by the manufacturer. Registry information from the manufacturers was excluded from the coverage guidance because the way that the information was gathered (a before -after study design) cannot account for competing hypotheses for why individuals using HFCWO device therapy improved or stabilized in terms of symptoms or health care utilization.

The revised coverage guidance recommendation includes a recommendation for coverage of high -frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) devic es for patients for whom chest physiotherapy and positive expiratory pressure device therapy are not tolerated, contraindicated, or not available (e.g., inability of a caregiver to perform). A3 Some bronchiectasis patients do not have a cough and thus the coverage guidance should remove the daily productive cough as a requirement for HFCWO device therapy The inclusion of daily productive cough was added as a requirement for HFCWO therapy for patients with non -cystic fibrosis (non -CF) bronchiectasis based on information extrapolated from studies of the cystic fibrosis (CF) population, and as recommended by our appointed ad hoc expert. For EbGS discussion. C3-C4 This coverage guidance should include a list of covered conditions and include Rett Syndrome in that list. This subcommittee declined to produce a list of covered conditions given the heterogeneity of neuromuscular disorders for whom HFCWO therapy may be effective. Instead, detailed coverage indications ensure that a patient with a very rare disorder may still be eligible for HFCWO therapy provided they meet the criteria.

My child has non -CF-bronchiectasis. It took me years to pay his off and it was a significant struggle for my family. Thank you for your comments. We have written specific responses to individual sections of your letter in the rows that follow. A2 He also is Autistic and blowing in the little devices was not feasible. He was too young and not able to use them effectively. Once he started using the vest he improved so incredibly much. The revised draft coverage guidance includes a pathway to cover age for HFCWO device therapy if other treatments are not tolerated, available or contraindicated. A3 Also, I don't like the cough requirement. My son never coughed. He just had a ton of mucus and couldn't/would not expel it on his own, so he would get in fections constantly. Based on expert testimony, HFCWO device therapy is most effective among patients with non -CF bronchiectasis who have a daily productive cough. A4 By expanding the coverage of devices It will also make it easier to get them serviced and sized. Thank you for your comment. B1 I agree with coverage as the use of High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices has shown to be very effective and reduces hospitalization when used correctly and consistently which ultimately l eads to better patient care and reduced overall cost. Thank you for your comment. HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 9/24/2021 to 10/18/20 21 Page 3 ID/# Comment Disposition C1 I am just a mom and Rett rep who has personally seen ICU's fill every winter with Rett patients in respiratory distress. When determining criteria for when a HFCWO device should be covered, there are a few observations I've made specific to Rett Syndrome - that is the presence of both scoliosis and hypotonia, often including the use of a wheelchair. Rett patients cannot speak and have no functional hand use to indicate difficulty breathing. Most are at risk of constant aspiration as well. The \"cycle\" is this: a Rett patient aspirates or is exposed to a virus, develops pneumonia, end up in the emergency room at their O2 sats drop and they will be hospitalized. Respiratory therapy is ordered and the HFCWO device is used, often in conjunction with a cough - assist device. Thank you for your comments. We have written specific responses to individual sections of your letter in the rows that follow. C2 If scoliosis is present, the kiddo will get well enough to recover at home but a dimness or small amount of infection tends to remain in the lower lobe of one or both lungs. Kiddos with low -tone, scoliosis and a wheelchair can never really expand their chest cavity so the HFCWO provides an effective home therapy that can be done safely and in the home to provide lung clearance. It is not typically prescribed before hospitalization but the pulmonologist will often send the device home as part of routine care following an em ergency room visit or hospitalization. This level of clinical specificity is not included in the studies identified for this review. C3 I would suggest Rett Syndrome or similarly complex syndromes be added to the list defined on page 18 in the background section. The subcommittee elected to produce detailed coverage criteria instead of producing a list of covered conditions in order that persons with very rare disorders can obtain access to HFCWO therapy provided they meet the criteria. C4 I also suggest that this group look at other states' recommendations for coverage in neuromuscular conditions for more definitive criteria. Our policy is to report coverage for Medicare, Washington 's Medicaid program, and selected payers active in Oregon (e.g., Aetna, BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon, Cigna, and Moda). HERC Coverage Guidance: High -Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation Devices Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Comments received 9/24/2021 to 10/18/20 21 Page 4 ID/# Comment Disposition C5 I also think there should be a return on investment study performed on the neuromuscular population that evaluates the cost of the device versus the expense of a single night in an ICU and I k now you will find it is comparatively cheap insurance for this specific population. We searched for comparative cost effectiveness studies for this coverage guidance and did not identify any that met our inclusion criteria. The subcommittee relies on exist ing, peer -reviewed published research to make coverage recommendations. It is outside of this group's scope to independently conduct economic studies. C6 I also think th4ere's typo on page 24 where it should read CONGENITAL muscular dystrophy under pulmonary complications. Thank you for drawing our attention to this typographical error. We have corrected this in the current draft. C7 I also wonder if the lungs themselves are considered part of the airway since the wording of the recommendation speci fically says \"chronic airway infection\" - and what defines chronic? My daughter was hospitalized 6 times in one year with pneumonia but we have been able to avoid hospitalization multiple times since then. The subcommittee decided against defining \"chronic ,\" leaving ability for the exercise of clinical judgment. C8 The word CONTRAINDICATED is included in the neuromuscular bronchiecstatis guidance but not the CF guidance. I wonder why they are different. We agree and we have updated the wording in both sections. C9 The inability of the caregiver to provide chest physiotherapy is an important factor and I am glad to see it included in the criteria for recommendation Thank you for your comments. Section 6.0 New Discussion Items Platelet Rich Plasma 1 Plain Language Summary: Background: Platelet -rich plasma is used to treat connective tissue injuries, ulcers and wounds. It i s blood that contains more platelets than normal blood . Platelets are cell fragments that help blood clot. Research shows a high level of bias and uncertain benefit , and other insurers list this treatment as experimental. Should OHP cover this treatment? Staff recommends OHP not cover this treatment. Service is costly and evidence doesn't show a clear benefit. Question : Is platelet rich plasma covered for any indication on the Prioritized List? Question source: Holly Jo Hodges, CCO medical director Issue: Platelet -rich plasma (PRP) therapy uses injections of a concentration of a patient's own platelets to accelerate the healing of injured tendons, ligaments, muscles and joints. The mechanism of action of PRP is unclear. Platelet ri ch plasma for treatment of knee osteoarthritis was reviewed as part of a coverage guidance , which excluded PRP for this indication; this was added into a guideline. PRP for treatment of spinal conditions was added to Guideline Note 37 at the October 2021 m eeting. PRP for treatment of ulcers and wounds was discussed in May 2021 but left on line 662/GN 173. CCOs would like further direction on coverage, as they get frequent requests for coverage of PRP for a wide variety of indications. Currently, the only code for general PRP is a level III CPT code, 0232T INJECTION(S), PLATELET RICH PLASMA, ANY SITE, INCL. These types of codes are generally considered experimental by Medicaid and not placed on the Prioritized List. PRP can be used to treat a wide variety of tendinopathies, tendon tears, joint inflammation, plantar fasciitis, osteoarthritis, low back pain, and other musculoskeletal conditions. Current Prioritized List status GUIDELINE NOTE 37, SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE OTHER THAN SCOLIOSIS Lines 346, 529 Spine surgery is included on Line 346 only in the following circumstances: A) Decompressive surgery is included on Line 346 to treat debilitating symptoms due to central or foraminal spinal stenosis, and only when the patient meets the following criteria: 1) Has MRI evidence of moderate or severe central or foraminal spinal stenosis AND 2) Has neurogenic claudication OR 3) Has objective neurologic impairment consistent with the MRI findings. Neurologic impairment is defined as objective evidence of one or more of the following: a) Markedly abnormal reflexes b) Segmental muscle weakness c) Segmental sensory loss d) EMG or NCV evidence of nerve root impingement e) Cauda equina syndrome Platelet Rich Plasma 2 f) Neurogenic bowel or bladder g) Long tract abnormalities Fora minal or central spinal stenosis causing only radiating pain (e.g. radiculopathic pain) is included only on Line 529. B) Spinal fusion procedures are included on Line 346 for patients with MRI evidence of moderate or severe central spinal stenosis only when one of the following conditions are met: 1) spinal stenosis in the cervical spine (with or without spondylolisthesis) which results in objective neurologic impairment as defined above OR 2) spinal stenosis in the thoracic or lumbar spine caused by spondylolisthe sis resulting in signs and symptoms of neurogenic claudication and which correlate with xray flexion/extension films showing at least a 5 mm translation OR 3) pre-existing or expected post -surgical spinal instability (e.g. degenerative scoliosis >10 deg, >50% of facet joints per level expected to be resected) For all other indications, spine surgery is included on Line 529. The following interventions are not included on these lines due to lack of evidence of effectiveness for the treatment of conditions on these lines, including cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral conditions: local injections (including ozone therapy injections) botulinum toxin injection intradiscal electrothermal therapy cervical pain intradiscal injections, including platelet rich plasma, stem cells, methylen e blue, or ozone Corticosteroid injections for low back pain with or without radiculopathy are only included on Line 529. Diagnostic anesthetic injections for selective nerve root blocks are included on Line 529 for lumbar or sacral symptoms.

N=132 articles i. 28 different conditions across eight medical fields. Studies investigating PRP treatment for musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions comprised 74% of all studies. Tendinop athy (n = 29) and osteoarthritis (n = 28) were the two most commonly studied conditions. MSK studies were 76% level 1 evidence while 57% of all other studies were level 1 evidence (p <0.05). Cosmetic studies comprised 14% (n = 19) of all studies, and 53% of these were level I evidence. ii. Majority of studies were assessed using the Cochranes Risk of Bias Tool, 80% (n = 106). Among these studies, 30% (n = 32) were assessed to be \"Low\" risk of bias, 25% (n = 26) were found to have \"Some Concerns\", and 45% (n = 48) were assessed to be \"High\" risk of bias b. Overall, 61% of the studies found PRP to be favorable over control treatment, with no difference in favorable reporting between MSK and other medical specialties. c. Conclusions: In summary, the vast majority of lev el I and II clinical studies investigating PRP have been conducted for MSK injuries, with only a handful of studies conducted for conditions in other medical specialties. Studies that reported details on PRP processing and composition were in the minority, and PROMs were not often used as an outcome measure in non -MSK studies. Rigorous reporting in human clinical studies across all medical specialties is crucial for evaluating the effects of PRP and moving towards disease -specific and individualized treatme nt. 2) Gato -Calvo 2019 , evidence review of platelet rich plasma for treatment of osteoarthritis a. N=5 systematic reviews and meta -analyses i. A total of 19 individual trials were identified in the five reviews but only 9 were level of evidence I RCTs, and many had moderate or high risks of bias. b. At present, results from these RCTs seem to favor PRP use over other intraarticular treatments to im prove pain scales in the short and medium term (6 -12months), but the overall level of evidence is low. As a result, clinical effectiveness of PRP for knee osteoarthritis treatment is still under debate. This is, prominently, the result of a lack of standar dization of PRP products, scarceness of high quality RCTs not showing high risks of bias, and poor patient stratification for inclusion in the RCTs. 3) Chen 2018 , systematic review and meta -analysis of platelet rich plasma on tendon and ligament healing a. N=21 studies (1031 patients) i. The majority of studies published investigated rotator cuff (38.1%) or lateral epicondylitis (38.1%). ii. Other patellar (PT), achilles (ACL), and h amstring tendinopathy (HT). b. 17 studies (844 participants) reported short -term VAS data and 14 studies (771 participants) reported long -term VAS data. Overall, long -term follow -up results showed significantly less pain in the PRP group compared to control ( WMD: 0.84; 95% CI: both pain in the long -term. Subs tantial heterogeneity was reported at baseline (I2: 72.0%, p<0.01), short term follow -up (I2: 75.8%, p<0.01). The funnel plot Platelet Rich Plasma 5 appeared to be asymmetric, with some missingness at the lower right portion of the plot suggesting possible publication bias. c. No study reported severe adverse events (SAEs). d. Conclusion: This review shows that PRP may reduce the pain associated with lateral epicondylitis and rotator cuff pathology. 4) Hussain 2017 , evidence based evaluation of platelet rich plasma in orthopedics a. Reviewed conditions: i. Knee osteoarthritis, rotator cuff repair, epicondylitis, patellar tendinopathy, Achilles tendinopathy, hamstring injuries and anterior cruciate ligament repair b. the evide nce appears to suggest that PRP may provide some benefit in patients who present with knee osteoarthritis or lateral epicondylitis. On the other hand, evidence appears to be inconsistent or shows a minimal benefit for PRP usage in rotator cuff repair, pate llar and Achilles tendinopathies, hamstring injuries, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair, and medial epicondylitis. There is limited confidence in the conclusions from the published meta -analyses due to issues with statistical pooling, and limited sub group analyses exploring the substantial heterogeneity across studies. Evidence -based clinicians considering the use of PRP in their patients with musculoskeletal injuries should be wary that the literature appears to be inconsistent and thus far, inconclu sive. Other payer policies 1) CMS LCD 2021 : This is a NON -coverage policy for all platelet -rich plasma (PRP) injections and/or applications as a means of managing musculoskeletal injuries and/or joint conditions a. While promising, we believe that there is insufficient high -quality evidence to justify the use of PRP for the treatment of any condition except for within the confines of a well - designed clinical trial. 2) All private payers surveyed considered PRP to be experimental . Platelet Rich Plasma 6 HERC staff summary General review of the effectiveness of platelet rich plasma for a wide variety of conditions finds that the literature is highly biased and inconclusive. CMS and all private payers consider PRP experimental, and Medicaid considers CPT level III codes, such as 0232T, to be experimental . HERC staff recommend placing CPT 0232T on line 662/GN173, with individual indications reviewed in the future as evidence matures. HERC staff recommendation 1) Add CPT 0232T to line 662/GN173 as shown below GUIDELINE NOTE 173, INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE UNPROVEN, HAVE NO CLINICALLY IMPORTANT BENEFI T OR HAVE HARMS THAT OUTWEIGH BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS Line 662 The following Interventions are prioritized on Line 662 CONDITIONS FOR WHICH CERTAIN INTERVENTIONS ARE UNPROVEN, HAVE NO CLINICALLY IMPORTANT BENEFIT OR HAVE HARMS THAT OUTWEIGH BENEFIT S: Procedure Code Intervention Description Rationale Last Review 0232T Injection(s), platelet rich plasma, any site, including image guidance, harvesting and preparation when performed Insufficient evidence of effectiveness March 2022 permissions Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease journals.sagepub.com/home/taj 1 Creative Commons Non Commercial CC BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).Introduction Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small cytoplasmic fragments derived from bone marrow megakaryocytes. Most platelet functions are directly connected with platelet activation, a process that occurs naturally after an injury in the wall of a blood vessel. Platelets are then exposed to collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins that stimulate their activation, resulting in the release of the con-tent of their cytoplasmic granules. 1 Overall, platelets contain over 800 proteins and molecules, compris-ing cytokines, chemokines, membrane proteins, metabolites, messenger molecules, growth factors (GFs) and numerous soluble proteins. 2 As a result, besides their role in coagulation and hemostasis, platelets are also involved in vasoconstriction, inflammation, immune response, angiogenesis and tissue regeneration and consequently, they partici-pate in numerous physiologic signaling mechanisms and are related to multiple pathologies. 3-5 The therapeutic use of platelet concentrates was first described by Whitman in 1997, 6 although blood-derived fibrin glues were already used 30 years earlier to seal wounds and stimulate their healing. 7 In 1998, platelet concentrates started to be known as platelet-rich plasma (PRP), generally defined as a volume of autologous plasma con-taining a higher platelet count than peripheral blood (150,000-350,000 platelets/ l). 8 Thereafter Platelet-rich plasma in osteoarthritis treatment: of current evidence Luc\u00eda Gato-Calvo, Joana Magalhaes, F. Burguera Abstract: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is defined as a volume of plasma with a platelet concentration higher than the average in peripheral blood. Many basic, preclinical and even clinical case studies and trials report PRP's ability to improve musculoskeletal conditions including osteoarthritis, but paradoxically, just as many conclude it has no effect. The purpose of this narrative review is to discuss the available relevant evidence that supports the clinical use of PRP in osteoarthritis, highlighting those variables we perceive as critical. Here, recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used to identify the latest randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing a PRP product as an intra-articular treatment for knee osteoarthritis, compared with an intra-articular control (mostly hyaluronic acid). Conclusions in the identified RCTs are examined and compared. In total, five recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews were found meeting the above criteria. A total of 19 individual trials were identified in the five reviews but only 9 were level of evidence I RCTs, and many had moderate or high risks of bias. At present, results from these RCTs seem to favor PRP use over other intra- articular treatments to improve pain scales in the short and medium term (6-12 months), but the overall level of evidence is low. As a result, clinical effectiveness of PRP for knee osteoarthritis treatment is still under debate. This is, prominently, the result of a lack of standardization of PRP products, scarceness of high quality RCTs not showing high risks of bias, and poor patient stratification for inclusion in the RCTs.

A number of meta-analysis have been published, but few studies have focused exclusively on tendon and ligament pathology. Purpose: To perform a meta-analysis assessing the ability of PRP to reduce pain in patients with tendon and ligament injuries. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Methods: This study followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items and Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out in April 2017 using electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library. Only Level I studies were included. Platelet and leukocyte count, injection volume, kit used, participant age/ gender, comparator, and activating agent used were recorded. The short-term and long-term efficacy of PRP was assessed using the visual analog scale (V AS), which measures pain intensity. Pathology subgroups (rotator cuff, tendinopathy, ACL, and lateral epicondylitis) were evaluated. Funnel plots and Egger's test were used to screen for publication bias and sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of potential outliers by removing studies one at a time. Results: Thirty-seven articles were included in this review, 21 (1031 participants) of which could be included in the quantitative analysis. The majority of studies published investigated rotator cuff (38.1%) or lateral epicondylitis (38.1%). 17 studies (844 participants) reported short-term V AS data and 14 studies (771 participants) reported long-term V AS data. Overall, long-term follow-up results showed significantly less pain in the PRP group compared to control (WMD: 0.84; 95% CI: 1.23, less pain in the long-term. Substantial heterogeneity was reported at baseline (I2: 72.0%, p<0.01). plot appeared to be asymmetric, with some missingness at the lower right portion of the plot suggesting possible publication bias. Conclusion: This review shows that PRP may reduce the pain associated with lateral epicondylitis and rotator cuff pathology. HHS Public Access Author manuscript Am J Sports Med .

Several studies nd that injecting PRP to the site of injury does not provide any signicant benet with respect to clinical outcomes; however, many others report thecontrary. Due to the conflicting evidence and multiple meta-analyses conducted on the topic, a literature review of high-quality evidence on the use of PRP for common orthopaedic conditions was performed. Thus far, the evidence appears to suggest that PRP may provide some benet in patients who present with knee osteoarthritis or lateralepicondylitis. On the other hand, evidence appears to be inconsistent or shows a minimal benet for PRP usage inrotator cuff repair, patellar and Achilles tendinopathies, hamstring injuries, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair, and medial epicondylitis. There is limited condence in the conclusions from the published meta-analyses due to issues with statistical pooling, and limited subgroup analyses exploring the substantial heterogeneity across studies.Evidence-based clinicians considering the use of PRP in their patients with musculoskeletal injuries should be weary that the literature appears to be inconsistent and thus far, inconclusive. Key words: Platelet rich plasma, Orthobiologics, Evidence-based medicine, Review. Platelet-rich plasma in orthopedics Within orthopedics, the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been increasing in popularity. United States estimates alonesuggest that approximately 86,000 athletes are treated withPRP annually [ 1]. Even though its popularity is rising, its true effectiveness has yet to be fully established. Several studiesnd that injecting PRP to the site of injury does not add anysignicant benet to clinical outcomes; however, many othersreport the contrary. This becomes even more of a concern since the cost of treatment can be relatively high. Peerbooms et al. (2010) reported that the cost for a single PRP injection isapproximately $840.00 USD whereas a simple corticosteroidinjection is around $300.00 USD [ 2]. With the conflicting evidence and high cost of PRP treatment, it is imperative thata more denitive answer regarding its efcacy is found. Giventhe continued uncertainty of PRP with regard to its efcacy atimproving various clinical outcomes in a broad spectrum oforthopedic conditions, we undertook this review to help clini-cians better understand the basics behind PRP and the clinicalevidence surrounding it.What is platelet-rich plasma? The platelets contained within autologous blood play an important role in healing since they secrete several growthfactors to the site of injury [ 3]. Briefly, among other roles, these platelets serve to promote mitogenesis of healing capablecells and angiogenesis in the tissue [ 4]. Autologous blood, which contains such platelets in higher than normal concentra-tions, is commonly referred to as platelet-rich plasma (PRP). For instance, the normal platelet count in healthy individuals is around 1.5-4.5 \u00b710 5/lL; however, to be considered PRP , the platelet should be 4-5 times above this amount [ 5]. This relatively recent biotechnology has been reported to enhancethe healing process since an increased number of plateletsresults in an increased number of secreted growth factors,thereby theoretically improving the healing process [ 4,6]. Some of the growth factors in PRP include: platelet-derivedgrowth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta(TGF-b), vascular endothelial factor (VEGF), and epithelial growth factor (EGF) [ 1,3,6]. Thus, unlike recombi- nant technology which is synthetic, PRP takes advantage of the naturally occurring proteins in the healing process. In addi-tion to these factors, PRP contains adhesion molecules nasir.hussain@cmich.edu 10.1051/sicotj/2017036 Available online at: www.sicot-j.org This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 ), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.OPENACCESS REVIEW ARTICLESpecial Issue :''Orthobiologics: role of platelet-rich plasma in orthopaedic clinical practice '' Guest Editor: Vijay D. ShettyBreast Reconstruction After Lumpectomy 1 Plain Language Summary: Background: If a patient wants breast reconstruction on one or both breasts after surgery to remove a breast due to cancer, a federal law requires that insurance pay for it. Currently, if the breast is only partially removed (lumpectomy), it is unclear whether OHP an d federal law require reconstruction of one or both breasts. Lumpectomies can range from removing a small lump to a large portion of the breast. If reconstruction after lumpectomy is not covered, some patients may choose to have their breast removed comple tely. Should OHP cover breast reconstruction after cancer is removed from one breast ? Staff recommends clarifying that OHP does cover reconstruction after lumpectomy because coverage of this procedure is currently unclear and to avoid unintentional incenti ves for unnecessary complete mastectomy . Question : Is breast reconstruction after lumpectomy a covered service on the Prioritized List? Question source : Kristin Garrett, CCO medical director Issue : The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act requires insur ance to cover breast reconstruction including surgery on the contralateral breast after \"mastectomy.\" Currently, GN79 BREAST RECONSTRUCTION states that \"breast reconstruction is only covered after mastectomy .\" Dr. Garrett is requesting clarification of coverage of reconstruction after lumpectomy for breast cancer. Lumpectomy is a surgery where only a portion of the breast is removed, and it is becoming increasingly common for certain sta ges of breast cancer. Lumpectomy generally has fewer risks than mastectomy, and requires fewer follow up procedures. The CPT codes used for lumpectomy list the procedure as \"mastectomy, partial.\" In some cases, lumpectomy removes only a small portion of breast tissue and no re construction is desired. In other cases, lumpectomy can remove a considerable portion of breast tissue, leaving significant disproportion between breasts. M ost private insurance payers will cover breast reconstruction or contralateral breast reduction o r similar surgeries after lumpectomy . There is concern that limited coverage for reconstruction to only after mastectomy might incentivize patients on OHP to opt for mastectomy when a lumpectomy would be a reasonable treatment approach. Mastectomy is a much more morbid procedure, and generally the reconstruction afterwards involves multiple steps and p rocedures. From CMS https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs -and-Initiatives/Other -Insurance -Protections/whcra_factsheet (accessed October 19, 2021) The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA) is a federal law that provides protections to patients who choose to have breast reconstruction in connection with a mastectomy. If WHCRA applies to you and you are receiving benefits in connection with a mastectomy and you elect breast reconstruction, coverage must be provided for: All stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed; Breast Reconstruction After Lumpectomy 2 Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance; and Prostheses and treatment of physical complications of all stages of the mastectomy, including lymphedema. This law applies to two different types of coverage: 1. Group health plans (provided by an employer or union); 2. Individual health insurance policies (not based on employment). Current Prioritized List status CPT 19301 -19302 (Mastectomy, partial (eg, lumpectomy, tylectomy, quadrantectomy, segmentectomy) are on line 191 CANCER OF BREAST; AT HIGH RISK OF BREAST CANCER GUIDELINE NOTE 79, BREAST RECONSTRUCTION Line 191 Breast reconstruction is only covered after mastectomy as a t reatment for breast cancer or as prophylactic treatment for the prevention of breast cancer in a woman who qualifies under Guideline Note 3, and must be completed within 5 years of initial mastectomy. Breast reconstruction may include contralateral be covered when contralateral reduction mammaplasty is inappropriate for breast reconstruction and mastopexy will accomplish the desired reconstruc tion result. Breast Reconstruction After Lumpectomy 3 Expert guidelines 1) NCCN Breast Cancer treatment guideline, version 8.2021 a. After lumpectomy , prior to radiation therapy i. No reconstruction required if ratio of tumor to breast volume is small and minimal cosmetic deformity with result, OR ii. Cons ider oncoplastic reduction or mastopexy and simultaneous or delayed contralateral matching procedure, OR iii. Consider bilateral breast reduction if symptoms warrant, or iv. Local tissue rearrangement, regional flap b. After lumpectomy and radiation therapy i. Delayed fat grafting ii. Delayed flap for correction of contour defects iii. Contralateral reduction/mastopexy for symmetry Other payer policies 1) Aetna 2021 Aetna considers reconstructive breast surgery medically necessary after a medically necessary mastectomy o r a medically necessary lumpectomy that results in a significant deformity (i.e., mastectomy or lumpectomy for treatment of or prophylaxis for breast cancer and mastectomy or lumpectomy performed for chronic, severe fibrocystic breast disease, also known a s cystic mastitis, unresponsive to medical therapy). 2) Cigna 2021 Breast reconstruction following mastectomy or lumpectomy is considered medically necessary for EITHER of the following: breast reconstruction procedures performed on the diseased/affected breast (i.e., breast on which the mastectomy/lumpectomy was performed), breast reconstruction procedures performed on the nondiseased/unaffected/contralateral breast, in order to produce a symmetrical appearance 3) Anthem BCBS 2021 The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA) mandated that reconstructive breast surgery for women and men who have undergone mastectomy be covered by their benefits for those who have opted to have breast reconstruction. In individuals who have undergone a medically necess ary lumpectomy, surgery to create a more normal anatomy is considered reconstructive. 4) MODA 2020 Reconstructive breast surgery is performed following a mastectomy, lumpectomy or prophylactic mastectomy for high -risk patients to re -establish symmetry between the two breasts. Breast Reconstruction After Lumpectomy 4 Expert input Danielle Bertoni and John Vetto, breast surgeons: both felt that reconstruction after lumpectomy was standard of care. HERC staff summary Due to concern that WHCRA requires coverage for reconstruction after partial mastectomy (lumpectomy) and a desire to not create an incentive to elect a mastectomy when a lumpectomy is sufficient treatment, HERC staff recommend revisin g GN79 to clarify that breast reconstruction after lumpectomy is a covered service. HERC staff recommendation: 1) Modify Guideline Note 79 as shown below GUIDELINE NOTE 79, BREAST RECONSTRUCTION Line 191 Breast reconstruction is only covered after mastectomy , or lumpectomy tha t results in a significant deformity or asymmetry, as a treatment for breast cancer or as prophylactic treatment for the prevention of breast cancer in a woman who qualifies under Guideline Note 3, and must be completed within 5 years of initial mastectomy or lumpectomy . Breast reconstruction may include be covered when contralateral reduction mammaplasty is inappropriate for breast reconstruction and mastopexy will accomplish the desired reconstruc tion result. Breast MRI Guidelines 1 Question : How best can the coverage of breast MRI be clarified on the Prioritized List ? Question source : Several CCO medical directors Issue : There are currently 3 guidelines that relate to breast MRI on the Prioritized List, and the CCO medical directors frequently have questions about how they relate to one another. They have previously requested clarification of these guidelines, but even t hose clarifications are not sufficient for the CCO PA process. There have also been questions from CCOs and providers about the lack of Prioritized List coverage for MRI after breast cancer diagnosis, which has generally become standard of care. From Ma x Kaiser, CCO medical director The main impetus are cases where members meet [criteria] for breast MRI screening, but haven't had the screening, and are now diagnosed with a new breast cancer. As the member met for screening, the surgeon uses that as reaso ning to request screening of the uninvolved breast so they could treat any identified breast cancer at the same time and image the involved breast for other occult lesions. That scenario may warrant clarification with the NCCN caveat that false -positives a re common and should be confirmed with tissue sampling. We had also talked about aligning D6 and D6[26] to indicated when after the member's original treatment an MRI is covered for future screening. Currently it's covered annually. Does this mean 1 year a fter treatment or would it also be covered, as with the mammogram, 6 months after radiotherapy if treated with breast conserving therapy? I also get fairly regular requests for a breast MRI in a newly diagnosed member that I approve by exception as they al ign with NCCN, such as poorly defined disease on mammogram/ultrasound or multifocal/multicentric Current Prioritized List status: DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE D6, BREAST CANCER SCREENING IN ABOVE -AVERAGE RISK WOMEN Annual screening mammography and annual screen ing MRI are covered only for women at above - average risk of breast cancer. This coverage, beginning at 30 years of age, includes women who have one or more of the following: Greater than 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, or w ho have not been tested for BRCA but have a first -degree relative who is a BRCA carrier A personal history or a first -degree relative diagnosed with Bannayan -Riley -Ruvalcaba syndrome, Cowden syndrome, or Li -Fraumeni syndrome Other germline gene mutations k nown to confer a greater than 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer For women with a history of high dose chest radiation ( 20 Gray) before the age of 30, annual screening MRI and annual screening mammography are covered beginning 8 years after radiation exposure or at age 25, whichever is later. For women with both a personal history and a family history of breast cancer which give a greater than 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer, annual mammography, annual breast MRI and annual breast ultrasound are co vered. For women with increased breast density, supplemental screening with breast ultrasound, MRI, or digital breast tomosynthesis is not covered. Breast MRI Guidelines 2 Breast PET -CT scanning and breast -specific gamma imaging are not covered for breast cancer screening. For surveillance for a treated breast cancer, see Guideline Note 26 BREAST CANCER SURVEILLANCE. The development of this guideline note was informed by a HERC coverage guidance . See https://www.oregon .gov/oha/HPA/DSI -HERC/Pages/Evidence -based -Reports.aspx DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE D9, MRI FOR BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS In women with recently diagnosed breast cancer, preoperative or contralateral MRI of the breast is not a covered service. GUIDELINE NOTE 26 , BREAST CANCER SURVEILLANCE Line 191 History and physical exam is indicated every 3 to 6 months for the first three years after primary therapy, then every 6 -12 months for the next 2 years, then annually thereafter. Mammography is indicated annually, and patients treated with breast -conserving therapy, initial mammogram of the affected breast should be 6 months after completion of radiotherapy. No other surveillance testing is indicated. For ongoing screening for a new breast cancer, see Guideline Note 2006 BREAST CANCER SCREENING IN ABOVE -AVERAGE RISK WOMEN. Expert guidelines 1) NCCN Breast Cancer treatment guideline, version 2.2022 a. Clinical indications and applications for breast MRI i. May be used for staging evaluation to define extent of cancer or presence of multifocal or multicentric c ance r in the ipsilateral breast, or as screening of the contralateral breast cancer at time of initial diagnosis (category 2B). there are no high -level data to demonstrate that the use of MRI to facilitate local therapy decision -making improves local recurrence or survival ii. May be helpful for breast cancer evaluation before and after preoperative systemic therapy to define extent of disease, response to treatment, and potential for breast -conserving therapy iii. May be useful in identifying otherwise clinically occult disease in patients presenting with axillary nodal metastases (cT0, CN+), with Paget disease, or with invasive lobular carcinoma poorly (or inadequately) defined on mammography, ultrasound or physical examination iv. False -positive find ings on breast MRI are common. Surgical decisions should not be based solely on the MRI findings. Additional tissue sampling of areas of concern identified by breast MRI is recommended v. The utility of MRI in follow -up scree ning of patients with prior brea st cancer is undefined. It should generally be considered only in those whose lifetime risk of a second primary breast cancer is >20% based on models largely dependent on Breast MRI Guidelines 3 family history, such as those with the risk associat ed with inherited susceptibility to breast cancer. b. Specific clinical situations: i. DCIS: breast MRI has not been shown to increase likelihood of negative margins or decrease conversion to mastectomy. Data to support improved long -term outcomes is lacking ii. Non-metastatic (M0) invasive breast cancer and higher stage invasive breast cancer : breast MRI is optional, may be useful for characterizing axillary and/or internal mammary nodal disease . MRI findings tend to overestimate extent of disease resulting incre ase in frequency of mastectomies. Two prospective randomized studies have examined the utility of pre -operative MRI in determining disease extent, and neither demonstrated improvement in rates of post -lumpectomy re -excision. One systematic review found MR I staging altered surgical treatment in 7.8 -33.3% of women; however, no differences in local recurrent or survival has been demonstrated. 2) NCCN Breast Cancer screening and diagnosis , version 1.2021 a. Recommend annual MRI screening: i. For individuals with a gen etic mutation, or a first -degree relative of gene mutation carrier ii. For individuals who received thoracic radiation therapy between the ages of 10 and 30 years 1. Begin 8 years after radiation therapy but not prior to age 25 years iii. For individuals with a lifeti me risk of 20% as defined by models that are largely dependent on family history 1. To begin 10 years prior to when the youngest family member was diagnosed with breast cancer, not prior to age 25 years or age 40 years (whichever comes first) 3) American Socie ty of Breast Surgeons 2017 : consensus guideline on diagnostic and screening MRI of the breast a. The ASBrS does not recommend routine diagnostic MRI in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients except as part of a scientific study. b. The ASBrS supports the use of MRI in the following situations: i. To search for occult breast cancer in patients with Paget's disease of the nipple or in patients with axillary node metastasis when clinical examination and conventional breast imaging fail to detect a primary breast cance r. MRI identifies an ipsilateral cancer focus in 60 -70% of patients who present with axillary nodal metastases and no cancer identified on clinical examination, mammography, or ultrasound. ii. For determining the extent of cancer or presence of multi -focal or multi -centric tumor or the presence of contralateral cancer, in patients with a proven breast cancer and associated clinical or conventional indeterminate imaging findings suspicious for malignancy. This may include patients with invasive lobular carcinoma or extremely dense breast tissue (limiting mammographic sensitivity), or when there are significant discrepancies in the estimated tumor size as measured on clinical exam, mammogram, and ultrasound. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criter ia and a recent meta -analysis by Houssami et al conclude there are no proven criteria for any patient sub -Breast MRI Guidelines 4 population that benefits the most from routine MRI based on specific patient, tumor, or mammographic characteristics. iii. To aid the assessment for eligib ility and response to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy or chemotherapy before, during, or after treatment. MRI can help identify those patients who are candidates for breast conservation, and assist in determining the extent of resection40,41. After neoadjuva nt chemotherapy (NAC), MRI has a sensitivity of 92% to detect residual disease and a specificity of 60% for pathologic complete response (pCR), based on a meta -analysis of studies including 2050 patients reported by Marinovich et al in 2013. Compared to ma mmography, MRI was better in assessing response to NAC, but a negative MRI did not always exclude residual microscopic disease. In two updated metaanalyses (2016 and 2017) assessing pCR, Gu et al and Sheikhbahaei et al reported pooled sensitivities and spe cificities of 64%/88% and 92%/55% respectively. MRI is not mandatory in patients undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy. iv. For the further evaluation of suspicious clinical or imaging findings that remain indeterminate after complete mammographic and sonographic evaluations. If lesions meet the criteria for biopsy by clinical examination or conventional imaging, then it may be preferable to perform minimally invasive needle biopsy, targeted by mammogram or US, rather than obtain an MRI. v. For evaluation of suspected breast implant rupture, especially in patients with silicone implants, if the MRI findings will aid the decision -making for implant removal or aid the diagnostic evaluation of indeterminate clinical or conventional imaging findings in patients with implants. The MRI protocol for detection of silicone leak is different from the protocol for detection of breast cancer. Thus, it is important to clearly define the purpose of the breast MRI if the concern is a silicone leak. Expert input : Steve Kornfeld, breast surgeon: Dr. Kornfeld recommended against including coverage for first degree relatives of mutation carriers, as confirmation testing is readily available and inexpensive. The relative has a 50% chance of having the mutation. If she does not carry it, then she is normal risk and should be screened with mammograms. Dr. Kornfeld also felt that preoperative breast MRI is standard of care for women, specifically if breast conservation (lumpectomy) is being considered over mastectomy. The rationale is to look for mul tifocal tumors. This is listed in NCCN as an option (2B recommendation). Danielle Bertoni, breast surgeon: I think there is one major group missing which is patients who have a genetic mutation or are at high risk for genetic mutation and are planning br east conservation. If we have a patient who is newly diagnosed with breast cancer and meets criteria for genetic testing or has extensive family history of breast cancer and is planning breast conservation, then we may need to follow them for screening goi ng forward with breast MRI. If this is the case, then we would want the breast MRI prior to going to surgery for their cancer treatment. We would not want to wait until they are due for MRI screening in 6 months and then find a new lesion in the same or contralateral breast that we could have and should have addressed at diagnosis. This is more of Breast MRI Guidelines 5 a concern in patients who also have dense breast tissue and are more likely to have things missed by conventional imaging. IF they know they want breast conserva tion regardless of genetic testing results, we often go to surgery prior to results coming back. In many cases, even if results are negative, they are still high risk based on family history and we would want to screen them with MRI going forward, again es pecially with dense breast tissue. Ultimately, if someone meets the high risk criteria and has cancer, they should be approved for an MRI at diagnosis. The other time we have had difficulty getting them approved is if someone has a breast MRI and it has a birads 3 finding. They are recommended for 6 month follow up and it is getting denied. Winnie Henderson, breast surgeon : Our practice follows the ASBrS recommendation s [see above ] Breast MRI Guidelines 6 HERC staff summary The current three guidelines regarding breast cancer screening modalities continue to be confusing to CCOs and difficult to administer. There are generally few barriers to mammography or breast ultrasound; therefore, staff feel that the guidelines should be simplified by removing mammogram/breast ultrasound coverage wording and only outline when breast MRI is covered. Furthermore, GN26 BREAST CANCER SURVEILLANCE is a practice guideline, not a coverage guideline and therefore staff recommends deletion. Staff recommend combining these three guidelines coverag e regarding breast MRI and clarifying criteria based on NCCN recommendations. Furthermore, staff recommend retiring the coverage guidances related to breast cancer screening for women at above average risk and MRI for breast cancer diagnosis and MRI for b reast cancer screening . NCCN addresses coverage of MRI only for two situations: 1) screening for breast cancer in high -risk women, and 2) peri -operative MRI. In terms of perioperative MRI, t he current NCCN guidelines give a \"may\" recommendation, and note that no differences have been found in the rate of re -excision, conversion to mastectomy from planned lumpectomy, local recurrence or survival with pre -operative MRI. The breast surgeons consulted on this topic argue that preoperative breast MRI is s tandard of care , particularly in women pursuing breast conserving therapy (lumpectomy) . Expert guidelines address coverage of breast MRI in two additional situations: 1) evaluation of suspicious lesions when other imaging is equivocal and 2) evaluation of possible breast implant rupture. Breast MRI Guidelines 7 HERC staff recommendations : 1) Retire the following Coverage Guidances a. Breast Cancer Screening in Women at Above Average Risk b. PET For Breast Cancer (recently revised PET coverage criteria) c. MRI for Breast Canc er Diagnosis (last affirmed 2016) d.

Associated ASBrS Guidelines or Quality Measures 1. This document replaces the previous ASBrS Statements of \"Position Statement on the Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Breast Surgical Oncology\" (July 27, 2010) and \"The Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Breast Oncology\" (May 6, 2007). 2. The ASBrS Choosing Wisely\u00ae Campaign endorses the statement \"Don't routinely order breast MRI in new breast cancer patients.\" There are no other ASBrS Guidelines or Quality Measures on breast MRI. Methods A comprehensive, but not a systematic review of the literature, was performed, inclusive of recent randomized controlled trials and meta -analyses evaluating the efficacy of screening and diagnostic breast MRI. The ASBrS Research Committee developed a consensus document which was reviewed and approved by the ASBrS Board of Directors. Summary of Data Reviewed Diagnostic MRI in the B reast C ancer Patient MRI of the breast has been used for breast cancer detection since its approval by the FDA more than 25 years ago. MRI of the breast has higher sensitivity than mammography for cancer detection (> 90%) but variable specificity (range 30 -90%).1-6 MRI may aid diagnostic evaluation of the breast and surgical decision -making in selected patient populations as indicated below.7-10 False -positive findings on breast MRI are common. Therefore, histologic confirmation of suspicious indeterminate MRI findings is necessary if the identification of new cancer(s) would change patient treatment from breast conserving to ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral mastectomy.2,11,12 Multiple studies confirm an association between receipt of breast MRI in patients w ith cancer and increased ipsilateral and contralateral mastectomy rates, including contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, as well as increased time to treatment.13-19 2 MRI has been shown to increase identification of ipsilateral and contralateral malignanci es. In 2008, a meta -analysis by Houssami et al reported on 2610 patients with breast cancer who underwent MRI.3 Additional disease was identified in 16% of patients (range 6% to 34%). The impact of these MRI findings was a change from wide -local excision t o mastectomy in 8.1% of women (95% CI 5.9 -11.3) and a larger local excision in 11.3% of women (95% CI 6.8- 18.3). In 2012, a systematic review of the literature by Lehman reported 617 (13.7%) of 4500 women undergoing MRI with known breast cancer had additio nal ipsilateral breast cancer detected, and 151 (3.6%) of 4147 women had additional contralateral cancers detected by MRI.20 These MRI- detected findings impacted surgical decision -making. A separate meta -analysis by Brennan et al addressed the rate of MRI -detected contralateral breast cancer detection in women with presumed unilateral disease.4 They reported on 22 studies including 3253 patients. MRI found a synchronous contralateral cancer in 4.1% of patients; 35% were DCIS, and 65% were invasive cancers. The receipt of MRI in patients with breast cancer is an independent risk factor for the patient receiving mastectomy, even when adjusted for stage and tumor characteristics. In 2013, a meta - analysis by Houssami et al reviewed the outcomes after MRI in 31 12 breast cancer patients captured from 7 comparative cohort studies and prospective randomized trials.19 A significant increase in both the initial and overall mastectomy rates was seen in the MRI group (16.4% and 25.5%, respectively) compared with the no -MRI group (8.1% and 18.2%, respectively), with a consistent increase in mastectomy rates after adjusting for age (initial mastectomy adjusted OR 3.06, 95% CI 2.03 -4.62, CI 1.21- 1.89, p<.001). The accuracy o f MRI to determine tumor size has been compared to conventional imaging in the neoadjuvant setting. The level of agreement between MRI and pathologic tumor size is better than clinical examination and mammography but similar to ultrasound by meta - analysis.21 The comparative effectiveness of breast MRI between patients who had a preoperative MRI and those patients who did not for the outcomes of re -excision rates, ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and overall survival (OS) were reported in the Houss ami meta -analysis (2013) above, and in two randomized trials.12,18,19 There is no convincing evidence that MRI reduces re - excision lumpectomy rates, local recurrence, or overall survival in patients with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.22,23 The decision to use breast MRI as an adjunct to clinical examination, mammography, and ultrasound in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients should be made by the physician and patient after joint consideration of the benefits as well as the consequen ces of MRI, such as frequent false -positive findings of the breast, increased ipsilateral and contralateral mastectomy rates and increased time to treatment.2,4,7,11,17,24,25 The performance of MRI is associated with increased costs of care and may be asso ciated with increased patient anxiety.7,12,26 Well- informed patients may have less distress when false -positive findings necessitate additional biopsies. Actinic Keratoses 1 Plain Language Summary: Background: Sun damage causes a pre-cancerous skin patches called a ctinic keratoses . While 0.5-2% of these patches develop into skin cancer (squamous or basal cell carcinoma) each year , 25% re solve over a years' time. Treatment of actinic keratoses does not appear to prevent the squamous cell carcinoma. If squamous cell carcinoma develops , it is treatable. Should OHP cover actinic keratoses treatment? Staff recommends OHP not cover this treatment because it does not appear to prevent squamous cell carcinoma and any benefits appear to be cosmetic . Question : Should actinic keratoses be moved to a funded line? Question source : Abigail Haberman, MD dermatologist Issue : Dr. Haberman is requesting -coverage . are pre -cancerous skin lesions (rough scaly patches) caused by sun damage. AKs can develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) , a type of cancer . They are treated with freez ing with liquid nitrogen, or chemical agents applied to the skin such as 5 -fluoruracil (5-FU). Currently , line 627 BENIGN NEOPLASMS OF SKIN AND OTHER SOFT TISSUES. According to Dr. Haberman, this is an oversight in line placement, as \"actinic keratosis is considered a premalignant condition.\" Dr. Abigail Haberman is requesting an examination of the code pairing for these codes (L57.0 with destruction of benign skin lesions) as they are (in her practice) treating premalignant keratosis, she is asking that it be added to Line 242 DERMATOLOGICAL PREMALIGNANT LESIONS AND CARCINOMA IN SITU. HSC/HERC history At the May 2006 HOSC/HSC meetings, the following was discussed: \" only 2% of skin cancers originating in AKs metastasize, and 20 -25% regress over the course of a year. There was discussion over whether this should be on a funded line. Saha suggested that it would not be unreasonable to wait until they become squamous cell cancer, given the very low rate of metastasis and the high regression rate. It was noted that biopsy results in cure, hence is part of the diagnostic procedure. However, treatment with liquid nitrogen or 5FU would not be covered if this were on a lower line. Olson opined that movement to a lower line likely would not affect practice, as more severe lesions would still be biopsied. Coffman pointed out that, in the past, CMS has objected to not funding actinic keratoses, resulting in its current placement on Line 351.\" The HSC moved actinic keratoses to line 586 Benign neoplasms of skin, as a biennial review change. In April 2012, as part of the ICD -10 dermatology review, the dermatologists agreed with keeping actinic keratoses on line 655 (benign skin lesion line) .

Increased numbers of AKs were modestly associated with increased cSCC risk (15 AKs vs 1 AK: subdistribution HR, 1.89; 95%CI, 1.75 -2.04). Older patients had much higher risk of cSCC than younger patients (c ompared with those 49 years of age at AK diagnosis ; 80 years of age: subdistribution HR, 8.18; 95%CI, 7.62 - 8.78). Other than AK, risk factors for cSCC included older age, White race (a proxy for skin type), history of basal cell carcinoma, and male sex . e.

The natural history of these lesions is that many regress spontaneously, and some small percent can progress to become squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) . The estimated rate of progression for a n AK to SCC is approx imately 0.5 -2% per year. Effective treatments exist for AKs; however, one study looking at the natural history of treated AKs found that they still had an approximately 2% risk of progression to SCC per year even after treatment . If AKs progress to SCC, these lesions are typically treatable with minimal risk to the patient . The Dermatology ICD -10 review group did not recommend moving treatment of these lesions into the funded region of the Prioritized list. HERC staff recommendation: 1) Make no change in t he placement of ICD -10 L57.0 ( Actinic keratoses ) on line 627 NEOPLASMS OF SKIN AND OTHER SOFT TISSUES.

DOI 10.1111/bjd.12420Summary Knowledge about the development of untreated actinic keratosis (AK) and risk of progression into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is important. Therefore, we set out to synthesize primary data on the natural history of AK. We carried out a sys-tematic literature search (Medline, Medline in Process, Embase, Cochrane) of stud- ies on the natural course of AK, regarding (i) progression and regression rates per lesion-year, (ii) changes in total lesion counts over time, and (iii) spontaneous eld regression and recurrence rates, taking into account studies on participants without immunosuppression and history of skin cancer, immunosuppressed patients and participants with a history of skin cancer and sunscreen use. Twenty- four eligible studies were identied providing data on at least one of the out- comes. Progression rates of AK to SCC ranged from 0% to 0 /C1075% per lesion-year, with a risk of up to 0 /C153% per lesion in patients with prior history of nonmel- anoma skin cancer. Rates of regression of single lesions ranged between 15% and 63% after 1 year. The data available on recurrence rates of single lesions 1 yearafter regression indicate a recurrence rate of 15 -53%. Data on the relative change of total AK count over time are heterogeneous, and range from /C053% to +99/C11%. Spontaneous complete eld regression rates range from 0% to 21%, with recurrences in 57%. In general, the available data are limited. Important methodo- logical limitations apply. Currently, no reliable estimates concerning the frequency of AK developing into invasive carcinoma can be given, and further studies are needed. What's already known about this topic? \u0081Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common skin lesion with the potential of malignant progression. \u0081Progression and regression rates are a matter of debate, and available data have notbeen summarized systematically. What does this study add? \u0081Rates of progression of single AKs into squamous cell carcinoma range between0% and 0 /C153% per year, but due to methodological limitations in the identied publications, any estimate of progression rates remains highly uncertain. \u0081Rates of regression of single lesions ranged between 15% and 63% per year, with recurrence rates of 15 -53%. \u0081Spontaneous complete eld regression of observed elds on the face and scalp occurred in 0 -7/C12% of patients. Actinic keratosis (AK; or solar keratosis, senile keratosis) is a condition that was described by the end of the nineteenthcentury, 1,2and the debate about the malignant potential of AKreaches back to the early twentieth century.2,3AKs may be considered as intraepithelial keratinocytic dysplasia, and thus a'premalignant' skin lesion, or as in situ squamous cell carcinoma \u00a92013 British Association of Dermatologists 502 British Journal of Dermatology (2013) 169, pp502-518Ten-Year Follow-up of Persons With Sun-Damaged Skin Associated With Subsequent Development of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Sandra Lisa J. Herrinton, PhD IMPORTANCE Risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) after the diagnosis of actinic keratosis (AK) has not been studied during long follow-up periods. OBJECTIVE To estimate the risk up to 10 years and identify risk factors for cSCC development. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal cohort study, performed from January 1, 2009, to February 29, 2020, examined Kaiser Permanente Northern California patientswith AK and control patients matched 1:1 on age, sex, race/ethnicity, medical center, and dateof the initial diagnosis plus 30 days in the patients with AK. EXPOSURES Patients with AK and control participants were followed up for up to 10 years for incidence of cSCC. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident cSCC was obtained from pathologic data, and subdistribution hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportionalhazards regression analysis, accounting for competing risks, calendar year, demographicfactors, and number of AKs. RESULTS The study included 220 236 patients with AK and 220 236 matched control patients (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [12.2] years; 231 248 [52.5%] female). After losses to follow-up wereaccounted for, risk of cSCC increased with each year of follow-up by 1.92% (95% CI,1.89%-1.95%) in patients with CI, 1.85-1.95). H owever, among patients 49 years or younger, those diagnosed with AK were nearly 7 times more likely to be diagnosed with cSCCthan those without AK (HR, 6.77; 95% CI, 5.50-8.32). At 10 years, the cumulative incidence ofcSCC reached 17.1% (95% CI, 16.9%-17.4%) in patients with AK and 5.7% (95% CI, 5.5%-5.9%)in control patients. Increased numbers of AKs were modestly associated with increased cSCCrisk (/H1135015 AKs vs 1 AK: subdistribution HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.75-2.04). Older patients had much higher risk of cSCC than younger patients (compared with those /H1134949 years of age at AK diagnosis; /H1135080 years of age: subdistribution HR, 8.18; 95% CI, 7.62-8.78). Other than AK, risk factors for cSCC included older age, White race (a proxy for skin type), history of basalcell carcinoma, and male sex. Risk decreased between 2009 and 2019 (2018-2019 vs2009-2010: subdistribution HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.63-0.72). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this longitudinal cohort study can be used to develop recommendations to increase early detection of cSCC. Additional research isneeded to understand the effect of AK treatment on cSCC risk and outcomes of cSCC.

Criscione, MPH5, and Stephen F. Bingham, PhD6, for the Department of Veteran Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention Trial Group BACKGROUND: Actinic keratoses (AKs) are established as direct precursors of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but there is significant controversy regarding the rate at which AKs progress to SCC. The authors of this report studied a high-risk population to estimate the risk of progression of AK to SCC and to basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and the risk of spontaneous regression of untreated AKs. METHODS: Data were obtained from participants in the Department of Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention Trial. Partici- pants were examined every 6 months for up to 6 years. At each examination, the locations on the face and ears of clinically diagnosed AKs and lesions scheduled for biopsy were marked, and high-resolution digitalphotographs were taken. These photographs were used later to map and track the presence, absence, or biopsy of each AK across visits. RESULTS: In total, 7784 AKs were identified on the face and ears of 169 participants. The risk of progression of AK to primary SCC (invasive or in situ) was 0.60% at 1 year and2.57% at 4 years. Approximately 65% of all primary SCCs and 36% of all primary BCCs diagnosed in the study cohort arose in lesions that previously were diagnosed clinically as AKs. The majority of AKs (55%) that were followed clinically were not present at the 1-year follow-up, and the majority (70%) were notpresent at the 5-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, the authors quantified the malignant potential of clinically diagnosed AKs for both SCC and BCC, although many did not persist, and the results Received: September 25, 2008; Revised: November 14, 2008; Accepted: November 20, 2008 Published online: April 20, 2009, Published 2009 by the American Cancer Society* DOI: 10.1002/cncr.24284, www.interscience.wiley.comCorresponding author: Martin A.

Published American Society.* KEY WORDS: actinic keratoses, squamous cell epidemiology. Actinic keratoses (AKs) are dysplastic keratinocytic lesions confined to the epidermis that are caused by ultra-violet (UV) radiation. 1They are 1 of the most common conditions treated by dermatologists,2with an estimated prevalence of 39.5 million in the US in 2004 and annualcosts totaling $1.04 billion. 3Although the most common reason for treatment is prevention of malignancy, lesionsalso are treated for cosmetic purposes and to provide relief from symptoms, such as tenderness or itch. It is generally accepted that these lesions can be direct precursors ofsquamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but there has been a pau-city of investigations into the frequency of malignanttransformation; thus, there is significant controversy overthe rate at which AKs progress to SCC. Annual rates oftransformation ranging from 0.025% to 20% have beenreported, 4yet we are aware of only 1 study that directly quantifies this risk using primary data.5That study was conducted in a general population sample, and the maxi-mum follow-up of individual lesions was 1 year. Thedearth of direct study of this phenomenon is remarkable. For the current investigation, we used prospectively collected data from 1 center of a randomized, multicentertrial in a high-risk population with up to 6 years of follow-up, including photography and dermatologist examina-tion, to estimate the risk of progression of AKs to kerati-nocyte carcinomas (KCs) and to assess the natural history of AKs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected from the participants at 1 of the 6 sites of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Topical Treti-noin Chemoprevention (VATTC) trial, a randomized,multicenter trial of topical tretinoin 0.1% for the preven-tion of KCs of the face and ears. Additional details of thatstudy are described elsewhere. 6,7Although quantifying the times to onset of new basal cell carcinoma (BCC) orSCC were the primary focus of the trial, understandingthe natural history of AKs was a secondary objective and,for this purpose, a subprotocol was implemented for the 182 participants at 1 site (the Oklahoma City VA MedicalCenter). All participants had been diagnosed with /C212 KCs in the 5 years before enrollment in the study and hence represent a high-risk population. The study derma-tologist (an experienced clinician who had been practicingclinical dermatology actively for 14 years) examined allparticipants at approximately 6-month intervals. Therewas no specific treatment of AKs (other than biopsy ifthey became bothersome or clinically suspect for KC) dur-ing the trial, although all participants were offered freesunscreen and encouraged to use it. Participants werequeried at each visit regarding biopsies and dermatologic treatments that took place outside of the Oklahoma VA Medical Center. Participants did not report any biopsiesand only reported 38 treatments outside of the VA (7.1%of all treatments) during the trial. During each examina-tion, a standardized set of 3 high-resolution digital photo-graphs of the face and ears was taken. Then, all AKs wereidentified by clinical criteria and were marked in red onthe patient's face or ears. Lesions that were suspected car-cinoma were scheduled for biopsy and marked in black.The photographs then were repeated to document these markings for later analysis. The investigators did not refer to images from previous visits during subsequent visits.After completion of the trial, the photographs were usedto evaluate the presence, absence, or biopsy designation ofeach distinct face/ears lesion at each study visit. All lesionsthat were biopsied from the face or ears were evaluated bya local pathologist and by 1 of 2 central referencedermatopathologists who were blinded to the originaldiagnosis. The interobserver reliability of these diagnosesis documented elsewhere. 8The diagnosis made by the central reference dermatopathologists was used for study purposes. Only biopsies of lesions that once had beenphotographed and marked as AKs were included in ouranalyses of AK prognosis. AKs that were not located onthe face or ears were excluded from all data considered inthis study.Original Article 2524 Cancer June 1, 2009Guidelines of care for the management of actinic keratosis Daniel B.

Schlesinger, MDm California; Boston, Massachusetts; Madison, Wisconsin; Scottsdale and Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado; New York, New York; New Haven, Connecticut; Washington, DC; Rosemont, Illinois; and Charleston, South Carolina Background: Actinic keratoses (AK) are rough scaly patches that arise on chronically ultraviolet-exposed skin and can progress to keratinocyte carcinoma. Objective: This analysis examined the literature related to the management of AK to provide evidence- based recommendations for treatment. Grading, histologic classication, natural history, risk of progres-sion, and dermatologic surveillance of AKs are also discussed. Methods: A multidisciplinary Work Group conducted a systematic review to address 5 clinical questions on the management of AKs and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, andEvaluation approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading clinicalrecommendations. Graded recommendations were voted on to achieve consensus. Results: Analysis of the evidence resulted in 18 recommendations. Limitations: This analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time it was conducted. The pragmatic decision to limit the literature review to English language randomized trials may have excludeddata published in other languages or limited identication of relevant long-term follow-up data. Conclusions: Strong recommendations are made for using ultraviolet protection, topical imiquimod, topical 5-fluorouracil, and cryosurgery. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of photody-namic therapy and diclofenac for the treatment of AK, both individually and as part of combination therapyregimens. ( topical agents.

Question source: Alison Little, CCO medical director Issue: Conventional treatment of renal cancer is total or partial nephrectomy (open or laparoscopic). For some smaller tumors, cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation may be selected. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of several less invasive approaches that have been investigated for the treatment of kidney cancer. In RFA, an electric current from a radiofrequency (RF) generator delivers energy into the tumor, via an electrode. Tissue impedance leads to heat generation, production of lethal temperatures, and ablation of tissue. RFA has been used most often for adults with small kidney tumors. Indications include comorbidities that preclude surgery, a single kidney, and multifocal renal cell carcinoma. Radiofrequency ablation of renal tumors (CPT 50592) is on line 662/GN173 and has not been reviewed in 15+ years.

Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for renal cancer in the short and medium term appears a dequate to support the use of this procedure provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit, and provided that patients are followed up in the long term b. A meta -analysis of 47 studies (non -randomized comparative st udies and case series) including a total of 1375 tumors treated by RFA (n = 775) or cryoablation (n = 600) reported local tumor progression (defined as radiographic or pathological evidence of residual disease after initial treatment, regardless of time to recurrence) in 13% (100/775) and 5% (31/600) of tumors respectively at a mean 19 -month follow -up (p < 0.001). The meta -analysis reported progression to metastatic disease in (19/775) of tumors treated by RFA and 1% (6/600) of tumors treated by cryoabla tion (p = not significant) c. In a non -randomized comparative study of 233 patients (260 tumors), residual or recurrent tumor on follow -up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reported in 11% (9/81) of tumors treated by percutaneous RFA and 2% (3/ 179) of tum ors treated by laparoscopic cryotherapy (1 -year and 3 -year median follow -up respectively). d. Adverse events: i. Hemorrhage was reported in 6% (5/85) of patients in a case series of 85 patients. ii. Hematoma requiring blood transfusion was reported in 1% (1/104) of patients in a case series and 1% (1/82) of RFA procedures in the non -randomized comparative study of 233 patients. Hematoma not requiring blood transfusion was reported in 5% (4/82) (3 perirenal requiring no treatment; 1 retroperitoneal) of RFA procedures in the non -randomized comparative study of 233 patients. Asymptomatic perirenal hematoma development was reported in 12% (4/34) (managed conservatively with no sequelae) of RFA procedures in the case series of 31 patients. e. The Specialist Adviser s indicated that there was uncertainty about the procedure's efficacy in tumors 4 cm or greater in diameter. Expert guidelines 1) NCCN Guideline Kidney Cancer Version 2.2022 a. Thermal ablation (e.g. cryosurgery, radiofrequency ablation) is an option for the management of patients with clinical stage T1 renal lesions i. Thermal ablation is an option for masses <3 cm, but may also be an option for larger masses in select patients. Ablation in masses >3cm is associated with higher rates of local recurrence/persistence and complications ii. Biopsy of small lesions confirms a diagnosis of malignancy for surveillance, cryosurgery, and radiofrequency ablation strategies 2) American Urological Association 2017 a. Physici ans should consider thermal ablation (TA) as an alternate approach for the management of cT1a renal masses <3 cm in size. For patients who elect TA, a percutaneous technique is preferred over a surgical approach whenever feasible to minimize morbidity. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Radiofrequency Ablation of Renal Tumors 4 b. Both radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation are options for patients who elect thermal ablation. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) c. A renal mass biopsy should be performed prior to ab lation to provide pathologic diagnosis and guide subsequent surveillance. (Expert Opinion) d. Counseling about thermal ablation should include information regarding an increased likelihood of tumor persistence or local recurrence after primary thermal ablatio n relative to surgical extirpation, which may be addressed with repeat ablation if further intervention is elected. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) Other payer policies 1) Aetna 2021 a. Aetna considers radiofrequency ablation (RFA) medically necessary for the following indications i. Renal cell carcinoma, up to 4 -cm in size, in persons who meet the following criteria: 1. High -risk surgical candidates; or 2. Persons with renal insufficiency, as defined by a glomerular filtration rate of less than or equal to 60 ml/min/m2; or 3. Persons with a solitary kidney. 2) ConnectiCare (Connecticut Medicaid) 2020 a. Members with small undefined renal lesions ( 4 cm in diameter) that are suspected to be malignant, or with malignant potential, are eligible for coverage of either cryoablation or RFA by any modality (eg laparoscopically or percutaneously) when either of the following criteria is met: i. Medically or surgically inoperable tumor(s). ii. Poor candidacy for standard treatments (i.e., nephrectomy). Radiofrequency Ablation of Renal Tumors 5 HERC staff summary Treatment of small renal cell carcinomas (<3cm) by radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy in patients who are poor surgical candidates is recommended by NCCN and the American Urological Association. A highly trusted evidence -based source (NICE ) has found sufficient evidence of effectiveness in this population to recommend use.

F urther research should compare the long-term outcomes of RF A with those of other treatments for renal cancer . 2 2 The procedure The procedure 2.1 2.1 Indications and current treatments Indications and current treatments 2.1.1 There are few symptoms in the early stages of renal cancer . Typically , symptoms develop as the disease progresses. The first symptom is often blood in the urine; pain and flank mass are other classic symptoms. 2.1.2 Renal cancer ma y be diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies or patients ma y present with symptoms. Con ventional treatment for renal cancer is total or partial nephrectom y (open or laparoscopic). One of a r ange of non-resectional ablativ e procedures such as cry oablation and RF A ma y be selected for some smaller tumours. 2.2 2.2 Outline of the procedure Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Percutaneous RF A for renal cancer is carried out with the patient under either local anaesthesia and sedation or gener al anaesthesia.

Some patients with clinically localized renal masses may present with findings suggesting aggressive tumor biology or may be upstaged on exploration or final pathology. Management considerations pertinent to the urologist in such patients will also be addressed. Practice patterns regarding such tumors vary considerably. The literature regarding evaluation and management has been rapidly evolving. Notable examples include controversies about the role of renal mass biopsy and concerns about overutilization of radical nephrectomy. Please also refer to the associated Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer treatment algorithm. Methodology The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline was completed in part through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and through additional supplementation that further addressed additional key questions and more recently published literature. A research librarian experienced in conducting literature searches for comparative effectiveness reviews searched in MEDLINE\u00ae, Embase \u00ae, the Cochrane Library, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment Database, and the UK National Health Service Economic Evaluation database to capture both published and gray literature published from January 1, 1997 through May 1, 2015. A supplemental search was conducted adding additional literature published through August 2015, and a final update search was conducted through July 2016. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions. GUIDELINE STATEMENTS EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS 1. In patients with a solid or complex cystic renal mass, physicians should obtain high quality, multiphase, cross -sectional abdominal imaging to optimally characterize and clinically stage the renal mass. Characterization of the renal mass should include assessment of tumor complexity, degree of contrast enhancement (where applicable), and presence or absence of fat. (Clinical Principle) 2. In patients with suspected renal malignancy, physicians should obtain comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and urinalysis.

Pierorazio, MD Copyright \u00a9 201 7 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.\u00ae Panel Nomination Acknowledgment: The AUA would like to acknowledge the following organizations: College of American Pathologists (CAP); Society Nephrology (ASN); En- dourological Society; and the Society of Interventional Radiology for participation in the development of this guideline. 2 American Urological Association (AUA) Metastatic evaluation should include chest imaging to evaluate for possible thoracic metastases. (Clinical Principle) 3. For patients with a solid or complex cystic renal mass, physicians should assign CKD stage based on GFR and degree of proteinuria. (Expert Opinion) COUNSELING 4. In patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, a urologist should lead the counseling process and should consider all management strategies. A multidisciplinary team should be included when necessary. (Expert Opinion) 5. Physicians should provide counseling that includes current perspectives about tumor biology and a patient - specific risk assessment inclusive of sex, tumor size/complexity, histology (when obtained), and imaging characteristics. For cT1a tumors, the low oncologic risk of many small renal masses should be reviewed. (Clinical Principle) 6. During counseling of patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, physicians must review the most common and serious urologic and non -urologic morbidities of each treatment pathway and the importance of patient age, comorbidities/frailty, and life expectancy. (Clinical Principle) 7. Physicians should review the importance of renal functional recovery related to renal mass management, including the risk of progressive CKD, potential short - or long -term need for renal replacement therapy, and long -term overall survival considerations. (Clinical Principle) 8. Physicians should consider referral to nephrology in patients with a high risk of CKD progression. Such patients may include those with eGFR less than 45 ml/min/1.73m2, confirmed proteinuria, diabetics with preexisting CKD, or whenever eGFR is expected to be less than 30 ml/min/1.73m2 after intervention. (Expert Opinion) 9. Physicians should recommend genetic counseling for all patients 46 years of age with renal malignancy and consider genetic counseling for patients with multifocal or bilateral renal masses, or if personal or family history suggests a familial renal neoplastic syndrome. (Expert Opinion) RENAL MASS BIOPSY (RMB) 10. Renal mass biopsy should be considered when a mass is suspected to be hematologic, metastatic, inflammatory, or infectious. (Clinical Principle) 11. In the setting of a solid renal mass, RMB is not required for: 1) young or healthy patients who are unwilling to accept the uncertainties associated with RMB; or 2) older or frail patients who will be managed conservatively independent of RMB findings. (Expert Opinion) 12. When considering the utility of RMB, patients should be counseled regarding rationale, positive and negative predictive values, potential risks and non -diagnostic rates of RMB. (Clinical Principle) 13. For patients with a solid renal mass who elect RMB, multiple core biopsies are preferred over fine needle aspiration. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) MANAGEMENT: PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY (PN) AND NEPHRON -SPARING APPROACHES 14. Physicians should prioritize PN for the management of the cT1a renal mass when intervention is indicated. In this setting, PN minimizes the risk of CKD or CKD progression and is associated with favorable oncologic outcomes, including excellent local control. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) 15. Physicians should prioritize nephron -sparing approaches for patients with solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal masses and an anatomic or functionally solitary kidney, bilateral tumors, known familial RCC, preexisting CKD, or proteinuria. (Moderate Recommendation; C) 16. Physicians should consider nephron -sparing approaches for patients with solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal masses who are young, have multifocal masses, or comorbidities that are likely to impact renal function in Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer Copyright \u00a9 201 7 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.\u00ae 3 the future, such as moderate to severe hypertension, diabetes mellitus, recurrent urolithiasis, or morbid obesity. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) 17. In patients who elect PN, physicians should prioritize preservation of renal function through efforts to optimize nephron mass preservation and avoidance of prolonged warm ischemia. (Expert Opinion) 18. For patients undergoing PN, negative surgical margins should be a priority. The extent of normal parenchyma removed should be determined by surgeon discretion taking into account the clinical situation, tumor characteristics including growth pattern, and interface with normal tissue. Tumor enucleation should be considered in patients with familial RCC, multifocal disease, or severe CKD to optimize parenchymal mass preservation. (Expert Opinion) RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY (RN) 19. Physicians should consider RN for patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass where increased oncologic potential is suggested by tumor size, RMB, and/or imaging characteristics and in whom active treatment is planned. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) In this setting, RN is preferred if all of the following criteria are met: 1) high tumor complexity and PN would be challenging even in experienced hands; 2) no preexisting CKD or proteinuria; and 3) normal contralateral kidney and new baseline eGFR will likely be greater than 45 ml/min/1.73m2. (Expert Opinion) SURGICAL PRINCIPLES 20. For patients who are undergoing surgical excision of a renal mass with clinically concerning regional lymphadenopathy, physicians should perform a lymph node dissection for staging purposes. (Expert Opinion) 21. For patients who are undergoing surgical excision of a renal mass, physicians should perform adrenalectomy if imaging and/or intraoperative findings suggest metastasis or direct invasion of the adrenal gland. (Clinical Principle) 22. In patients undergoing surgical excision of a renal mass, a minimally invasive approach should be considered when it would not compromise oncologic, functional and perioperative outcomes. (Expert Opinion) 23. Pathologic evaluation of the adjacent renal parenchyma should be performed after PN or RN to assess for possible intrinsic renal disease, particularly for patients with CKD or risk factors for developing CKD. (Clinical Principle) THERMAL ABLATION (TA) 24. Physicians should consider thermal ablation (TA) as an alternate approach for the management of cT1a renal masses <3 cm in size. For patients who elect TA, a percutaneous technique is preferred over a surgical approach whenever feasible to minimize morbidity. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) 25. Both radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation are options for patients who elect thermal ablation. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) 26. A renal mass biopsy should be performed prior to ablation to provide pathologic diagnosis and guide subsequent surveillance. (Expert Opinion) 27. Counseling about thermal ablation should include information regarding an increased likelihood of tumor persistence or local recurrence after primary thermal ablation relative to surgical extirpation, which may be addressed with repeat ablation if further intervention is elected. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE (AS) 28. For patients with small solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal masses, especially those <2cm, AS is an option for initial management. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) 29. For patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, physicians should prioritize active surveillance/expectant management when the anticipated risk of intervention or competing risks of death outweigh the potential oncologic benefits of active treatment. (Clinical Principle) American Urological Association (AUA) Copyright \u00a9 201 7 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.\u00ae Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer 4 30. For patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass in whom the risk/benefit analysis for treatment is equivocal and who prefer AS, physicians should repeat imaging in 3 -6 months to assess for interval growth and may consider RMB for additional risk stratification. (Expert Opinion) 31. For patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass in whom the anticipated oncologic benefits of intervention outweigh the risks of treatment and competing risks of death, physicians should recommend active treatment. In this setting, AS with potential for delayed intervention may be pursued only if the patient understands and is willing to accept the associated oncologic risk.

Question source: Holly Jo Hodges, MD, CCO medical director Issue: A new guideline was added to t he Prioritized List in 2015 regarding treatments options for lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS ) other than transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) based on a coverage guidance regarding alternatives to TURP . This guideline requires that symptoms be \"severe\" but does not define severe. The American Urologic Association (AUA) and other expert groups have developed a symptom index known as the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). This list of questions is scored with 0 -7 being considered \"mild\" Dr. Hodges is requesting that GN145 be clarified to indicate that \"severe\" symptoms are defined as an IPSS score of 20 -35. The American Urologic Association revised their guidelines for treatment of LUTS in 2021. In that guideline, the AUA recommends using the IPSS at initial evaluation of LUTS and to follow up on any interventions to evaluate effectiveness. Dr. Hodges has also requested that the requirement for \" drug treatment and conservative man agement options \" to fail or not be appropriate to be clarified. Do a certain number of drugs need to be failed? What is considered failure? What are conservative management options? The AUA 2021 guideline recommends the following medications as treatment options for LUTS: 1) Alpha blockers ( e.g., tamsulosin, terazosin, doxazosin, etc.). Evidence level Grade A 2) 5 alpha reductase inhibitors for LUTS with p rostate volume >30 cc, >1.5 ng/dl, or palpable prostate enlargement of digital recta l exam. Evidence Level Grace B 3) Tadalafil as a treatment option. Evidence Level Grace B 4) Combination of various medications in certain clinical situations The AUA recommends the following conservative treatment options for LUTS: 1) Alter modifiable factors such as caff eine, fluids, contributing medications when possible 2) Lifestyle counseling In the AUA 2021 guideline, only the surgical interventions which are currently covered on the Prioritized List.

See https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/DSI -HERC/Pages/Evidence -based -Reports.aspx 1 SUMMARY Purpose Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a histologic diagnosis that refers to the proliferation of smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition zone. The prevalence and the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in the aging male can be progressive and is an important diagnosis in the healthcare of patients and the welfare of society. In the management of bothersome LUTS, it is important that healthcare providers recognize the complex dynamics of the bladder, bladder neck, prostate, and urethra. Further, symptoms may result from interactions of these organs as well as with the central nervous system or other systemic diseases (e.g., metabolic syndro me, congestive heart failure). Despite the more prevalent (and generally first line) use of medical therapy for men suffering from LUTS attributed to BPH (L UTS/BPH), there remain clinical scenarios where surgery is indicated as the initial intervention for LUTS/BPH and should be recommended, providing other medical comorbidities do not preclude this approach. It is the hope that this revised Guideline will provide a useful reference on the effective evidence-based management of male LUTS/BPH. Please see the accompanying algorithm for a summary of the procedures detailed in the Guideline. Methodology For the surgical management of BPH, the Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Li brary, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) database to identify studies indexed between January 2007 and September 2017. Following initial publication in 2018, this Guideline underwent an amendment in 2019 that included literature published through January 2019. An additional literature search was conducted through September 2019 and serves as the basis for a 2020 amendment. The Guideline underwent an additional amendment in 2021 to capture eligible literature published between September 2019 and September 2020. For the medical management of BPH, the Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Coch rane Library, and the AHRQ databases to identify eligible studies published and indexed between January 2008 and April 2019. An updated search was completed to capture studies published between April 2019 and December 2020. Search terms included Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords for pharmacological therapies, drug classes, and terms related to LUTS or BPH. Limits were used to restrict the search to English language publications. The review team also reviewed articles for inclusion identified by Guideline Panel Members. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Approved by the AUA Board of Directors August 2021 Authors' disclosure of po- tential conflicts of interest and author/staff contribu-tions appear at the end of the article. \u00a9 2021 by the American Urological Association American Urological Association (AUA) Management of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Attributed to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: AUA GUIDELINE Lori B.

Question source : Linda Williams, School -Based Health Services Program at OHA Issue: Sensory integration therapy (SIT) is a type of occupational therapy that seeks to improve integration of sensory information and thereby help children with learning disabilities improve their sensorimotor skills. In theory, this will result in improved be havior and academic performance. It is typically done as part of treatment for children with autism spectrum disorder. Currently, sensory integration therapy is on line 662/GN173. The entry in GN173 lists the date of last review a s 2010; however, the las t in depth review of this therapy was earlier tha n 2006.

N=24 studies (inclusion c riteria: 10 or more children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 2 -12 for RCTs, 20 or more children for other study designs ) i. 20 RCTs, 1 non -randomized trial, 3 retrospective cohort studies ii. 3 low, 10 moderate, 11 high risk of bias iii. Severity of ASD and sensory dysfunction varied across studies b. Key points: i. Four studies addressing sensory integration (SI) -based approaches were small and short -term (typically <6 months), with no follow -up beyond the immediate treatment period. No study reported harms of intervention. ii. Sensory -related outcomes improved in children receiving an SI -based intervention compared with those receiving usual care or other treatment (statistically significant improvements in three of four studies addressing the outcome). We have l ow confidence in this conclusion (low strength of evidence). iii. Motor skills outcomes were improved in children receiving SI -based treatment compared with those receiving usual care or other treatment (statistically significant improvements in three of three studies addressing the outcome). We have low confidence in this conclusion (low strength of evidence). iv. We could not assess the effects of SI -based treatment on adaptive behavior given differences in outcomes measures (insufficient strength of evidence). v. Only two studies conducted a follow -up after treatment ended. Follow -up occurred at two and five months in each study. Additionally, many of the outcome measures were based upon parent reports rather than using standardized interactive assessments. Therefore, little existing evidence at this time contributes to predicting long -term functional outcomes. c. Relative to usual care or other interventions, SI-based approaches improved measures related to sensory and motor skills in the short ter m (3 RCTs with high, moderate, and low risk of bias ( ROB ) and 1 high ROB retrospective cohort study). Four small RCTs (2 moderate and 2 high ROB) of auditory integration -based approaches reported mixed results. Additional RCTs (moderate and high ROB) of in terventions with sensory -related components (tactile stimulation exercises, weighted blankets) reported few significant differences between treatment groups. d. Conclusions. Some interventions targeting sensory challenges may produce modest short -term (<6 mo nths) improvements, primarily in sensory -related outcomes and outcomes related to ASD symptom severity; however, the evidence base for any category of intervention is small, and durability of effects beyond the immediate intervention period is unclear. Sen sory integration -based approaches improved outcomes related to sensory challenges (low strength of evidence ( SOE)) and motor skills (low SOE). Data on longer term results are lacking, as are data on characteristics that modify outcomes, effectiveness of in terventions across environments or contexts, and components of interventions that may drive effects. In sum, while some therapies may hold promise and warrant further study, substantial needs exist for continuing improvements in methodologic rigor in the f ield. Sensory Integration Therapy 3 Other payer policies 1) United Health Care 2021 : a. The following are unproven and not medically necessary for treating any condition due to insufficient evidence of efficacy: i. Sensory integration therapy (SIT) ii.

Most were placed on the same line as the \"mother code\" as \"daughter codes\" when they were released as new ICD -10 codes without specific in - depth review. Dr. Rajani requested a review of this code family, as some of these codes are on funded lines and code for conditions such as flat feet which are not intended for coverage. On review, several of the codes in this family should be moved to other lines.

Question source : Max Kaiser, CCO medical director Issue: There are several CPT codes for gait analysis which are currently on the Ancillar y file . These tests are generally not covered by private insurance as experimental. Dr. Kaiser received a request for this testing a nd is asking for clarification as to HERC 's intent for coverage. It appears from old minutes that these codes were not intended to be covered. These codes were mo ved to the Diagnostic Workup File in 2012 as part of the neuroimaging back pain discussion. This appears to be due to the mistaken impression that these codes are used for standard electromyo graphy (EMG), when actually this service is coded with CPT codes 95860 -95870. Gait analysis is used to study a variety of conditions, most commonly cerebral palsy. Studies have been conducted to evaluate whether gait analysis affects surgical planning or outcomes in cerebral palsy. It is also used for studies of athl etes and human kinetics. Gait analysis consists of the visual assessment of walking, augmented by videotaping with the use of slow -motion and split -screens to view the child's gait simultaneously from the front, back and side to capture the range of joint motion (kinematics) occurring in the sagittal, coronal and transverse planes over the entire gait cycle. The subject walks on force plates embedded in the floor, which calculates the joint moments and power (kinetics). Kinematic and kinetic data are prese nted as waveforms over the entire gait cycle, along with the typical waveforms of normal gait for comparison. Subjects may also undergo dynamic electromyography (EMG) to record the timing of activation of specific muscles/muscle groups during the gait cycl e and measurement of energy expenditure or oxygen consumption during walking. These data are used collectively to guide the choice of interventions to optimize gait efficiency and quality. Surface electromyography (sEMG) can be used to assess the integrit y of the neuromuscular system and its impairment in neurological disorders. Multi -muscle sEMG recordings provide information on muscular recruitment/de -recruitment capability, fatigue, synergistic activation, co -contractions, as well as contribute to the e vidence for the efficacy of the rehabilitation plan HSC/HERC history : April 2004 : 96000 -96004 Motion analysis. These codes are currently not on the List. The Subcommittee members felt they should remain off the list. Action: add to the Never Covered list. November 2012 : It was pointed out that electromyelography (CPT 96002 -4) is used for diagnosis of a variety of conditions. The proposal was to not cover this service for the diagnosis of low back pain; however, the group agreed that it should be covered for diagnosis for other conditions and moved from the Ancillary to the Diagnostic List. The intention is to not cover EMG for diagnosis of low back pain.

The use of gait analysis to guide clinical (surgical) decision -making before multilevel orthopedic surgery remains an area of controversy among pediatric orthopedic surgeons. There is good evidence that gait analysis does alter surgical decision -making at least some of the time. However, there remain concerns about the reliability (reproducibility) of these decisions or whether implementing these recommendations would result in differen t, let alone better outcomes b. A systematic review of the literature on the use of gait analysis in children with walking disorders reported that there was little published evidence that outcomes of surgery based on gait analysis are any better than outcomes of surgery based on observational analysis alone c. Conclusion: insufficient evidence regarding the utility of gait analysis improving surgical outcomes Surface EMG 1) Cappellini 2020 review of surface electromyography in cerebral palsy a. Despite the uniqueness of the sEMG technology and the successes in clinical applications for planning and assessment of treatment of children with cerebral palsy, clinical application and practice in rehabilitation departments remain very limited because of many barri ers. Other payer policies 1) Aetna 2021 : Aetna considers gait analysis (also known as motion analysis studies), dynamic electromyography or the use of an electrodynogram experimental and investigational for conditions that result in gait deviations and for all other indications because there is insufficient peer -reviewed medical literature demonstrating the clinical value of these technologies. 2) Cigna 2021 : a. Computerized gait analysis is considered medically necessary when BOTH of the following criteria are me t: Gait Analysis Testing and Surface Electromyography i. A child or adolescent has a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. ii. The procedure is performed as part of a preoperative assessment, and the results will be used in surgical planning. b. Gait analysis for any other indication is considered experimental, investigat ional or unproven 3) Wellmark BCBS 2021 a. Surface electromyography (sEMG) including but not limited to the following, for the evaluation of neuromuscular disorders and to evaluate abnormal patterns of electrical activity in the paraspinal muscles for any indica tion is considered investigational . There is insufficient evidence in the medical literature to support the use of any type of surface electromyography (sEMG) as the diagnostic utility is unknown and the role in patient management has not been established. HERC staff summary There is ver y little evidence published on the clinical utility of either gait analysis or surface electromyography. Most private insurers do not cover these tests, considering them experimental. Surface electromyography appeared to be mistakenly removed from the Ex cluded file as the procedure codes were inaccurately thought to represent standard EMG testing. HERC staff recommendation : 1) Add CPT 96000 -96004 to line 662/GN173 a.

The eectiveness of interventions in CP must rst consider what CP and its associated pathophysiology are and takeinto account the heterogeneity and natural history of CP to put denitions of \"eectiveness\" into pe rspective. This article reviews the current standards of the den ition and classication of CP, discusses the natural history and specic goals for the management of ambulatory CP, as well as the outcome measures available to measure these goals. The current best evidence of eectiveness isreviewed for specic interventi ons in children with ambulatory CP including spasticity management with botulinum toxin A injections and selective dorsal rhizotomy; multilevel orthopaedic surgery to address contractures and bony deformity; and the role of gaitanalysis for surgical decision-mak ing before orthopaedic surgery. Key Words: cerebral palsy, ambulatory children, evidence-based medicine, treatment outcomes, eectiveness, orthopaedic surgery, multilevel surgery, gait analysis (J Pediatr Orthop 2012;32:S172-S181) Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common cause of chronic physical disability in children aecting between 2 and 3 per 1000 children.1The impact is lifelong and af- fects not only the child with CP, but also their parents andcaregivers, the family, the health care system, and poten- tially society at large. In the absence of a cure, children with CP are subjected to numerous interventions to address thesecondary consequences of the primary neurological path- ology. This article reviews the current best evidence for the (musculoskeletal) interventions for children with ambula-tory CP, with much of the content derived and updatedfrom 2 systematic reviews on the subject. 2,3 Any discussion about the eectiveness of inter- ventions in CP must rst consider what CP and its asso-ciated pathophysiology are and take into account theheterogeneity and natural history of CP in order to put denitions of \"eectiveness\" into perspective. This article will review the current standards of the denition andclassication of CP and discuss the functional trajectory associated with the natural history, before outlining the specic goals for the management of ambulatory CP, aswell as the list of validated outcome measures available to measure whether these goals are achieved. This background is essential to contextualize the current best evidence aboutthe eectiveness of various musculoskeletal interventions to achieve these goals for children with ambulatory CP. DEFINITION OF CP AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL CONSEQUENCES The term CP refers to a heterogeneous group of dis- orders of the development of movement and posture that are permanent and attributable to nonprogressive dis- turbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infantbrain. 4The primary disorder in the brain is associated with abnormal muscle tone, most often hypertonia, accom- panied by loss of selective motor control, muscle weakness,and impaired balance. 5The motor disorders contribute to secondary musculoskeletal problems including muscle contractures, bony deformities, and joint instability. Nor- mal muscle growth occurs in response to the stimulus ofstretch derived from typical physical activities associated with normal motor development. Hypertonia and the lim- ited use of muscles due to developmental delay resultin dynamic contractures, which become static joint con- tractures over time as the tight muscles fail to grow in proportion to the long bones which they traverse. 6The growing skeleton remodels in response to typical stresses associated with the motor milestones, which when delayed, or absent, result in retention of infantile morphology anddevelopment of secondary bony deformities and joint in-stability, which contribute to lever-arm dysfunction. 7The interaction of joint contractures, muscle weakness, bony deformities, and joint instability at multiple levels aect thequality and eciency of gait and other aspects of physical function in children who are ambulant or deformities of the trunk and limbs in those who are nonambulant.

If yes, is there a guideline required? Question source : HERC staff Issue : In August 2020, polydactyly (having multiple toes) was discussed at VBBS and HERC. The staff proposal was to leave the diagnosis on an uncovered line, and add to a covered line with a guideline that stated the diagnosis was on the covered line only when the child could not be fitted with shoes by age 1. The VBBS did not feel that a guideline was needed, but did approve the addition of the diagnosis to a funded line. The issue summary and the meeting minutes both reflect that the approved decision was to add the diagnosis to a funded line, leave on the unfunded line, and not have a guideline. HERC staff are requesting clarification regarding whether VBBS/HERC intended polydactyly to only be included on the upper line, or be included on both lines. If on both lines, how are CCOs and HSD to determine when to cover treatment?

HERC staff recommendation s: Effective 1/1/2024: 1) Delete Line 647 AGENESIS OF LUNG Line: 647 be reprioritized as a treatment for spastic cerebral palsy? Question source : Drs. Siana and Williams, pediatric neurology, OHSU Issue : Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition that can result from various disease processes affecting the brain either during gestation or in early childhood. About 75% of patients with CP have lower limb spasticity (increased muscle tone and rigidity). Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR ) is a neurosurgical technique developed to reduce spasticity and improve mobility in children with CP and lower extremity spasticity. It involves the selective division of lumbosacral afferent (sensory) rootlets at the conus or at the intervertebral foram ina under intraoperative neurophysiological guidance. Early procedures were effective at reducing spasticity but were associated with significant morbidity; however, technical advancements have reduced the invasiveness of the procedure. Spastic diplegic c erebral palsy can also be treated with oral medication, orthotic devices, physiotherapy , botulinum intramuscular injections , corrective orthopedic procedures such a tendonotomy , electrical stimulation and continuous intrathecal cerebral palsy (ICD -10-CM G80.1) is the only on line 49 1 SPASTIC DIPLEGIA ; Treatment: RHIZOTOMY. The procedure is currently on 3 other lines that do not include spasticity diagnoses. OHSU pediatric neuro logy has requested a review of the lack of coverage for this procedure for spastic CP. CCO medical directors have indicated that this is a frequent exceptions request. HERC staff review of HSC and HERC minutes found no history of any discussion on rhizotom y or spastic diplegia. The pairing of spastic diplegic CP with dorsal rhizotomy has been in the unfunded region on all previous versions of the Prioritized List.

A meta -analysis of RCTs involving dorsal rhizotomy and physical therapy versus physical therapy confirmed reduced lower -limb spasticity and increased gross motor function (4.5%, P = .002). Observational studies reported statistically significant improvements in gross motor function over 2 years or less (12 studies, GRADE moderate) and over more than 2 years (10 studies, GRADE moderate) as well as improvements in functional independe nce in the short term (10 studies, GRADE moderate) and long term (4 studies, GRADE low). b. Major operative complications were infrequently reported (4 studies). Bony abnormalities and instabilities monitored radiologically in the spine (15 studies) and hip (8 studies) involved minimal or clinically insignificant changes after surgery. c. For children whose lower limb spasticity significantly limits motor development, dorsal rhizotomy effectively reduces spasticity and (with physical therapy) increases motor function and functional independence. Motor gains are related to level of disability. Less disabled children with some mobility are more likely to achieve motor skills like running or jumping. More disabled children generally gain skills like crawling, sittin g, or standing. Functional independence and caregiver burden also improve for many children after surgery. d. Major surgical complications are infrequent. 2) NICE 2006 , evidence review of selective dorsal rhizotomy for spasticity in cerebral pa lsy a. Effectiveness : i. A meta -analysis of three randomized controlled trials comparing selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) and physiotherapy with physiotherapy alone found that gross motor function improved by an additional 4% with SDR and physiotherapy than with physiotherapy al one ( i.e., an 8% over a 4% improvement respectively, p=0.008). The follow up period in the primary studies was between 9 and 12 months ii. In a non -randomized controlled trial of 61 patients undergoing SDR, botulinum toxin type A injection, or rehabilitation t herapy there were no significant differences in scores of walking speed in any of the three groups between baseline and 20 moths follow up. However, patients treated by SDR showed a transient but significant decrease in walking velocity at 3 months compare d to baseline iii. The gross motor performance measure of patients undergoing SDR was found to increase at 2 years of follow up (54.6 to 63.4 points) in a non - randomized controlled study. This was not significantly different to the improvement among patients h aving corrective orthopedic surgery (54.1 to 60.7 points) (p=0.751). Similarly, self-case score increased from 73.7 points to 84.1 points following SDR, and from 75.2 to 83.4 points with orthopedic surgery (p=0.932). iv. Case series studies have found that SDR reduced median muscle spasticity scores in abductor muscles from 2 to 0 points (Ashworth scale) in children with Cerebral Palsy categorized as walkers (p=0.007) and also from 2 to 0 points in children characterized as non -locomotors defined as non-walkers and non-Dorsal Rhizotomy for Spastic Cerebral 3 crawlers . (p=0.001) at 12 months follow up; and from 2.9 to 0.4 points in a mixed cohort of patients with spasticity at 4 years. v. 81% (169/208) of patients in a case series of children with Cerebral Palsy receiving SDR demonstrated improvement in ambulatory function at 1 year follow up b. Safety i. Case series studies have found that SDR reduced median muscle spasticity scores in abductor muscles from 2 to 0 points (Ashworth scale) in children with Cerebral Palsy categorized as walkers (p=0.007) and also from 2 to 0 points in children characterized as non -locomotors defined as non-walkers and non- crawlers . (p=0.001) at 12 months follow up; and from 2.9 to 0.4 points in a mixed cohort of patients with spasticity at 4 years. ii. Common bowel and bladder compli cations that were reported include constipation 20% in between 5% (13/250) and 10% (20/208) of patients. Other, less common but more serious complications reported include intra -operative bronchospasm in 5% (13/250) of patie nts undergoing SDR, and postoperative aspiration pneumonia at a rate of about 1% (2/208) and (3/250) c. Conclusion [updated in NICE 2010] : Current evidence on selective dorsal rhizotomy for spasticity in cerebral palsy shows that there is a risk of serious bu t well -recognized complications.

The operation consists of cutting of some of the nerves in the s pine that are res ponsible for muscle ri gidity Introduction This overview has been prepared to assi st members of the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee (IPAC) in making recommendations about the safety and efficacy of an intervent ional procedure. It is based on a rapid review of the medical literature an d specialist opinion. It should not be regarded as a definitive assessment of the procedure. Date prepared This overview was pr epared in February 2006. Procedure name Selective Paediatric Neurology Association British Orthopaedic Association Society of British Neurological Surgeons British Paediatric Neurosurgical Group Description Indications Cerebral Palsy is a condition that can result from various disease processes affecting the brain either during gestati on or in early childhood. About 75% of patients with Cerebral Palsy have lower limb spasticity (increased muscle 318 IP Overview: selective dorsal rhizotomy for cerebral palsy Page 2 of 18 tone and rigidity). Other symptoms may include movement or balance abnormalities, and speech, or visual difficulties Current treatment and alternatives Current conservative treatment options include oral medication, orthotic devices, physiotherapy. Botulinum Intramuscular injections may also be used. In other cases corrective orthopedic pr ocedures, such as a tendonotomy may be appropriate. Electrical stimulation and continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion are other treatment options. What the procedure involves Muscular tone (tension) is normally contro lled by nerve centres in the brain, however in patients with Cerebral Palsy such centre s may be affected. In such patients muscle tone greatly depends on a sensory-motor reflex arc between muscles and spinal cord nerves. This reflex involves sensory nerves bringing information from a muscle back to the spinal cord, and a motor nerve that goes back to the muscle, causing it to contract. The aim of selective dorsal rhizotomy is to down-regulate this spastic reflex by reducing sensory input. Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a surg ical procedure carried out under general anaesthesia to the lower area of the spi ne. The duration of the operation is about five hours During surgery, an incision is made along the lower back and a laminectomy in one or more vertebrae is made to uncover and test small nerve rootlets that make up the spinal sensory nerves. Us ually 3-5 rootlets are identified. Some rootlets fo und to have abnormal electromyographic responses are subsequently selectively cut. All motor nerve rootlets are preserved so leg movement is not affected . Intensive physiotherapy will be required for around three months to one year, as patient who was previously able to walk has to learn to walk again. Efficacy A meta analysis of three randomised cont rolled trials comparing selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) and physiother apy with physiotherapy alone found that gross motor function improved by an additional 4% with SDR and physiotherapy than with physiotherapy alone (i.e. an 8% over a 4% improvement respectively, p=0.008). The follow up period in the primary studies was between 9 and 12 months1. In a non-randomised controlled trial of 61 patients undergoing SDR, botulinum toxin type A injection, or rehabilitation therapy t here were no significant differences in scores of walking s peed in any of the three groups between baseline and 20 moths follow up. Howe ver, patients treated by SDR showed a transient but significant decrease in walking velocity at 3 months compared to baseline 2. The gross motor performance meas ure of patients undergoing SDR was found to increase at 2 y ears of follow up (54.6 to 63.4 points) in a non-318 IP Overview: selective dorsal rhizotomy for cerebral palsy Page 3 of 18 randomised controlled study. This was not significantly different to the improvement among patients having corre ctive orthopaedic surgery (54.1 to 60.7 points) (p=0.751). Similarly, self ca se score increased from 73.7 points to 84.1 points following SDR, and from 75. 2 to 83.4 points with orthopaedic surgery (p=0.932)3. Case series studies have found that SDR reduced median muscle spasticity scores in abductor muscles from 2 to 0 points (Ashworth scale) in children with Cerebral Palsy categorised as walkers (p=0.007) and also from 2 to 0 points in children characterised as non-locomotors defined as non walkers and non crawlers. (p=0.001) at 12 months follow up 4; and from 2.9 to 0.4 points in a mixed cohort of pati ents with spasticity at 4 years5. 81% (169/208) of patients in a case seri es of children with Cerebral Palsy receiving SDR demonstrat ed improvement in ambulat ory function at 1 year follow up5.. Safety Neither the meta analysis of 3 random ised controlled trials, nor the non- randomised controlled trials report on S DR safety outcomes. Therefore, there are no comparative data available from the studies included in this overview to consider the safety profile of SDR against that of othe r therapeutic options for spasticity. A case series of 250 patients under going SDR (mean patient age of 5.9 years, follow up of at least 2 years in 49 patients) found t hat 58% (145/250) of patients suffered severe postoperativ e pain and 40 % (100/250) complained of dysesthesia 6 Common bowel and bladder complicati ons that were reported include constipation 20% (49/250)6, retention in between 5% (13/250)6 and 10% (20/208)5 of patients. Other, less common but more serious complications reported include intra-oper ative bronchospasm in 5% (13/250)6 of patients undergoing SDR, and postoperative aspiration pneumonia at a rate of about 1% (2/208)5 and (3/250)6. Radiologically observed scoliosis wa s found in 6% (12/208) of patients followed up to 4.2 years although this was not considered to be functionally important 5. Periods of increased spasticity dur ing times of increased stress at months or years after surgery have been reported in 45 ( 10/250) of patients undergoing SDR in one case series6 Literature review Rapid review of literature The medical literature was searched to identify studies and reviews relevant to selective dorsal rhizotomy for cerebr al palsy. Searches were conducted via the following databases, covering the period from their commencement to 06/02/02; Medline, PreM edline, EMBASE, Cochr IP Overview: selective dorsal rhizotomy for cerebral palsy Page 4 of 18 databases. Trial registries and the Internet were also searched. No language restriction was applied to the searches. (See Appendix C for details of search strategy.) The following selection criteria ( Table 1 ) were applied to the abstracts identified by the literat ure search. Where these criteria could not be determined from the abstracts the full paper was retrieved. Table 1 Inclusion criteria for id entification of re levant studies Characteristic Criteria Publication type Clinical studies were in cluded. Emphasis was placed on identifying good quality studies. Abstracts were excluded where no clinical outcomes were reported, or where the paper was a review, editorial, laboratory or animal study. Conference abstracts were also ex cluded because of the difficulty of appraising methodology. Patient Patients with cerebral palsy Intervention/test Selective dorsal rhizotomy Outcome Articles were retrieved if the abstract contained information relevant to the safety and/or efficacy. Language Non-English-language articles were excluded unless they were thought to add substantively to t he English-language evidence base. List of studies included in the overview This overview is based on one meta anlaysis of 3 randomised controlled trials1, two non randomised controlled trials 2,3and 2 case series (3 publications5,4,6. Other studies that were considered to be relevant to the procedure but were not included in the main extraction table (Table 2) have been listed in Appendix A. For case series studies, t he sample size cut off for inclusion was 200 cases or more. All meta-analyses, RCT's other than those already included in the reviewed meta-analysis, and other controlled trials identified are described in Table 2. Existing reviews on this procedure There were no published reviews identified at the time of the literature search. A Cochrane protocol for selective dor sal rhizotomy in the management of children with spastic cerebral pal sy has been published with the review expected to be published in the autumn of 2006 http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.co m/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD003360/f rame.html Related NICE guidance Below is a list of NICE guidance related to this procedure.

Mean age = 5.5 years, Male =53%, gestational age =31.7 weeks, birth weight =1,849g, prenatal cause of CP = 87% (78/90), baseline GMFM score = 62.5, non-ambulatory = 57%. Follow-up = all patients followed up to either 9 or 12 months Disclosure of interest: Funding provided by a foundation Operative parameters There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between the baseline GMFM-66 score and the percent of dorsal rootlets cut (p=0.0002). This was independent of study site. Clinical outcomes A weak inverse correlation was found between the percent of dorsal root tissue cut and change in Ashworth spasticity score (p=0.03) and GMFM score (p<0.001). A small but statistically sign ificant benefit of SDR and physiotherapy over physiotherapy was found. GMFM scores improved by 4% in the control groups and 8% in the SDR groups (data read from figure) (p=0.008). It is not clear whether this benefit is clinically important. No safety data from the primary studies is presented. Primary researcher was also the author of one of the studies included, allowing for analysis of unpublished raw data, and ability to recalculate variables, but potential subjectivity. Follow-up limited to 12 months (2 studies) and 9 months (1 study) Medline, Cochrane and meeting abstracts searched for RCTs up to December 2000. No further details of search strategy provided. Multiple regression undertaken to assess factors of treatment group, study site, age, sex, birth weight, ambulatory status, and baseline clinical scores. In one study less dorsal root tissue was transected (25%) than at the other two studies (41% and 45%). Functional GFMF outcome scores were assessed blindly in all patients Method for data pooling used - blocked Wilcoxon's test.

However this score recovered at 6 months and was better than baseline at 12 and 20 months follow up (not a significant difference). During the study period SDR treatment costs were paid for by insurance while BTA was not. No between groups analysis was performed (only within groups). Outcomes assessed by a computer assisted gait analysis system.

Complications Incidence Pulmonary Intraoperative bronchospasm 5% (13/250) Aspiration temperature loss 1% (2/250) Two of the 3 patients with pneumonia required artificial ventilation. In addition 2 patients had lung segment or lobe collapse intraoperatively leading to the abandonment of the procedure. One patient with urinary retention remained on a catherarisation programme at 18 months follow up. Authors suggest that children with a history suggesting spastic bladder are at greatest risk of this complication Increased spasticity during periods of increased stress (illness anxiety) occurred in 4% (10/250) of patients months or years after surgery. All these patients were spastic quadriplegics at baseline 2% (6/250) of patients have undergone osteotomies of the femur for progressive hip dislocation. All these children were crawling at baseline.

The most common postoperative discomfort was back pain that was experienced by all patients Radiologicaly observed scoliosis occurred in 9% (5/58) of patients who had laminectomy, and 2% (2/150) who had laminoplasty. Retrospective study No value for degree of certainty of statistical results are given for most outcomes. Long standing spasticity in older children resulted in more severe musculoskeletal contracture which was more difficult to correct with SDR. Authors state that other causes other than spasticity can influence child ambulation Post operative physiotherapy regimen (if any) is not described. 318 Validity and generalisability of the studies Improvement in physiological out come may be poor predictors of functional improvement. Converse ly even a small improvement of a physiological measurement may impact disproportionally on disability or caring requirements. Some studies do not report on ability to walk, which is probably the most important efficacy outcome. There is no evidence about the quality of life impact of the operation, either on patients or carers / family members. Significant variation in operative procedure, includ ing the extent of nerve testing before rhizotomy. Selection criteria for study entry varied between studies. It could be expected that patients with more seve re spasticity at baseline are not going to report as favourable outcomes as less impaired children. The studies included in the overview do not allow for the effect of age on outcome to be considered. Specialist advisors' opinions Specialist advice was sought from consultants who hav e been nominated or ratified by their Specialist Society or Royal College. Dr G Cole, Dr A Roberts, Mr M Vloeber ghs, Mr M Carter, Mr N Buxton, Dr M Clarke All but one of the advisors cons idered SDR to be an established procedure. The potential benefits of SDR are reduc tions in pain, improved functional outcomes through greater motor abili ty and reduced spasticity, and fewer corrective orthopaedic procedures. Adverse events that have been r eported with this procedure include Bladder and bowel disturbances, limb weakness, joint subluxations, progressive scoliosis or kyphosis, and sensory disturbance. Additionally the following complicat ions are theoretically possible; paralysis, dividing the wrong nerve rootlets, death, hypotonicity, and weight gain Standard outcome measures are lacki ng but audit criteria might include paediatric quality of life, gross motor function measurement, reduction in spasticity, perioperative morbidity, scoliosis, and sphincter function problems. A number of advisors commented that there is some controversy as to where SDR sits among other managem ent options for spasticity in cerebral palsy. It has been commented that a reducti on in spasticity does not always result in improved motor function. SDR is an irreversible procedur e with long term outcomes not well researched. IP Overview: selective dorsal rhizotomy for cerebral palsy Page 11 of 18 318 The most useful comparator woul d be continuous infusion with a baclofen pump, although this is not yet established for long term use. Few surgeons are currently experienc ed in this procedure in the UK, and the potential diffusion of SDR is like ly to be to 10 or fewer specialist centres. Standard microsurgery facilities are required, and intraoperative spinal cord electrophysiology monitoring may be required, although there is some disagreement between advisors on the merits of this. Patient selection for this proced ure is not well und erstood, and patient work up through a multidisciplinary team is seen as essential. Issues for consideration by IPAC Many studies were available, and the majority were only detailed in appendix A. Many studies are 10-20 years ol d, suggesting the procedure may be established in other parts of the world.

The evidence on efficacy is adequate. Therefore this procedure ma y be used pro vided that normal arr angements are in place for clinical go vernance and audit. 1.2 During the consent process parents or carers should be informed that selectiv e dorsal rhizotom y for spasticity in cerebr al palsy is irre versible, and that patients may experience deterior ation in walking ability or bladder function, and later complications including spinal deformity . The y should understand that prolonged ph ysiother apy and aftercare will be required and that additional surgery ma y be necessary . 1.3 Patient selection and treatment should be carried out b y a multidisciplinary team with specialist tr aining and e xpertise in the care of spasticity in patients with cerebr al palsy , and with access to the full r ange of treatment options. This team would normally include a ph ysiother apist, a paediatrician and surgeons, all with specific tr aining and e xpertise. 1.4 NICE encour ages further research into this procedure. L ong-term outcomes are encour aged. Outcome measures should include: the incidence of neurological impairment and spinal deformity; the need for additional oper ations; and assessments of disability , social inclusion, and quality of life. 22 The procedureThe procedure 2.1 Indications and curr ent tr eatments 2.1.1 Cerebr al palsy encompasses different br ain disorders originating during fetal development, birth or early childhood. It is associated with abnormalities of movement, balance and posture, language and vision. L ower limb spasticity affects 80% of people with cerebr al palsy . This can impair walking and sitting, and can cause discomfort, cr amps and spasms.Selectiv e dorsal rhizotom y for spasticity in cerebr al palsy (IPG373) \u00a9 NICE 2018. All rights reserv ed. Subject to Notice of rights (https:/ /www .nice.org.uk/terms-and- conditions#notice-of-rights).Page 2 of 72.1.2 Current treatments include or al muscle relaxant medication, orthotic de vices, physiother apy, and repeated intr amuscular injections of botulinum to xin. Surgical procedures include tendonotom y, tendon lengthening, peripher al neurotom y, osteotom y, electrical stimulation of the muscles or dorsal spinal cord, and continuous intr athecal baclofen infusion. 2.2 Outline of the pr ocedur e 2.2.1 The aim of selectiv e dorsal rhizotom y is to achie ve a long-term reduction in sensory input to the sensory-motor refle x arcs responsible for increased muscle tone, b y dividing some of the lumbar sensory nerv e roots. 2.2.2 With the patient under gener al anaesthesia, a laminectom y of one or more vertebr ae is performed to e xpose the dur al sac, which is opened to displa y the spinal conus with or without the cauda equina. Intr aoper ativ e neuroph ysiological assessment is commonly used to identify the sensory nerv e rootlets judged to be most responsible for the e xcess motor tone. Selected sensory rootlets are divided, preserving some sensory supply and the motor roots responsible for v oluntary mo vements. 2.2.3 Intensiv e ph ysiother apy and aftercare is usually giv en for se veral months after the procedure. P atients who were pre viously able to walk ma y ha ve to learn different walking skills. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published liter ature that the Committee considered as part of the e vidence about this procedure.

The percentage of patients with scoliosis pre-oper ativ ely was not stated. Case series of 105, 98 and 30 patients reported scoliosis of 10\u00b0 or more in 55% at 4.3 y ears, in 43% at 5.8 years, and scoliosis of less than 35\u00b0 in 50% at 21.4 y ears respectiv ely. 2.4.2 In a case series of 61 patients, 4 patients de veloped spondylolysis and gr ade-I spondylolisthesis between 3 and 5 y ears after the procedure. 2.4.3 Urinary retention due to decreased bladder tone and h yporefle xia was reported in 10% (20/208) of patients in the case series of 208 patients. This resolv ed spontaneously within 4 weeks in 18 patients but 2 patients had long term urinary incontinence because of atonic bladder . 2.4.4 The Specialist Advisers considered theoretical adv erse e vents to include death, worsening motor function and/or par aplegia, wound infection, meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, dislocation of the hip(s), back pain, constipation, weakness, chronic pain, and late ar achnoiditis and/or syringom yelia.Selectiv e dorsal palsy (IPG373) \u00a9 NICE 2018.

The Committee also noted that this procedure and patient selection for it are still e volving. Se veral commentators recommend limited laminectom y to reduce the risk of late spinal deformity , and others question the need neuroph ysiology . 33 FFurther informationurther 3.1 For related NICE guidance see our website .
