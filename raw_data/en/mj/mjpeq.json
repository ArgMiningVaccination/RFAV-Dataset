Onelate Friday afternoon, Iinterviewed Barbara, a woman inherlate 30's who hadrecently undergone bilaterial prophylactic mastectomies. Barbara have cancer nordid she have afamily history ofcancer. However, she had been diagnosed with several risk factors forbreast cancer. After the end ofthe interview, Iasked Barbara how shefelt about hersurgery. She broke down in tears andexplained that she had had noidea howterrible itwould feel her meand Ibegan towonder what kind ofmedicine was being practiced when surgery was performed onwomen who did not have cancer. Shortly after myinterview with Barbara, the case ofayoung woman waspresented atabreast conference. Molly was 26 years old and had alate stage breast cancer. The cancer had spread to herspine andherx-rays looked asifshot gunpellets had been shot through them. After the impersonal facts ofher case had been presented, allconference participants (12 intotal) went into the examining room toexamine \"the case\". Molly sat onthehard examining table, inthecorner. Her surgeon introduced thegroup ofpractitioners toMolly and then proceeded to examine her. Molly's affected breast was hard andswollen and she flinched inpain asfingers poked andprodded. After the the practitioners room instunned A\u00ba awoman without cancer, have both breasts removed asa precaution? And how could Molly, awoman with norisk factors with tothese anysimple solutions toprevent these tragic events from reoccurring. However, I believe that agreater understanding ofthe dilemmas that both clinicians and women face canlead tomore aresponsible practice of medicine and can empower women totake greater control over their own health. Iwould like tothank all the woman who shared with metheir experiences concerning their breast health. Ihope that my interpretations oftheir experiences will help women andclinicians make \"good\" decisions about breast health. Onamore personal level, I Ihave learned much about thecourage ittakes when one isfaced with thetragic possibility ofanearly death. Mylife has been made richer through those who shared these experiences with me. Iamgrateful tothesurgeons andother medical practitioners who agreed toshare with methe dilemmas they face when managing women with risk factors forbreast cancer. Ibelieve that each practitioner who I interviewed cared deeply about his orherpatients and each inhis/her own way, believed that he/she was making thebest clinical decisions possible. Ihope that bysharing some ofthe dilemmas that iii * *these clinicians face andtheir personal feelings about these difficult situations, steps can betaken tohelp medical practitioners cope more adequately with theuncertainties oftheir profession.

Using ahermeneutic approach, fieldwork was conducted over aone and ahalf year period intwolarge hospitals in California. The ofthefieldwork was toexplore howclinicians, whospecialized inbreast health, diagnosed andtreated women whom they believed were \"atrisk\" forbreast cancer, and how women experienced being diagnosed as\"being atrisk\". Thefindings presented inthis study support the argument that concept ofrisk iscoming toplay acentral and powerful role inthe practice epidemiologic gives dimension ofrisk, thedoctor's ownpersonal risk of making awrong diagnosis. Arising from these twodimensions, a fundamental shift inmeaning takes place andepidemiologic risk becomes understood, spoken about andtreated asadisease ofanindividual.Within this context, clinicians diagnose andtreat risk inthe same way they diagnose andtreat other diseases. Removal ofrisk iscarried out through theprescription ofdrugs, biopsies and intheextreme case, through prophylactic mastectomy. However, may be successful inremoving her orhis ownrisk ofmaking awrong diagnosis, treatment does not remove awoman's risk factors for breast cancer. For women, being atrisk represents anewstate ofillness, andbeing diagnosed with risk factors often leads togreater medical surviellance and intervention.

Those ofuswho arehealth professionals have become quite comfortable with the language aswemeasure it,estimate and uses oftheconcept ofrisk. How is risk understood asused within epidemiology and how might itbe differently understood inpreventive medicine? How donon-health professionals understand concepts How experience being diagnosed as\"being atrisk\" oras\"having risk factors\"? This dissertation explores the meaning and use oftheconcept of risk asitapplies tobenign breast disease andbreast cancer. The isonunderstanding how theconcept ofrisk comes totake on multiple meanings; meanings that express scientific, clinical and lay uncertainties surrounding theprevention, diagnosis andprognosis of breast conditions. Like most chronic non-infectious diseases, the cause ofbreast cancer remains unknown. And, indeed, itislikely that nosingle cause ofthedisease will ever beisolated. Instead, notions ofcause may bemore appropriately thought about within alanguage that speaks about multiple risk factors that appear tobeassociated with theincidence andprevalence ofthedisease. Here wefind non-infectious diseases ingeneral andabout breast cancer in particular. Because medical scientists have been unable toisolate the cause (s)ofbreast cancer, there exists nomethod ofpreventing the disease short ofremoving thebreasts. Thus, themajor focus has been directed towards developing technologies that canaid inearly detection andtreatment. Efforts within epidemiology have been directed towards defining risk factors for thedisease, thus enabling those inpublic health andpreventive medicine toidentify, screen and follow women who have been diagnosed ashaving one ormore ofthe identified risk factors. However, identification ofrisk factors does notguarantee that awoman will develop thedisease and infact, many women who donot have any oftheidentified risk factors develop breast cancer. The problems surrounding themeaning ofrisk factors, coupled with theoften ambiguous meanings concerning theclinical relevance of pathological andradiologic findings, act toproduce much uncertainty Onthepart ofclinicians who must diagnose andtreat women with breast conditions. For awoman, being diagnosed ashaving one ormore risk factors illness. Inthis research, and years exploring how clinicians, whospecialized inbreast health, diagnosed andtreated*-i- .women whom they believed tobe\"atrisk\" forbreast cancer. Atthe same time, Iexplored how women experienced being diagnosed bytheir doctors as\"being atrisk\" fordeveloping breast cancer. Based upon this fieldwork, Iargue that the concept ofrisk represents the cultural creation ofanewcategory ofhealth andillness; aliminal state ofbeing that forclinicians, women, being atrisk represents anexperienced state ofbeing that isbetween health andillness. Using risk, benign breast disease and breast cancer asacase diagnosed with abenign condition andwomen's experiences ofbeing diagnosed with breast cancer. Chapter 6is concerned understanding ofthe might beunderstood, intheanthropological sense, as aculture-bound illness and howinsights, derived from this study of risk andbreast conditions, might beapplied toother non-infectious diseases.CHAPTER 2: that meaning isinuse, butitisequally true that useis influx. Perhaps itiseven such action that itwill resist anyattempts tocatch andconsequent uncertainties indisease prevention and management arebecoming increasingly common (Fox 1980). In part, these problems stem from inadequate knowledge ofthenatural history ofthe many non-infectious diseases andtorapid increases inthe production ofscientific andmedical technology. While technological advances have enabled ustoextend our knowledge ofthe human body andtomore precisely detect minute changes in Physiologic states, ourunderstanding ofwhat these changes mean lags behind. orbiochemical may take onmore than onemeaning realm, (1979:289) While ambiguity within thescientific realm pushes thefrontiersofknowledge into new andchallenging directions, ambiguity within the clinical context often results inuncertainty andfrustration. The practitioner isfaced with translating knowledge into practice andsince knowledge isoften incomplete, itbecomes transformed into akind of clinical uncertainty. Scientific ambiguity, which describes astate of knowledge, becomes transformed into clinical uncertainty inthe application ofknowledge. This research explores scientific ambiguity within thecontext of scientific, clinical andpopular understandings about themeaning and management \"dis\" meaning apart, andthe word itself from the French term meaning \"want ofease\" (Skeat l980). Benign breast disease then describes that isa\"good dis-ease\". The term describes andharmful atthe same time. Thus, thevery meaning ofthis physical condition is fraught with ambiguity. Iargue that theterm more clearly describes thestate ofmedical scientific understanding knowledge andpractice than the\"reality\" ofthephysical condition itself. That is,there exists an inherent ambiguity inthecurrent medical scientific thinking where certain pathologic changes inthebreast areunderstood tobeboth normal andabnormal atthe same dis-ease anduncertainty inthesense that itisdifficult for theclinician totranslate ambiguous scientific understanding into clinical knowledge andpractice. Thus, benign breast disease represents a particularly vivid example ofamedical dilemma where ambiguity inthe understanding ofthe meaning ofphysical changes Inthis Iwill ofthis research. Second, philosophical assumptions that guide the way inwhich Ihave defined and explored theresearch problem. Third, Ishall discuss therationale behind mymethodological approach anddescribe theresearch setting and participants. Andfinally, Iwill discuss specific methods andtheanalysis ofthedata. 2.2 CONCEPTS OFAMBIGUITY AND UNCERTAINTY: Theconcepts ambiguity anduncertainty been used both inthe medical andsocial science literature toloosely describe various used these twoterms interchangeability but soon found that such uncritical usage became problematic. Forexample, even when the meaning ofaphysical condition isclear, there canstill remain much clinical uncertainty as totheappropriate kind ofmanagement. Forexample, even when the pathological diagnosis ofcancer can beclearly clinical clinician Inbreast tothicken up. uncertainty lies inthechoice example where the meaning ofthedisease isclear but where there exists clinical uncertainty isinprognosis. Thelonger I've been atthis specialty, theless certain I've become ofmyability toprognosticate because I've been fooled so many times. The outcome depends upon allkinds offactors. How extensive the tumor is, howaggressive looking itisunder the microscope, howresponsive itistotheapplied therapy andwhat ever innate patterns there are oftheparticular every cancer isindividual. Andevery individual butalso of for thefollowing statements Well, Ifrankly have notbeen involved intoo many cases inthe grey zone. I've got some just short ofcancer butI've been taken off the hook because thepathologist hasn't quite given itthe name cancer and soI've treated itbylocal means.

Ihad onepatient ofmine last month, shealmost had some invasive cancer. They talked about itforthree weeks, thepathologists. But they finally allagreed that there was noinvasive cancer. What emerges from these above statements isakind ofclinical uncertainty arising from afundamental ambiguity inthe meaning ofa pathological condition. This ambiguity becomes inthe were made are really incorrect. Sowhat Iseemyself doing isreally defining it toemerge isaproblem ofinterpretation meaning. That is,clinical uncertainty stems from what isunknown orfrom what is ambiguous.

Andthere are some reports that anincreased cancer inthat group ofpatients. single breast forundue alarm. need tobe followed closely, doself exams, getregular exams andthey need a higher index ofsuspicion simply because they're harder toexamine. Here, benign changes areunderstood tobeboth normal andabnormal at the same time. Thefirst the not beoverly concerned about fibrocystic breasts, they must beexamine regularly. And here, ifwelook deeper into thelast statement, wefind, that thecause ofconcern hisuncertainty about significance ofambiguous Ambiguity anduncertainty then, describe twodimensions ofbenign breast conditions; scientific understandings about themeaning ofthe condition and theclinical dimensions about how totranslate those ambiguous meanings into practice. Inthis dissertation, uncertainty refers primarily tothedimensions ofclinical practice while ambiguity refers todimensions ofmeaning. Myuseofthese concepts becomes clearer when weexamine their etymological roots. Ambiguous derive from Latin roots meaning driving about. Theprefix ambi means onboth sides, related toboth. The dictionary asmeaning, \"towander undetermined, unfixed, unsettled, undistinguished, unresolved, themeanings ofthe twoconcepts ambiguous anduncertainty orpractice inrelationship toambiguous meanings. Ambiguity anduncertainty describe different types of relationships between aphysical condition anditsinterpretation. And these relationships ultimately areexpressed inthedialectics research, theexploration ofthe relationships knowledge is carried out though thediscourse ofsocial science. Butitmust be pointed outthat social science discourse isnotfree ofambiguity or totranspose statements from the language ofsocial science into the realm ofhuman action, then werun the risk ofimposing would belaid limp, lowly raped bythedominating forces ofcertainty. What was meant asatender kiss becomes adeadly throat bite. (1979:292-3) \u2014ll2.2a Research Questions: Thespecific questions guiding this research are asfollows: l. What isthe meaning ofbenign breast disease for: a. scientists b. clinicians c. laywomen 2. What istherelationship between knowledge andpractice inthe management ofbenign breast disease? 3. Howisknowledge transmitted and/or transformed inspoken discourse between medical scientists, clinicians and laywomen? Thus, thesubject ofthis research concerns scientific, clinical and popular understandings andpractices surrounding breast health. 2.3 PHILOSOPHICAL ORIENTATIONS: Because the problems that theresearch questions explore concern the creation ofknowledge andthetranslation andapplication ofmeaning, I have chosen themethodological approach system ofinquiry well suited ofinquiry. dichotomy (objective) methodologies isafalse oneas both aredependent upon methods which theresearcher chooses (Feyerabend 1975). These theories andmethods are inturn, dependent upon theresearcher's philosophical orientations. This assumption states that they way inwhich research problems aredefined, where bythe world view oftheinvestigator. Even inpure survey research, where responses arequantified and grouped into patterns ofrelationships, itistheresearcher who must bring meaning tothe numbers. Thedata cannotspeak forthemselves; there must always oftheindividual investigator aswell astheinquiry system used toconceptualize theproblem. Different investigators and different systems ofinquiry will generate different interpretations ofa given problem andwill result indifferent kinds ofbias but noone mode can bejudged asinherently more bias free than another. No oneparticular suited ofproblems where itispossible and shall review these orientations inorder thecontext from which myownresearch emerges. 2.3a Much ofthe focus anthropology isdirected towards understanding culture interms ofsystems ofmeaning. The aim of inquiry within this tradition isnottogenerate universal laws about the nature ofhuman behavior butrather tounderstand theprocesses bywhich humans give meaning Cultural Thegoal ofanthropological understanding isto describe symbolic systems asthey aremanifested through social discourse. Theassumption that all human social action isimbedded inwebs of meaning gives rise toabasic paradox: howisonetoobtain an \"objective\" reading ofmeaning when that reading isitself embedded within socially constructed meanings? How doweunderstand how meaning means? How dowecreate byapriori todeal The fundamental problem which Husserl addresses concerns therelationship between consciousness andobjective ofthe world. The then discover the essential nature or\"essence\" ofthe phenomena (Linge 1976). Husserl's aim istoreveal something which ispregiven, something that precedes cultural experience. Heargues that theultimate foundation suspending functioning oftheconsciousness. Through this process ofsuspending the everyday taken-for-granted horizons of lived meanings, the phenomena can bereduced totheir fundamental essences (Husserl 1960). Two major problems phenomenological investigations. Thefirst concerns thetransition from theprivate world ofthe into aworld reduction without essences (for humans) -15donotexist. Addressing thefirst problem, that oftherelationship between ego andtheworld oftheintersubjective other, Alfred Schutz attempts areformulation oftheintersubjective social 1970). Combining Schutz argues that theprimacy human experience ofthewe-relationship. Other isgiven without question and isaprecondition ofall experience. Schutz does not deny subjective experience butrather suggests that theconstitution ofthesubjective self arises first from theintersubjective world. Within thecultural situation. Within negotiation social reality, theactor must always presuppose ego and anintersubjective world becomes irrelevant asbeing isfirst and intersubjectivity, with bridging the gap between thefamiliar world and themeanings which are beyond thehorizons oftheeveryday world. The interpretation ofhermeneutics asgiven byGadamer hasbeen most influential within American anthropology. Gadamer ofphenomenology with hermeneutics, argues that theunderstanding ofanevent isnotreconstruction thetext. Heclaims that itisourprejudgements based upon theideal ofunprejudiced objectivity Thus, hermeneutical understanding calls for reflection: before hermeneutics requires that within a **in theinterpreter must ofher/his historicality. Hermeneutic understanding becomes illuminated through thedynamic never ending dance of i- - - -*erpretation between theinterpreter and thetextual thepeople within adynamic interacting framework, aframework that produces understandings which are always open toreinterpretation. As Michael Agar argues: ...anincreased forthepeople that constitute that group, andconversely. (1980:254) Incorporating this orientation into the American tradition, Rabinow andSullivan (1979: 65) argue that anunderstanding ofhuman framework iscritically orcategories defined inrelation toeach Rather world ascomposed ofacircle ofmeaning outside ofwhich emphasized this primacy ofcontext. Heargues that weneed togo beyond empirical science based upon verification tothebounds of common meanings which are embedded within social reality. A hermeneutical science not founded upon brute data butrather upon readings ofmeanings, readings which are inpart constituted by self-definitions, would hermeneutical the thegeneration ofmeaning isaprocess which isalways incomplete and inwhich ofthe and given acultural framework. Culture, conceived assystems ofmeanings, has amajor influence upon the ways inwhich understood andexperienced. Biological realities ofunderlying pathological conditions aregiven individual meaning when culturally interpreted. Good Good argue that: Human illness becomes ahuman experience only asitis apprehended, interpreted, evaluated and communicated -that is, asit enters theworld ofhuman meaning anddiscourse. (Good Good This approach, bywhich sickness phenomena areviewed as fundamentally semantic, has been used byboth medical historians and philosophers tounderstand theevolution ofmedical thinking andpractice (Eisenberg lo'77, Engel 1977, Engelhardt 1975, Foucault 1973, King 1982, Reiser 1978). Ameaning centered approach hasbeen taken bymedical cultural meanings ofpopular andmedical discourse. Within this framework, several studies have explored scientific medical andclinical knowledge anditstranslation into practice. The scientific andclinical modes ofknowing can bebest understood asacts of cultural interpretation given order andmeaning tobiological chagnes within the body. Biomedical orclinician's \"objective\" Rawlinson 1982, Treacher andWright 1982, Young l978). This meaning centered approach ahsalso been utilized for understanding popular models ofsickness andforexploring differences between these andbiomedical models. These studies have pointed toa basic distinction between popular andbiomedical ways ofexperiencing sickness. Comparisons are made between biomedical discourse body whereas illness discourse refers tothepersonal, interpersonal, cultural experiences of disease (Engel 1977, Fabrega 1972, Kleinman, Eisenberg and Good l978). This approach hasbeen instrumental toward understanding problems in doctor-patient negotiations inthediagnosis, treatment andprognosis of sockness (Good lo'77, Kleinman, Eisenberg and Good l978). This approach hasalso given rise toconsiderable interest concerning phenomenological -20understandings ofillness experiences 1982, 1982, 1982). The anduncertainty intheunderstanding and treatment ofdisease and illness iscommon toboth the medical and social science literature. However, fewanthropological studies have explored in depth the meanings ofthis ambiguous discourse anditstranslation into uncertain practice. Rosser and Maguire (1982) have explored problems that thegeneral practitioner faces inthecare ofcancer patients. They argue that these problems flow from clinical uncertainties concerning etiology andtreatment. Comaroff andMaguire (1981) have explored the dilemmas facing both clinicians andparents inthesearch forknowledge about childhood leukemia. They argue that gains inmedical knowledge and technology often serve tohighlight theremaining uncertainties inthe search for meaning andpredictability: Observation. ...revealed beseen asambiguous ina double sense: the more itappears tocontrol, the more threatening is the domain where knowledge isstill lacking; andthe more it controls, the more alienated the layman himself from control over its effects. (Comaroff andMaguire 1981:l) Rosser (1981) hasexplored the problem experiences ofbreast cancer. After reviewing theliterature cerning women's reactions sheconcludes that mostarti cles have toaddress uncertainty Iusethe asdistinct method, tothe guiding context-dependent andarechosen ofspecific within which aparticular mode ofinquiry istobe carried out. Thecentral problem which this study explores concerns the relationship between ambiguous knowledge anduncertain practice. A qualitative methodology ismost suited tothis type ofinquiry. AsIhave argued, all \"facts\" aredetermined by thetheories and methods that create them. Quantitative aswell as qualitative methodologies arise outofthesubjective ofmethodology can beconsidered tobeinherently more biased than another. Data must then beinterpreted orgiven meaning and this process is,again, embedded that agiven system of inquiry measures what itissupposed tomeasure. Qualitative research is often criticized onthegrounds that if\"reality\" isnot\"objectively\" apprehended, then itisdifficult todetermine whether theresearch findings can beyond thestudy group and beyond the research's owninterpretations ofthedata. With qualitative research, how can webesure generated bytheresearcher are comparable totheinterpretations ofthose hasargued argues that anyinformation isvalid Singerian which areill-defined, dynamic andcomplex. They require aneclectic methodology. Validity in this system ofinquiry isenhanced byincluded asmuch possible relevant data from allrelevant bear upon all dimensions oftheproblem (Ratcliffe l980:15). Insuch validity about, anduncertainty isforever changing dilemmas arising inother contexts? This question forces ustoaskanother more fundamental question, a question concerning theethical dimensions ofinquiry. That is,whose ends arebeing served bytheinquiry process andproduct? Howwell this research serve these ends? This research isaimed atserving four different parties, myself, medical anthropologists, medical professionals, and laywomen. Thegoal oftheresearch istoincrease understandings within andbetween each ofthese aimtocreate better forms ofmedical knowledge andpractice. Theextent towhich this research serves these ends will inpart, determine itsvalidity. This introduces several problems inthat validity cannot beassessed until those whose ends this inquiry aretoserve, read andreact tothe research. Butaside from waiting forresponses from these parties, there arefour methods bywhich Ihave assessed validity during theresearch process. ways toassess this mode of ofthis arose on alarge case-control project exploring therisk factors of benign breast disease andbreast cancer. Myrole wastoconduct formal structured interviews with women who were assigned tothree separate groups; twogroups ofcases being women diagnosed with benign breast conditions andthose diagnosed with breast cancer and acontrol group of women who never had abreast biopsy. After finishing theinterview I would teach women how todoabreast self exam and then wewould often chat informally about thekinds ofquestions they hadabout their breast health. Often without myproving they would raise many oftheissues which form thequestions ofthis research. Iwould then ask them to explain inmore depth their concerns andwhat they thought could bedone about the problems they raised. Thequestions andissues raised bywomen this context formed thebasis research andIcontinued upon these the direction ofmyinquiry. Thefollowing quotes illustrate thekinds of issues women raised. These quotes were collected within thefirst few weeks ofmyinvolvement asaninterviewer intheepidemiology project know, Idon't disease. Youshould change thewording. totheambiguities inepidemiological and medical thinking about benign breast conditions. Ielicited the second statement from awoman when, upon completing You know, the way Igot totheBreast Screening Clinic was through Planned Parenthood. Iwent there forbirth control pills and they referred metotheBreast Screening Clinic. Ichose tohave the lump removed instead of... needle aspirated. When Iwent back to Planned Parenthood with myclean bill ofhealth, the nurse told me, \"You know, Iwasflabbergasted! Theydidn't Itsfrustrating, nobody causes it(breast cancer) so you have nocontrol! Atthe same time, Ibecame aware ofthecontroversy andconfusion that existed within medicine andepidemiology concerning themeaning of benign breast conditions. Anarticle appeared inthe New England Journal ofMedicine inJanuary 1982, that summed upthis controversy (Love etal., 1982). The authors pointed outthat valid histological criteria defining benign conditions asadistinct process did notexist and microscopic differences between the normal breast and those clinically defined asfibrocystic were ones ofdegree and not of quality. They argued that thedistinction between normal physiologic changes andclinical disease were dependent upon awoman's age, etal., oftheresearch confirmed when I began tocall clinical practitioners toarrange interviews with them. When Ifirst contacted them, Iexplained that Iwasinterested in talking tothem about oftheproblems invoved inthediagnosis of breast conditions. Onedoctor forcefully replied: I'll tell you what the problem is. Nobody knows what thehell they're talking about! Thevalidity oftheproblem within epidemiology became apparent in theliterature concerning risk factors associated with benign breast disease andbreast cancer. There ismuch controversy astowhether the risk factors forbenign breast conditions are the same asthose for breast cancer. Until recently, ithas been assumed that women diagnosed with benign breast conditions were athigher risk for developing breast cancer. However, this assumption isbeing questioned onthegrounds that itisunclear astojust what benign changes mean. applied toitsvarious within thegroup ofbiopsied lesions that are clearly notcarcinoma, there exists aspectrum aregiving aretrue? How doIknow towhat degree their responses accurately answer the the question? This problem ofvalidity isnogreater with qualitative open-ended unstructured interview techniques than itiswith formal structured methods. Infact, assessing thevalidity with the use ofthelatter methods may bemore ofaproblem than with theformer. One way thevalidity role. byclass, social status, degree of consensual meaning, andinterpretations ofrespective roles. The closer Iwas able toestablish good rapport between myself and the women asIhadalready interviewed them atlength ina more structured interview, Ihad taught them abreast self-exam orhad discussed their concerns ofbreast cancer, Iwas ofsimilar socio-economic background and Ihadmyself been diagnosed with abenign breast condition. The women and Ishared agood deal ofcommon ground before Iinterviewed them intheir homes. After completing the interview, wewould often chat about myresearch, their work or activities. Iwas invited byseveral women forcoffee and lunch, and ononeoccasion visited one woman socially. Many ofthe women thanked meand said that doing theinterview had been agood experience for -28\u00ba * -- s **them. Several said that more books needed tobewritten which dealt directly with benign breast conditions rather than with breast cancer. Rapport with themedical practitioners was more difficult but again, Ihad the advantage ofhaving met them inaclinical context before ourinterview. Ihad been attending breast conference tumor boards atthe twohospitals for about ayear before Iconducted was ofmyemployment project. Myown research grew out ofthe issues raised Thus, most oftheclinicians were that they needed toknow more about, and they knew that Iwas interviewing many oftheir ownpatients. This familarity helped to establish rapport andallbut one oftheclinicians allowed metotape record their interviews, allfelt free toexpress their points ofview, none refused aninterview and inmany cases, especially with the clinicans attheprivate hospital, the interviews went onpast the time alloted. Many oftheclinicians said that they hadenjoyed talking about theissues Iwas concerned with asthey were very to their ownexperiences. Iemployed athird method ofchecking validity bytesting out my propositions onrespondents after our home interview was complete and onother women not formally part ofmyownstudy. Inthis way, Iwas able togain newinsights, layinterests. Finally, anduncertainty from anumber ofdifferent modes.

Agreat deal ofmyparticipant observation research was carried from twohospitals inalarge U.S. city. Thestudy design included two case groups and onecontrol group. Of the twocase groups, thefirst consisted ofwomen diagnosed with breast cancer andthe second, women diagnosed with benign breast conditions. The control group consisted ofwomen who had never had abiopsy orsurgery for malignant orbenign breast conditions. Women between the ages of18to75 who had been seen byco-operating clinicians atoneofthe twohospitals were invited toparticipate. For women, participation consisted ofaone hour structured interview, abreast examination, andthecollection of blood, saliva, andbreast fluid samples. Theinterview, labwork and breast exam were conducted bymyself and aresearch nurse. 2.5b Breast Conference Tumor Boards: Asecond setting inwhich out wasbreast theepidemiology, were held weekly attheteaching hospital andmonthly attheprivate hospital. They were attended by persons -33\u00ba **surgeons, Oncologists, objectives atboth hospitals were similar, thestructure and content differed. Because ofthis, theconferences played different roles intheir relationships animportant role inshaping the way inwhich aparticular clinician incorporated knowledge from these conferences into his orherdaily clinical practice. Thefirst hospital (University hospital) isateaching hospital and apart ofalarger medical center that supports aschool of medicine. The second hospital isprivate and isused bypractitioners inprivate practice (although itisalso ateaching hospital, with residency programs, etc.). TheUniversity hospital hasestablished a special breast screening clinic that provides anumber ofservices including diagnosis andtreatment ofbreast twofull-time nurses who areresponsible forteaching breast self exams, conducting breast examinations and for thesurgeons, community health clinics andgeneral practitioners canrefer women whom they feel need further evaluation. Atthe time ofthis research, theprivate hospital did not have a separate breast screening clinic although afull-time nurse had been employed towork with theprivate practitioners toestablish one. The structure ofthebreast conferences differed between the two -34-\u00ba: s \u00ba \u00bahospitals. AttheUniversity hospital, theconferences were held weekly from 8to9a.m. before thebreast clinic opened. The woman whose \"case\" was being presented wasusually available sothat the conference members could examine her. The woman waited inan examination room near the conference room until thedetails ofher \"case\" had been presented byherphysician. She would then beexamined bytherest ofthe team. After examining the woman, the members would return totheconference room todiscuss the\"case\" and togive advice about diagnosis andtreatment. Because most ofthe women presented at these conferences represented diagnostic ortreatment difficulties, an attempt was made toreach some kind ofjoint \"management\" decision. A team consensus served toprovide support for anindividual clinician's recommendations. These weekly conferences also served asongoing working team meetings where current diagnostic and management problems were discussed, where new information concerning clinical trials, new treatment techniques anddiagnostic methods were shared and where the members could enter into open debate concerning theeveryday concerns ofthebreast clinic andthe management oftheir patients. Attheprivate hospital, conferences were amore formal affair being held monthly atnoon during which time lunch was served. The conferences were led byapathologist whose special research interests concerned insitu andminimal breast cancers. Often hewould organize aspecial presentation for theclinicians concerning specific types of benign ormalignant problems, diagnostic techniques ortreatment procedures. Individual cases were often selected toillustrate current dilemmas and directions inbreast cancer research but the woman was never present forexamination byconference members. While individual -35-physicians didpresent cases about which they were uncertain, these conferences tended tobefurther removed from theeveryday working problems oftheclinicians. Asoneprivate clinician told me: Tumor boards are only for ideas andnothing more andnever should they ever dictate therapy for anygiven patient. Iknow what's best for mypatient. The people whosit andpontifically make statements attumor board must always betaken with agrain of salt because they haven't met thepatient and they don't know the patient's personality. They can never have all theinformation about apatient. Thus, conferences attheprivate hospital tended tobeupdate sessions concerning new and emerging knowledge within thefield. As one young surgeon explained: Well, Idon't know thepathogensis offibrocystic disease. I don't honestly know. And thediscovery inapathological specimen that there are in-situ lesions know what itmeans. That iswhat Iamgoing tothat breast conference for. Despite thedifferences between conferences held atthe two hospitals, both provide acontext where clinicians canenter into open debate concerning what isknown, what isunknown, and what is ambiguous. These conferences represent one ofthe fewsafe contexts within which clinicians canfreely admit uncertainty. Itiswithin this setting that exploration oftheambiguities ofmedical meanings is encouraged. Anditiswithin this context that theclinician can seek support from colleagues inhis orherattempt totranslate ambiguous meanings into clinical tomyparticipant observation ofthe tworesearch settings described above, Iconducted open-ended interviews with medical practitioners from both hospitals. Mygoal was tointerview all medical practitioners hospital aninterview, and one physician canceled atthelast minute on Thus, 13surgeons. The sample wasselected toilluminate general themes and dilemmas that many of these practitioners deal with intheir everyday practice. thus, the sample wasselected forexploratory purposes rather than fortesting particular ofinterviewing women andtheory construction rather forspecific hypothesis testing (Denzin andStrauss, 1967). Mysample units consisted oftwogroups ofwomen; 15diagnosed with breast cancer and 30diagnosed with benign Therational for sample size wasbased onseveral considerations. First,\u00baowing tothe time required for each non-structured small number ofwomen could beincluded. Thegreater number tothe fact that only 22% ofwomen diagnosed had a malignant diagnosis. Second, thefocus oftheresearch isupon the experiences ofwomen with benign conditions rather than those with breast cancer. Both groups ofwomen were selected from those participating inthe epidemiology project. Women with benign conditions were selected from those Ihad interviewed over afour month period. Iasked each woman hour that Iwould atalater date. The first 30women to accept made upthis sample. Women with breast cancer were selected in similar fashion. However, because Ihad notpersonally interviewed 15 ofthese women, Iinvited women who had been interviewed bytwoother research nurses toparticipate. All the women diagnosed with breast cancer particpated and only one woman with abenign breast condition declined. This woman explained that she was too busy with her work and family. All the women were selected from those attending theuniversity hospital. Initially Ichose not tointerview women from theprivate hospital because Iwastold that Iwould probably encounter problems in obtaining permission from their doctors andthat Iwould runinto difficulties gaining approval from thehospital research committees. However, Inowbelieve that theprivate clinicians would not have discouraged mefrom interviewing their patients asIfound that they were much more willing todiscuss problems inmanaging patients with -38-breast conditions than were their university hospital counterparts. Obviously itwould have been better ifIhadinterviewed some women from theprivate hospital. However, Iwasable toinformally talk with women from theprivate hospital whoparticipated intheepidemiology study and they voiced concerns anduncertainties tothose ofthe women who attended theuniversity hospital. Butitmust bemade clear that the quotes bywomen about specific interactions they hadwith their physicians refer topractitioners attheuniversity, notprivate hospital, unless otherwise noted. Amore detailed description ofthe sample hasbeen included inappendix A. 2.6 The arethose common toanthropolo gical inquiry. Oneofthese methods isparticipant observation which I employed atbreast tumor conferences, epidemiology project meetings, and inmyinvolvement intheeveryday activities oftheepidemiology project. The second method Iutilized wastheuse ofopen-ended in-depth interviews conducted with women andmedical practitioners. Allthe interviews were tape-recorded andlater transcribed. Only onemedical practitioner asked that Inottape theinterview. Interviews with the women lasted from lto 2hours. Interviews with clinicians lasted from 20 minutes toone hour. Because the interviews were unstructured Iused a list ofthemes Iwanted toexplore asaguide. The mentioned, interviews with women were conducted intheir homes and before Iturned -39 Aonthetape recorder wewould chat about various things that may have \". occurred since welast saw each other. Often the women would offer mea |- cup oftea orcoffee which Iwould accept. While itcan beargued that this approach may have seriously biased the research, Ibelieve that inorder tobuild theparticipant toremember back to when shefirst became that there might beanything wrong with her breast; toremember where she was, what she was doing, who she waswith, \u007f, what was going oninherlife atthat context inwhich wecould explore together various themes. Interviews with medical practitioners were similar tothose conducted with women. After introducing myself and myresearch, Ibegan byasking them todescribe their practice and howthey \u00ba particular specialty. Then Iasked field notes describing thebreast conferences and notes ofmyinteractions with during thestructured epidemiologic interview andwhile Itaught them howtoconduct breast-self exams. I noted comments women made toour research nurses. Iobserved informal interactions between theepidemiologists, medical practitioners and research assistants who were involved with theepidemiology project. I read thereports ofthepathologists andsurgeons ofpatients. Iobserved ofknowledge into practice within several contexts and many different perspectives. 2.7ANALYSIS: Theanalysis andinterviews isdirected towards istoachieve knowledge and meanings aretranslated into practice. Iamspecifically concerned with understanding thethemes that emerge from thecontent ofinterviews observation rather than thefrequency ornumber were mentioned. Therefore, Ihave tobring to light thevarious system forcoded dissertation ultimately remains my owninterpretation ofthedata. Descriptive statistical analysis is provided only todescribe thecharacteristics ofthe sample ofwomen interviewed. Inkeeping with thehermeneutical philosophy and assumptions upon which this research isbased, analysis ofthe\"data\" takes the form is, asthereader interprets myownunderstanding ofthe\"data\" newunderstandings should emerge. And these newunderstandings might be understood asanongoing dynamic dance between research participants, myself theresearcher, and theaudience orinterpreters ofthe dissertation itself. -42-CHAPTER 3: DILEMMAS INSCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF BENIGN BREAST CONDITIONS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO BREAST CANCER \"At arecent influential scientific Congress, held inEngland, and atwhich all the most advanced thinkers inthe realms ofScience were present, the King publicly declared that who acure isassure anemissary ofDeath asthe bolt from from ofScience.\" Wallace Electro-Medical and Surgical Institute, 1898. Current clinical and laydilemmas surrounding thediagnosis, treatment andprognosis ofbenign breast conditions stem from uncertain understandings concerning their relationship tobreast cancer. First, because there exists noaccepted method ofpreventing breast cancer, emphasis has been placed upon early detection. This hasrequired that attention bedirected towards defining more subtle changes inbreast pathology. However, thescientific andclinical understanding ofthese changes isoften unclear. Second, until recently, epidemiologists, pathologists, andclinicians have believed that women diagnosed with benign breast conditions were atsignificantly higher risk for developing breast cancer. This belief however, isbeing called into question because itisnowrecognized that there are many different kinds ofbenign conditions, some ofwhich may beless benign than others. Third, between conditions that areclearly benign, andthose that areclearly invasive may lead to*-- invasive carcinomas inthe future. This chapter consists offour sections. First, Iwill briefly summarize thehistopathological understandings ofand issues about benign andmalignant breast conditions. Second Ishall review epidemiological understandings about therelationships between benign andmalignant conditions. Third, Iwill discuss issues inbreast cancer screening protocols and technology. Finally, Iwill explore some ofthe themajor problems arising inthe management ofboth benign breast carcinomas. ofbenign breast conditions andtheir relationships tobreast cancer. 3.1 PATHOLOGY OF MALIGNANT AND BENIGN BREAST CONDITIONS: Thepathology ofboth breast cancer andbenign breast conditions Z. isvaried and complex. Within these twobroad classifications the differentiation ofspecific histopathologic types isimportant aseach carries different implications fordiagnosis, management, and * prognosis. Ifone were toimagine breast conditions onaspectrum from clearly aggressive cancers toclearly benign conditions, one would find a~ alarge grey zone comprising thecenter. conditions that somewhat anomalous asthey are notinvasive. Ontheother side, there arebenign conditions that areconsidered tobepotentially more aggressive, or -44-less benign than others. Theconditions that make upthis central grey zone give rise toboth scientific ambiguity andclinical uncertainty. Inthis section, Iwill briefly describe thepathology ofbreast conditions, beginning first with invasive carcinoma andconcluding with benign breast conditions. Myaim isnot those areas that, atthe time ofthis study, were ambiguous and therefore, most controversial and those areas where there was much clinical uncertainty concerning diagnosis, treatment andprognosis. 3.laInvasive Breast Carcinoma: There are many different kinds ofinvasive breast cancer and they areclassified both according tothespecific kind ofbreast tissue from which they arise and bythe type ofcell composing the tumor. The most common type ofbreast cancer involves theglandular tissue and is referred toasadenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinomas arise inthe milk ducts, the lobes orinthelymphatic system beinvasive non-invasive (see appendix adenocarcinomas, duct ofallbreast lobular carcinoma isthe next most common, making upabout 7%ofall breast cancers. Other less common invasive cancers ofthe breast whose names reflect tumor cell type include medullary, colloid, papillary and, tubular carcinoma and comedocarcinoma (Carter and Eggleston 1977, Haagensen 1971, Baker 1977). Most often thepathologist isable toeasily classify breast cancers. However, insome cases itisdifficult identify the types oftissue from which arises of cells composing the cells inthe epidermis and there ismuch debate about theexact characteristics of these cells andtheir origin: These cells are regarded bymost observers ascarcinoma cells and the most popular interpretation isthat they arise from an intraductal carcinoma isthat cells found, just asdothecarcinoma cells oftheother multiple foci within thebreast aninvasive ornon-invasive carcinoma. Theclinical consequences ofthis controversy became apparent during several ofthe Breast Conferences held atthePrivate Hospital. Thecondition is ambiguous inthepathological sense because itcan come totake on multiple meanings atthe time; invasive Because oftheambiguity inthehistopathologic meaning of Paget's disease, surgeons expressed much uncertainty concerning appropriate therapy. Onthe one hand, ifthedisease isbelieved tobe non-invasive, tobeinvasive and/or ifitis theunderlying tissue, radical treatment of thebreast might beindicated. Another example ofpathological ambiguity occurs with the distinction between infiltrating ductal carcinoma andinfiltrating> -46-lobular carcinoma. inan** \"Indian file\" pattern. some types ofductal carcinoma can resemble lobular carcinoma. Thedistinction between the twocancers is, - attimes, unclear. One approach toresolve this dilemma hasbeen to classify ambiguous cases within thegroup that represents thegreatest duct carcinoma. This isdone toreserve thelobular carcinoma diagnosis for a cancer which has aheightened risk ofbilaterality (Carter and Eggleston 1977:43).\u00ba Another important feature ofcancer pathology concerns the potential and/or actual degree towhich acancer spreads through out thebreast and body. This obviously has important clinical implications forboth treatment andprognosis. One aspect ofcancer 1981:84). Acursory review oftheliterature however, would provide much confusion, asthe frequency ofmulticentricity alone has been stated tovary from 9 percent to75percent inindividual series. Itshould beno surprise that some degree -47-conservative resection and ontheother fortotal mastectomy--is espoused bythecited investigators. are, in large part, theresult ofvaried definitions ofmulticentricity, different techniques ofexamination employed, and theextent of tissue sampling (Lagios, Westdahl and Rose, 1981, pp83-84). Here wefind that within the domain ofpathology there are unresolved problems concerning thedetermination ofmulticentricity. .This creates difficulties for thedegree towhich thedisease has spread throughout the body presents additional problems. The presence orabsence of cancer cells intheaxillary lymph nodes has been considered tobea significant indicator ofthedegree ofspread and ofpatient prognosis. Itiscurrently theextent oflymph node involvement has agreater influence onprognosis than does the tumor size andthat patients with three orfewer lymph nodes containing metastatic tumor have abetter chance ofsurvival than those with four affected nodes. Pathological understandings oftherole oflymph nodes intumor metastasis are changing. Until recently, the primary tumor was thought tobeconfined tooneparticular locale ofthebreast, where it remained for aperiod oftime and then spread tothe lymph nodes where, again, itremained before disseminating further. Itwasbelieved that the lymph nodes acted asabarrier tothespread oftumor cells. These assumptions formed thebasis forradical mastectomy totreat breast -48-\u00ba s R **cancer. Patients who did not dowell were thought tohave had disseminated disease before oratthe time oftheoperation. However, thepathological oftherelationship thedissemination ofbreast cancer isbeing challenged. Newconcepts are emerging which suggest that tumor cells may bypass the lymph nodes entirely andenter directly into theblood system. Theimplications arethat negative lymph nodes donotnecessarily indicate that dissemination has not occurred (Carbone 1981). These shifts inhistopathological understanding suggest that new forms ofclinical treatment are needed. First, early treatment of minimal cancers andpremalignant orbenign conditions may beallthe more important inpreventing thepossibility ofaninvasive disease. Second, theeffectiveness ofestablished therapeutic options are thrown into question. Numerous classification systems have been created inanattempt to bring order toboth thehistopathologic understanding andclinical management ofbreast Thecurrent system ofclassification most commonly used hasbeen prepared bythe American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and EndResults Reporting (Robbins 1977). This system classifies cancers according tothecharacteristics ofthe tumor, the conditions ofthe lymph nodes and thepresence ofmetastasis. This information iscombined todivide cancers into four stages (see appendix D). Although this system provides asource ofstandardization forclassifying anddescribing the spectrum ofbreast cancer, itdoes not that result histopathological 3.1b invasion ofsurrounding tissues. Many insitu carcinomas are notclinically detectable and are most commonly discovered when breast tissue isbiopsied for some other reason. Since aninsitu carcinoma confined tothebreast isasymptomatic and non-life threatening, some argue that thecondition should require no therapeutic action. However, treatment dilemmas arise out ofthe uncertainty astowhether thecondition will become invasive atsome time but not always associated with anunderlying invasive carcinoma. Until recently theaccepted mode oftherapy involved treatment oftheentire breast rather than being to Duct carcinoma insitu isfound inthelarge ducts ofthebreast and Until recently, duct carcinoma insitu intheabsence ofinfiltrating cancer the introduction ofroutine mammography, this disease isbeing detected more frequently. The few published studies that have investigated therate atwhich thedisease becomes invasive show that upto57% (Betsill etal. 1978, Rosen 1980). -50-findings tomean that ductal insitu aninvasive cancer. Thenatural history ofthis disease remains unknown and experimental studies are underway todetermine whether less radical treatment ofthebreast isanacceptable alternative inwomen with limited duct insitu carcinoma (Lagios etal. 1982). There are many problems concerning theclassification and carcinoma and long periods oftime. Itis considered toberelatively rare butthis isperhaps because itis almost always discovered byaccident when thebreast isbiopsied for another condition. Itisdifficult therefore, todetermine the prevalence ofthedisease among thegeneral population. Awoman has carcinoma insitu isthought tobeat risk ofdeveloping inflitrating cancer. Controversy surrounding treatment ofthe condition arises because the condition is theoretically 100% curable ifremoved. However thedisease removal ofone orboth breasts. Those who advocate close follow-up rather than treatment usethis evidence tointerpret thecondition asa \"laboratory\" rather 1980). *Insum, the insitu carcinomas currently represent aproblematic area both within medical science andclinical practice. Dilemmas arise for thepathologist inthat thenatural is unknown, anditisoften atwhich a transformation takes place from alaboratory disease toaclinical disease. This inturn creates much uncertainty for theclinician in choosing anappropriate mode ofpatient management. Lagios (1980), concerning summarized theproblems ofpatient for which there are, noagreed upon answers: l. What percent ofagiven non-invasive lesion will become invasive? 2. What isthe lag time between adocumented non-invasive lesion andsubsequent invasive cancer events? 3. What percent ofspecific non-invasive lesions are: a. multicentric associated with with spontaneous areasonable for non-invasive breast cancer? Many ofthese questions form thebasis for much clinical uncertainty concerning the thetranslation ofpathologic findings into clinical practice. They will befurther discussed indetail in chapter 4. 3.loBenign Breast Conditions: Thehistopathologic understanding ofbenign breast conditions are ledtoproblems * conditions. Asearly asthe 19th century, efforts were made to distinguish benign conditions from those classified asbreast cancer (Ernster 1981, Lewison and Lyons 1953) and conditions became referred toas\"chronic cystic mastitis\" (Konig 1893). Despite several detailed studies ofbreast over thelast 80 years, there continues tobeavariety ofill-defined histopathologic labels applied tothevarious forms ofbenign conditions (Ernster 1981, Love etal. 1982, Love 1984). Atthe time this study was conducted, there existed nouniversally accepted standardized system of classification. This has led todiverse terminologies where different terms often refer tothe same conditions. Anduntil very recently, benign breast conditions have been commonly labeled asfibrocystic breast disease. The major difficulty with the use ofthe term fibrocystic disease isthat itdoes notdistinguish between different kinds of histopathologic andclinical breast changes. This lack of specification hasgiven rise totwoareas ofconfusion. First, the term does notdifferentiate between conditions some ofwhich which may be less benign than others. This inturn hasgiven rise toquestions concerning thedegree towhich \"fibrocystic disease\" represents a distinct disease process. Love etal. (1982) critically reviewed the literature since 1964 forevidence that supports the argument that fibrocystic disease isadistinct disease entity. Because ofthe liberal use ofthe term within pathology, they found that inonestudy, upto90% ofwomen could behistologically defined ashaving fibrocystic breast disease. evidence, they posed the -53-question \"Isitreasonable todefine asadisease anyprocess (p:1011). consequences asitcombines individuals who are not atrisk with those who are. There ismuch debate concerning which kinds ofbenign changes should beconsidered normal and which abnormal. Breasts areorgans inastate ofconstant change due totheinfluence ofhormonal fluctuations. Thus, changes might actually represent arange ofnormal responses tohormonal variation. This has led Love p.1011). Because it isbecoming increasingly clear that notallbenign breast conditions carry thesame risks ofbreast cancer, theuseofaterm todescribe conditions present inupto90% ofall women would seem not butirresponsible. Love etal.argue: The term more descriptive oftheclinical situation, and specific histologic designations are more useful indescribing the pathology, aswell astheprognosis (1982, p:1014). Inattempts tosolve the above dilemmas, several schemes have been proposed tostandardize thehistopathology ofbenign conditions (Azzopardi 1979, Haagensen 1971, Wellings etal. 1975). Dupont and Page (1985) have separated histologic lesions into three catagories. First arelesions tha arenotproliferative ascysts, andfibroadenomas. Intheir retrospective cohort study Page found that 70% ofwomen inthestudy with excised benign breast tissue were diagnosed with nonproliferative lesions and were not atincreased risk for breast cancer. The second andthird categories asdefined byDupont and Page, do carry anincreased risk cancer, ascompared with therisk for women inthegeneral population. Proliferative conditions without atypia (abnormal cells) include hyperplasia (too many cells), papillomas andsclerosing adenosis. Intheir study, and Page found women hadproliferative conditions without However, athird category, atypical hyperplasia (too many abnormal cells) was found in4percent ofthe women. This category ismade up ofconditions that have some ofthemorphologic characteristics of carcinoma insitu. Women with atypical hyperplasia afivefold increased athighest risk were those who hadatypical hyperplasia and afamily history ofbreast cancer. The study byDupont and Page hasdemonstrated that themajority of women who undergo breast biopsies forbenign conditions arenot at increased risk ofbreast cancer and many clinicians arecurrently reassessing the way inwhich they manage women with these conditions (Hutter 1985). However, atthe time that Icollected data forthis study, there wasstill much confusion concerning thedifferent types of benign breast conditions and thedegree ofrisk they carried. Although the results ofstudies such asDupont arebeginning to \u201455-clarify anumber ofhistologic categories along theproliferative continuum which overlap and thus make diagnosis and management difficult (Hutter 1985). 3.2EPIDEMIOLOGY OFBREAST CANCER AND Atthe time ofthis study, breast cancer was theleading cause of cancer incidence andmortality and ranked second toheart disease as the leading killer ofAmerican women. Between 1973 and 1977, cancer of thebreast comprised 27% ofnewcases among women annually and was responsible for 19% ofall female cancer deaths. IntheUnited States, the annual age-adjusted incidence rate forwhite females in1976 was 84.9 per 100,000 and theage-adjusted mortality rate was 27.0 per 100,000 women. Itisestimated that atthepresent rate, lout of every llwomen will develop breast cancer inherlifetime (SEER 1984). While mortality rates have remained relatively constant (26.4 in 1969 and 27.0 in1976), incidence rates have risen (from 73.9 to83.5 per 100,000 between 1969 and 1976). Various explanations have been given toaccount forthese trends. However, the increase may bedue to better screening techniques andthus, more cancers arebeing detected that would not have been detected before. Alternatively, theincrease may bereal (Kelsey 1979, Urban 1976). Survival trends bystage of breast cancer have remained virtually unchanged since 1950 (National Cancer Institute 1975). Theliterature ontheepidemiology ofbreast cancer has been comprehensively to herarticle for thedisease.-- - \u00ba -56-Increasing age isone ofthestrongest risk factors and inthe United States and other western industrialized countries the age-specific incidence rates increase rapidly until 45-50 andcontinue toincrease ataslower rate thereafter. Demographically, breast cancer occurs more frequently inwhite females than inblack although among young women, this gap hasdisappeared. Internationally, rates range from low inmost Asian and African countries tomedium inSouthern Europe and South America andhigh inNorth America andNorthern Europe (Doll etal. 1966, Kelsey 1979). The risk among women inthe upper social classes ishigher than those inthe lower social classes (Cohart 1955, Menck etal. 1975). Thespecific causes ofbreast cancer remain although the disease appears tobeonerelated toanumber ofdifferent factors. Athighest risk are women who have inonebreast. These women have 4to5times therisk ofdeveloping acancer inthe other breast when compared with similar aged women inthegeneral population (Schoenberg 1977). Several reproductive variables areassociated with breast cancer. Women who have never married and those who have never had children are athigher risk than married women and those with children (MacMahon et al. 1970). Many studies have found early ageatfirst birth tobe protective andthat afirst birth inwomen over the of30is associated with anincreased risk relative tofirst births atayounger anincreased risk ofbreast cancer (Choi etal. 1978, Kelsey 1979). Artificial menopause may confer a -57-protective effect (Lilienfeld 1956). Explanations concerning the association ofreproductive factors tobreast cancer remain unclear. Many studies suggest that women who have amother, sister, or grandmother with breast cancer have two tothree times therisk compared tothose first-degree members etal. 1978, Petrakis 1977). Therole ofendogenous hormones hasreceived considerable attention. Kirschner (1977) has reviewed the evidence inthis area and concluded that despite much research, itisstill unclear which hormones are involved and the manner inwhich they operate. For example, estrogen has been long known tobecarcinogenic inanimals but thenature oftherelationship exposure tobreast cancer isnotclearly understood. Other endogenous hormones that may beetiologically associated with breast cancer include progesterone, prolactin andandrogens. Progesterone mayconfer aprotective effect against estrogens although theevidence this hypothesis remains weak (Kelsey 1979, Sherman and Korenman 1974). Prolactin has hypothesized that subnormal levels ofandrogen metabolites may beassociated with an increased risk ofbreast cancer butagain, little research has been done inthis area and thepossible etiologic role remains unclear. Some studies have suggested that exogenous estrogens could play a possible role intheetiology ofbreast cancer. Studies have been\u00ba > -58-conducted investigating therelationship contraceptives to breast cancer however thebulk oftheevidence does notsupport an effect. Afewstudies have found that use may increase risk among certain subgroups ofwomen (Brinton etal. 1979, Paffenbarger etal. 1977). Other studies have that the use oforal contraceptives forfour years orlonger isassociated Ory etal. 1976). Overall, there islittle evidence tosuggest that oral contraceptive use increases therisk ofbreast cancer. The fewstudies that have investigated theassociation between estrogen replacement therapy correlation between high fatintake andbreast cancer incidence andmortality rates across countries. Several studies have found high fatdiets tobemore strongly correlated tobreast cancer than other socioeconomic variables (Armstrong and Doll 1975, Drasar andIrving 1973). Inboth theUnited States andJapan the incidence rates of breast cancer have increased along with dietary fatintake (Wynder et al. 1976). Similar trends have been noted for England and Iceland (Stocks 1970, Miller 1977) One study found that breast cancer rates were lower than average among Seventh-Day Adventists whoalso have low cancer mayaffect ageatmenarche andthe amount ofadipose tissue, both ofwhich influence hormone levels. Or, high fatdiet may have more to -59-dowith influences ongutbacteria that could result intheproduction ofcarcinogenic estrogens (Kelsey 1979). The exact mechanisms between L high fatintake andbreast cancer remain unknown andstudies of -- individuals asopposed tothose conducted atacountry level have . produced mixed results (Kelsey 1979). However, while thebiological \u00ba mechanisms remain tobeexplained, evidence isconvincing ofthe importance ofthis relationship. Several studies have suggested anassociation between radiation andbreast cancer. Women who have been fortreatment andtuberculosis aswell as survivors ofthe atomic bombs inJapan show higher than normal rates of breast cancer (Boice and Monson 1977, Mettler etal. 1969, Wanebo et Much hasarisen over therisk ofexposure to \u00ba, radiation through mammography screening programs. Several studies investigating this issue have contributed toconclusions drawn bythe National Cancer Institute that mammography ispotentially associated with anincreased that that (Bailar 1976, Shapiro National Cancer Institute> 1977). This issue will bediscussed atgreater length inthethird arose from thediscovery ofamammary tumor virus inmice. However, the evidence for the role ofavirus inhuman breast cancer was reviewed byMacMahon etal. (1973) and they concluded \u00ba -60-that there islittle evidence tosupport this hypothesis (Kelsey 1979). Several reports have suggested that permanent and semipermanent hair dyes aremutagenic and could play anetiological role inbreast cancer (Searle etal. 1975). However, studies conducted of hairdressers and ofwomen who dyetheir ownhair have produced little convincing evidence tosupport this hypothesis (Kelsey 1979). Finally, three case-control studies conducted intheearly 1970's reported anincrease inrisk among women containing reserpine (Armstrong etal. 1974, Heinonen etal. 1974). Again, subsequent findings from several additional studies have not found agreater risk among women exposed tothis drug (Kelsey 1979). Insum, thespecific causes ofbreast there isnoknown method ofprevention. Thedisease appears to bedependent upon multiple factors. Ithas been difficult to adequately define andmeasure these risk factors andthus, much uncertainty remains concerning theextent towhich each contributes to Summing estimates arefairly modest, ourcurrent state ofknowledge indicates that inmost women there are many variables acting together todetermine risk forbreast cancer .Whether several ofthe known risk indicators can be related tosome common underlying mechanism, such asaparticular hormonal profile, remains tobedetermined. Also, most ofthe risk factors implementation (Kelsey risk factors forbreast provide forunderstanding why benign conditions importance. -61-3.2b Epidemiology ofBenign Breast Conditions: Asdiscussed, there are many different types ofbenign conditions some ofwhich may simply represent arange ofnormal changes within the breast and some ofwhich may indeed carry more risk. Thegreat diversity ofbenign breast conditions has made itdifficult studies. Acomprehensive review ofthe epidemiological literature that: Theexistence ofbenign lumps andother nonmalignant disease processes ofthebreast has long been recognized, though attempts toclassify these conditions andestimate their frequency have suffered from alack ofstandardized clinical criteria and terminology. ..Different investigators have concluded either that BBDdisplays impressive epidemiologic similarity tobreast cancer (Nomura 1978, Soini 1979) (1981:200). first discuss some ofthedifficulties in carrying outepidemiologic studies ofrisk factors associated with benign breast conditions. Second, Iwill review theevidence for the associations between certain risk factors and benign breast conditions and theevidence for theassociation between benign breast conditions andbreast cancer. design, implementation, andanalysis ofepidemiological studies ofBBCs arelimited bythree major problems. First, obtaining accurate case definitions has been difficult because ofproblems in histopathological andclinical classifications andtheabsence ofan universally accepted standardized cases from non-cases (orcontrols) areoften and even when detected, can begiven different labels. Asecond problem isthat while many women have breast lumps, not all women seek medical attention for their condition. This has made it difficult toobtain accurate data concerning theoccurrence ofBBCs in thegeneral population. Finally, most studies oftheoccurrence of BBCs have been confined tocases defined bybiopsy. This has introduced sampling biases inthat with lumps undergo biopsy. Thedecision toperform abiopsy isoften based upon the clinician's about the amount ofrisk present. Women atrisk forreasons other than thepresence ofalump are more likely tobebiopsied (Love 1984). One would obviously expect tofind ahigher incidence ofbreast cancer among agroup ofwomen athigh risk. Even among those high risk women whose biopsies were normal, the expected incidence ofbreast cancer would behigher. Insum, because ofproblems inobtaining clear case definitions, because not all women seek medical attention for their BBC and because the associations between BBCs and breast cancer have been derived from biopsies among high risk women, ithas been difficult toobtain valid descriptive andanalytical epidemiological data (Love 1984). Several different types ofstudies have attempted toestimate the occurrence ofBBCs inthegeneral population. These include biopsies taken from autopsied women who died ofcauses unrelated tobreast conditions, biopsies conducted incase-control andprospective studies and onepopulation-based study abiopsy the age of50, upto50% ofall may have palpably irregular breasts and asmany as90% ofwomen may have some type ofhistological changes (Kramer and Rush 1973, Love etal. 1981). While therisk ofbreast cancer associated with adiagnosis ofa hasprobably itisappropriate atthis point to take acloser look atthe evidence for anassociation. One method of examining this association istocompare theprevious history ofBBCs among women without breast cancer tothose who develop breast cancer. Most studies ofthis nature have been prospective follow-up studies of women who have had abiopsy diagnosed BBC (Black etal. 1972, Clagett etal. 1944, Davis etal. 1964, Donnelly etal. Lewison and Lyons 1953, Monson etal. 1976, Page etal. 1978, Potter etal. 1968, Shapiro etal. 1968, Veronesi and Pizzocaro 1968, Warren 1940). These women are followed through time tosee which ones goontodevelop breast cancer (Ernster 1981). While different methods have made comparison of estimated risks difficult, most studies have confirmed that ahistory ofabiopsied-defined BBC foratypical Page 1985). However, retrospective studies investigating theprevalence ofBBC among women with breast cancer have shown that only asmall minority have ahistory ofbiopsy diagnosed BBC (Love 1984). ofstudy investigating theassociation between BBCs risk factors for BBCaresimilar tothose forbreast cancer. However, again results have been mixed. Studies investigating menstrual andreproductive factors have -64-produced little evidence ofepidemiological similarities between benign andmalignant breast conditions. Studies exploring twofactors associated with breast cancer, early menarche andlate ageatthebirth ofthefirst child, suggest either BBCs (Cole etal. 1978, Fasal andPaffenbarger 1975). Studies investigating obesity and theuse oforal contraceptives have suggested that weight andoral contraceptive use mayprotect against BBCs. The negative association forobesity might beexplained bythe fact that disease isperhaps more issomewhat studies investigating theassociation between oral contraceptive use andbreast cancer have suggested either aweak positive association ornoeffect atal(Ernster 1981). Atthe time ofthis study, considerable attention was being directed towards factors which might beassociated with BBCs but not with breast cancer. and studies conducted onthe use ofthese products have argued that among women whoeliminated these products from their diets, the amount ofBBD diminished. However, further investigation wascarried out by Ernster etal. (1982) and they found little difference between intervention andcontrol groups ineither clinically palpable breast findings orinbefore-after mammograms. Furthermore, noevidence exists that suggests that methylxanthines might beassociated with breast cancer. Nonetheless, themethylxanthine theory hasgained considerable popularity among the lay public andwhile itisprobably -65-more healthy toeliminate products containing methylxanthine from one's \u00ba diet, theresearch reported inthis thesis show that many women wrongly assume that thehealth benefits areprotective against breast cancer. --- Insum, theevidence ofanassociation between benign breast . conditions andbreast cancer remains unclear. The problems inherent in \u00ba theepidemiology ofbenign breast conditions are due inlarge part to the lack ofclear patho-histological andclinical definitions that distinguish between different types ofthese conditions. Haagenson (1971), who isperhaps one oftheworld's leading authorities in diseases ofthebreast has summarized these problems byarguing that: Things have come tosuch apass that most asshowing \"chronic cystic mastitis\". Thescrap basket that this diagnosis provides isan easy way ofavoiding careful microscopic description and thoughtful classification ofbreast lesions (1971:156). Aspreviously discussed, research pathological, andclinical diagnosis andfindings are suggesting that excess risk forbreast cancer may berestricted to those benign conditions known asayptical hyperplasia (Dupont and Page \u00ba 1985). However, further epidemiologic studies ofhistopathologic | specific types ofBBs are needed. \u00ba 3.2c Epidemiology ofMinimal Breast Cancer: s Little epidemiologic data exists concerning theincidence ofand- risk factors associated with minimal breast cancers. Aswehave seen, s until recently, insitu carcinomas were most often discovered quite by \u00ba: accident when biopsies were performed forother breast conditions.* 7. However, improvements inmammographic techniques andtheincreasing use technology inroutine screening programs has ledtoanincrease -66inthe detection ofsmall invasive lesions and insitu cancers. For example, the frequency ofduct carcinoma insitu increased tenfold between 1972 and 1979 atChildren's Hospital inSanFrancisco and is accounted for bythe mammographic detection ofsmall lesions (Lagios et al. 1981). Several clinical follow-up studies have been carried out (Rosen et al. 1979, Rosen etal. 1978, Betsill 1978) andepidemiologic studies of these conditions arestill intheir infancy. The importance of epidemiologic studies istodescribe thenatural history ofthese conditions and todetermine whether minimal cancers share similar risk factors with invasive conditions. Onecase-control study conducted as apart oftheBreast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project compared risk factors forbenign breast disease, insitu cancer, small invasive cancer andlarger invasive cancer. Theresearchers found that risk factors offamily history ofbreast cancer, ageatfirst live birth, history ofbilateral oophorectomy were forsmall andlarge invasive cancers age areat studies are needed toclarify theepidemiological relationships between insitu cancers and invasive conditions. 3.3 SCREENING FOR DISEASE: Because thespecific causes ofbreast cancer remain unknown and as yet, there exists noknown method ofprevention, thebest hopes ofZ, i -67-control are through early detection. Methods ofearly detection are directed towards screening asymptomatic orhealthy women forsigns of disease. The most common screening techniques include monthly breast-self exams, routine clinical exams byahealth professional, and mammography. Ultrasound and thermography arealso utilized but are considered Inthis discuss both theadvantages techniques. Examination 1978, Goldstein Greenwald etal. 1978, Huguley and Brown 1981, Senie etal. 1981, Strax 1978). However, for many reasons, few women practice BSE onamonthly basis andthere is much concern inthe medical literature about the effectiveness of BSE (Cole and Austin 1981). Two issues must beaddressed ifweare toassess the effectiveness ofBSE indetecting early stage cancers. inorder for BSE tobe effective, women must practice itatmonthly intervals. Yet many studies report that few women conduct monthly examinations oftheir breasts. AGallup poll conducted in1975 reported that only 18percent ofwomen interviewed regularly examined their breasts and astudy carried out bytheAmerican Cancer Society (1973) reported that only 27 percent ofwomen had examined their breasts monthly. Furthermore, 37 percent reported never having examined their ownbreasts. However, in astudy ofaBSE program forhigh school students, Carstenson and O'Grady (1980) report that younger women are more willing than oldere s \u00ba-68women tolearn andperform BSE onaregular generation of WOIIlene Asecond issue concerns theeffectiveness ofBSE can bedetected initsearliest stage, then life can beprolonged. Fewstudies have been conducted that assess the effectiveness ofBSE and those that have been conducted report conflicting results. Foster etal(1978) conducted astudy inwhich they reported that among BSE, 55percent haddisease inclinical states 0-1while among with breast cancer who did notpractice regular BSE, only 19 percent hadearly stage disease. However, another study conducted bySmith etal(1980) failed to confirm this positive association between BSE andearly stage disease. Smith etal(1980) classified 220breast cancers according tothe method ofdetection and found that among 75percent ofwomen who reported discovering thecancer themselves, there was nodifference by stage orlymph node involvement between these women andthose who discovered their lump byaccident. These studies suffer from several limitations including small sample size and thefact that none were apart ofalarger study designed specifically totest theeffectiveness ofBSE (Cole andAustin 1981). Two more recent studies overcoming some ofthese limitations have been conducted byHuguley and Brown (1981) and bySenie etal. (1981). Both studies included larger samples and both have shed more light ontheeffectiveness ofBSE.& t > -69-The work whopracticed BSE, hadearly stage disease ofwomen who did notpractice BSE. However, theauthors concluded that only 25percent ofthebenefit among BSE women was due tothepractice ofBSEitself while the remainder could be explained bythefact that women whopractice BSE arealso more likely todiscover (1981) reports that BSE relationship tosmaller tumor size and theabsence ofinvolved axillary lymph nodes. Rather, these variables were closely associated with the frequency ofmedical examinations. These mixed findings have lead some researchers toargue that BSE should remain asan\"adjuvant\" toother primary screening procedures (Cole andAustin 1981) while others have argued that BSEplays an important andprimary role inbreast cancer screening (Goldstein andet al1982, Moore 1978). BSE isnotpracticed regularly bymost women and even among women who discover their own lumps, there isoften along delay time before they seek medical advice. Many studies have explored thereasons for these patterns (Howe 1981, Magarey etal. 1977). This issue will be explored further inchapter 5ofthis dissertation. Suffice ittosay that while BSEmight indeed reduce theoverall mortality rate due to breast cancer, there arecurrently many problems inhibiting regular and effective 3.3b ofaphysical examination ofthebreast byawoman's doctor orother trained medical professional. Most women seemedical professionals at regular intervals fortheir reproductive health, (e.g. birth control advice, annual pap smears, pregnancy care orother conditions.) Therefore, nurse practitioners, midwives, obstetricians, gynecologists andother primary care providers are inanexcellent position tocarry out routine exams. However, these health professionals receive little training in breast care and thus arenotproperly prepared toconduct thorough examinations orgive outadequate advice about breast health. Currently, cases ofmalpractice formissed diagnosis ofbreast cancer are amajor problem This has resulted inmore referrals tosurgeons fordiagnostic decisions (Weekes 1983). Itwould seem that apractical, simple, effective and inexpensive method ofreducing breast cancer mortality would lie in training primary care providers tobecome skillful intheart ofbreast examination. Furthermore, the American Cancer Society hasdevoted much time and energy convincing women ofthe importance ofBSE anditis therefore only logical that similar efforts bedirected towards the training ofclinicians. Yet work inthis area screening device mammography isahighly effective method fordetecting cancers technology isnotwithout itsproblems. Intheearly 1960's, the New York Health Insurance Plan (HIP) conducted controlled clinical trials todetermine ifyearly screenings ofasymptomatic women with acombination ofmammography andphysical exams could bring about reductions inbreast cancer mortality rates. The study andcontrol groups each consisted of31,000 women between the ages of40to64years. After 7years, theresults ofthe HIP data indicated there with theNational Cancer sponsored 27Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Projects (BCDDPs) throughout theUnited States. The BCDDPs were designed toscreen women - between the ages of35to74years annually for aperiod of 5years \u00ba with 5additional years offollow-up (Baker 1982). However, in1975 concerns were raised about thepossible risks ofmammography. The HIP studies had shown nobenefit towomen under the age of50andcritics ofmass screening began toquestion whether exposing young women to s periodic X-rays could actually increase their risk ofdeveloping breast N cancer. Furthermore ,there were charges that thescreening centers\u00ba were operating inviolation ofinformed consent regulations andthat many ofthe mammography machines were poorly calibrated (Bailar 1976, Greenberg 1977). These criticisms lead theNational Cancer Institute toset up -72--three expert committees tore-examine the HIPdata. The committees data, the pathological data and theeffects ofradiation carcinogenesis. All three committees reached the consensus that because itwasdifficult to assess thebenefits ofroutine mammography towomen under the age of 40andbecause ofthepossible risks ofx-ray exposure, routine screening for women under the age of40who were notathigh risk, should beterminated. (American Cancer Society 1982). Inthethirteen years that have elapsed since thefirst HIP reports, mammography technology has been improved. Modern machines give lower doses ofradiation and newscreening techniques are more sensitive than previous methods. Several trials have been conducted in Sweden, Canada, and theUnited Kingdom tofurther test the HIP findings (Tabar 1981, Miller etal. 1981, UKTrial ofEarly Detection ofBreast Cancer Group 1981). studies carried out intheNetherlands have confirmed thebenefits ofpopulation based screening programs. These twostudies reported a50to70%reduction inmortality among screened women (Verbeek etal. 1984, Collette etal 1984). Furthermore, these studies suggest that modern mammographic screening may beofbenefit inreducing mortality among women under the age of50years. The study byCollette etal.(1984) screened women between the ages of35to65years ofage and tothe HIP findings, reported that ofdying ofbreast women atthe lower equal ofwomen attheupper age inreducing N -73-many problems which need toberesolved before itisintroduced asa mass screening technique forgeneral populations. First, there isa possible increase ofunnecessary biopsies due tomammography. Inthe HIPstudy, among cases where tobiopsy, (or 1in5)were positive. Verbeek etal. (1984) reported alower but still high false positive rate; forevery detected case, two women had areferral and one ofthem had abiopsy that they would not have had if there had been noscreening (1984:1223). This points tothe need to improve thesensitivity ofmammographic techniques. Second, increased use ofmammography has lead tothediagnosis and treatment ofnon-cancers. The BCDDPs have been criticized for identifying cases that inthetreatment minimal cancers. from those 506cancers just mentioned were recently reviewed byanexpert pathology team. Itfound that more than 80ofthegrowths given credit forsaving lives that were not endangered inthefirst place. More importantly, the women in question, besides having unnecessarily lost abreast, have been living inneedless fear ofcancer recurrence (Randal 1977:39). This finding was reported inthepress and hascontributed to public awareness about the need forcaution concerning benefits of mammography. Even therecent studies ofnon-cancers. Verbeek etal. (1984) reported ahigher annual diagnostic rate of primary breast cancer than before thescreening program. They suggest that this might bepartially due tothediagnosis ofnon-cancers. Another difficulty with mammography concerns alone can not and sensitivity isincreased when combined with aclinical exam. Finally, one must consider whether mass screening iscost effective. Currently, mass screening isexpensive and thus raises the question ofwhether screening should beselective; aimed only athigh risk groups. Ifitistobeselective, toclearly identify which risk factors arepredictive ofdisease and toselect only women with these risk factors forscreening. Yet, aswehave seen, epidemiologists have been unable toclearly identify risk factors that arestrongly predictive ofmost cases Hakama ofbreast cancer cases studied remained inthe lowrisk group andthat selective screening was ofonly limited application inpublic health work. They concluded that savings incost ofuptoonethird could beattained ifitwasaccepted that every fifth cancer patient was toremain inthepopulation not screened. Obviously, this raises ethical issues inaddition to economic ones. 3.3d Additional Screening Techniques: Other screening methods less commonly used shown that cancers give off more heat than normal tissue and thermography measures this heat difference through infra-red radiation emitted bytheskin. This method ismore commonly use inEurope. IntheUnited States, its use islargely experimental. One reason use intheUnited States assunburn and ofthermography can beimproved, under the age of40asitinvolves noexposure toionizing radiation. Another non-invasive detection technique isultrasound. This method detects abnormalities byprojecting high-frequency sound waves into thebreast. Thedifferent echo patterns given off are then converted into acomputer image andabnormalities areinterpreted from theattenuation andspeed breast. arerelated totheaccuracy of the equipment. This method isstill but isofpotential value towomen under 3.3e Summary Discussion: Screening techniques, nomatter howaccurate, cannot prevent They areonly valuable insecondary prevention. Thus, while itisimportant todevelop accurate and lowcost screening technologies, this effort should not draw attention away from research into risk factors that might lead toprevention activities. Currently, theextent towhich screening actually increases life expectancy is unknown. And there arerisks attached togeneral screening forbreast cancer. Screening programs may cause considerable anxiety among women* ** \u00ba s -76-being screened. They mayalso women 3.4 DIAGNOSIS: Ultimately, thediagnosis one microscopic detected types ofbiopsies, aspiration andsurgical aneedle into thebreast mass some breast cells and tissue. There are twotypes ofneedle biopsies, one ofwhich is referred toasafine needle biopsy (FNA). This procedure isused to withdraw fluid and iscommonly type ofneedle isused when thedoctor and woman tobegin considering different types oftreatment. However, false negatives are apotential problem astheneedle may have simply missed thecancer cells. Therefore, negative needle biopsies areoften followed bysurgical torule outcancer. This problem offalse s -77-hasdiscouraged many surgeons from utilizing this method ofbiopsy. I will discuss this issue inmore depth inchapter 5. Asecond type incisional ofthe isremoved. Excisional biopsies remove theentire lump. Both types can under alocal anesthetic onanoutpatient basis orunder general anesthesia onaninpatient basis. The former procedure is becoming the more common. Once thetissue isremoved, the specimen can beexamined intwo onaslide, stained, and then mounted formicroscopic examination. Inafrozen section, only the most suspicious tissue is selected forfreezing anditispossible, aswith needle biopsies, to sample the wrong tissue. While this method cangive rapid feedback to the woman and the surgeon itisnot aspermanent ofhealth until confirmation with apermanent section. This second method consists ofamore exhaustive examination ofthe tissue asa permanent section. This method takes about 48hours butprovides a more definitive diagnosis (Carter andEggleston 1977). Ifapathologic isnegative, awoman may befollowed tobeathigh risk, the surgeon may recommended * that shereturn for exams atthree orfour monthly intervals. Ifapathologic diagnosis several additional techniques will beperformed inorder todetermine the - extent ofthedisease. X-rays, blood tests, these diagnostic tests areevaluated, thecancer can beclassified, staged andtreated. 3.5 TREATMENT: Currently there ismuch controversy concerning treatment options forboth benign andmalignant breast conditions. Inthecase ofbenign*- conditions, often anexcisional biopsy represents both adiagnosis and - treatment. That is, anexcisional biopsy removes all ofthetissue under question. However, for women with more extensive benign conditions, other forms oftreatment may berecommended. Ifawoman *- suffers from pain andlumpiness before hermenstrual period, she may be advised tocut down onhersalt intake and sometimes amild diuretic will beprescribed. mayalso dietary advice such as *aking vitamin Eandcutting down onhercaffeine intake. Other more extreme treatments have been used inthe treatment of\u00ba, bernign breast conditions. Amale hormone (Danazol) has used -the treatment offibrocystic breast - cancer. However, newstudies arebeginning toshow that because not A T. all that subcutaneous 1984). Therefore, inorder toprevent cancer, the appropriate procedure would seem tobetotal mastectomy which results inremoval ofall breast tissue. AsIhave argued, there ismuch controversy concerning theextent towhich benign conditions can beconsidered disease entities. Ifin\u00ba fact, many benign conditions are simply normal variations ofbreast tissue orifmost are notstrongly associated with malignant disease, this referred tothis article for amore in-depth discussion ofthese issues. Briefly, surgical treatment choices range from removal ofthe turricr only, toremoval ofthebreast, isbetter with theHalsted procedures. Those infavor -80- \u00baofless extensive forms ofsurgery cite ofcancer, there isnodifference insurvival rates tohave the more extensive surgery ascompared tothose with less extensive procedures. Thecurrent trends are to perform apartial mastectomy followed byradiation (Fisher etal. 1985). This allows the woman toretain some ofthebreast tissue that can beaugmented later byplastic surgery. Radiation therapy isgiven inorder tokill any remaining cancer cells inthebreast. Those against this treatment procedure argue that breast cancer is amulticentric disease andthat therefore itislikely Proponents ofless radical surgery argue that although the rate ofreoccurence may indeed behigher, this haslittle effect on overall survival rates. (American College ofSurgeons Commission on Cancer 1982, Carbone 1981). Chemotherapy isused todestroy cancer cells that have spread through theblood toother organs ofthebody. While the use of chemotherapy has theeffect ofkilling cancer cells, italso affects normal cells. Itisadministered orally orthrough injection, weekly or nonthly inconjunction with local surgery and/or radiotherapy. Studies **ave shown that some forms ofchemotherapy may bemore effective in F*ermenopausal women than inpostmenopausal ls-7s ). Current chemotherapy drugs have serious short and long term siGle effects and thetoxicity must becarefully monitored. For tumors that respond toestrogen, s appear growth. These \u00ba glands aremanipulated byeither removal orbytheinjection of - * hormones. Studies have shown that ofthe women who have positive estrogen-receptor assays, two-thirds will respond tothis form of therapy (National Cancer Institute 1980). Insum, treatment forbenign andmalignant breast conditions faced with anumber ofoptions inthemanagement of patients with breast cancer. The treatment options include modified radical mastectomy; simple, ortotal, mastectomy; segmental todoitasa one-stage procedure atthe same time definitive surgery is performed orasatwo-stage procedure, with treatment instituted atsome time after thebiopsy (1981:53). - 3.6 SUMMARY: !

This A uncertainty, however, arises largely from of ofmedical knowledge. diseases represent themajor health challenges facing industrialized societies, theleading causes ofdeath being -- heart disease, cancer, stroke, anddiabetes. Explanatory models ofthe 2. ! etiology andmanagement ofthese conditions have been shaped byour understandings ofinfectious Models ofinfectious disease *. understanding ofinfectious disease. The major activities in\u00ba **ical research have been directed towards isolating theinfectious -\u00ba *Gerht and intervening inthepath ofinfection. Thus, control measures *ave focused upon eradicating the agent and reducing host \".*\\*sceptibility (Mausner and Bahn 1974). The rapid increase intheincidence andprevalence of *-84-non-infectious diseases has introduced newcomplexities and theabsence ofaknown causal agent makes diagnosis, management andprognosis difficult (King 1982, Mausner and Bahn 1974). These problems have pointed tothe need forreassessing oldexplanatory models inorder becoming more common ambiguous anduncertain etal. 1983, Comaroff 1982, King 1982). While thequest for new knowledge has produced greater certainty insome areas ithasironically increased ambiguity anduncertainty in others. Medical technology has increased the range ofhuman perception and hasallowed, atleast intheory, for more precise andeffective discrimination between normal and abnormal states. Atthe same time however, technology hasintroduced anumber ofdifficult problems as, ultimately, \"data\" not, newdiscoveries many different interpretations. For atime, they come totake onmultiple and competing itsinterpretation, andits transformation can beconceptually understood asan ambiguous space where \"data\" aregiven multiple meanings atthe same time. Thetransformation ofmultiple interpretations into knowledge requires that this ambiguous space bereplaced byone where there is shared consensus concerning the meaning ofdata. This ambiguity has different consequences formedical scientists andclinicians precisely because theuses ofknowledge differ between Thescientist ofknowledge inorder topromote explanation whereas knowledge toincrease theprecision ofdiagnosis resulting inmore effective therapy andprognosis 1982, 1982). For themedical practitioner, therapid production ofnewlaboratory and epidemiological data ofthese data hasincreased theuncertainty oftheclinical act. Thus, medical practitioners are faced with the dilemma of translating often ambiguous scientific meanings into clinical knowledge andpractice. Inthis chapter Iamconcerned with understanding therelationship between anduncertain clinical practice. Thegoal howclinicians thecentral isbased. That is,that surgeons experience risk bytransforming itinto aclinical entity. Through\u00ba -86-this transformation, risk becomes understood not asaproperty of clinical practice butrather, asaproperty residing within the body or tissue ofaparticular patient. Within theclinical model, risk becomes transformed into asign ofacurrently hidden orfuture disease. Risk asunderstood asaclinical entity to control uncertainty bymanipulating thepart ofthe body atrisk. Surgeons control clinical uncertainty byremoving risk from thebody, thereby bringing about greater clinical certainty. Surgeons, then, manage risk asthey doother disease entities Inthis chapter, Iexplore dilemmas surgeons experience when practicing within acontext defined byscientific ambiguity and clinical uncertainty. Byunderstanding these dilemmas, wecanbetter understand howuncertainty becomes transformed into theclinical entity ofrisk and howclinical uncertainty iscontrolled through the treatment and management ofrisk. Thechapter isdivided into three sections. Inthefirst section Idiscuss the assumptions upon which current models ofdiagnostic processes arebased. Iargue that current models are nolonger adequate fordealing with physical conditions about which themeanings arehighly ambiguous. Inthe second section, Iexplore theuncertainty surgeons experience inthediagnosis of benign breast conditions. Thethird section explores how, when faced with ambiguous diagnostic results, surgeons manage benign conditions. 4.2 THE ART OFDIAGNOSIS: Indiagnosis, the young arepositive and themiddle aged apatient's subjective complaints into adisease entity; an objective clinical reality that can beclassified, understood andacted upon. Intheory, clinicians should beable todraw upon knowledge that enables them first todistinguish anumber ofpossible classes or categories that might explain the phenomena and second, toplace the phenomena inanappropriate disease category. Theclinician should then beable toargue why the phenomena belong inthat category and not inanyother (King 1982:91). The medical model within which most clinicians operate isbased upon twoassumptions. First, that there exists anobjective physical reality that scientific andclinical knowledge candiscover. Second, that signs and symptoms can beunderstood asreferring tosome physiological McGehee etal. 1979). These assumptions form thefoundation ofmedical thinking and are imparted early within medical education. Thus, most medical texts aim atmaking explicit thedefining criteria demarcating each disease category while lectures andclinical experience teach themedical student thepractical activity ofdiagnosing, orbeing able to'see' these disease states and toknow their meanings. Through this process, thephysician learns togive form andmeaning to\"abnormal\" changes weunderstand relationship between health anddisease and themeanings of s -88-patho-clinical states (Foucault 1975, King 1982). Diagnosis depends ontheexistence ofclasses that areever shifting extent onhis orherability tointerpret signs and symptoms. Stedman's medical dictionary (1976) distinguishes between signs and symptoms bythe patient andindicative ofdisease.\" experience ofthepatient ascompared totheobjective experience ofthedoctor. However, within a biomedical model, definitions arebased upon theassumption that states Prior tothe 19th century, little difference was made between a patient's experience ofsickness andthedoctor's reading ofdisease. Apatient's subjective symptoms were thephysician's objective signs. That is,there was not much difference between what both patients and doctors perceived. Thedifference lay intheinterpretation ofwhat the phenomenon meant (King 1982). Thus, Foucault argues that: Beneath agaze that issensitive todifference, simultaneity or succession, andfrequency, the symptom therefore becomes a sign-...the sign isthe symptom itself, but initsoriginal truth. Atlast there emerges onthehorizon ofclinical experience the possibility ofanexhaustive, clear, and complete reading: forthe doctor whose skills would becarried tothehighest degree of- * \u00ba -89-perfection, all symptoms would become signs; allpathological manifestations would speak clear ordered language (1975:94). Current medical thought assumes that theclinician's objective reading ofsigns provides amore reliable understanding ofdisease than thepatient's experienced symptoms. This change has been brought about inpart, bytechnological advances that have changed thephysician's ability toobserve the body. Percussion andausculation allowed for indirect ways ofperceiving the body and allowed thephysician to elicit andinterpret data notdirectly accessible tothepatient (King 1982, Reiser 1978). Through these technologies, thephysician has come tohave access toanew body ofdata, data that donot rely upon the patient's subjective experiences ofill-health. Thediagnostic task becomes one ofdiscovering andtransforming objective signs into a disease reality. Thus, inthe contemporary act ofdiagnosis, there is afundamental separation between signs and symptoms, the former representing more clinically objective andtherefore more reliable readings ofunderlying pathological orchemical often results inpatients anddoctors holding different explanatory models of sickness realities. Symptoms represent theexpression ofthepatient's illness reality. Illness can beunderstood as,\"... thepsychosocial ofperceived disease\" (Kleinman 1980:72). Signs represent theclinical experience ofdisease. Disease then, can be defined as,\"...the malfunctioning ofthebiological and or psychological process\" (Kleinman abiomedical model signs\".- S. -90-leading treatment and cure ofdisease, this approach may notheal apatent's illness (Kleinman, Eisenberg and Good 1978, Engle 1977, Fabrega 1972, Good 1977, Kleinman 1978). That is,thepatient's experience ofill-health often goes beyond theclinical encounter. Thesubjective orlived within ofwell-being have social andcultural meanings which areoften notshared by clinicians trained within ascientific medical model. Inavery real sense, patients anddoctors donotshare the same cultural realities. Problems ofpatient dissatisfaction, clinician dissatisfaction, non-adherence, dropping out ofcare andmedical-legal problems often stem from these differences inthemeanings ofbiomedical lay experiences ofsickness. Theclinical process one tointerpret symptoms insuch a way astounderstand thepatient's illness reality. Toreaddress this problem, Good and Good (1981) argue for theincorportation ofa cultural hermeneutic model ofclinical practice. across medical subcultures. disease while thedata made relevant bybiomedical models are clinical data that reflect underlying physiological disorder, the primary data made relevant bythecultural model arethose that yield special insight into initiates theclinical encounter by \"presenting\" with one ormore symptoms. Second, after listening toand observing thepatient's symptoms, thedoctor will elicit signs ofsome underlying disorder. Finally, thesigns that theclinician elicits will have some relationship toanunderlying pathological orchemical condition. However, these assumptions areoften faulty asthesequence of clinical events does not always follow this neat pattern. Concerning thefirst assumption, patients donot always initiate theclinical encounter bypresenting with symptoms. This often occurs inroutine physical examinations when anumber oflaboratory tests might reveal abnormalities inpathological orbiochemical functioning. Such isthe case for high blood pressure, diabetes, andanemia. Inthis situation, with astate ofill- health was upuntil that moment, nonexistent. After receiving adiagnosis, thepatient may react oftwo thefact that aperson had indeed been feeling tired and run down, yetuntil that time, these experiences were not constructed assymptoms ofillness. Thepatient has nowcreated anew illness reality inorder tobring tothebiomedical creation of disease. -92-Asecond alternative inthe absence ofsymptoms, a* person refuses toaccept thedisease reality. This situation often occurs with diseases such ashigh blood pressure where doctors and--- patients donotshare clinical realities may not choose tobelieve that sheorhehas a disease. Instead, they choose not tobeill andthus, may not comply with their doctor's treatment plan. Inthis study, one woman diagnosed with anearly stage cancer confided that she did notreally believe that she ever had cancer because she did not feel sick. She believed that the doctor had made amistake and that she should not have had a mastectomy. The second assumption; that thedoctor, after listening toand observing thepatient's symptoms, that totheillness legitimacy that because heor she canfind nopathological basis forthepatient's complaints, that that patient's illness reality must beill-founded. This often results inthepatient's complaint being classified aspsychosomatic inorigin. -93-Thethird assumption; that orchemical ornotelicited signs refer tosome underlying abnormality. For example when conducting aroutine breast examination aphysician may find some slight nodularity and ofthe meaning ofthis faulty assumption occurs itself clearly represents an abnormality but thephysician isnotsure what kind ofabnormality it signifies, what other signs itshould begrouped with, and how to classify itinto adisease category. wecan take anexample the kind and itsmeaning, isoften ambiguous. Because these three assumptions areoften not met, clinicians find themselves enmeshed insituations where themedical model guiding their thought andaction isnolonger appropriate. Itiswithin these contexts that clinicians must face the inherent uncertainties of medical practice. Physicians experience contexts ofuncertainty and ambiguity asrisky situations anditiswithin these contexts that risk becomes diagnosed, managed andtreated like theunpredictable disease itrepresents. 4.3 THE MEANING OFSIGNS AND INTHE DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST LUMPS: Theprocess oftheclinical diagnosis ofbreast conditions illustrates the above dilemmas. aclinician performs abreast -94-examination and isuncertain about themeanings ofphysical findings, the most common procedure istorefer the woman ontoasurgeon. The surgeon isthen responsible forinterpreting the meaning ofsuspicious- changes. Surgeons generally begin their clinical evaluation bytaking apatient history andconducting anexamination ofthebreasts. Based upon interpretations derived from these twoprocedures, surgeons will then decide whether additional screening anddiagnostic procedures are required. These procedures might include pathologic andradiologic evaluations. Adiagnosis isthen made based upon interpretations of both clinical andlaboratory signs. Inbringing meaning toaseries ofsigns, surgeons must draw upon theexpertise ofanumber of different andtechnological specialists. Asdiscussed in ofvarious pathological changes occurring within thebreast arenotclearly understood andareoften ambiguous in that these changes can come totake onone ormore meanings depending upon thephilosophical orientation oftheobserver. Thus, surgeons are often faced with thetask oftranslating andintegrating esoteric and experimental knowledge into practical clinical knowledge. This makes thetask ofdiagnosis particularly problematic forthesurgeon. Within thescientific realm, ambiguity poses noimmediate problems and in fact, can beapositive motivator forthequest for new knowledge and newunderstandings (Murphy with that will give order andsense tothesigns. But, attempts toremove ambiguity often leave clinicians inastate of uncertainty concerning diagnosis, management, andprognosis. Andthis -95-isadifficult dilemma within which thesurgeons find themselves more commonly enmeshed. Two surgeons illustrated this dilemma by explaining: Interms ofearly diagnosis theonly differences are thetools. In had nothing butyour hands andyour eyes andyour senses. Nowyou've got mammograms and Idon't finding isthe same will tell mejust and and physical examination will tell memore than oneortheother alone but even then, mammography andphysical examination both can come tothe wrong conclusion. Clinicians arecaught inadilemma inthat their very attempts to reduce uncertainty through the use ofmultiple diagnostic technologies, can ironically act toincrease uncertainty. And even when diagnostic results areconsistent, there isstill the chance ofbeing wrong, of missing ahidden cancer oroffailing topredict thedevelopment ofa future cancer. This section will explore howsurgeons experience this \u00bancertainty within four phases ofthediagnostic process: SYnecologists and many referrals totheuniversity hospital were from S\u00baumunity health centers, family planning clinics, health many oftheinternists bail out sotospeak assoon asthey feel something that doesn't just right. And they shift theresponsibility astodiagnosis andtreatment tosomeone else. Another surgeon trouble, ...itsabout Iget alot ofreferrals from mostly the gynecologists andinternist when breast ora breast that isdifficult tofollow. Thegeneral practitioner isfaced several shesolves byreferring awoman ontoasurgeon. First, asmedical students, they inhow toconduct breast examinations. Second, internists andgeneral practitioners conduct fever breast exams than dogynecologists andthus have less opportunity t\u00ba become familiar with variations ofbreast changes. Andthird, the ofbreast cancer with surgery. However, ther-e are many kinds ofbreast conditions that might bebetter managed Sther explained: You've got tolook attheinteresting history ofwhy surgeons are doing breast biopsies and notgynecologists. It's the same reason whygeneral surgeons inabigcity don't dohysterectomies and gynecologists do. It's operations togeneral surgeons butitwasprobably that education about breast disease began tofalter interms training programs. Noeducation really like2, 3. t N. \u00ba -97-nutrition. what Idon't know what thecorrect answer istoprotecting against other than good careful examinations. Ithink that gynecologists andother specialists have been improperly awoman canarrive atasurgeon's office self-referral. Women often aware ofthe health hazard ofbreast cancer through afriend oramedia event and thus seek theadvice ofa surgeon either because they have found alump themselves orare \u00b0Cricerned about their risk ofgetting breast cancer. While most **rgeons intheprivate hospital reported that only asmall number of **nen self-referred, they said that Because every would referred. Alot of women just hear about it[the Breast Screening Clinic] from friends. Usually they have aperception ofabreast problem. They think there's aproblem although sometimes youget women who come injust because they're high risk and they know they want to befollowed. Insumthen, women areusually referred toasurgeon without The surgeon begins thediagnostic process bytaking apatient history with the aim ofeliciting three ofinformation; patient's level ofconcern, andrisk factors forbreast cancer. Allthree types ofinformation allow the surgeon to predict whether the condition might bebenign ormalignant and tobegin tocreate anumber ofpossible diagnostic categories. All surgeons explained that thefirst thing they try todointhe initial encounter with apatient isallay herconcerns andfears. They gave two main reasons why they thought that this was important. First, surgeons realize that thediscovery ofabreast lump causes awoman much emotional distress and they believed that itisimportant to address these concerns from thestart. Thus, many ofthesurgeons in private practice said that they attempt tosee awoman assoon as possible. Twoexplained: Thefirst thing She's freaked out. SoI consider itanemergency. Itrytoseeher the same day. Isee most ofthem the same daythat they are seen intheprimary care doctor's office orthe same day they have called. They come in,aresitting there wringing their hands and maybe crying and maybe just scared todeath. Iconsider days. The surgeons hospital have commitments to teaching andresearch inaddition totheir surgical practice. Thus, women areoften seen first who are faced with Apart their patients, assessing thewoman's level ofconcern also aids the surgeon indeciding onappropriate diagnostic and management procedures. Because thediagnosis ofbreast conditions isanuncertain act, there isalways the very real chance that theclinician will be wrong. This puts thesurgeon intheuncomfortable position ofmaking a decision that isnotalways correct. Byaddressing awoman's emotional concerns atthebeginning oftheclinical encounter, the surgeon can encourage her totake some responsibility fordecision making. One surgeon explained: Thefirst thing you have torecognize isthat onthebasis ofa physical examination alone, you know, you can only make an educated guess which has maybe an80%accuracy. Soyou're always left with theconcept that you're wrong .It depends onhow they [women] respond intheconversation astowhat one does. There are many women who are very satisfied with the doctors just examining them. Ifthey're young, ifthey're inthe lowrisk group andtheir likelihood ofhaving breast cancer is very low, ifthey don't want anything else done, Idon't push them. Thus, byaddressing awoman's fears andconcerns, surgeons aimat establishing acaring relationship with their patients. Hopefully, this will enable them tomore easily carry outdiagnostic andc -100management procedures aswell asenable them toshare the responsibility these procedures with patients. The second step forthesurgeon inthehistory taking process is toelicit past andpresent symptoms. These might include breast pain, alump, ornipple discharge. Surgeons also include past biopsies and mammograms under thecategory ofsymptoms. Theinterpretation ofsigns heorshe might discover and what kinds ofmeanings these signs might have. One surgeon explained: Igointo their previous symptoms, whether they have had any previous cysts aspirated, anyprevious biopsies andpresent symptoms ofcourse, what found alump intheir breast ortheir gynecologists found alump in got pain ortenderness orvarious other complaints orsymptoms that they have. And then finally, when I getthat alltogether, Iput down what Ithink itmight be. And from Icarry out aroutine examination. The meaning ofsymptoms varies andwhile made on theinterpretation ofsymptoms alone, dohelp theclinician to interpret the as areport ofapast biopsy that wasatypical, orabloody or dominant different from symptoms ofpain andtenderness occurring around themenstrual period. former symptoms arelikely tobeinterpreted aswarning signals bytheclinician while thelatter symptoms are Ironically, while asymptom ofpain thechances offinding amalignancy during especially disease than cancer. Nothing eliminates thepossibility ofmalignancy butthat possibility. butthat itwill aid Finally, thesurgeon elicits anyrisk factors forbreast cancer. Here, clinicians draw upon epidemiological knowledge about major risk factors. These include awoman's age, menstrual history, number of children, age ofthe woman atthebirth ofherfirst child, breast feeding history, hormonal use, and family history forbreast cancer (Schwartz 1982). Thediscovery ofrisk factors iscrucial AsIwill show, intheclinical language ofrisk, risk factors are often talked about asifthey were clinical signs. That is,risk is talked about asifitwere aclinical entity, not astatistical that awoman \"has\" plays aimportant role inclinical diagnosis and management. The following comment byasurgeon illustrates this point: Well, Iexamine her and make sure that Idon't feel anydistinct mass inherbreast, get amammogram, make sure that they're negative andthat the woman gets followed. Butitdepends upon family history, itdepends onsome oftheir risk factors. . her right tothebiopsy. taking tobring meaning tothe physical examination and indeciding whether diagnostic measures are needed. Thus, bythe time theclinicians\u00ba -102-conducts abreast exam, heorshe has begun toformulate hypotheses about how theclinical findings might beinterpreted. 4.3c The Clinical Exam: -- - conducting the \u00ba clinician relies ontwosenses, intheskill ofknowing how tosee andfeel and knowing how tointerpret what has been seen orfelt. Most surgeons will agree onhow aphysical examination ofthebreast should be conducted andinterpreted. While abreast exam \"should\" bean objective clinical procedure, inreality theclinical actisonethat rests with skills ambiguity inthe meaning ofphysiological changes within scientific modes ofthought adds through perceptions. isthat ofobservation. Through this act, thepractitioner attempts to\"see\" what might lie * below thesurface, what visible signs might lend meaning tothe\u00ba invisible structures that heorshewill then feel. Until recently, thediagnosis ofbreast cancer took place atastage when thedisease waswell manifest, atapoint where theinvisible processes within the body had become expressed onthesurface. These signs that can be seen, include discharge ofthenipple, scaley In general, visible signs speak toclinicians with clarity. While they cannot besaid tosignify cancer, they dosignify achange that must beinvestigated further. Thus, while thepractitioner might be uncertain inunderstanding what isseen, there islittle uncertainty in knowing that, Apatient that Ijust sawtoday pulling lesion in the upper outer quadrant ofherleft breast that issoobvious. This lady has asgot was That need azeromammogram to tell methat ofthe breast andcertainly needs abiopsy. Theperception ofavisible sign lends greater certainty to knowing what will befelt but when novisible signs can beseen, surgeon lamented that because ofthese newer technologies, many younger practitioners donot make good use of their ownvisual senses. Heexplained: Thefirst thing that you do, tothepatient toget anidea from thehistory. Then inthe physical examination, you are none soblind inthis world that won't evenlook! Ithought that everybody bylooking. And everybody doesn't. Ihave them [women] puttheir arms the arms goupand you gothrough various manoevres sothat the breast mass moves onthe chest Isee the lesion before Itouch it. Seeing asign ofdisease lends greater certainty towhat will be felt while the lack ofavisible sign enlarges theclinical space of uncertainty. Cancer initsearly stages, isaninvisible disease. It lays hidden andsilent beneath thesurface. Itisaninward disease reveals \u00ba -104reaches throughout theorgan orentire body. Currently within clinical medicine andpublic health, thebattle against breast cancer is directed towards early diagnosis thus requiring itsdetection before thedisease becomes expressed onthevisible surface. Emphasis then, has been shifted from that ofseeing what lies visibly onthesurface tosearching for what lies invisibly beneath thesurface. This shift has introduced many dilemmas for interms able uncertainty. are tothis uncertainty. The first concerns uncertainty inknowing what isfelt. Here Iam referring totheclinician's ability toknow whether ornot what is felt isnormal orabnormal. The second dimension concerns understanding what isfelt. Here Iamreferring totheclinician's ability to interpret what achange means. Thefirst dimension, isfelt, isshaped primarily by thephysician's skill what perceptions nodularity asasign ofdisease. This does not imply that theclinician will necessarily understand what these abnormal changes mean. The second dimension, understanding what isfelt, isshaped bythe state ofknowledge about the meaning ofbreast changes asembodied in** -105scientific knowledge. Clinical uncertainty within this dimension is often aresult ofambiguity inherent inthescientific understandings ofthe meaning ofbreast changes. knowing isfelt examination ofbreasts that theclinician begins toface the dilemmas of integrating knowing what isfelt with understanding what isfelt. Knowing What isFelt: Knowing what isfelt depends first upon thesurgeon's experience andskill and second, upon his orherassumptions ofwhat \"normal\" should feel like. Inthefirst instance, surgeons realize that no matter howexperienced they are, there isalways achance that they will either fail to\"feel\" anabnormal change orthat they will not \"know\" that what they have felt isabnormal. All surgeons I interviewed reported that there was always achance ofbeing wrong or missing something during aphysical exam. Two surgeons explained: Well, thefirst thing you have torecognize isthat onthebasis ofphysical examination alone, you can only make aneducated guess which has maybe an80%accuracy. Soyou're always left with the concept that you're wrong 20% ofthetime. Well, you always getfooled. Noone's ahundred percent sure and you never know. But you can get tohave apretty good feel, pretty good idea. Because ofthis uncertainty, surgeons rely upon other modes of knowing. Forexample, onesurgeon stated: Idonotfeel super confident that I'msharp enough, enough that ifthere's alittle maps inmy own notes tocompare forfuture examination and hope that if something appears itwill bedifferent enough tolet meknow. But knowing that myerror rate will beintheorder of20%. -106-Older clinicians, those with more experience tended tobemore comfortable with theuncertainty about what they can andcannot feel. Putanother way, they tended toput more trust intheir subjective senses. Asone oftheolder surgeons explained: Well, there aninstinct you've felt alot ofbreast lumps. There arethings that Ifeel confident about that aremovable, rubbery, they're symmetric. Now Iknow very well what I'mfeeling, palpating isthesurface. And you can not assume that something ishomogeneous all the way cause there could ofcredence tomyfingers. And Ihave that I've followed somebody that Iwould look back andwith horror say, \"My God! This lady has cancer now and she haditwhen Isaw her 3months ago!\" The isfelt concerns theclinician's assumptions of\"normality\". For example, the physical conditions that physicians are most uncertain about interms ofknowing what they arefeeling arethose ofgeneral lumpiness. While ofdensity andnodularity, itisultimately inthesubjective evaluation ofthephysician. Furthermore, breasts are notall homogeneous andclinicians must make some distinction between when the range ofnormal becomes abnormal. Thus, while itisfairly clear what \"normal\" should feel like and what \"abnormal\" should feel like, itis the grey area inbetween that gives rise tothemost uncertainty. Three surgeons explained this kinda lumpy and Idon't know what I'm feeling. Idon't really feel adominant lump yetitdoesn't feel the same astheother side. Idon't know what I'mfeeling. Its something there, itsprobably fibrocystic disease, butitsthe in between, it's thegrey area. ..** -107Multiple lumps are always alittle unnerving because you know that the lumps aren't allcancer but you know that there could beone hanging around theothers and you know, youcan't biopsy everything that feels lumpy. Mygod, some women come inand they have breasts that feel like anygiven part oftheir breast could beacancer! Very firm, very nodular, very difficult toexamine. Very variable feeling breasts onboth sides andmultiple areas and youdon't know what todo! Itisprecisely this same dilemma facing surgeons that leads general practitioners, gynecologists, andnurses torefer women upthe medical hierarchy tosurgeons. kinds ofwomen were difficult toexamine agynecologist replied: The only ones that are easy are women with soft breasts. They're notfibrocystic orlumpy inconsistency sothat one canpalpate thickening women wesee. The others aredifficult toexamine inthe sense that they have a large volume ofbreast tissue orthebreasts arefibrocystic meaning firm, lumpy inconsistency, sothat ifthere were tobea small mass within that breast to what isfelt during aclinical exam often results inthereliance onadditional diagnostic tools. However, even when theclinician candetermine just what itisheorshefeels, there isoften much uncertainty ofapproach heorshewill ofadominant lump orthickening isinterpreted as abnormal, theclinical meaning ofabnormal often remains uncertain. For example, this becomes particularly problematic with conditions of general lumpiness combined with anumber ofrisk factors. Here, the clinician isnot only uncertain about his orherability todetect (or know) anunderlying cancer but also about the meaning ofthese breast changes. This uncertainty about the meaning ofbreast changes can betraced totheambiguity themeaning ofbenign breast conditions inthescientific Ihave argued that benign breast conditions can beunderstood asbeing normal and abnormal atthe same time. This inherent ambiguity stems from the lack ofknowledge about thenatural history ofbreast cancer, the lack thedisease, andthe high prevalence ofbenign breast conditions inWestern society. For example, apathologist whose research focuses upon themeanings of pre-malignant conditions and minimal cancers explained that benign Conditions can beunderstood both asnormal and asadisease process. Ithink ofbenign ofprolific lesions that wecall fibrocystic disease forinstance, probably all lead back tosome underlying etiologic condition, some factor. ...I think it's adisease process. Itsjust that itissoprevalent in ourparticular society fibrocystic disease was. Idon't know the answer tothat. I've always felt that anything that was socommon shouldn't bedignified bycalling itadisease. Idon't know whether know, when you begin totalk towonder what really isgoing onhere. Theproliferative are the oratleast very early stages ofmalignancy. So, that's adisease. Idon't know the answer, Idon't know that anybody knows theanswer. Formedical scientists, benign changes canoften beunderstood as being both normal and abnormal atthe same time. There isasyet no clear agreed upon understanding ofwhat some signs mean. Thecentral dilemma oftranslating ambiguous scientific knowledge into clinical practice arises atanumber oflevels inthediagnosis ofbreast conditions, particularly with those conditions about which the clinician isfairly certain donotrepresent cancer but atthe same time represent anabnormal condition .Consequently, theclinician is faced with uncertainty about whether what heorshefeels could either hide acurrent cancer orbecome cancer inthefuture. forthemedical conditions. Wecanexplore this dilemma byasking howclinicians translate scientific knowledge about benign breast conditions into clinical practice. Under what conditions dothey understand itas representing adisease condition diagnosis ofbenign conditions onthebasis ofaphysical exam only. Inother words, what are the theclinical meanings offelt lumps? First, much clinical uncertainty inunderstanding themeaning of lumps stems from thechanging nature ofmedical knowledge ingeneral. Many ofthesurgeons interviewed were aware oftheshifting nature of medical knowledge. Forexample, one oftheolder surgeons explained:** S. -110Inmylifetime thetruth has been around three times. When Igot started theabsolute truth was known. ...Ilearned noword efforts tomake theearly diagnosis, weareseeing a spectrum ofillness that most people don't really have anatural history of. Idon't know ifwhat wearefinding isreally the same thing aswhen wegathered ourearly knowledge about breast cancer. See, nobody knows what thereal natural history ofitis. Inaddition tothechanging nature ofmedical knowledge, much remains unknown within the domain ofmedical research about the meaning ofbenign conditions. Because these conditions are soprevalent and because they arealso associated with breast cancer, most surgeons held contradictory understandings ofbenign breast conditions and spoke of them asboth normal andabnormal. surgeon Ihonestly don't know. Ican't say. I consider it, when speaking with women, asanatural phenomena because itissoprevalent. Ican't tell you how Iseeitinthe continuum ofthings. Another surgeon explained: Idon't know, it's (benign changes) one type ofbreast tissue. Disease may not bethecorrect terminology because ithas connotations topatients that create excessive worry. There are some reports that show that women who have that type ofbreast tissue, what ever name you use, wecall itmammary dysplasia because that's aradiographic term forthe same process, show an increased incidence ofbreast cancer. There are other studies that don't confirm that .Frankly, theconsensus would bethat we have toaccept that thepatient has ahigher risk todevelop breast cancer but atthe same time she does not have tolead a life intotal fear that she isgonna have breast cancer any more than the average woman. Idon't think weshould single out the fibrocystic breast for undue alarm but they need tobefollowed closely, doself exams, getregular exams, andthey need ahigher index ofsuspicion entities. Then logically, wemust treat them assuch. Because there iscontroversy among medical researchers asto whether benign changes doinfact represent acurrent orfuture disease process and because method or* \u00ba T \u2014lllprevention ofbenign breast changes clinicians understand conditions as; a current cancer; asdisease states inand assigns of future diseases. This clinical ambiguity inmeaning isillustrated by the use ofthe term disease totalk about normal benign changes. Within clinical practice, there islittle room forambiguity andthus, allconditions become talked about inthe language ofdisease. What is normal becomes talked about asanormal disease. The following quotes bysurgeons illustrate this: I've always felt that this was not adisease. Thelargest percentage ofpeople who have disease, if70% ofthe woman have it? Itdoesn't ormammary dysplasia orfibrocystic wonders whether fair tocall anything adisease ifitspresent inmore than half thepeople that arejust walking around and seem tobereasonably healthy. Thus, surgeons are faced with much uncertainty interms ofboth knowing what isfelt and inunderstanding what isfelt. When faced with these dilemmas, practitioners often take further diagnostic actions toreduce this ambiguity andincrease clinical certainty. At this point theclinician shifts from amode based upon his orher subjective perceptions and ways ofknowing toonebased upon objective technologies andscientific knowing andunderstanding. Theclinician isnowfaced with integrating these two modes ofexperience, the clinical mode andtheobjective, technological, scientific \u2014112- S.- andwhile ambiguity andclinical DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES: and NEEDLE ASPIRATION: Surgeons tools available tothem that can beused toincrease their certainty about the meaning ofclinical findings. Thethree methods most commonly used bypractitioners interviewed inthis were mammography, biopsy, andfine needle aspirates. The use ofthese medical techniques increases the range of clinical perception thus resulting inadditional information and hopefully ingreater certainty inthediagnostic process. Unlike information obtained from thepatient history andphysical exam, this form ofperception produces indirect inforamtion about the body. Here theobserver observes not the body itself but asymbolic representation ofthebodily parts (King 1982:85). Aswith direct methods of observation, what isobserved must beinterpreted and theobserver must bring meaning tothe phenomenon. Yet thedifferent methods, direct aswell asindirect, have certain features incommon: sensory presentations that require interpretation. Thedermatologist sees changes incolor, contour, texture, 1982:85). Ironically, while which will theclinician toreach amore certain diagnosis, these technologies canlead togreater clinical islargely due tothree problems that encounters \u2014113\u00ba \u00ba\u00ba with the use ofdiagnostic First, theclinician isoften -- faced with thedifficult task oftranslating inconclusive laboratory L meanings oftest results into clinical practice.

First, thetest results must beinterpreted bya medical scientist. Second, these interpretations must betranslated by thepractitioner insuch away astohave clinical relevance. Thus, with indirect methods ofobservation, thecomplexities of interpretation increase andoften result ingreater uncertainty \u00ba concerning theclinical significance ofagiven condition.

Inthe above quote, that attempts tocomment about theclinical significance ofpathological interpretations. While pathologists often make comments concerning treatment, itistheclinician who inthe end, isresponsible for selecting andcarrying outtreatment andmanagement.

A More often than not, incases such asthe above, thepathological 3 diagnosis results ingreater clinical uncertainty concerning what type ofclinical action should betaken. The following surgeon explains how hefeels when faced with these dilemmas: Whether these minimal breast cancers actually represent cancer, is really apathologist's definition atthis time and Iamnot a hundred percent convinced that there isacause andeffect relationship between these insitu tumors, socalled cancers and ultimately thedevelopment ofadvanced cancer. So, Idon't know.... Isolicit advice from people attheclinic and they - solicit mine. Asecond waythat clinical uncertainty isintroduced bydiagnostic technologies or s precision), andreliability (accuracy), ofthediagnostic test. Many surgeons expressed concern over both thevalidity andreliability of fine needle biopsies. Several surgeons explained: - There's anerror rate ofneedle biopsy.

Third, diagnostic technologies can have theeffect ofmaking clinicians less certain about their diagnostic abilities through direct observation andphysical examination. Oneolder surgeon emphatically explained how theproliferation ofnewdiagnostic technologies was -3 -116undermining the importance ofphysical examinations.

Ifthedoctor develops adistrust for hisnon-technical judgments, herisks becoming merely an intermediary between and themedical judgments rendered bytechnical are caught inabind ofsorts. Onthe one hand, diagnostic technologies are used tobring greater certainty toclinical understanding andaction. But atthe same time, very useoften results ingreater clinical uncertainty inthat theclinician isfaced with ambiguous laboratory findings, thevalidity andreliability ofsuch tests isoften diagnostic technologies serve toundermine thepractitioner's confidence inhis orher own clinical abilities. argues \"The development ofx-ray technology obliterated the distinction between theouter were thepractitioner with additional aids with which toenhance andobjectify clinical diagnosis. However, the use of mammography canalso introduce anumber ofproblems into theclinical understanding and management ofbreast conditions. These problems stem from theradiologist's interpretation ofbreast changes and from the clinician's interpretation ofthe mammographic report. When the mammogram has been interpreted bytheradiologist asclearly representing anabnormal area that ispossibly malignant and when the practitioner reaches asimilar suspicion during thephysical examination, abiopsy will berecommended toconfirm thesuspected diagnosis. Inthis case, there isnot much clinical uncertainty about what changes mean and about what should bedone. The meaning of mammographic signs andclinical signs isunambiguous. However, the clinical situation becomes less certain when the meaning of mammographic signs for theradiologist, areless clear. That is, when the shadows could beinterpreted aseither normal orabnormal depending upon anumber first from thepoint ofmammograms isfraught the same problems the clinician faces when conducting aphysical exam. Interpretation is influenced bytheexperience oftheradiologist, thephilosophical isnot aperfect science. There areerrors involved. Some cancers just don't show upand sometimes they look asthough they're benign and some benign aremalignant andit's, one I'm concerned don't like the looks ofthat. I can't really explain precisely why but I'm not happy with that.\" So, you need acombination oftechnically good images and an interested interpreter who has had some experience. Amammographic image can beinterpreted bytheradiologist as being more orless suspicious depending onanumber ofinfluencing factors. Forexample, oneradiologist explained that the most difficult kinds ofimages tointerpret were those ofbenign disease. For these information. Ithink theflagrant cancers are theeasiest andbenign disease the most difficult....We make determinations time onthe basis post mammograms, what their family histories arelike, ifthey've hadprevious breast surgery, what their current complaint is,etcetera, etcetera. All ofthese things are designed tolet meknow ifthis woman falls into ahigh risk category ornot and what are theclinical, physical, findings, because youcan't interpret these inavacuum. And then ifIseesomething that I'mnotcomfortable with and say,\" This woman is33years old andshe's had amother and a sister with breast andshe's had aprevious woman who isthe same age, has hadsixchildren, nofamily history, andfatty breasts. This rather lengthy quote illustrates how theradiologists takes into account many different kinds ofinformation intheinterpretation ofamammographic image. Finally, radiologists know that there is always thepossibility that their interpretations will bewrong. And they attempt toconvey negative andatthe same andthree exclude breast cancer and should notdeter thefurther evaluation ofpositive physical findings. Most people puttheir report. They say, \"Statistically atthis institution, wehave 22% false positives and 9%false you should bear this inmind intheinterpretation ofthereport.\" Ithink most surgeons know these numbers, we've certainly published ours and made them clear toeverybody. Insum, much clinical uncertainty inthediagnosis and management ofpatients stems from uncertainty andambiguity inradiologic interpretations. More often than not, these uncertainties increase the chances that asurgical biopsy will beconducted inattempts tobring surgeons explained: Iuse zeromammography, but Idon't fully trust that. That's gift touseither. Ihadthree patients come inwith negative zeromammograms, with lumps that didn't show uponthe zeromammogram, and they have had cancer with anabsolutely negative zeromammogram! And, Ihave had ahell ofalot of patients with avery onepatient who had aroutine scan, some calcifications, and she did indeed have incindentally theradiologist wants tocover himself, reports something that's suspicious and suppose youdon't take itout? Then where are you? Then where are youifitisreally something significant? The problem comes inwith avague like guarantee, abiopsy isneeded. These quotes illustrate that although mammography extends the clinical perception ofthebody, itdoes notnecessarily lend clinical certainty todiagnosis and management. Inthefinal analysis, the diagnosis ofbreast conditions isamicroscopic one, dependent upon biopsy. Ironically, the very search forcertainty through the use ofa non-invasive technology such asmammography, often results ingreater uncertainty thus leading tosurgical intervention. The dilemmas faced bythesurgeon intheinterpretation and management ofbreast rise byMicroscopic patterns tolarger relationships ofthe whole body. Amicroscopic slide isentirely comparable tothex-ray physician technique that canprovide adefinitive of breast tissue issurgically removed, itissent toapathologist for diagnosis. Inferences drawn from pathological analysis areoften clear asthesigns ofmost forms ofbreast cancer and many benign conditions speak clearly tothepathologist. Inthese situations, the practitioner haslittle problem translating pathological findings to have clinical relevance. However, clincial certainty about the meaning ofapathological change isnot always tobehad. This has become more problematic as technological advances have allowed forfiner discrimination oftissue changes. Although finer changes can bedetected, thescientific and clinical understanding about the meaning ofthese changes realtionship toadisease entity has lagged behind. Theresult isthat ithas become unclear where the line between normal and abnormal should bedrawn. Thus, although microscopic analysis produces supposedly objective, indirect ways ofperceiving thebody, understanding the clinical significance about what isdetected under themicroscope is often difficult. Surgeons described three major problems encountered when utilizing biopsies toincrease clinical certainty. First, itisoften difficult forthesurgeon todecide when findings toBiopsy: When toperform abiopsy isperhaps most problematic tworeasons fordoing this. The first istogain amore definitive diagnosis and the second isto remove theclinical sign, the physical condition that gives rise to clinical uncertainty. There isgeneral agreement that anydominant mass should beremoved. However, amass interviewed were very concerned about theproblems ofconducting unnecessary biopsies but they felt that therisks ofdoing nothing in the face forbiopsy interms ofpathological tobefibrocystic breasts. Soitwould be nice toreduce thepool ofpeople who have that turn out mymedical attitude that anysolid lump should beremoved, needle, mammogram, et cetera, so, I'mnotlikely trouble. Iknow there is abiopsy they may befairly sure that the lump isnotmalignant. Asurgeon explained the way this problem: Ifshe has adominant lump Iremove it. Itell way ortheother they have togetrid ofit. I'mcompulsive. . .I get rid ofall lumps. Idon't watch lumps. And alotof people do. Igetsent alot ofcases where somebody's been following for 6months, It's cancer. A lot ofpeople his bycutting out a lump. Certainty isbrought about byremoving thephysical condition that gives rise totheclinical uncertainty. The following quotes serve further toillustrate this dilemma: Itend toberather aggressive about doing biopsies and sometimes Iget alittle guilty about that. Andthen, you know, you have a situation where Ifeel alittle bitguilty and then tohave tosay, know, there was.... there were Orinsome cases, Both thepatient and thedoctor now aretrapped ina different environment than they were before when allthis possibility existed [referring topathological diagnosis]. And there isnowaythat one can examine apatient unless you take something out and look atitunder themicroscope. Both the doctor and thepatient feel more comfortable doing something. If youdon't youmight hit who ifyoudon't doanything about ityou're in legal problems. What other kinds ofactions could surgeons take tocut down on their risk inthe face ofuncertainty? One such answer would befor surgeons toacknowledge andshare their uncertainties with their patients andthus, share theresponsibility fordecision making. Several surgeons said that when they felt that abiopsy was not warranted but they could not besure, that they shared this uncertainty with thepatient and then lether make upher mind about what should be done. Two surgeons expressed this more conservative approach to biopsying. Both ofthese surgeons were older, hadspecialized in breast conditions, were more confident about their ability toconduct a good physical examination, andbelieved that they had good -124with patient and that it's my obligation tomyself andtothepatient tosee them again, maybe once every three orsix months for areasonable length oftime and make sure that I'mnotmissing something. And another surgeon felt more strongly: Unnecessary biopsies Idon't understand. I've seen women come in because they're fibrocystic. Nowfibrocystic lumps come and go and come and goandifthat patient goes toasurgeon who lops out every lump before present, seen some patients who have had 17biopsies. And they come inwith their 18th breast lump. Now Idon't know what the heck isgoing onbecause their breasts look like hand grenades went have scars ontheoutside andthey're know what it's terrible. With this last quote, itisinteresting tonote that while unnecessary biopsies may cut down onaclinician's risk byreducing current clinical uncertainty, they can atthe same time act toincrease future risk anduncertainty. This last surgeon explains that with women with multiple biopsies, itisdifficult for him toknow what he ispalpating. Abiopsy often leaves ascar andscar tobiopsy. However, inthe case ofgeneral lumpiness, knowing what tobiopsy becomes more problematic. One surgeon explained: Well, multiple lumps are always alittle unnerving because you know that they allaren't cancer but you know that there could be one, sort ofhanging around inamong theothers. And you know you Sothequestion isif I'mgoing tobiopsy, what doIbiopsy? Andusually when end upnotbiopsying atall. -125-Andfinally another surgeon explained: Itiswhen andits know where tobiopsy. You allthat way. ...The ones who come inhere with alot of lumps here andthere are for themost part going tobebenign because breast cancer doesn't present that way very often. But they're worrisome because youjust got toprove it, you know. Thus, intheinitial stages ofdeciding whether ornot tocontinue further along thediagnostic path, clinicians are faced with much uncertainty about what and when tobiopsy. 4.4d Needle Biopsies: The most common method ofobtaining amicroscopic diagnosis isby surgically breast tissue through However, aneedle biopsy isaprocedure whereby tissue can beobtained without the need for asurgical procedure. Inthis research, Ifound that needle biopsies generated the most controversy ofallscreening anddiagnostic procedures. Many ofthesurgeons used this procedure selectively asthey felt that itcould not befully trusted togive accurate results. One surgeon explained: Iuseitselectively. With this lady this morning, her lump is really very small and Iwould beafraid that Iwould ruin the specimen ifItried toaspirate besides having itbedifficult to besure you're getting into Ifit's negative, help meprepare the patient more. Another surgeon explained hisreservations: I'll tell you myfeeling about it. I've always been less than sure about itbecause number one, ifit's malignant, yougot to because you have a benign cytology and then you have amalignancy that's continuing togrow andwhether you've really ofabind! \u2014126Asurgeon who was inprivate practice said that hefelt that too many needle biopsies were being conducted attheuniversity hospital and that women were being subjected toanunnecessary anduncomfortable procedure. Well, when Iseepeople inconsultation, itcomes down with fibrocystic followed many patients, ...I've been inpractice for 25years now and many patients Ihave followed for 15and 20 years. Every three orfour months Imaptheir lumps andI've never biopsied. But when Igetsuspicious, when I'm not sure what I'mfollowing, Ithink they need abiopsy...The thought that I'm going todepend onaneedle going into this trust the random needling ofasuspicious lesion. Ifitspositive then that's terrific, that's allright but you going todoifit's negative? And Ihave had anumber been tothinking needed Iamnotthat worried about. It's kinda ofajudgement that I don't understand. Another young surgeon was outspoken ofme. test. I never doit. Idon't care what isdone anywhere else inthe world. you ofafine isabiopsy. So, thepatients wind uphaving two procedures anditsworthless. Other surgeons stated that they felt that needle aspirations were ofsome use asdiagnostic procedures. aspiration isthat ifyouget back fluid and the mass goes away, then theproblem stops. Itanswers thethird thefine needle biopsy shows unless itshows cancer. Ifitshows cancer says inandtalk about treatment. Mygoal have cancer. Which isadifferent way ofapproaching itthan toprove that she does have acancer. Other surgeons explained that the use ofaneedle biopsy was important asitprovided additional information concerning the need forfurther diagnostic procedures aswell andinformation fortreatment andpatient management. Several could doimmediately intheir offices. Oneexplained: Ihave been using thefine needle more inthelast 6 months orsoandit's just something Ican dohere intheoffice very easily anditdoesn't toquell their Imean, ittells me information that Ineed touse patient. One ofthenurses who worked atthebreast screening clinic atthe university hospital explained that they used needle biopsies because they were relatively cheap, easy toperform anditallowed them to continue toconduct ahigh number acancer. Wedeal with lots ofpatients alot Basically intheoverall surgical community, you're doing 5benign biopsies for every cancer, which isthe wayit really should ifyou more. Butbiopsies andit's very difficult to decide (whether ornot todoone). That's why welike needle aspiration cause it's relatively easy. have topursue everything because cancer isoutthere. It's there and you have tofind it.Ifyouwaittill it's obvious, then you've lost, you've lost the game and that's it. For the most part, thepreferred method ofdiagnosis wassurgical biopsy. Surgeons reported that needle biopsies were good forproviding additional information about what asurgical biopsy might show and to alleviate the concerns ofpatients when abenign condition was suspected. However, needle biopsies canprovide asomewhat less invasive biopsy procedure that can beused bypractitioners other than surgeons. Onegynecologist explained: Fine needle aspirates have been around along time. . .Inagood interpretive setting, they have agood pathologist. It's helpful inthat ifthe mass iscystic anditcompletely goes away, the patient walks out oftheoffice extremely relieved and the problem isresolved. Ifitturns out tobenot acyst andthere are actual cells there, it's spread andprocessed and sent tothe lab. Ifitcomes ..You toknow what thetool isand when it's useful. It's agood screening test. It's nice tosend someone toabreast surgeon, like call upJohn Smith and say, \"John, Isaw awoman today. She had aone centimeter mass anddid aspirate. It's cancer.\" He can then know tosee herthat day, it's anadjunctive test. Butit's ahelpful test. That's may needle biopsy toattempt ownuncertainties exactly itisheorshe isfeeling. It's thegrey area inbetween. You know, itfeels kinda and Idon't know what I'mfeeling. Idon't really feel adominant lump yetitdoesn't feel the same astheother side andthe same thing bothers women. Idon't know what I'mfeeling....That's where Ithink these. ...thefine 4.4e Interpretation ofBiopsy Results: Once the surgeon has conducted abiopsy, most often his orher uncertainties will beput torest once heorshereceives thepathology report. Ifthediagnosis ismalignant then the surgeon must begin to negotiate atreatment program with the woman. Ifthediagnosis is benign, then thesurgeon must interpret themeaning ofabenign diagnosis andnegotiate amanagement Sometimes, however, represent anarea ofmuch controversy and uncertainty. Surgeons arecognizant ofthefact that there isa certain amount ofsubjective influence when pathologists interpret biopsy samples. One surgeon explained: You have [MEANING?] Hecalls positive when would call them negative. Inother words, histhermostat issetdifferently. Hetends to over ifyour pathologist tends toover call orunder call. You know, been inthebusiness, having watched some ofthese pathologists around .. had nobackfires. Hehasn't made amistake. And I've seen some other ones with plenty ofmistakes. [OH REALLY2 INTERMS OF BOTH OVER CALLING AND UNDER CALLING?] Rarely, over...well, there's onedoctor intown that's doing a research program asyou know, that tends toover call lobular. Because alot Haagensen forinstance. Now you take hisslides around and half ofthe the stuff he's called lobular carcinoma in situ, theother call inthe week. -130-Another surgeon expressed similar feelings asheexplained: Thequestion is, how much treatment isnecessary for anearly cancer? isatthis point, noonereally know that ifyoutreat thetotal breast, with carcinoma are notinfallible. There can beone break inthe membrane makes aninvasive cancer that was ononeslice bythe inthe same surgeon that hewassympathetic tothe pathologist's dilemma: What has happened iswehave suddenly given tothepathologist a spectrum ofthedisease they have noknowledge of. Uncertainty concerning the meaning ofclinical, radiological, and pathological findings brings thesurgeon face toface with many dilemmas ofpatient treatment, management, andprognosis. These uncertainties give rise totheclinical management ofrisk, both risk asunderstood toreside within patients and theclinician's own personal risk ofbeing wrong. The language ofrisk iscentral when clinician's talk about management, it,all anduncertainties ofclinical thought andpractice. begin Aswehave seen, theclinical management ofwomen with benign and malignant breast conditions isoften conducted within acontext of uncertainty concerning themeanings ofsuch conditions. Because of -131-this, cannot know abenign condition will goontodevelop acancer. Neither can thesurgeon know with any accuracy, the\"best\" treatment for awoman diagnosed with amalignant condition. Thus, theclinician isfaced with thetask ofmanaging and treating both what isknown and what cannot beknown. Theclinician is responsible andbeing unable to predict the outcome ofagiven condition. When moving from diagnosis tomanagement andtreatment, clinicians continue tobefaced with uncertainty. Here, conditions. Asurgeon may choose one ormore management options. thesurgeon that acondition anyrisk toa woman's health, heorshe may simply donothing. Second, the surgeon may decided that thecondition represents some risk but not enough to warrent abiopsy. Inthis case, thesurgeon maydecide that the woman should befollowed. Third, theclinician can recommend anumber of less invasive intervention procedures such asvitamin Etherapy, removing caffeine products from awoman's diet, prescribing diuretics and insome cases, hormone treatment. Fourth, the surgeon maydecide that thecondition represents enough risk tobebiopsied orremoved. In this situation, abiopsy represents both adiagnostic aswell as a treatment procedure. Finally, inextreme cases, asurgeon may recommend that awoman consider aprophylactic mastectomy. This last management procedure consists oftheclinical act ofremoving risk by -132-physically removing thebreast. Here, mastectomy isatreatment for risk ofbreast cancer, not for thedisease itself. The treatment of risk will 6. 4.5a Conveying aDiagnosis: AsIwill discuss inthe next chapter, women expressed much distress concerning the ways inwhich they were given their diagnosis. Both women who received benign and those who received malignant diagnoses felt that for the most part, their doctors did notaddress their personal concerns. Most benign biopsy results were given towomen over the phone bythenurses orreceptionist. While several surgeons explained how they experienced having totell awoman that herbiopsy results were malignant, only one surgeon explained how hegave women a diagnosis ofabenign condition andsaid that hetried toemphasize that thediagnosis did not mean that thepatient would get cancer. In fact, hesaid that hetried normalcy the range ofnormal. And Itell them, \"What that really means isthat you have breasts that will make lumps from time totime anditwill make thediscovering ofthe breast ca. ..,ofmore serious conditions, more difficult, 'cause your breasts areharder andlumpier. You're going tohave pain in them that will create anxiety inyou even though thepain isn't a terribly worrisome symptom. Itwill focus your attention onyour breasts and soitisbad for those reasons and not because it means you have agreater chance ofgetting cancer. This surgeon reported being sensitive tothe mixed messages that women aregiven when they receive adiagnosis offibrocystic disease andexplained that these clear 5,the ofbeing labeled ofgiving name and which at the same time isnot ofhealth. One surgeon believed meanings ofbenign conditions, women will notbelieve that abenign diagnosis gives them aclean bill ofhealth. It's not adifficult thing todotoassure awoman that she does not have breast cancer. That's what they want tohear andso, you know, ifthere isaspecific complaint like pain orlumpiness here orthere, you canassure them that ifthey feel this way, that this isaquite common natural phenomena, part ofbeing awoman. Inmany tosee that everything's still OK. Many ofthesurgeons reported that they found itdifficult to inform awoman tending give favorable news. You know, toallay anxiety until wehave the biopsy result. And Idothat even during thebiopsy when something out andsay, \"Ohshit, that looks like acancer.\" AndI'll tell them, \"Ah, you know, youcan't tell, come back tothe office tomorrow andI'll have all themicroscopic reports atthat point. .. .You know, talk toyou tomorrow.\" Nobody ever taught me, . ..you know. That isstill avery very uncomfortable situation for meandit's terrible forthepatient. ...Itell Idon't know thefuture, nobody knows thefuture. Ifthey believe inGod, God knows the future and I'm sure ashell not God. And so Itell them, \"What weknow now, moment Andyes, it -134isthe biopsy tosay, \"Well, this iswhat wefound.\" It's usually not that Iwouldn't say. It's jarring butits, inawayit's gentler than theother thing when they woke upfrom thegeneral anesthesia and thebreast was gone. Here, the surgeon speaks from hispast experiences ofonestep procedures inwhich thebreast was removed atthe same time ofthe biopsy. Finally, twosurgeons explained how they think women react when they receive adiagnosis ofcancer. I've always been very impressed with how much courage women have, ...patients have. How well they tolerate being told. Now they may break down later you know. Maybe itdoesn't hit them right atthe time but most ofthem that come for abiopsy have thought ofthis andthis iswhat they've been scared about. I just tell them, \"I'm sorry but you know, It's what wehoped it wasn't.\" Itry not touse the word asmuch hope asIcan. \"It's alittle thing.\" Anything that's good about it. Itry totell them the good features. And then I try tosay, \"Wedon't have thefull story until information tothe than that pamphlet does (referring tothepamphlet published bytheState ofCalifornia). Now what thepatient remembers, isanother factor. And they probably don't remember. ..I realize that after the words cancer, operation, mastectomy, the hearing goes off. Andthere arestudies toprove allthis. They're thinking, while you're sitting there talking about the risks oftheoperation, they're sitting there thinking about who's going totake care ofthe dog forthenext 10days, who's going to pay thebills, you know, all theother factors involved with anyone going into thehospital. AsIwill show inthenext chapter, for women, thereceiving itbebenign ormalignant, isatransition point from onestate ofhealth into another. The time between abiopsy and receiving isonefraught with much anxiety. Itcan -135\u00ba \u00ba \u00bapatient attention isgiven to phases ofdiagnosis, treatment, andprognosis, little attention hasbeen given tothetransitions between these phases. For patients, these transitions are thepoints atwhich thedoctor has the most control. There may benoeasy way torelay adiagnosis ofcancer; however, asIwill show, women with both benign andmalignant conditions experienced this transition phase asone ofthemost difficult. Clinicians need tobebetter equipped todeal with these uncomfortable situations. 4.5b Patient Management Decisions: Once aclinician has reached adiagnosis and has conveyed this to the woman, heorshe must decide upon some sort oftreatment or management procedure. When asurgeon isfairly certain that the condition iscompletely benign and does notrepresent much risk of breast cancer, nomanagement procedure will beundertaken. However, often thesurgeon can not besure that thecondition isone oflowrisk and must decide just what kind ofmanagement procedure will bethe safest and most acceptable. There exists agreat deal ofconfusion as tothebest types ofprocedures forbenign conditions procedure ischosen based upon they type orextent ofbenign disease a woman has orhow much atrisk she ofgreatest confusion. It really is...She has seen hergynecologist and maybe ageneral surgeon. Maybe she's had abiopsy and oramammogram which shows this data which puts her inquote, increased oratincreased risk. There's all therisk factors andyou know solets sayshe's now been atincreased fordeveloping cancer or that shehas abiopsy that shows atypical cells. That's the common thing. Now, well, what does she do? She's told byone doctor, \"Don't doanything, She's told by\u00ba > -136another doctor, \"Gee, maybe you should have this kind ofsurgery. And another doctor says, \"No, you should have that kind of surgery.\" Anditbecomes areal confusing area. Thus, uncertainty and ambiguity intheclinical understanding of benign conditions leads touncertainty inmanagement. And management ofbenign conditions istreated bydoctors largely asmanagement of risk rather than asthe management ofaphysical condition itself. The danger ofbenign conditions lies intheir relationship tobreast cancer. AsIhave explained, benign conditions canact tohide current cancer orcanprogress into afuture cancer. Doctors's management ofbenign conditions centers upon reducing thecondition so that hidden cancers can bemore readily detected and sothat therisks ofafuture breast cancer can bereduced. However, there islittle that surgeons can dotoreduce the amount ofbenign disease short of physically removing it. Thus, inmany cases, thesurgeon will recommend close follow upofawoman. Inthis manner, the surgeon can keep aclose surveillance over awoman's breasts and become familiar with anychanges which might signify cancer. The following surgeons explained their reasons forclose medical surveillance oftheir patients: There arecertain patients ofcourse alittle more about and youjust have tofrankly express that you're alittle more worried about them and they just have toresign themselves toaroutine ofclose follow upandbiopsy when necessary, mammograms when indicated. I've followed many patients... I've been inpractice for 25years now and many patients Ihave followed for 15, 20years. Every three orfour months and maptheir lumps andI've never biopsied. When Igetsuspicious, when I'm not sure what I'mfollowing, I think they need abiopsy. ...Idon't believe that way that wegot asyetthat thesurgeons, inatotally safe attitude. The closest that Iknow ofistheattitude that I learned from Dr.Black. You follow your patients carefully ina concerned way, and Isee most ofthese people, they come inevery three orfour months andit's incredible how lumps will change.\u00ba -137-Finally, one surgeon explained that hefollows many ofhispatients diagnosed with minimal cancers. Recall from chapter 3that there exists much controversy over the meaning ofthese conditions andtheir management. I've got about 35women I'mwatching now. the way from ductal insitu tolobular insitus. And Ionly had one and Ihave them come in3times ayear, medium risk, twice a year. Other than that, once ayear. Idon't see them anyless than ayear. Thepoints tobemade arethat not becertain that abenign condition ofremoving thebreast andthus, surgeons maintain close medical surveillance over physical conditions about which they areuncertain. Some clinicians explained that they doattempt togive women some advice onthings they can doto possibly reduce the amount ofbenign disease. Atthe time ofthis research, several clinical studies were 1981). thereduction and theaddition ofvitamin Ehad nostatistically significant effect on thecondition. Nonetheless, some surgeons recommended these therapies towomen. While these therapies represent two ofthepossible ways that women might beable toreduce their amount ofbenign breast disease, ithas not been shown that they will reduce therisk ofbreast cancer. Therefore, most ofthesurgeons wewere intreating how todo. Nowat least wecantell them some ofthetheories about it. Maybe take them off ofvarious things like coffee andcaffeine andchocolate and give them some vitamins. For alotofthem itdoes benefit. Anurse practitioner explained: There's not awhole lot you can doabout prevention. Isay, now look, ongeneral principal, you can keep your caffeine intake down. Idon't know ifthis isgoing tochange anything. You can keep your fat inyour diet down. You can check your ownbreasts. Imean it's notprevention but you can dothese things. Basically there's not alot you can dotoprevent it.. ..Most women realize that they can't prevent thething is,that most ofusdon't think we'll getitsomost ofusare not concerned about preventing it. Some women are concerned about preventing breast cancer because of their having been diagnosed with abenign condition which brings the possibility ofbreast cancer that much closer tothe women's lived reality. Akey issue tounderstanding themedical management ofbenign conditions concerns the way inwhich surgeons think about these physical changes. Inwhom orwhat does language ofbreast health centers primarily upon theorgan rather than the person. Again, this will beclearly illustrated inchapter 6but here itisinteresting toexamine the language used todescribe benign andmalignant afile onall ofthebenign breast conditions, alphabetically. Ifill out abreast sheet which you might be interested inseeing. Here isthe form I've adopted. They're all just listed alphabetically astowhat their problems were. And so Ihave apretty good record ofall these cases. There must be about athousand. Ofcourse you have the whole gamut ofthe problem astothe type ofbreast you see and what you dowith them and how you follow them and when youdecide they ought tobe s T-139-biopsied and when you know they arecysts orhave apretty good idea they arecysts inthis the language ofrisk anddiseases being located organ, the breast. What isimportant here isthat surgeons donotjust manage women with risk, but more specifically, they manage breasts atrisk. Breast cancer isasystemic disease anditscause ismost probably toprevent breast cancer byaltering specific factors inawoman's environment, the focus becomes reduced tothesite ofthe disease. Ifclinicians cannot alter thecontext which produces thedisease, then management is directed towards thephysical site where thedisease becomes manifest. Theresult isthat clinical uncertainty becomes removed from thewider scientific context, condensed and reduced into risk which isthen seen toreside within aspecific physical part ofthe body. Through this process, clinical uncertainty becomes transformed into adisease entity, can belocated within thephysical body and isnow open to manipulation bytheclinician. Risk then represents thetransformation ofclinical uncertainty into aclinical entity. Risk, orclinical uncertainty, can now beclinically managed, brought under close surveillance, orremoved alltogether. This brings option open tosurgeons inpatient through biopsy orfine needle aspiration. While needle andsurgical biopsies are done primarily toobtain amore definitive diagnosis, they also often result inremoving asuspicious lump. They can, therefore, beconsidered atreatment procedure one. One forbreast* s\u00ba R -140cysts istoaspirate fluid, thereby getting in risk cancer. can sometimes cause discomfort ina woman andgetting rid ofthecyst does indeed relieve both thedoctor's and woman's fears ofcancer. However, cysts will often disappear on their removed byneedle aspiration isnot thought toremove therisk ofbreast cancer. The following explained totreat cysts: Iexamine Iput aneedle initand out andthat results intotal disappearance lump. can nowconsider that examination tobeconsistent with fibrocystic disease. AsIhave shown, surgeons use fine needle aspiration both asa diagnostic tool and asatreatment procedure. AsIhave argued, surgeons also conduct biopsies both toobtain amore definitive diagnosis andtoremove thephysical condition giving rise tothe uncertainty. They thereby obtain clinical certainty byremoving tissue atrisk. While, intheory, some conditions may bemore benign others, inpractice, all conditions areconsidered torepresent Ithink inthebreast arepremalignant changes and then there arecertain other changes that Ithink have avery benevolent togetitout. So, have to payattention towhat isdangerous and what may bedangerous. Surgeons have been trained tocarry outtherapeutic procedures which involve removing abnormal ordiseased tissue anditisdifficult for them toleave inthebreast, tissue that isnotmalignant but at the same time not\"normal\". The same surgeon quoted above went onto explain: Yourealize that asasurgeon, you've been brain washed abit...I derive acertain degree ofcomfort getting rid oftissue that has already proved itself tobeabadactor. always considered that inacertain number tomake that upwith very fine looking breasts and thepremalignant orthe early isnotspeaking oftreating clearly malignant conditions, but rather about those that are non-invasive and premalignant. These conditions arenotlife threatening inand of themselves; they dorepresent arisk ofinvasive breast cancer andtherefore, within the surgical tobetreated. Inother words, thepremalignant therisk byremoving thepremalignant condition. However, thesurgeon above also the dilemma hefaces; that although hehastreated onebreast, there isanother and what ever caused thepremalignant condition intheone, might also cause apremalignant condition inthe -142-other. Surgeons cannot remove the cause ofthecondition, they can only remove thecondition. The assumptions made bythesurgeon are that what ever caused thepremalignant condition might also cause breast cancer. Breast cancer might progress through different stages oftissue change andtherefore, since there isnoway tochange the underlying cause, surgeons continue toremove tissue that isdifferent from normal. Aswehave seen, there ismuch controversy over what should be defined asnormal anditisnotclear that the same factors that cause breast cancer, cause premalignant orbenign conditions. However, surgeons remove this uncertainty, ortheir risk ofbeing wrong and the woman's risk ofapossible cancer, byremoving thecondition itself. Surgeons assume that thecondition isthevisible manifestation of invisible causes. Surgeons remove not a\"disease\" butrather a\"risk\" ofadisease. Ironically, surgeons also know that they donot remove alltherisk andthis requires that they keep close surveillance on their patients sothat they will beable tocatch thecancer early acontext ofuncertainty concerning themeanings ofbenign conditions. These uncertainties stem from ambiguities inthescientific understanding ofthese conditions and from clinical uncertainties associted-ith theclinician's ability to detect abnormal changes within thebreast andwith his orherability tounderstand themeaning ofthese entail clinical risk, andthepractice ofmedicine -143-entails clinical risk taking. However, thedominant medical model does not allow foruncertainty. Rather, itrequires certainty atallcosts. Signs must beclassified into diagnostic categories anddiagnostic categories must identify disease anddisease must beremoved. Within the dominant clinical model, clinical risk becomes transformed into a clinical entity residing notwithin clinical practice norwithin the clinician, but rather within thepatient. Clinicians transform their ownrisks into thepatient's lived risk. Women are seen ascarriers of risk, tissue becomes defined asbeing atrisk. Part ofthis problem isdue tothefact thecurrent models ofmedical thinking andpractice are notable todeal with. Clinicians learn how to memorize knowledge. They areexpected todecode signs anddiscover underlying realities are inherent inmedical knowledge andpractice, yetthese denied. Clinicians can isthat into aclinical entity, asign ofadisease. can then be removed with thescalpel. Orthetissue atrisk can followed sothat ifitchanges and becomes more itcan betreated. Clinical risk gives rise totheclinical creation ofanewdisease entity whereby patients arediagnosed with risk and then treated toremove risk. Clinical uncertainty, then, becomes transformed into theclinical management ofrisk. Tounderstand this process more fully, Iturn now toexploring women's experiences ofbenign breast disease andbeing at risk forbreast cancer. -144-CHAPTER 5:RISK, AMBIGUITY, AND THE MEANING OFLUMPS: LAY EXPERIENCES OF BENIGN DISEASE 5.1 INTRODUCTION: Molly is27years old and dying from breast cancer. Sheshouldn't be. Shefirst noticed alump inherbreast when she and her toworry, acyst. Five years later, inextreme pain andunable towalk, Molly was diagnosed ashaving breast cancer. Ihadthis little knot and Ithought, \"I'm sure it's nothing.\" But sometimes you need tokeep onthese things, like cysts can grow into tumors. about itatall. itwas OK,it was my physical, Iwould let thedoctor know... Ialways made mention of thefact that cyst and Ialways made mention ofthe fact that Ihadirregular menstrual cycles just because Ifigured the more information they received, thebetter. But maybe because Ididn't have aconsistent doctor every year, they never thought much ofit...Then Iwas only 21or22and they probably figured, \"Oh, tobe concerned about... Ithink they weren't conscientious enough and that really bugs mebecause that iswhat wepay them for. That's what they gotoschool for. And even ifapatient doesn't come in andsay, \"Well, give meabiopsy,\" they should say, \"Well, acyst? And how long have you hadthis? Well, maybe weshould take a biopsy just tosee.\" You know, Idon't care how young you are or what. That really makes meangry because Ithink that maybe this could have been prevented. Molly had none oftheclassic risk factors forbreast cancer. She isyoung, black, andhas nofamily history ofthedisease. Benign breast lumps are common inyoung women, breast cancer isnot. Within -145thesix months cancer, Molly underwent amastectomy, anovariectomy, radiotherapy, andchemotherapy. She not know how long she has tolive. Fiona is44years old and has been diagnosed with a\"serious\" benign breast condition. She has hadseveral biopsies that have been diagnosed asmammary dysplasia. Fiona iscurrently close medical surveillance andmust seeherdoctor every 3months. Although shehas been told that what isserious, implications ofherdisease. Handing meone said that there areother things, mammary dysplasia for one, Idid not not the hell sure what it isIgot. ..Atanyrate hehas been seeing menowevery acouple ofcysts intheleft breast which hehasaspirated. Now today Iwas up there and hefound one intheright breast which hefelt was a little bit more ofalump than itshould have been. ...that more water should have come out ofitthan did. Buthe's going tosend what little fluid that hedidget tothepathologist again and I won't have their report till Wednesday. Ithas been anongoing saga now for twoyears. AsIsay, heputs meonpins myself, Sandy, Ihave told myself, Iwill not think about this anymore... Butitnever goes away. Itisalways there. Fiona has many risk factors forbreast cancer. She is44years ofage, never married, has nochildren, and been given adiagnosis ofmammary dysplasia. While itisclear that Fiona does not have cancer, neither issheconsidered tobehealthy. Rather, she has been diagnosed tobeathigh risk andbreast cancer. tragic, Onemight pause toconsider thephysical andpsychological consequences ofFiona's constant medical Molly and Fiona both share isalack ofcontrol notonly over medical knowledge butalso over medical uncertainty. Inthis chapter, Iexplore how lay women experience andunderstand medical uncertainty concerning thediagnosis, management, andprognosis ofbreast conditions. The focus here isnot somuch has control over knowledge, butrather, of what isnot known. Thecreation ofknowledge lays bare thelimits to that knowledge. Because scientists andclinicians have access to knowing thelimits ofknowledge they also have potential control over theconsequences oftheapplication ofincomplete knowledge. However, laypeople not only have little access tomedical knowledge butalso little opportunity toappreciate what isnot known. This makes it difficult for laypeople toevaluate theextent towhich uncertainties expressed bytheir doctors arise from thedoctor's personal lack of knowledge (that is,the knowledge does exist but thedoctor isnot familiar with it), oramore general lack ofknowledge within science andclinical practice. This lack oflayknowledge about what can and cannot beknown results inalack oflaycontrol over theconsequences ofuncertainty. The aim ofthis chapter istoexplore women experience this -147ambiguous state between health andillness. Aphenomenological approach reality object itself. However, ineveryday experience, reality isthe experiencing oftheobject. This points toafundamental gapthat exist between experience reality andscience's ofthat same reality (Rosenkrantz 1976). Asdiscussed in Chapter 2,medical anthropologists andsociologists have developed this perspective into explanatory models ofclinical and layperceptions of illhealth, thebiomedical dimensions being understood asdiseases and the laydimensions asillness. Itiswithin this framework that lay experiences ofbenign breast conditions will beexplored. Inthis chapter, Iwill first explore women's experiences ofwhen they first discovered their lump. The second section explores experiences ofdiagnosis andthethird concerns experiences of management andtreatment. Inthefourth section, Idiscuss issues of prognosis andprevention. 5.2 BETWEEN HEALTH AND ILLNESS: THE EXPERIENCE OF DISCOVERY Much has been written about why women delay seeking medical consultation when they discover alump intheir breasts. However, very little attention has been given towards understanding theexperiences -l48ofwomen who doseek medical consultation. The lack ofliterature in this area points tounderlying assumptions held bymany inthearea of clinical medicine andpublic health amajor problem detection ofbreast cancer isgetting women toseetheir doctors immediately ifthey discover alump. However, the problem does not stop there. Major dilemmas arise atthepoint when awoman seeks medical consultation. Inthis section Iexplore some ofthe dilemmas that women experience when they seek medical consultation about alump intheir breast. 5.2a Experiences ofDiscovery: Awoman may she alump herself \"I'm carried Ithought I thought about thearticles Ihad read that said theworst thing you can doisnotconfront it, goand see someone. It's that fear that leads tosomany deaths... Ithink that one ofthe reasons that look. Iwas ambivalent about having mybreasts touched. Itwaslike they were just these twothings onmybody that were alien beings and I wished Icould just getrid ofthem. Well, the shock offeeling something like that, that's totally foreign. You know, thesensation ofsomething that doesn't really... it's notsomething Ifelt thecyst inmybreast. Somebody else was examining meand she (the nurse practitioner) was there also. Shedidn't like the way that woman was examining me'cause shesaid, you outthis thickening inmybreast which I had not noticed atall...She wanted metocome back 2weeks after myperiod and she would check meagain. Well, that day Iwas so distressed bywhat shesaid, ...That whole thought that something might bewrong was sofrightening that Icouldn't figure out what todonext and Ireally realized why some women neglect doing anything cause you arejust immobilized byfear. Ireally felt vulnerable. 5.2b Seeing aSpecialist: Once awoman has made the decision toseek medical medical practitioners discover acondition about which they are uncertain, they usually refer women ontosurgeons specializing inthe diagnosis andtreatment ofbreast conditions. Asonegynecologist explained, there isreally noreason why most preliminary diagnostic procedures can not becarried out bythegeneralist. However, because theaccepted method oftreatment forbreast cancer recently surgery, treatment has been andcontinues tobethe domain ofsurgeons. All women inthis study were referred tosurgeons fordiagnostic work up. Women attending theuniversity hospital were referred totheBreast Screening Clinic which was apart ofthe -150-department ofsurgery and women attending theprivate hospital Asexplained inchapter thesetting oftheBreast Screening Clinic asthephysical provides animportant context in bringing meaning tobenign conditions. TheBreast Screening Clinic is located inthesurgical department ofahigh-rise clinic building. The building ispart ofalarge medical complex composed ofaconfusing array ofbuildings. Abusy traffic-choked divides the towers of andglass asdoctors, nurses andother health professionals dressed inwhite orblue coats walk purposefully from building to building. Young medical students rush totheir classes dodging patients inwheelchairs andgurnies. Elevators crowded with children and Deans, thesick and thehealthy connect underground parking lots with sterile high tech operating rooms. Each year there isthe rape intheparking lot andtheassault intheelevator. Finding atoilet experience. experience ofattending a clinic atthemedical center can beastressful andunhealthy experience. When awoman arrives atthemedical center, she immediately enters thehierarchical world ofthose who are diseased and those who cure disease. After sheenters theclinic building, she must take the elevator totheappropriate floor. Upon emerging from theelevator she ismet with asign informing herthat she isnow inthedepartment of surgery. One woman expressed her dismay atattending aBreast Screening Clinic which surgeons' names obviously they have only -151-One answer. Cause ifyou gotothesurgery clinic, youexpect surgery. What else can you expect? Breast screening clinics areheld onspecific days ofthe week, used problems ontheother days ofthe week. When awoman arrives, she must notify the receptionist andthen she may take aseat inthewaiting area. Seats and look through thelarge windows While waiting, women canobserve the comings andgoings ofthesurgeons andnurses although thearea is from thearea containing theexamining rooms . Although aspecialized clinic dealing only with breast problems is animportant service, itslocation andphysical setting explained that sheappreciated thefriendliness oftheclinic and the amount of Icalled upandsaid Ihad had towait and everybody wasreal nice... Ijust felt real informed. The Breast Screening Clinic employs twonurse practitioners who specialize inbreast problems. Their presence plays avital role in helping todiminish awoman's experience ofalienation and lack of control. The nurse practitioners explained tomethat their aims were togive women information and todiscuss their concerns rather than to \u2014152-carry out thetechnical aspects ofdiagnosis andtreatment. One woman explained that she wasdisappointed with herinitial experiences with theBreast Screening Clinic because she had not been able tofirst see anurse practitioner: Ididn't goover for acouple ofmonths because they (the clinic) were pretty filled up. Ididfinally get over there and was a little surprised that Ihad anappointment with the...well, I talked tothereceptionist said, \"well, since you're here forthis possible aspiration, and since you've already been examined, we'll just directly have you see thesurgeon.\" That was alittle tomebutit made supportive than Iexpected it. Ihad alittle anxiety going immediately to see the surgeon. Intheinitial stages ofmedical consultation, women want both information and acknowledgement oftheir psycho-social concerns. The nurse practitioners play avital role infulfilling these needs. There isagood deal ofanxiety surrounding theinitial discovery ofalump. Women areencouraged through thepublic health media to notify their doctors assoon asthey discover alump. Yet, sometimes women referred totheBreast Screening Clinic are notscheduled for immediate appointments. Anappointment will bedelayed ifawoman is considered atlowrisk forthe lump being malignant and/or she may be asked towait until two weeks after her next menstrual period, when her breasts are easier toexamine. While most women interviewed were able toschedule appointments immediately, those who were not able tosee someone immediately expressed much concern andanxiety. One woman, a student with noother health insurance, explained that after she had discovered her lump, she made anappointment with thestudent health -153service tosee asurgeon. Her appointment wascancelled had seeing asurgeon immediately. appointment with asurgeon which wascancelled twice cause the surgeon only comes had made amistake inthe schedule. Hewasn't going tobehere that awoman decides totake action towards resolving herbreast problem, she has begun totake control over her ownuncertainties and herhealth. However, ifshe isunable tosee adoctor immediately, tolose control. many women, theinability togain immediate access tomedical attention isthefirst step ingiving up control over their own self care. 5.2c Experiences ofaPhysical Examination: When awoman sees amedical practitioner concerning herbreast problem, one ofthefirst diagnostic procedures carried out isa physical exam. Intheprevious chapter, Idiscussed theproblems that clinicians face ofview, bymany women asa ofsome unknown Medical confirmation and interpretation ofthese symptoms asthis information helps women tobring meaning totheir ownexperiences. Atthe same time, however, women fear themedical interpretation might mean. They\"A -154-fear that theresults ofaphysical exam will only confirm their fears; that the lump will represent asign ofdisease totheclinician. Thus, while women want their symptoms interpreted into clear clinical signs, atthe same time, they hope that their symptoms will be be interpreted asnormal. They hope their lump will turn out tobenothing serious. One woman explained: Iwent toPlanned Parenthood and Iwaited toseeifthey would say anything when they did thebreast exam. And they didn't say anything. And soIsaid, \"Do anything funny over here?\" Iwasn't going Ididn't want to even then, toadmit there wasreally something there. SoIsaid, anything.\" Andthen, Ifelt very relieved. Even though Iknew perfectly well that something wasthere. But because they hadtold methere wasn't anything, Ifelt, \"Well, they must know, you know, these people dothese exams all the time !\" Inthefall Ithink, Istarted thinking, \"God only knows what its doing inthere !\"...I went again and they decided todo the whole routine again and again they didn't sayanything and again there.\" And Isaid, is, you know, can someone else doanexam?\" Soshe went and got someone higher uporwhatever who came inanddid the exam andsaid there was nothing Nowitisapretty tiny because these people ....Itwasn't until a year ago, Iwent infor myannual andthe woman did the exam and shesaid, ever talked toyou butI've seen doctors and you know, noproblem.\" And she looked very concerned and shesaid, \"Well, Ithink you have amore serious problem your breasts lumpy canfeel that it's can't feel all the way through. There's akind ofmass forming inyour breasts.\" This woman hasraised several important issues. First, she looked towards themedical profession tolegitimate andbring meaning toher own symptoms ofapossible illness. When her symptoms were not confirmed, sheattempted todismiss them. However, this wasdifficult asher alived reality toher. Second,\u00ba \u00ba -155because initially medical practitioners were unable toconfirm her symptoms, she did notfeel reassured that she did not have cancer. The thought ofhaving cancer isfrightening andthus, sheattempted to interpret the lack ofmedical confirmation asasign that she must have been allright. Third, when aclinician finally confirmed her own symptoms, she was confronted with having toaccept adisease label indicating that something inside ofher was not normal. Thus, she was faced with being medically labeled ashaving abnormally lumpy breasts. Another woman vented herclinician confirm her ownphysical mybreasts, they hadn't done itaswell asIcould of, which sorta bothered me cause Ithought ifthey were examining breasts, they would doit really well. Aswehave seen intheprevious chapter, conducting breast exams andinterpreting findings isoften difficult from aclinical point of view. However, thepublic health media and theliterature written for women informing them about breast conditions rarely raises this issue. The layliterature implies that thedoctor hasall the answers and therefore women tend believe that their doctors should beable to perform andinterpret aphysical exam with little problem. The very lack ofinformation available tolaywomen concerning theproblems facing theclinician acts further toremove women's control over their own health. Molly's tragic story presented atthebeginning ofthis chapter is avivid illustration ofwomen's alienation from knowledge and power. It isuseful here, tocontrast thefollowing three passages about breast health with statement istaken from -156aparticularly well-written booklet onbreast (Horowitz and Johnson 1982). The second istaken from anarticle concerning breast care published inawomen's journal, Family Circle (1983) andthethird from anarticle onbreast lumps published in another women's journal, Self (1982). Ifyou have anyquestions about how toperform breast self-examination orabout what you arefeeling when doing the exam, ask your doctor. Every breast abnormality should beexamined byadoctor. Ask him toexplain exactly what byyour doctor, forcertain it's benign ormalignant areaspiration and/or biopsy. Yet when adoctor first examines a lump, heorshe may simply sayreassuringly, \"It's nothing toworry about--its probably just acyst,\" before his orher suspicions about it's benign ormalignant. The most important factor iswhether ornot the growth seems togetlarger and smaller inconnection with themenstrual cycle. Cancerous tumors don't getsmaller. They usually grow, although sometimes they may stay the same size. Also, ifthe lump ismovable, it's more likely tobebenign. Cancerous growths tend tobefixed\" (p:28). Allthese quotes can lead women tobelieve that their doctors should have all the answers about breast conditions. They give nohint oftheunresolved issues concerning breast health nor oftheproblems clinicians face intranslating often ambiguous knowledge into practice. Unfortunately, theconsequences canresult inwomen dismissing their own symptoms andfailing topursue anuncertain diagnosis. For example, afew months before she was diagnosed with breast cancer, Molly became pregnant and had anabortion. During andafter thepregnancy, Molly's breast Shealso wassuffering from pain inherback, extreme fatigue and ageneral feeling ofill-health. In short, Molly felt sick. She went tosee agynecologist who then referred her toasurgeon. Molly \"Oh no, nonono,there's nothing. You know, Ithought, \"Oh! Whew!\"...The nipples were starting toinvert and you hard. Ithought, \"Well, this isjust not...\" And Ok, you he's talking about! Hedidn't say, \"Ithink should have a biopsy\" oranything like that. And Ididn't know what toask, come back and heagain story butrather with pointing outthat even when itbecame obvious to Molly, that something wasdrastically wrong with herbreast andher body, shestill continued thedoctor hadtold her wastrue, that she wasallright. Remember that Molly was young, she hadjust had anabortion and she was naive forthe most part about medical issues. Contrast Molly's statements with those ofKate, a woman older and more experienced with theworld ofmedicine. Kate was anewspaper reporter and hadcovered different types ofmedical issues. Aswith Molly, Kate discovered alump inherbreast while bathing and immediately went toawomen's clinic and saw anurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner referred her toasurgeon whospecialized Kate spot... Ihad back tothenurse adoctor inOakland who shesaid\u00ba - S. -158hadterrific hands, hewasreally good infeeling these things out and making decisions about what todosoIwent tosee him. He waswonderful. Really good, hewas Hetook methrough everything step bystep from benign breast disease to early diagnosis. Hewent through allthesteps and heexplained it would turn out mammogram itwasn't anything andspent alot oftime talking about benign breast disease, about coffee, vitamin Eand about alot of what hethought Ishould like tostress several points here. First, Kate saw a surgeon whospecialized inbreast problems, yet, based upon aphysical exam, hebelieved that the lump wasbenign. The choice ofabiopsy was left uptoKate; the surgeon gave herthat choice. Kate herself had a good deal ofknowledge about medical issues andfelt competent in choosing toundergo abiopsy. What issimilar about both Molly and Kate isthat both were considered tobeatlowrisk bytheir clinicians. What isdifferent isthat Kate was able totake control over theuncertainty inherent inthephysical diagnosis. Kate trusted herdoctor enough totake account ofthesmall amount ofclinical uncertainty and thus choose totake further diagnostic steps. Molly however, was less aware ofthediagnostic uncertainties andcontinued towant clinical S -159-risk and canresult inscarred breasts, making thedetection ofa breast cancer even more difficult. Biopsies canraise awoman's chances ofdying from breast cancer. Rather, thepoint isthat inorder to make informed andresponsible decisions, women need toknow about medical uncertainty. Lack ofknowledge ofmedical uncertainty raises a woman's risk ofover-medicalization onthe one hand and ofinsufficient medical follow knowledgeable ofthe aphysical exam, they position totake control over choosing whether ornot Experiences ofMammography: forthose who arethought tobeathigh risk and for women who have difficult breasts toexamine. When used appropriately, mammography ishighly effective inhelping recommended because ithas been estimated that exposure toradiation over long periods oftime can increase awoman's risk ofdeveloping breast cancer. While much research has been directed towards the medical risks andbenefits of mammography, little effort has been directed towards women's experiences ofthis procedure. Here, Iwill discuss women's experiences ofmammography with a focus upon issues ofuncertainty andcontrol over this screening technology. One ofthemajor problems women experience with theuseof mammography isthat *.- S- -160technology can and cannot do. Because mammography involves the use of x-rays, many women fear theeffects ofradiation. The problem for women lies inbeing able toidentify which kinds offears aremedically justified and which arepersonally justified. The risk ofexposure depends onmany factors. These include the kind ofmachine used, thetypes and numbers ofx-rays taken, the ageat and thebenefits ofmammographic screening ascompared technology. Many different types ofmammography machines arecurrently inuse, some of which give higher doses ofradiation than others. Women areoften not aware ofthis difference and thus make uninformed decisions about where tohave mammography done. For example, many oftheclinicians atthe university hospital expressed concern that women undergoing mammographic screening attheprivate hospital were being screened with anoutdated machine. They felt that women were being exposed to unnecessary doses ofradiation. Several clinicians and oneradiologist with whom Ispoke toabout this matter attheprivate hospital felt that there was noneed forthis concern. However, theextent towhich this information was towomen undergoing mammography theprivate hospital isquestionable. Theuniversity hospital considered clinicians tobequite several women attending theuniversity being exposed totheradiation. Forexample, onemorning, Iwas intheBreast Screening Clinic following one ofthesurgeons rounds. This surgeon was examining awoman inherearly fifties\u00ba -161-who had asuspicious lump. The surgeon felt itwas important that she have amammogram and wanted her tohave itdone that day. The woman began toquestion him about therisks ofradiation and thesurgeon explained that the dose was not very high andthat sheshouldn't be worried. Hethen left the examining room toask thereceptionist to call and see ifthe woman could have amammogram done within thehour. Istayed intheexamining room with the woman while thesurgeon was out and the woman explained herconcerns. Shesaid that she was afraid ofgetting breast cancer from themachine, she had heard about therisk ofcancer associated with thebreast screening trials and wondered why thesurgeon couldn't tell what her lump was from his physical exam. The surgeon came back into theexamining room andtold the woman hehad scheduled her for amammogram, butfirst the woman was tosee thenurse practitioner. When thesurgeon left the room, the woman began tocry. Asshewaited tosee the nurse practitioner she said that shedidn't understand why she had tohave the mammography and that she was very frightened. Two issues are important here. First, the woman did not understand that thesurgeon was very concerned that the lump was indeed malignant andthat therefore, therisks ofnothaving amammography outweighed therisks ofhaving breast screening trials and therisk ofbreast cancer made the issues seem black andwhite. The woman did notunderstand just who was at risk forrepeated mammograms and howthese women were determined tobe atrisk. She did notunderstand that mammographic technology had been perfected sothat very lowdoses ofradiation would produce high quality pictures. The surgeon did not have ordid not take the time toS -162-address her concerns and thus the woman wasleft feeling asifshe had very little control over thesituation. Once the decision has been made that awoman will have a mammogram, theexperience itself can prove tobemost unpleasant. A major problem isthat ifanabnormality shows up on thefirst mammogram, know ifsomething isnotquite right. The inability for women toobtain immediate information atevery point of thescreening anddiagnostic process isasource ofmuch distress and further leads toalack One woman who wasdiagnosed with breast cancer explained: Hedidn't really think that anything was wrong 'cause hehad done anexam andthere was noindication thefilm andstuff. Soshesaid (the technician) ifthey don't get agood shot, they would have to doother views. Ithought how many other views could you have 1 But Ifound out! She came back and ontheleft breast, they had todoitagain and again andagain. And every time, I'dwait, you see, while they went todevelop thefilm. And then they took me toanother room with another machine where they could twist you in there even more differently, cause itwas way atthebase soit was hard toget your body Isuspected they aren't doing this oneside over andover and over without being suspicious of something. Iasked her and shesaid they had toget abetter picture ofthis side anddidn't really say \"Yes, there's something wrong.\" But they were very concerned about itbut they didn't tell methere was something wrong. Iknew there was something wrong 'cause youdon't dothat over andover without there being some reason forit. Well, anyway, then Iwas finished and they told meitwould beafew days before they had theresults soI left and they'll you when something's wrong, tocome back. Ihadn't been home very long when mydoctor phoned me. This woman was inherearly 60's, had very little experience or \u2014163-knowledge about medical issues, had read little about breast health and did not demand more information during the mammographic procedure. In contrast, thefollowing woman was diagnosed with abenign condition. Sheisinher mid20's and waswell informed about herrights Iwent aroutine kept instead ofsay 6 mammograms or4,she kept going out oftheoffice and andsaying, \"We're going totake another one\" And Ijust knew something was wrong. Thelogistics and common sense just stepped right inandsaid, \"Hey wait aminute!\" And soIasked the technician, \"I'd like toseethese when you're all done with them. bedenied theright tosee or talk toadoctor about they the thefirst one, didit, she had afunny look onher and Iremember seeing that and I said, \"That doesn't look good does it?\" And youdon't have totell me.\" And she shook her head and nodded her head andagreed with me. Andthat's all she could do. Once mammograms have been taken, women often have difficulty understanding theresults. When theresults areclear cut, awoman receives adiagnosis ofmalignant orbenign. However, very the results are ambiguous and theclinicians are notcertain howthey should beinterpreted. One woman explained: The next time was when Igot the mammogram and they saw peculiarities init,under super-duper magnification, which is obviously amixed bag. Itwas bothersome tome. Itwas more ofa question and...some fear, some concern about what this lymph node meant. ..the mammogram, ...looked asifsomebody had taken droplets ofwater and went like sprayed anantomizer atit. Itwasall over theplace, some were grouped and some were random. Anditwaslike, \"My God, if that's what's happening, I'mgoing tohave lumps ofcancer all over!\" They And they were very curious and they wanted to know what itwas and so, thesuggestion was, \"Go home andthink about itbut don't wait buy themedical model for the most part, oratleast can't discard ittotally, what choice doIhave? When faced with confusing mammographic results, what real choices dowomen have? Part oftheproblem women face concerns their limited access todetailed information concerning mammography. Forthemost part, women interviewed studied, showed that little detail isprovided concerning mammogram technology and interpretation. Apamphlet put out bythe American Cancer Society entitled \"Facts onBreast Cancer\" gives ashort word description of mammography: (x-ray examination ofthebreast) isavery important diagnostic tool, particularly insymptomatic and high risk women. The newer techniques andequipment, when properly used, have permitted physicians tolargely dispel theconcern about x-ray exposure from mammography causing breast cancer. The known risk ofbreast cancer inall women over 50and inhigh risk thetheoretical risk for mammography. Itistheonly method that before they can befelt most experienced physician\" (1978:7). This short description istypical ascreening tool. Second, noinformation is given about what isknown about specific risks andspecific doses of radiation. Third, noinformation isgiven concerning what level of radiation iscurrently thought tobeacceptable. What levels did old't S. levels the the \"theoretical\" risk isfor given which might allow women toevaluate forthemselves, thetruth of these statements. Women are being asked toaccept thedominant medical orthodoxy about mammograms without questioning the many assumptions upon which theorthodoxy rests. Itmight beargued that itisnotfeasible toprovide all the details inasmall pamphlet, however, this does notpreclude providing references orsources that will give them thedetails ifthey so desire. Most oftheliterature for the lay woman asks her totake at face value, thestatements about thegoodness ofscreening and diagnostic technologies. Atthe twohospitals studied, nurse practitioners represent theprimary sources where lay women could obtain more detailed explanations ofmammography andother screening anddiagnostic astoremove theclinical risks anduncertainties awoman onestep closer tothecancer experience. Little attention has been given towomen's experiences of undergoing abiopsy and inpart this isbecause medical 3\u00ba. with thefears anduncertainties of what theoutcome might mean andwhat one's future might be. For many women, having abiopsy represents afurther loss ofcontrol over one's are twotypes ofdiagnostic technologies. Some ofthesurgeons interviewed, explained that needle biopsies were less invasive and could beconducted intheexamining room. Ifthe lump was acyst, the fluid could and the problem could betaken care ofthen inconvenience ofscheduling another appointment for asurgical biopsy. shown, many surgeons aresuspicious oftheresults ofneedle negative results. Thus, for theclinician, theneedle biopsy isamixed blessing. Women also may have reservations about theprocedure. First of all, arather large looking needle isused toaspirate either fluid or tissue. One woman reported: Iasked him how much itwas gonna hurt and hegets outthis big needle !That was scary 1Itisavery big needle. The surgeons Iinterviewed claimed that since there are no nerve endings inthe area where theneedles areinserted, that needle biopsies are notpainful and, therefore, thesurrounding tissue does not have tobeanesthetized. While this observation may betrue according toscientific medicine, some ofthe women who had the\u00ba - s \u00ba -167-procedure reported that itwaspainful. The following arequotes from women their personal experiences biopsy: What didbother mewasthat ontheother Ididn't argue with him about thematter. Anditdidhurt \"Well, OK, I'mglad Igotthis over with because they got something they can look atandsolve this...put this problem to rest once andforall\". Soifhehadn't gotten anytissue I probably would have left feeling alittle irritated. Iwas there actually todoaneedle aspiration because that was intermediate between abiopsy anditwasreally painful. It wasn't jabbing like real sharp pains. They couldn't get anyfluid, they just kept poking. And awoman diagnosed Heisnotgentle and may betypical of surgeons. They are use todealing with people under anesthesia. He's avery nice man and Ifeel he's very competent and Idon't know ifit's possible todoitinabetter butit's very so.\" (laughs) Imean, Idon't blame him forthat. I mean medicine isn't anexact science. Imean that's notthe way biology isbut... I've always kinda wondered cause Istarted having this tingling right after that. Contrary toclinician's beliefs, needle biopsies arepainful for* * '...), some women. This would suggest should begiven thechoice ofrequesting alocal anesthetic ifitmakes theprocedure more tolerable. This choice isespecially important since many women will face the same procedure again inthefuture. \u00ba -168Butperhaps amore important point isthat these women did not express thebelief that they thought they had aright toinsist upon being treated differently. Often women donot know before hand that they might have aneedle biopsy. Surgeons decide onthespot after conducting abreast examination. Itisdifficult for women tomake choices and take control when they areseated onanexamining table, with their breasts exposed and faced with arecommendation bythe surgeon togoahead with aneedle biopsy. oflack ofcontrol: Well, Iwas inthe tub and Ihave always had lumps but Iguess I wasgiving myself abreast check and Igotsecretion and Ichecked look atthe lump, notpreventative things. ...Iwish people anddoctors were more honest about what they know and what they're saying andgive more choices. When Iwent initwasjust wham, her is... Thefirst time, when Iwas inthere getting wanted did dry. This raises thequestion ofwhat kinds ofchoices women dohave concerning needle biopsies? This question can beaddressed inseveral ways. First, when women schedule anappointment atthebreast clinic, they could betold before hand thekinds ofprocedures that they might expect. Second, when they arrive atthebreast clinic fortheir appointment, they might begiven some information toread concerning thekinds ofdiagnostic technologies andprocedures which might be utilized. Third, women could begiven achance tofirst sit down with the surgeon anddiscuss these issues before they areundressed and placed upon theexamining table. AttheBreast Screening Clinic, when- * .7 - *... s T -169-awoman had theopportunity thenurse practitioner before seeing thesurgeon, sheoften had theopportunity tobeinformed and to discuss these issues. However, women donotalways see thenurse practitioner before they seethesurgeon. Finally, incases where surgeon believes that tome, what Idid was try toget rid thetea, ittasted horrible, it's and Idrank some about every hour for therest ofthenight and Iswear the next day, itwas almost entirely Ihad under my it wasn't serious oranything. But Istill went through with the treatment thing. This woman went ontohave aneedle biopsy. However, thepoint is that bybecoming informed before she hadtheprocedure and bybeing able totake control over her own treatment, she was able toenter into amore cooperative relationship with themedical practitioners. By first being able todecrease thesize ofthe lump herself, she began to take control over thediagnostic process. Additionally, she made the decision herself toproceed with further medical diagnostic procedures. Ifneedle biopsies aredifficult experiences for women, surgical biopsies represent thenext step towards abreast cancer experience. Until recently, surgical biopsies and removal ofthebreast ifthe results came back malignant was aonestep procedure. Women went into surgery not knowing ifthey would wake upwith onebreast gone and ofcancer orfree, healthy and ready togohome. most undergo what isreferred toasatwostep isperformed and achance todecide onthe appropriate oftreatment. Women have fought fordoctors toaccept this were done as\"same day surgery\". This means that women enter thehospital asoutpatients, biopsies arecarried out under alocal anesthesia and women need not spend thenight inthehospital. Generally, theprocedure takes no longer than arecarried out inanoperating room bysurgeons andthere isalways uncertainty and fear for the woman concerning the outcome. Two themes emerged from women's experiences ofabiopsy. First, women expressed alack knowledge about how theprocedure would be carried out. Second, women expressed asense ofhelplessness inthat their future was atthat moment out oftheir own hands and inthe hands ofthesurgeon. Thus, inareal sense, undergoing abiopsy brings a woman onestep closer tolosing control over her body andloosing control Forexample, one two inthis study. Forthis biopsy, she was admitted tothe hospital and thebiopsy was done under general anesthesia. This woman had been living intheUnited States forabout seven years, spoke broken english and was somewhat unfamiliar with themedical system. Herexperience illustrates herperceived lack ofcontrol over the?, After Friday they mywhole in help the surgeon pinpoint thearea tobebiopsied. Needles are inserted into thebreast and then dye isinjected into thesite tobe biopsied. The following woman describes herexperience: Thenurses were very supportive, very supportive. They knew Iwas scared todeath. Anyway they punched all these holes. Ilooked like adart board. Imean Ihadpins inmybreast. ...then they which ofcourse hadn't been yet developed . . ..Then they took meupstairs about 2:30 intheoperating room and they inserted blue dyewhere those pins were, sohecould see where when he'd take them out. The Only thing hetold methat made mefeel happy onthat table while he... itwas a long wait. Iwill never dothat again. Iwould rather beout. I don't care howdangerous theanesthesia is. Itwas along time. .. Dr. Smith wears glasses and sohewas looking down with allthese bright lights that hewas much And Iwas uncomfortable. ...Another thing! Hecutwith anelectric something orother and Icould myownflesh burning. covered me soIcouldn't see but smell Itwas falling. And ofcourse everybody wassaying, you in pain?\" Well, ofcourse Iwasn't. Iwas, well, the nerves you, Icried for twofull days. Ihadn't lost abreast and I cried for twowhole days. -1.72-*-y == -- 2 s S & */There areseveral points Iwould like tohighlight. First, the medical professionals were concerned with deadening only one ofthe senses, pain, through the use ofalocal anesthesia. Theother senses however, were still functioning. This woman could see what was happening toher inthesurgeon's glasses and shecould smell her own burned flesh. She wasclearly experiencing much distress. Yet when she expressed herdistress, thedoctor andnurses focused onher sense of pain. Itwas asiftheexperience ofpain was alegitimate source of distress rather than smelling andseeing. Notbeing she came apart andthat shecouldn't gain control ofherself. Infact, her body did come apart and she did not have control over herself. While acertain loss ofcontrol insuch situations isperhaps inevitable, medical practitioners need torealize that while alocal anesthesia can deaden the body against pain, they cannot deaden theother senses. This isparticularly important for surgeons who arequite use tooperating with ageneral anesthesia. Doctors need toensure that women know what toexpect. Inthis way, women can take greater control over their distressing experiences. Doctors andother medical providers also need toaddress and acknowledge senses ofdistress other than pain. Care andsupport should beprovided for women inthese situations andthis requires that surgeons have agreater sensitivity andunderstanding ofthebiopsy experience. Inthe next case illustrated isthe ofunderstanding ofthis distress onthepart oftheoperating room andeverything and Icouldn't bemoved cause they didn't want me upinawheel chair intheelevator and Ifelt sofunny cause all these people were looking atyou and Ithought oftheneedle sticking out.

I'msure that itmust been. And then isthe term when they burn you, orwhat ever they do, andthat smelled tomewhen they didthat, reminded meof, this .. isinteresting assome women interviewed experienced taking akind ofcontrol over their helpless situation through humor. The following case example isrevealing asthis woman reported having ajoking relationship with her surgeon and was able to express herfears andconcerns local. Igot there and saw Dr. Smith who inserted the needle and Iwas shocked that itwas...not as. ..notpainful. ithurts thebody!...So then Iput onarobe and went down andwaited for some God forsaken length oftime, like anhour ormore with this thing sticking out ofme,until Igot into surgery. Ithink people went tolunch. I'msitting around, you know, sitting there with this needle sticking out ofmeinmy robe, waiting andwaiting...maybe waiting 2hours, I'mnot ittook anhour and a that one you know. Aspointed out intheprevious chapter, some surgeons stated that they performed biopsies even when they were fairly certain that the lump was notmalignant. Many ofthedoctors interviewed reported feeling badly about this; however, they also felt that biopsies were required inorder toremove therisk ofuncertainty. Thus, often doctors feel better doing something rather than nothing. Some women also reported similar feelings. For some women, living with abit of uncertainty was notacceptable andthus, they felt that abiopsy would remove this risk. The following women describe their decisions to undergo abiopsy: Idon't like not knowing. Ilike having tests done even though I know they really don't make that much difference sometimes. It's somuch ofareassuring thing. He[the surgeon] aperiod ofthree years toseewhether they if they became further defined orgoinnow and have abiopsy. He recommended thebiopsy and mything that him was, ifIwait outthree from nowthatit's malignant, amIgoing toloose much time mylife cause I waited three years?\" And hesaid, \"Ican't tell Iknew Ihad tofind out now! One woman expressed her she had requested abiopsy yet herdoctor hadtold herthat theprocedure was notappropriate. This woman had astrong family history ofbreast cancer and was very concerned that ifacancer should develop inher ownbreast, that it should bedetected early. She had ageneralized thickening inone of herbreasts could s1. S. -1.75palpated. surgeon malignancy. Sheexplained: Ididn't want Hesaid when you doabiopsy and youdon't know exactly what you're looking for, you know, itproduces scar tissue which makes italot more confusing. Hewassatisfied with the needle biopsies and thefindings ofthat. This woman ended upaccepting herdoctor's advice insist onhaving abiopsy. Atthe oftheinterview, shereported being satisfied with hercurrent medical management asshesees her surgeon every three months and has been told that thethickening inher breast isnotchanging. Other women resisted their doctor's recommendations forbiopsy and instead decided tolive with the uncertainty ofapossible cancer. Well, most ofthepeople have meit's OK, andthat Ididn't really aminority of practitioners who tempted togoahead andget abiopsy tofinally finalize what itwas inmymind, because having just gone through thedeath ofa spouse with cancer, just torelieve myownanxiety. ..But Isaw a couple ofother specialists and they said itdidn't seem like anything out oftheordinary and I'mpretty conservative myself in terms ofsurgery andwill not doitmyself unless I'mconvinced it's necessary. Another woman explained: Well, itseemed like they thought itwascystic atthat point so that was nice tohear. Theaspiration confirmed that. But then they were thinking, \"Lets take itout.\" 'Cause itwas kinda big. Iwasn't too keen Idid goinafter that. Iwas going tosuggest tothedoctor, \"Why don't you try andaspirate some more and see ifsome more fluid comes out.\" But before Ihad achance todothat they did tended toprefer why they methat it's maybe 90%sure [that it's notmalignant] and Ifigure that two 90s make more than a90l.Thedoctor that Ihad recently says that there are twoschools ofthought, itout orleave itin. He's hetakes Idon't think itgrows any. Itjust comes back toit's original size and Ithink that's it. But Istill haven't decided yet because itwould bekinda foolish to risk leaving itinand then having itend upbeing malignant and then end uphaving more problems after that. So, ...I'mstill up inthe air! Decisions concerning whether ornot tohave with uncertainty and therationale behind performing biopsies isto remove this uncertainty, toobtain adefinitive diagnosis. While the majority ofbiopsy results doinfact bring certainty todiagnosis, results canironically increase both awoman's and aclinician's uncertainty over the meaning this has abiopsy, fortheresults until thetissue has been analyzed bythepathologist. Some ofthe more disturbing experiences described bywomen were those associated with receiving their diagnosis. Women with benign conditions aswell as those with malignant ones expressed agreat deal ofdistress and general dissatisfaction with the way they received their results. The time between having abiopsy andreceiving theresults isananxious one. Women wonder what theresults will Will they betold they arehealthy orill? Will they betold that they are dying ofcancer or will they betold they have nothing atall? One woman described her feelings during this time: It[the biopsy) was more emotional than painful, especially since Ihad towait four days for theresults. Wehad planned togo away toYosemite that weekend and wewent away but, naturally I wasworried all the time andnaturally wetalked about itand I considered all thealternatives. \"Well, it's probably benign 'cause it's been there allthat long and hedoesn't think it's malignant.\" Soonthe one hand Iwas saying that but on theother hand, Iwas saying \"You never know\", especially with me, who knows what itcould bel Especially when Ithink ofthecases that come into theclinic and the young women who die ofbreast CanCere Perhaps one ofthe more ofsymptoms initsearly gaze. Cancer isacondition where people canfeel very well while at the same time bevery diseased. Cancer can beadisease without an illness. Women are very aware ofthis contradiction between what they experience andwhat theunderlying reality, asdefined bymedicine,!. h \u00ba C. S\u00ba be. One woman who had had herfirst biopsy seven years prior to participating inthis anappointment biggest feeling second appointment feel fine andhere somebody's telling meImay bedying!\" You think, here you aregoing about your regular activities but inone week from now, youjust may bereally inbad shape andfeel like you're really dying. time [her second biopsy hospital] but youstill have that feeling, you know, youfeel good andyet somebody's telling you you may have something really serious! And one woman who received adiagnosis ofbreast cancer reported similar feelings: Thestrange from February toJuly and then Ifelt really good. The world looked wonderful and then all ofa sudden, Igotthat news... Idon't know how long cancers take to grow butitwas initsbeginning. Atthe time Iinterviewed this woman, she had had removed and was undergoing chemotherapy. Incontrast tohow shefelt atthe Ichose the Icouldn't a SoIgotwo weeks out ofthe month. ...Ican't describe ittoyou. Your body issick, sick, sick. Myhead aches, mybones hurt, myblood hurts, myskin hurts, nausea, diarrhea, and nose bleeds andbloody stools. ...Well, nowthat I've been through allthis stuff, nothing scares me. Icould anything! Well,...since I'mnot yet! inits invisibility. Inpart, itisthis invisibility ofdisease and lack of illness which removes control from women. Instead, only medicine has the technology todraw theline between Women that even though they mayfeel healthy when they gothrough breast screening anddiagnosis, that disease can indeed behidden, waiting tobe discovered bythedoctors gaze. Thus, theperiod she must come toterms with being ill; with having disease inherbody. She must recreate anewreality women have already experienced thepossibility ofillness, they have already begun toalter their experiences ofhealth andillness. Making thetransition back tothestate isoften difficult. Experiences ofhealth andillness are notdefined purely by physical parameters but, rather, aresocially constructed experiences. When women have abiopsy, they experience much emotional and psychological distress. Adiagnosis ofabenign condition means for theclinician, that nophysical condition needs tobecured. And while this brings relief tothe woman, her ownexperience ofillness needs to undergo ahealing process. Inmyresearch, women explained that they wanted more than just tobetold that their condition was benign. They expressed the need foradditional information about their condition and the need fortheir emotional concerns tobeaddressed. Most women\u00ba Ji -180-receive their diagnosis over thetelephone and many women reported that they felt much frustration with theinsensitive ways inwhich diagnostic results were communicated. The following quotes illustrate these themes: Yagot towait aweek for theresults! Andthat's when youget paranoid. During that time, the lump went down and you could just feel where itwas, anditcertainly didn't show any. Itwas very small. ...anditwent away And afew days later, I got alump inmywrist! Ithought that wasreally strange. I thought maybe, \"Oh maybe it's just working its way out ofmybody\" You know, Maybe Idohave cancer! It's inmywhole body! itcame a fear anyway... Iwas with afriend knew I'm cool.\" You know. Andthere was nothing wrong. Another woman expressed herfrustrations with the way inwhich she received her results. Her husband was adoctor and had received her diagnosis before shedid. Sheexplains: Iwaswaiting forthebiopsy report tocome back and anxious about what itwasgoing toturn out tobe. I had had thebiopsy done one day and Iwas supposed tocall the next afternoon orsomething like that. Iwas couldn't back. Hedidn't call back and Iwasfeeling pissed that hehadn't called all the while knowing that physician's days get very tied upand they often don't return calls toyouuntil theevening orlate orwhatever. But hadalso called me, and Idon't recall ifhehadactually reached Dr. Smith orwhether Dr. Smith returned his call before he returned mycall. But atanyrate, myhusband got theresults of thebiopsy first and Iremember being really angry about that. You know, Iwasrelieved hadgotten tohimfirst. Imean, back Iwas thepatient here you know. Iwas the one heshould have called, soIwasbent out ofshape about But myanxieties and twoother woman explained: Then Icalled back the next week very very nervous. And Igot on the phone and thenurse orthereceptionist answered. Itold her who Iwas, and shesaid, \"OK, just one moment.\" And she went and she must have talked tohim orlooked attherecords orsomething and she came and putoff! was Ivery itwasnegative, but Iwas really putoff bythefact that myfeelings through the week had been dealt with with this sort ofblunt response, totally dismissed! 'Cause Iwas nervous! write them aletter andtell them very Iwasalso putoff bythenurse getting onthephone orthereceptionist, some whole thing, andtelling me. Imean, ifitwould have gone theother way, would anurse tell methat when mylife meoff. Thebiopsy would theresults onMonday. Iwent home onThursday afterwards and Ifelt very. .not weak, butjust numb. For about two and a half days Ijust felt numb. Mybody wasjust dragging. And I think itwasjust areaction toallthat system. ...Everybody was Iwould beallright but... ah. . .part ofmesaid everything would be OKbutpart ofme just hadthis sort of... negative attitude that, well, maybe kid, maybe this isit. Iwastrying tothink positive butyet, Iwas on theother side ofthebuilding. And come out. Icalled mymother and Ihadtears inmyeyes. This last woman was able togain emotional support from her mother. The other women allsaid that they wanted aless harsh transition back tothestate ofhealth. Simply being told that their condition was benign was not enough. TheBreast Screening Clinic isabusy place and many women are screened there forbreast disease. asstaff donot have the time to schedule special appointments. Additionally, many women find it inconvenient toreturn toreceive their diagnosis. However, ifstaff were made aware oftheconcerns that women might have, they could arrange tospend more time onthetelephone answering questions. Follow-up calls could concerns this issue tobe asimportant asitwas towomen. Some women reported difficulties in obtaining their results: They sent off the sample anditwas very inconclusive. There was some suspicious looking cells and Itried toget theresults and they wouldn't get theresults. Ifinally got them, but they wouldn't give them tome. They were afraid oflawsuites they said. The doctor wasn't available, thedoctor was out oftown. I went there and demanded them. Isaid I'mgoing tostand here until you give them tome'cause they're mine!\" Ifwomen with benign conditions experience much distress upon receiving their diagnosis, what kinds ofexperiences dowomen receiving malignant diagnoses have? While there may benoway tosoften the shock ofreceiving thediagnosis ofcancer, some women reported that they had received their diagnosis inamost insensitive manner. Forexample, many hadreceived their diagnosis over thetelephone; adepersonaled mode ofhuman communication. There isnoeyecontact, thespeakers do not have toacknowledge each other directly and each has theability to cut thecontact offatanypoint bysimply hanging upthe phone. When doctors give women adiagnosis ofcancer over thetelephone, they do not have todirectly confront women's initial reactions. Doctors can remain distant anddetached. Their patient must then deal with her initial feelings onher own. While this type ofcommunication allows\u00ba - \u2014183thedoctor tocontinue onwith his result. forthemselves andfeelings when they their diagnosis ofcancer bytelephone. Thefirst case Ipresented atthebeginning ofthis chapter. Recall that her symptoms ofcancer had been consistently overlooked until she was diagnosed with alate stage disease. Atthe time ofreceiving her diagnosis, Molly wasliving alone about 70miles from her family: Iwent infor the body scan thenext day and they told methat the reason Ihad the body scan was because Ihadthese. ...allthese holes inmybones. And Isaid, \"Holes inmybones! Well, what is that from?\" And they didn't even tell me. They said, \"Well, your doctor just wants toget another scan tomake Isaid, \"Well that's notnormal!\" causes Ihad noidea ..After for mybreast...Then they out ofit. Asthe days were progressing Iwas losing more and more energy and hecalled methat evening .Itwas Friday and hesays, I just abook onbreast cancer and Iwasscared to call mymom. And sothen, they scheduled metosee the weekend. And I thought, \"Ohdear me.\" Ididn't know what they were going totell me....So then Iwent inand they were telling methe damage that had been done. ...They were explaining tomeallthis. Upuntil then Ihadallthese chumpy doctors. ..none ofmydoctors. . surgeon have thenerve. Ididn't know ifhefelt bad orwhat but henever told meexactly what I had. Another woman had had herbiopsy done atahospital other than the two inthis study. Herdoctors recommended that she have the . .and thefollowing day, ...I'll never forget it, you know, like Black Monday, well this was Black Thursday. Hecalled andtold meitwasmalignant. I just satthere, Sandy. Ijust satthere. Icouldn't believe it and hekept saying that you know, usually these lumps are 80% of the time benign. Another woman explains: Isaw him for him when would Ifind out. Hesaid Icould call his nurse about 3 o'clock and Iwas kinda waiting till then. But hecalled about noon. Isaid that Iwasworried about that poor girl having to tell meand hesaid no,that ifitwaspositive, he'd That weekend notpleasant. Ihung upthe ...Iwasalone. Myhusband knew Iwas going tofind out that day and Isaid, \"Well Iwon't Ileft, between andthree onFriday and let you know what theresults are, way.\" SoI said fine.

Anyway, that time was very suspenseful. Anawful time amastectomy also. Sothen Dr. Smith came, he's a sweet doctor you know. Hestands there smiling, nothing inhis face you know. Then hestarts talking. Hesays, \"Well, are noalternatives.\" This confusing you know, first hesays itispositive, you caneither have, ...take asample ofitinthesurgery and then wecancall you back and seeifit's positive ornegative again and then we can schedule you forwhatever you want tohave inthehospital, mastectomy oryou can hegoes onand onand onand onyou know. I'm just, tears are coming down myeyes. You know, and myhead is about toburst you know. Idon't know what thehell he's talking about and I'mjust soconfused you know. ...Inmymind, Ikept saying, \"Iknew it. Iknew was going tobesomething wrong. Ihave always been lucky. Iknew it. Iknew something was going tohappen tome.\" Ikept going this, very thesize ofit, thechances are very high that it's cancer, that you have thebreast removed.\" And I'mcrying and Idon't understand what he's saying and I'mallconfused and sofinally I just said tohim, \"Doctor, you know Idon't even know what you have now. tell thepatients what your alternatives arebut weknow it's very hard for you to make adecision now.\" Isaid, \"Yea, right all Iknow isthat Ihave cancer. That's all I know. Much has been written about the need for medicine tobemore socially responsible and forclinicians torespond inamore make itmandatory for clinicians toinform women ofalltheir alternatives. However, humane ways tocontrast * ** s \u2014186-with those ofwomen who were happy with the waythat their doctors addressed their concerns when they were given their diagnosis. The following woman had made arrangements tohave abiopsy done. Her doctor and sheboth thought that the lump would turn out tobebenign. However, thedoctor did notlike what Hedidn't ordinarily keep office hours onSaturdays, but hearranged for sending thefrozen sections intoSanFrancisco and hearranged lightly you know. Less than getting atooth out since every test was negative andeveryone was saying that they really didn't think itwas butmatter of fact. ...kindly. But hedidn't act asifhewere confirming a death sentence onme. Hewasjust very pleasant and warm and I always thought Ishould have written him anote. Hespent along time inhisoffice with making drawings from will survive. ...Italked with him about alot ofother things, about telling other people about it. Hewas really very good with me. Another woman who hadinitially been diagnosed byadoctor ata hospital outside this study, wasreferred toone ofthesurgeons atthe teaching hospital. Although she hadalready received herdiagnosis, she explains howgrateful she was with the waythis surgeon treated her: When Isaw DrWhite, would Iknow myhusband said that feel that Iwas in very good hands. Hehugged mesothat you were feeling that you are ingood hands hedoesn't have todothat really. Butit wasreally nice. Andfinally, awoman diagnosed with abenign positive relationship about Iguess the thing was, Ineeded answers and Ihad to wait until all these tests came back and that was hard. Itisgenerally acknowledged that there isagreat need for clinicians tospend more time addressing thefelt needs oftheir patients. Many studies explored thereasons whyitisso difficult forclinicians tocare forthepsycho-social needs orheal their patients. However, what isillustrated here isthat the ways in which women aregiven their diagnosis, whether itbebenign or malignant, need tobegiven more serious attention bythemedical profession. This isespecially thecase when such conditions are fraught with much uncertainty concerning both scientific andclinical meanings, when there areoften noclear answers concerning treatment and prognosis. 5.3c Understanding the Meaning oftheDiagnosis: The meaning ofthediagnosis very much determines thekind of treatment options available toawoman and the long term prognosis. With benign conditions, management isamore appropriate term asoften nospecific treatment will beprescribed and women will continue tobe followed bytheir doctors. Itisimportant for women tounderstand \u2014188control over themedical process. While much has been accomplished to provide women with information about malignant conditions and the various treatment options, little attention has been directed towards providing women with adequate information about theclinical meanings ofbenign conditions. Often, when doctors explain abenign diagnosis, they convey ambiguous orunclear information. This clinical ambiguity or uncertainity can beinterpreted bywomen indifferent ways. First, a woman maybelieve that herdoctor andunderstands what the condition means. thecondition isbutthat ispurposely being evasive bynotproviding acomplete explanation. Third, she maybelieve that herdoctor does not have complete knowledge orunderstanding about hercondition butthat the knowledge does exist. Inthis instance, a woman might seek another opinion. Fourth, awoman maybelieve that her doctor does not have the knowledge about hercondition because the knowledge does notexist; thecurrent agreed upon state ofknowledge is uncertain orambiguous. isproviding. Inreality, these five situations are notclearly differentiated, however, each situation has different consequences for the kind ofcontrol women take over treatment andprognosis. Thefirst situation exists when thedoctor clearly understands the meaning ofthephysical condition yet the woman does notunderstand what itisthat thedoctor This about options inlanguage lay women canunderstand. Ithas also resulted inaCalifornia State Lawrequiring that every woman be given adequate information, that she canunderstand, about her cancer and hertreatment options. Ithasalso resulted intheproduction ofa pamphlet bytheState ofCalifornia that every doctor isrequired to give towomen diagnosed with breast cancer. However, little literature isavailable that explains thedifferent kinds ofbenign conditions and their association tobreast cancer. This leaves awoman with very little access toinformation toenable her tolearn more about her condition. Italso prevents women from gaining access toinformation which would enable them tounderstand their doctors and toask relevant questions. One woman explains: doctor nothing toworry about. Iwasstarting it. Somany different people said it. The doctor atPlanned Parenthood said itwasprobably just fibrocystic breast disease which doesn't seem tomean too much to mebut Idon't know too much about it. Itworried mebecause I read somewhere that itincreases your chances ofhaving breast cancer like 50%orsomething like that. Idon't really remember thefigure andthestudent doctor said the same thing, it's probably just fibrocystic breast disease. .. .Itdoesn't worry me too much. Idon't think it's that serious. Iputitinthe same category aswarts! Except that you can have warts removed. It worries mealittle because supposedly itincreases your chances ofbreast cancer This woman expresses notonly alack ofknowledge about benign breast conditions but isalso misinformed. She says that she read that her condition increased her chances ofbreast cancer by50%. However, she seems not tobeoverly concerned about therisk. Most oftheliterature written for women about benign breast disease isincluded inliterature about breast cancer. Little exists which focuses primarily upon benign conditions themselves. WomenI / \u00ba, $- . -190expressed their frustration because theliterature they read had asits main focus, breast cancer: During the whole time Iwasstarting tonotice how magazines and newspapers...whenever there was anything about breast cancer or whatever. think ofmyself ashaving fibrocystic blaa had tome! Breast cancer. That's what Istarted noticing. Iknew, Ifigured they were probably benign lumps but whenever Iwould look atthem myheart would \"This isabsurd! I've got to work through this!\" SoIwould read it. Anditwas the same thing with magazines. Butitwasdefinitely cancer Iwas thinking about. She (the nurse practitioner) pretty much told menot toworry about it. But Idid. She gave meabook, from thelibrary. ..No, she showed mewhere books too much reading itand Ididn't read thewhole thing. During the time that Iconducted this research, several popular women's magazines published articles onbenign breast conditions and breast health (Good Housekeeping 1980, Mademoiselle 1982, Family Circle 1983, Self l982). However, there still isadearth ofinformation specifically about benign conditions. This makes itvery difficult for women tobecome adequately informed about both what isknown and what isunknown within epidemiology, medical science andclinical practice. Because women are not familiar with the kinds ofterms used todescribe benign conditions, they often have adifficult time understanding what their doctors aretelling them. Inthe second situation, awoman may think that herdoctor has information about hercondition that heorshe iswithholding. None of the women reported that adoctor attheteaching hospital hadwithheld information from them. However, several didreport that doctors who they had seen before they were referred tothis hospital hadwithheld \u2014191\u2014information. Molly very clearly believed that one ofhersurgeons knew that she hadbreast cancer andyetwithheld theinformation letting his partner inform her ofhercondition. Anolder woman whoalso was diagnosed with alate stage breast cancer explained: Going back totheactual testing, theliver scan which was inconclusive, this doctor said tomeafterwards, \"It looks asif there are afewabnormalities\". Andthat's all hewould But after the bone scan, Iasked him ifhecould bealittle bit more specific and hewouldn't commit himself and Irealized afterwards that the reason hewouldn't commit himself was because there was very definite metasis and hedidn't want totell me. Ofcourse doctors letthe have the fun oftelling thepatient! Inthethird instance, awoman might believe that shehasn't been given complete knowledge about hercondition butthat such knowledge is available. Inthis instance, women need tosearch further for additional information. The following woman had gone through medical school andpracticed medicine. She had the background and knowledge to complete her search forinformation about hercondition. They just dysplasia, its aword I'm more use tohearing interms ofcervical disorder and you know, asI'm sure you're well aware, they talk about dysplasia asbeing ona continuum from carcinoma tojust inflammation. dysplasia notconsidered ofbeing preliminary tocancer. that out. reassurances that dysplasia wasn't the same kind ofthing. Fiona, the woman whose story waspresented atthebeginning of this chapter, explained that itwasdifficult forher togain an adequate understanding ofjust what itwas she had. She had been diagnosed ataprevious hospital with lobular carcinoma insitu yether biopsy conducted atthepublic teaching hospital had notconfirmed this diagnosis. Rather, she had been told she had mammary dysplasia. As discussed inChapter mealong what it was Ihad, howreally itwas and what thealternatives really were. They tend totalk around you, like you're...you know... anidiot. They sayallthese things while they're inyour room orwhatever, like your some sort ofidiot and youdon't understand what they're talking emotional tobediscussed in very plain english. Itshould beencouraged that you see somebody else. Doctors seem tohave more ego than most professions have. They have got tobeable tosay, \"Here iswhat Ithink. Now you recommend some people toyouthat you can gotoandget another If you've got enough time you've got tobeable totalk with enough people that canhelp you tounderstand what itisyou have and what your options are. Ifind that many times, doctors talk to women like they're stupid...They think we're they will make something all right. They areafter all, men. And Ihave nothing against men. They arewonderful people. But wehave toraise them tothepoint where they seem tofeel that they know everything. Iamnot altogether certain that that istrue anymore. Maybe itnever WaS \u007f,,, Inthefourth instance, women maybelieve theinformation which they have given isincomplete butthat nocomplete information currently exists. Forexample, thefollowing woman explains: first described itasafibroid orsomething like that, so they didn't really have any idea whether itwasmalignant or benign but they just said, you know, generally itisbenign. . . .I guess it's written down, fibroid orsomething like that. Although they've never been specific about defining, giving ita label...See, I've gone through mammographies there and the ultrasound, and Ilisten towhat they say even though they aren't it's dense what itis. Soyou maybe putting 2and 2together and getting 5but ownunderstanding and second, believes that practitioners areunsure about just what itisshehas. shedid notreport asking her doctors specifically toexplain hercondition toher nor did she seek outfurther information. She has inpart, accepted thefact that the current state ofmedical knowledge concerning hercondition, is incomplete. The same woman reported being pleased with hercare atthe university hospital someone who wants toknow about their body andtheir condition and they explain toyou alot. They don't just say, well, this is this andthat isthat. But then again, I'mthe type ofperson who takes theinitiative. ...it's obvious that Iwant toknow all the factors about mybody. Even so, Ithink they're allvery good there. Their bedside manner, their explaining everything. I've been just really pleased. Thepoint tobestressed here, isthat even though this woman did notobtain aclear understanding ofexactly what itwas shehad, she was satisfied with her medical encounter. Shefelt that her doctors had atleast been straightforward with her and had notattempted to pretend they knew theanswers tothings that infact, they were uncertain about. Finally, insituations where scientific andmedical understandings of agiven condition are incomplete, itisthedoctor's responsibility not tohide this but toshare this with the woman she orheis treating. Furthermore, doctors need tobeable toshare theinherent uncertainties about knowledge with women inasensitive manner. The following woman explains how her surgeon informed herthat they found a rare cancer inherbreast, one which they knew very little about and\u00ba \u00bar - \u2014194-how shefelt about the way inwhich thing Idid have found inwomen's breasts that wehave never seen before.\" Ireally don't know what that means and the next time IgoI'mgoing tocheck that out. Anyway, hesays, \"Iguess you opted for theright decision. You went for theright decision ofnothaving chemotherapy because ifyou had opted for chemotherapy that kind ofcancer would have reacted in abad way.\" And Isaid, Soyou know, and then bythe time Iwas going to say something tohim, hewas out thedoor! And you know, and gone! ...Anyway, that left mewith terror, with confusion and in myopinion, hewas very untactful the way hewent about it. Especially since heoperated andhe's going totell somebody something they have and then don't have agood answer forityou know. And soIsaid, youleft me. You had mecrying here.\" Isaid, \"I don't think that's very nice the way you handled yourself the other day.\" Now ofcourse this isthesurgeon. His eyes just popped but totell you thetruth, wedon't know what type ofcancer you have. It's avery unusual type ofcancer you had inyour breast andit's thekind that's tothis don't know.\" Finally, thelast situation occurs when awoman completely dismisses what she has been told. This might occur for many reasons. The process ofdenial has been written about extensively inthe psychological literature and Idonot intend toaddress this issue at any length. Rather, Iwould like topoint outthat adiagnosis of breast cancer represents asudden redefinition ofaperson's reality. And inthe case ofbreast cancer, many women never feel ill from thedisease: - *. \u00ba \u2014195-itself but only from thetreatments. They are asked tobelieve inthe existence ofaninvisible disease. One women confessed that she did notreally believe that she ever hadcancer: Sometimes I'mthinking what happened with me,butitgoes sofast over, maybe and noteveryday, but... that Ididn't same the level ofunderstanding that awoman has about herdiagnosis has consequences for the amount ofcontrol she takes over treatment or medical management andher understanding ofherprognosis. Italso has consequences for the way inwhich women redefine their experiences of being healthy orill.! s\u00ba \u00ba- 2 -196-5.4 cancer, itisusually clear toherthat she has adisease about which something must bedone. She may notadequately understand just what kind ofdisease she has nor may sheunderstand all ofher treatment options. Nevertheless, most often, women areclearly told bytheir doctors that they have cancer andthat they must undergo some form oftreatment. Rarely isthe Option ofdoing nothing presented ordiscussed. One woman diagnosed with breast cancer explained that she would have preferred doing nothing andthat she had adifficult time even raising theissue for discussion with herdoctors. Sheexplains: DrJones isapleasant fellow and hewas very matter offact. Poor thing, he's very tall andhe'd sit down onthechair and there Iwas ontheexamining table and hesat down ifhewas exhausted which heprobably was and hesaid, \"Well now, I've seen lots ofbreasts mydays here andyour's really should come off.\" Hesaid, \"You have four choices. You can have surgery, you can donothing...\" Idon't know what theothers were but there were some And Isaid, \"Well, Ilike number two.\" I shouldn't have pursued itthat much.\" Much has been written concerning the need toinform women oftheir various treatment options forbreast cancer and the women interviewed inthis study were aware ofthe need tomake informed choices. They expressed that they should ideally enter into apartnership with their doctors todecide ontheappropriate cancer treatment. They were aware that the issue ofproper treatment was amatter ofdebate. However, such isnot thecase with benign conditions. Women interviewed often reported feeling powerless inthe management oftheir benign conditions. Inpart, about\u00ba!--- *\u00ba--- \u2014197-themeaning oftheir diagnosis; they were often unclear about whether they were supposed tobehealthy orill. Because ofthis ambiguity, women almost always end upletting their surgeons ordoctors decide for them whether ornottheir condition isrisky enough tobeconstrued as ill health. This often results incontinued medical surveillance and can increase awoman's anxieties about her breast condition. Alternatively, itcanalso result inwomen discounting medical advice andfailing toreturn forregular checks when such acourse isstrongly indicated. The lack oflay knowledge about both what isknown and what is unknown puts women atrisk ofbeing over medicalized orunder further necessary diagnostic procedures undertaken. Inorder tobegin totake more control over their health, women need tobegin totake responsibility together with their doctors, formedical uncertainty. This involves atonelevel, the acknowledgment that medicine does notcurrently have anadequate understanding ofbenign conditions. This uncertainty must bebrought into thepublic ofdialogue Both amount ofrisk andboth parties must equal ofsharing responsibilities andconsequences ofrisk. Toacertain extent, this isalready happening inthat some doctors interviewed reported that they didshare their uncertainties with their patients and some women interviewed reported that their doctors were very frank about what they did not know. However, for the most part, women inthis study reported that they felt alack ofcontrol over management oftheir benign uncertainty amongst both women andclinicians about thecauses of benign conditions. Because ofthis uncertainty, women feel that there islittle they can dotoresolve their breast problems. One ofthe issues Iexplored with women concerned their owntheories about the causes ofbenign breast conditons. The most widely held view wasthat noonereally knew what caused benign conditions. Thefollowing responses aretypical ofthis view point: I'msure there must have been areason but Ican't really say. I feel that itjust appeared out ofnowhere... Imean Idon't recall anytraumatic thing. ...Iguess I've always felt that that's still sort ofamystery why,... you know, women get benign lumps. . . .My perception ofitwasthat itwasjust amedical problem and we know thecause and .you have itandthat's it. Idon't know, Idon't know. Iwasreally healthy atthetime. It was not aparticularly stressful time. Idon't know what causes a lump toshow upout ofnowhere. Itwaslike that you know, away just asfast. Butitgave me alot tothink about. Upon exploring ideas ofcausation further, women expressed two general types ofpersonal theories. First, women thought that benign lumps might becaused bybiological orenvironmental factors, primarily byagents time Iconducted the research wasthat caffeine products somehow caused breast lumps. However, none ofthe women who mentioned this theory took itvery seriously. One woman explained: Well, even atmyfirst exam, they began totalk about howpeople were concerned that coffee was aculprit. Well, Ihadresolved to give upcoffee atthat explained: *: Iuse toeatchocolate all the time and people were sure that it / waschocolate. And then they discovered that caffeine products 3 were bad. But then itwas toolate. Ihadalready downed the chocolate next door neighbor\u007f* had somany cysts removed that they finally did amastectomy on herjust forthecysts removal. And herdoctors were taking her offcaffeine andevery complete form ofchocolate, watching her diet. ..Infact, when Isaw the very first doctor atthebreast * screening clinic, she had abag ofempty gourmet decaffinated, just anempty bag onherbulletin board andpointed that out as - being something good todo. And then the next twodoctors Ihave \u00ba seen, Ibrought thequestion up. Iasked them about Ido drink coffee, Idon't drink ahigh excess but Idohave coffee and s\u00ba they both said OK. I'm one whodoesn't question much. Ifthey tell meit's OKIdon't question why. And they both said inmy *-situation itprobably wouldn't matter one way ortheother. left itatthat... Inever take itbeyond that. So,I've*-never stopped drinking coffee. Ithink it's really like this because somuch Igave upteacompletely for awhile, but Igoback toitevery now and * then. Another woman said that she thought that theproduction ofbreast milk ..S. might have something todowith causing breast cancer: | Ithought that conceiving must trigger lactation and Ihave always wondered ifthe human body could absorb human milk. You know, it ! candigest itandbreak itdown but what about re-absorbing it? I think somebody like mymother who haseight babies, you know, her breasts would get big and she would take pills and they went down and Idon't think \u00bareason. ...Idoworry about itand Ihave friends who have had 9 abortions . . .and they areworried about getting cancer cause their breasts are up, down, up, down. And what happens inbetween? _\u00ba -200Asecond theme expressed bywomen wasthat benign breast conditions were believed tobetheresult ofpsychological factors such asinternal conflicts about one's role asawoman, andfeelings of guilt orstress. Here, women felt that their breast condition was the external manifestation ofinternal disharmony. This theme is particularly important asmedical treatment and management does not attempt toaddress these issues. Rather, itiscontainted toexternal causes. Thus, while doctors attempt tocure, they donotattempt to heal. Many women complained that what they needed was someone to address their emotional concerns aswell asthephysical condition. The following women explain their feelings about internal causation: You know, Iwanted tohave children. Ithink that maybe my breasts filling upwas almost like Iwaspunishing myself for something, for through inmyhead wasfighting mybody. Itwaspunishing me. God waspunishing me. Mybody was punishing me. Iguess one's body prepares forhaving children every month, cause that's what your period is. There arejust so many cycles and weseem tohave just somany eggs and ,. ..Imean I should have taken advantage ofitwhen Ihad....maybe this isthe end you know. It's like thebiological time clock iscoming toan end and mychances are ofthefeelings ofexploring inalternative medicine and waspracticing some alternative medicine for Ihadreally neglected some andwithin my relationships inmylife asawhole that's disharmonious and somehow Ihaven't established areally good relationship with that part ofme.{ woman explained asimilar theory ofthecause whogives andresents improve, Management ofIll-Health: One ofthe most striking contradictions that women experience is that while onthe one hand they aretold bytheir doctors that what they have isnormal and they shouldn't worry about it, ontheother hand they aretold that they must keep aclose watch ontheir condition. This often requires regular visits totheir doctor, repeated needle aspirations and mammograms. Thus, women arebeing told that they arehealthy while atthe same time undergoing further medicalization. Through this process, women come toredefine their experiences ofhealth asastate where they are notquite healthy yet they are notquite ill. Thedistinction ofhealth, shewill feel good, shewill feel healthy. But asher next appointment approaches, shebegins tofeel anxious andwonders if indeed there could beahidden disease waiting tobediscovered. A woman's experience ofhealth begins totransform itself into an experience ofillness that only adoctor can Only thedoctor -202-canbring that hidden. Itisasymptomatic and only thedoctor's gaze, thedoctor's hands orthedoctor's instruments candetect it. For women, breast cancer lays hidden ready tobecome areality, toshow itself atthe next visit. One woman described this cycle ofhealth andillness and her dependency upon herdoctor: Igoback every. ...I'd sayatleast every three months... Ihave \"very\" lumpy breasts which are very hard toexamine because Ihave all these little bumps inthere and avery close watch point, we're going to watch it.\" Ihave this feeling that it's notgoing tobeforat least five more years. Idon't know why, Ijust feel like it's way down the road and maybe I'mwrong, maybe I'll never beatthat point anyway. Maybe I'll always have this problem but, I ...as...he hastold meonsubsequent visits that hethinks I'm that. ...Usually when Igotosee him, Iget worked up...when Igo. This time when didn't get worked upatall and Iwasglad cause Ithought, I've been very busy. Sopsychologically, this was very good forme... Iwent into see him, itwassorta depressing 'cause Ithought, \"Ohcrud, Iwassorta feeling sorry And then onFriday, astiff, upper lip.\" Andthat was God! What else up on thekidhere?\" You know, and then Istarted having these fantasies and \"Oh first things first.\" You know, sometimes yougetcarried away. This woman clearly articulates the ambiguous nature ofher -203-experiences ofhealth andillness. Many ofthe women interviewed explained clearly thekinds ofdouble messages they received from their doctors about the meaning oftheir condition andtheir need formedical management. One woman explained the impact ofthese messages onher experiences ofhealth andillness: Iwasgetting this sort ofdouble message, \"Don't worry about it and many women have ofwomen's deaths. itshould seriously butatthe same time I didn't see why mewith this supposedly benign condition should have tokeep anextra sharp eye onit. And then they set upan appointment todoanaspiration, andafter that, Iwent home feeling alittle better. Again Ihad been told that right now I didn't have aserious problem but each month again, when Iwould get very sore, Iwould getreally depressed, more depressed than I had been before Ihad myperiods. Anditwasn't something that I wasreally acknowledging. Ijust felt, really like, itwas almost impending death. Itwas almost like every time they would get really sore itwaslike Icould just see them being cutoff, or, orwhatever....Or very drastic images came into mymind. Astriking aspect ofthe management ofbenign breast healthy than before\". When awoman has \"more\" benign disease, she comes under closer medical surveillance. One woman explained: Igoback, ...it's been every 3months or6months. Before they discovered this little thing under myarm, they said, \"You look like alowrisk person, youdon't have tocome back for ayear.\" But then Ifelt that additional lump. ..Ifthis lump disappears then they'll follow meinlonger intervals but ifitdevelops into something, itwill beshorter. Very few women interviewed inthis study said that they would not return tothedoctors fortheir regular check ups. However, one woman who had worked asanurse inthe area ofwomen's health and who was quite knowledgeable about breast conditions and the ways that doctors managed these conditions explained that she waswilling totake: -* s S. theappointment and was going tomake another one ...they wanted metomake ittoofarahead. And didn't. Ialso realized take theresponsibility forwhat's going onwith me. Iknow the growth rate ofcancerous you know. like notcancer, ofthat risk, of the 70/30 odds.\" Both ofthese above women speak oftheir risk associated with\u00ba benign breast conditions. Risk iscentral toexperiencing benign breast conditions asastate between health and illness. The experiences ofrisk will remain unknown, itis difficult for women totake anypreventative actions that might enable them toincrease their sense ofwell being. Many women reported their frustration over their perceived lack ofcontrol toprevent anyfuture problems. This feeling ofalack toplace themanagement ofbreast health inthe hands ofthe medical profession. The these problems: DrRyan that Itake 800units meatone time possibly oncutting down oncoffee, caffeine, chocolate, Ireally haven't done that. Idon't drink alot ofcoffee all day Ihave maybe three cups aday, onaweekend. But Ihaven't quite gotten tothat and with isthis vitamin E. Iread somewhere that ifyou take vitamin but thedoctor mevitamin But, Ihave heard that itdoesn't make anydifference, it's all in everyone's mind. Libby Brown [anurse] told Shesaid upteacompletely, for awhile...but you know, nocoffee, notea, nocaffeine, none ofwhich Ido anyway. Which was agreat let down tothedoctors. Which was another thing that frustrated mebecause they heard ofsomething. for women that didn't drink ofthing. inforthelast that actually did itwasn't the doctor who Iseeall the time 'cause the doctor I see was oncall. Sowhen Italked tothedoctor whoactually did it,another man, hesaid you can do. And I said, \"Well, isthere anything about diet that they've -recently?\" Hesaid, \"Absolutely not. There's noconnection. Nothing. They have proven absoutely nothing. Don't read all the articles inthemagazines. They don't know anything. There isno connection.\" So, I...Ikeep thinking that sometime when Igoin, they'll say, you know, what youmight dowould that itmight beafactor. runinto anybody who hassaid that. This lack ofpersonal control over theprevention ofbreast problems has consequences for thedegree ofresponsibility that women take fortheearly detection ofbreast cancer through thepractice of breast self exam (BSE). Because there iscurrently nothing women can dotoprevent breast cancer, the focus has been upon helping them learn how todetect cancer. The only thing women can dofor themselves then, istoconduct amonthly search forcancer. Much has been written about thevalue ofbreast self examination and thereasons why somany women fail todoitregularly. Iwould argue that inpart, women's failure toconduct regular breast exams isrelated totheir perceived lack of control over anything they might dotoprevent cancer from developing inthefirst place. Therefore, theact ofbreast self examination comes tosymbolize even further, their lack ofcontrol over apossible future orhidden cancer. Every time awoman performs abreast self exam, she has toconfront thepossibility that she may have cancer. Thus, women are asked toactively search forsomething that they can do nothing about except discover. Healthy women arebeing asked tosearch for unwanted and feared illness. Clinical andpublic health professionals argue that ifwomen do notdetect cancer early, they are atgreater risk ofdying from the disease. What islittle understood isthat themonthly search for cancer constitutes avery real and immediate lived risk for women; the risk offinding something unwanted. Thus, one might question thevery -207-risks oftheanxiety brought about byBSE. Itisaterrible irony that asked tosearch forinvisible disease within their bodies andthen are rewarded forfinding itwith mastectomy, chemotherapy orradiation. The rewards for notfinding aninvisible cancer are knowing that they must search again the next month. Searching forthefeared, theunwanted, theinvisible istalked itcertainly does notprevent illness. Indeed, within scientific andclinical medicine, there exists some debate over theextent towhich early detection ofcancer actually prolongs life. Infact, some argue that early detection may only increase thelength oftime that women live knowing that they have cancer. Given allthese problems, itisnowonder that most women donot conduct breast self exams onaregular basis. During myinterviews with women, Iasked how they felt about conducting breast self exams. One woman explained: Well, ifsurgery oriftreatment has value and can itis, then Ithink that ... Ithink doesn't that upinmyhead looking for andthat's notitisit?\" Then I'm saying, \"No, Ican't worry about that one, that one's OK. Iknow what that is. That's just alump. Another woman explained: I'mstill very reluctant todothebreast exams. Part ofit, after myperiod Icount the days and Iknow that there isa certain time period that Ishould doit,but um, somehow that time always goes past. Myfeelings are, well, I've probably done it once since thelast exam, which was four months ago. Istarted to doanexam once andit's hard toknow what's normal and what isn't normal. Nomatter what they say, there are many things you can: -208-feel; you canfeel your ribs and you feel the bottom ofthetissue andthere's just various things you canfeel andeveryone's different. Sowhen Idoit, Ifeel like, I've been, ...I've don't think ofitaslooking forsomething, just think ofitas learning toknow your when Idoit, Ifeel angry. Ifeel soangry that, that I'mtrapped with this body that's malfunctioning. That's the way Ifeel about it. And soIstart todothe exam and know. \"You're notright!\" You know, \"You feel like you're supposed tofeel and I'mnotquite sure howyou're suppose tofeel!\" And so, Inever get through. Like inthis breast, Ithink Ifeel even asecond tiny I'mthinking, \"Here Iaminthe anexam here.\" And soI'll start feeling andI'll get around that area and Iget more and more reluctant and, like when Ifelt that second thing my first impulse was togotothedoctor immediately 'cause you'll feel relieved ifyoujust godoit. Then Ithought, well you know, that's just absurd! Youcan't just gorunning tothedoctor every time you get upset about it. This fear ofconducting breast self exams can indeed result in women becoming more dependent upon their doctors. Several women explained: Hewatches meevery itisin3months They're always after metotry and Ido. Iknow all thethings you're suppose todo. You know, feel yourself ina clock wise position, stand up, look atyourself inthemirror, see hope build uptheconfidence inhim. I'msure Iwill, he's such anice doctor. Finally, some women reported that while they thought that breast self exams were important, they didn't dothem because itdidn't fitinto anything 'cause Ithought Ihad done breast checks. Not every month, like maybe twice ayear or something and Icould never find anything but Ireally wasn't that well trained onhow tofind them 'cause now Icantell that Ido have little lumps kinda around theedge. Butthat's not where I was looking and Ikinda expected tofind something right onthe top ofmybreast and write itabout two weeks after myperiod starts, toremember. seems like about, one small encounter. ...Iwasjust reading over thething Igot from your clinic, about aweek ago anditwas saying that most women dofind the lumps andthat makes mesee agreat deal ofvalue init. Although mylittle lump was found bysomebody else, but the idea that Ishould know mybody better than anybody else, that Ishould beable tonotice any changes, Iguess that's thesignificant important. Ifyouget tothepoint you're obsessed with checking your body once aweek orevery day, then you got a problem. You're thinking it's going tohappen. You got your mind inaplace where you're expecting aproblem. Ithink you have to berealistic, you have tobeknowledgeable about yourself. I think acheck uponce amonth, once maybe every twomonths, or even soyouget toknow the waythings are working now when I'mnursing, everything islumpy soI'msorta just letting it slide. Another woman pointed out: Ithink it's [BSE] very valuable. It's just that Iguess nowthat Iknow something isthere, hopefully I'll doitmore doitregularly. That's myhope. that breast exams butthat was asfar asitwent. Itwaslaziness you know. Tight schedule inthe morning, you know, You have togetinto aroutine and you have to remember theright time ofthe todoitand ifitpasses you todothem Ialmost sensation that -210-since it's been benign, it's going tobebenign. It's like the psychological effect ofit. You know, once you're safe, you're always safe andthat isn't always true. Atthis point, acrucial question emerges. Ifthere exists no accepted knowledge within medical orclinical science about how to prevent breast problems, how can weexpect women tobeable totake more control over their own breast health? Toanswer this itmust be stressed again that itisimportant that women not only have access to what knowledge does exist, butalso, toknowledge ofthelimits of certainty. Women must beable toassess what knowledge does notexist and then they must beable toenter into arelationship with their doctors where this uncertainty isshared between them. Women need to beable toexpect their doctors totell them what isnot known and doctors must notthink that they should beable toprovide answers when there are none. Both women and doctors need tolearn tolive with uncertainty, tolive with risk. This however requires that therelationships between doctors and patients become more equal interms ofwhocontrols power over decision making. The consequences ofremoving this uncertainty orrisk areoften greater than simply learning tolive with it. Aswehave seen, doctors often perform unnecessary biopsies inextreme cases, prophylactic mastectomies inorder toremove risk byremoving thephysical condition giving rise touncertainty. 5.6 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WOMEN AND THEIR DOCTORS Aswehave seen, both women anddoctors arecaught inthebind of theuncertainties conditions andtheir aretorn between ofa misdiagnosis, unnecessary deaths andpossible Women aretorn uncertainty about their need for medicalization andtheir desire totake control over their own health. For women, this often results inself blame and surrender toamedical practice ofuncertain efficacy. There are noeasy solutions tothis many sided problem. However, onepossible step towards finding acceptable solutions lies inre-addressing thekinds ofrelationships women have with their doctors. Twogeneral ofthemes areapparent in this research concerning thekinds ofrelationships women valued. First, women appreciated doctors being frank about what they did not know orabout when they were uncertain. But women wanted their doctors totalk about this uncertainty inacompetent manner. One woman explained: Ifelt DrWaters than Iwas asking himquestions flat out and heanswered them flat out, what hecould, and itwasstill obvious that he didn't know everything. His mannerism wasjust more confident as were his assumptions even though Ithink they were incorrect. But then noone canever besure ofanything. Soifyou're going theright thing! While the important thing that sheexpresses isthat herdoctor felt comfortable about being uncertain and not knowing everything. Another woman explained: Iwould like people anddoctors tobemore honest about what they know and what they're saying andgiving more choices. When Iwent initwasjust wambam boom, let's open her upandfind out what the problem is. Anditseems like there should bealittle bit more investigation. Atthat point, ifIhad gone what's going onthere, Idon't know what's going there. Itnow appears inboth breasts and sonow, whysurgery? Itseems like a foolish expense and too quick onthegun.} -212-The second theme apparent isthat women wanted their doctors to acknowledge their emotional andpsychological concerns. Because ofthe relationship ofbenign conditions tobreast cancer, women want tobe able todiscuss their anxieties about this ambiguous condition. Criticizing their surgeons, several women explained: I'mnotterribly fond ofsurgeons. Surgeons think they areGod's gift totheentire world. God gave them wonderful hands and therefore they can doanything they want todoand they have all get thesensation that you know, you're just another body and youdon't have anything else behind it. Just feeling uncomfortable from their personality too. Ijust had aphysical last week, and Ididtell mydoctor about this [breast lump) andit's funny that we're talking today because one ofthefeelings Ihadlast week, was afeeling ofwondering whydoctors, ...whyitisIcome across doctors that are not providing alittle more thorough breast examinations with physicals except for DrStreet doctor] that Iwould be talking toaperson showed some interest. Not only competence andprofessionalism asadoctor, butpersonal interest too. That really makes adifference. Ihate hung upin this whole issue them and polarizing them, butjust onexperience alone, thethree women doctors that Ihave had over thepast several years, have been doctors Ihave remembered because ofthe impact they had onmefor talking andproviding information and showing alittle bit of concern. Iwasn't just another person inone ofthose tissue paper robes sitting there onthetable. Because they are women and they understand women's bodies, Ithink they understand the nuances and the way women think. There isalittle something there that weneed that mendon't give areferral tosee someone there twoyears ago. Isaw him and had one good experience and acouple ofhorrendous experiences with him. Hewasoutrageous. He'd make Outrageous, were outrageous statements. You know, Iasked about thepossibility ofbiopsy and each time I'dsee himhe'd say something else. He'd say yes and -213-and then thenext time he'd say, \"Well, your breasts arejust very nodular you know, you want metocuthere, here here, here? Chop them alloff?\" Thefirst time Iwas very impressed with him, the next twotimes, you know...He said tocome back atregular intervals, but Isaid, this isridiculous! All the women who Iinterviewed said that they felt that the kind ofcare they received from the twonurse practitioners atthe university hospital wasexcellent andthat their emotional needs were cared for aswell astheir physical condition. One woman explained: Jane was wonderful! Iwasjust really upset. Ihad been crying and they were addressing thefact that granted, there was some ambiguity about what this thing was. Itwasn't like somebody had said, \"Yes, this needs tobebiopsied.\" .. .Anyway, Jane came in and she took agood history which was thefirst good history that anybody took. This was thefirst time anybody had gone step by step through thewhole thing. And shedid areally thorough history and athorough breast exam, which was again very reassuring. Shesaid, yes, this needed tobechecked outbut from what she could feel, shewasn't alarmed with what shefelt. It felt good. Ialso knew then that Iwasconnected upandthat what ever needed tobedone would get done. Soitwasreally reassuring. Most women explained that what they wanted were straight answers concerning their physical condition and anacknowledgement oftheir emotional concerns. However, one woman explained that sheappreciated thetechnical expertise ofher doctor andbelieved that they had agood relationship even though hewas not able toaddress some ofher more personal And \"Well, I guess he's just oneofthose far removed persons.\" And asIbegan talking with him Irealized that hewas sofar removed personally that technically hewas And Ireally hecould. This woman clearly articulates thedistinction between the personal qualities and thetechnical skills ofherdoctor. Shetreats -214-these astwoseparate dimensions andexplains how, even her t doctor did notgive her thepersonal care sheexpected, she judged him interms ofhis concern with herphysical body, with hisattention to herinternal physical processes. This example points outthat women take into account many factors inassessing their relationship with their doctor. 5.7 DISCUSSION: Ihave argued that within medical practice, there isand always will beaninherent amount ofclinical uncertainty. This uncertainty arises both from doctor's personal limits onbeing able toknow all there istoknow, and from thestate ofscientific knowledge; where what isknown may have ambiguous meanings orwhere there aregaps ina given state ofknowledge. This state ofmedical uncertainty represents t risk forboth doctors and women. Doctors risk failing todetect a hidden cancer orfailing topredict thedevelopment results that risk bytransforming itinto aphysical entity, asign ofdisease residing within women. This allows doctors tocontrol uncertainty through thediagnosis, treatment andprognosis ofrisk. Thus, wefind asubtle but important shift occuring asrisk is understood now toreside within individual women. The consequences ofrisk also affect women. When awoman is diagnosed asbeing atrisk she istransformed from tobecome well andthis ofremoving the breast. And asweshall see inthe next chapter, even this extreme procedure isfraught with controversy about how much risk isremoved with removal ofthe breast tissue. Because women have little control over the management of uncertainty, they areatrisk forfurther medicalization. Akey issue concerning women's control over uncertainty pertains tounderstanding the many dimensions ofrisk experienced bywomen. Onthesurface, this would seem tobestraight forward. Women experience therisk of getting breast cancer, therisk oflosing their breast andtherisk of death. And, asIhave pointed out inthis chapter, they also risk repeated biopsies andindefinite medical surveillance. Butrisk for women also hasother qualities that aredifferent from those ofclinical risk for for towomen able toacquire the power toshare with their doctors, thecontrol over uncertain outcomes. This leads usinto the next chapter, which focuses upon exploring the many dimensions ofthe concept ofrisk.s -216-6.1CHAPTER 6: THE PHENOMENOLOGY arefairly modest, Ourcurrent state ofknowledge indicates that inmost women there are many variables acting together todetermine risk forbreast cancer. Whether several ofthe known risk indicators can be related tosome common underlying mechanism, such asaparticular hormonal profile, remains tobedetermined. Also, most ofthe risk factors identified sofar implementation ofpreventive measures. \u2014Kelsey 1979, AReview ofthe Epidemiology of Human Breast Cancer.

Iknew intellectually that Iwas athigh risk diagnosed cancer INTRODUCTION: Intheprevious three chapters, Ihave explored the ambiguous meanings ofbenign breast conditions within medical science, clinical practice and the layworld. Ihave shown howthese ambiguous meanings give rise touncertainties inboth practice and lay experiences ofhealth andillness. Idevelop a concept ofrisk that acts tocondense thescientific, clinical, and lay uncertainties about the meaning ofbenign breast conditions into aC -217concrete entity, thus enabling uncertain understandings tobe translated into practical activity. The language ofrisk makes it possible totalk about, andcontrol for, what isunknown. Power inmedical science andpractice lies not only incontrol over knowledge, butalso incontrol over knowledge about what isnot known. Inaworld where medical knowledge israpidly shifting, where ourfutures are becoming less andless predictable, theability to manipulate what isnot known represents amajor source ofpower. The concept of\"risk\" gives reality topossible futures and has the potential ofallowing doctors and women tocontrol possible health outcomes. This chapter explores themeanings ofrisk within epidemiology, clinical medicine, and the layworld. Iargue that the meanings ofrisk andtheir uses, are fundamentally different within each ofthese areas and that afailure tounderstand these differences hasserious consequences forclinicians inthe and for women andpatient management. The language of risk isabout scientific uncertainty concerning causal relationships andclinical uncertainty concerning theprediction andcontrol of explain theetiology ofchronic diseases and from the inability ofclinical medicine toprevent and cure these diseases When epidemiologists, clinicians, andpatients talk ofrisk, all are\u00ba -218-expressing ideas about uncertain knowledge and theprediction offuture danger. Yet, within each context, theconcept takes onsubtle but important differences inboth meaning anduse. Currently anddebate between epidemiologists andclinicians about how totranslate epidemiological risk into clinical risk. Part ofthis confusion arises because thecontextual differences between themeaning and use oftheconcept have not been fully recognized. This chapter, explores theconcept ofrisk astaking ontwo distinct dimensions; anobjective, technical, scientific dimension orlived dimension. The assessment and evaluation ofrisk fortheepidemiologist isanobjective, technical, process ofrisk must beunderstood asasocial ascientific, Clinical medicine bridges these twodimensions asrisk for thepractitioner is sometimes objective, sometimes lived, and sometimes both. The practitioner isfaced with thetask oftranslating scientific risk into clinical practice. Confusion between thescientific andlived dimensions ofrisk has led toserious consequences forclinicians who are faced with managing patients atrisk and forpatients diagnosed as being Within clinical practice, risk istransformed from anepidemiological concept describing generalized observations within populations toaclinical concept describing aspecific entity within anindividual. Thus inclinical practice, risk issomething -219-patient suffers. Theclinician transforms risk into asign ofafuture disease entity, enabling clinical diagnosis, prognosis, andpatient management. Forthepatient, risk becomes transformed into alived or experienced state ofill-health, into asymptom offuture illness. Risk laywomen further blurs thealready ambiguous relationship between health and disease. This ambiguity results inthecreation ofanewstate of being healthy andill; Inthis Idiscuss thetheoretical informing the meaning and use ofrisk within epidemiology andclinical medicine. Ithen discuss the two fundamental dimensions ofrisk: objective scientific and clinical practice, and laycontrol over states ofhealth andillness. While the argument concerning themedicalization ofrisk emerges from andrelates specifically tothis case study ofbenign conditions, Isuggest that itmay have applications tomedical thinking andpractice for other non-infectious 6.2EPIDEMIOLOGIC AND CLINICAL CONCEPTS OFRISK: Tobegin, Ifirst want more andWildavsky, risks as toothers represent aparticular society's shared values about present andfuture dangers. Risk perception isasocial andcultural process. While Douglas andWildavsky that uncertainty. When applied toexperiences ofhealth, out of the inadequacy ofcontemporary models anddisease toexplain how and why wegetsick orstay Epidemiological models are complex and imprecise, clinical medicine islargely ineffective in preventing andcontrolling many ofthechronic diseases, andthere is much layconfusion over which kinds oflife style habits will protect a person against disease. Thesocial construction oftheconcept ofrisk allows ustothink andtalk about ambiguous meanings ofhealth and illness andunpredictable relationships between our world and our health. Not only areparticular risks theresult ofasocial process, but thecreation and use oftheconcept arising from contexts ofcollective uncertainty. While theconcept ofrisk has always spoken about danger, ithas not always spoken about chance. Theetymological meanings ofrisk derives from theLatin word \"resecare\" The concept ofchance isintroduced inthe modern daydefinition. The Concise Oxford \"the ofinjury, damage orloss. Adangerous chance, hazard.\" Contemporary concepts ofrisk describe relationships between uncertain knowledge and unwanted outcomes. The language of risk isessential tobeing able tospeak about, understand, andlive ofrisk istotalk about the probabilities ofuncertain and unwanted futures. Within thescientific world, risk describes theoretical, measured, objective, mathematical associations leading topossible outcomes. Here, risk isnever more than atheoretical possibility. However, risk within thelived ofbeing; must befirst understood asamore general cultural concept created todescribe and explain contemporary experiences ofuncertainty concerning relationships between knowledge and unwanted futures. Within both epidemiology andclinical medicine, risk describes uncertainty inknowledge about thecauses ofdisease. when applied tohealth andillness, isabout ambiguous anduncertain etiological relationships. This uncertainty from changes occurring inboth epidemiologic andclinical models ofthought and practice. Current epistemologic assumptions underlying models of disease etiology can betraced toideas about knowledge and the body arising from theScientific Revolution inthesixteenth andseventeenth centuries. Itwas during this period that about ofthe universe andGalileo introduced methods ofscientific experimentation and theempirical approach. The laws ofnature were described in mathematical language sothat they could bemeasured andquantified. Bacon formalized theempirical method and introduced scientific procedures reasoning which toform theheart of epidemiologic logic. Descartes argued forbelief inthecertainty of scientific knowledge and claimed that the laws ofnature could be discovered though theapplication oftheanalytic method andexpressed through the language ofmathematics. Within this model, natural phenomena could bebroken down into bits andpieces and then explained interms oftheir relationships toeach other. The world toDescartes was like amachine and hereadily applied this metaphor tothe functioning ofthe human Finally, Descartes had aprofound influence ontheconceptualization ofthe human asseparated into two dimensions; mind and body (Capra 1982, Chalmers l978). This mechanistic, reductionist view ofthe world and the consequent belief inthecertainty ofknowledge greatly influenced the development ofthescience ofbiology. Biological models aimat reducing organisms totheir functioning parts and then explaining the relationships between these parts. This biological model gave rise to contemporary concepts ofdisease causation anditisthese assumptions about disease etiology itincreasingly toexplain the etiological relationships ofmodern disease. The concept ofrisk as used within contemporary explanatory models ofepidemiology and clinical medicine has emerged directly from thegrowing awareness among researchers, practitioners, and the laypublic that ourcurrent models and knowledge ofhealth andillness areundergoing important theconcept ofrisk arises from shifts in epidemiologic andmedical thinking, thinking which has been based upon thepostulates ofbiology. Risk, then, points toanddescribes anomalies arising inthecurrently held paradigms explaining the etiological orcausal process ofdisease (2). 6.2a Risk and Concepts ofCausality: Upuntil the end ofthenineteenth century disease was thought to result from animbalance ofthe within the body orfrom alack ofharmony orwhat Dubos (1959) hascalled, thedoctrine of specific etiology, became the most popular explanatory model during the latter half ofthenineteenth century. Louis Pasteur's work gave rise totwocentral ideas concerning therelationships ofhealth and disease. Thefirst was the idea that aspecific micro-organism had a specific effect andthe second was that the immunity ofthehost played animportant role toaparticular disease (Susser 1973). formulate ofdisease causation. Using Henle's earlier -224postulates concerning disease causation, Koch demonstrated that many types ofdisease could meet these postulates (3). Itwas through the formulation ofthese postulates that thedoctrine ofspecific etiology hold asthemost powerful explanatory model ofdisease causation. Both Pasteur and Koch devised elaborate experimental situations in order toillustrate their hypothesis that aparticular disease agent caused aparticular disease. ofspecific etiology has great utility asithas enabled clinicians todescribe with more precision, distinct disease entities. The refinement ofdiagnostic categories increased thephysician's ability topredict the outcome of specific treatment regimens and thus allowed forgreater clinical control over diagnosis, treatment andprognosis. The development ofthemicroscope andother scientific technologies hasenabled theexperimenter precisely upon and togain detailed knowledge ofthecellular and molecular mechanisms ofthe human body (Dubos 1959, King 1982, Reiser 1978, Susser 1973, ).While the development ofmolecular biology has allowed medical scientists tostudy themechanisms ofdisease inits most minute parts, ithasalso led tofurther entrenchment of reductionist, mechanistic medical models. Modern medical thinking and practice hascontinued tofollow this experimental reductionistic approach andwhile these models have produced many triumphs in understanding andtreating disease, they have also inhibited the creation ofabroader, more holistic approach that might better explain the many complex relationships between health anddisease (4). Thedoctrine ofspecific etiology has had thestrongest explanatory power when applied totheinfectious diseases. Yet even in -225-well controlled experimental conditions direct cause-effect relationships fail toaccount forall cases ofdisease. However, the doctrine ofspecific etiology becomes even more problematic when applied tobiological phenomena intheir natural context. Thenatural external andinternal environments ofthehost are composed ofa complex set ofdynamic relationships that areall but impossible to control for, outside ofthelaboratory setting. This, combined with theincreasing incidence ofnon-infectious diseases, has ledtomuch uncertainty concerning thenature oftheconcept ofcause both within scientific andclinical medicine. The concept ofrisk arises directly out ofthecurrent inadequacies ofthemono-etiological approach to understanding, preventing andtreating sense afirst step towards shifting away from thinking, inanother sense, its use can beunderstood ascovering theever growing anomalies inthe paradigm ofcause andeffect epidemiology and clinical medicine areadopting multi-causal models ofhealth and disease, both continue inthedoctrine of specific etiology. Thus wefind anemerging rhetoric speaking of holistic, multi-causal relationships yet apractice that continues to adopt areductionist, mechanistic approach towards understanding and managing disease. Thus, the language ofrisk represents efforts to explain the many anomalies arising inour contemporary bio-medical models andpoints tobebased upon etiological hypotheses developed from within laboratory orclinical models (Lilienfeld andLilienfeld 1980). This points toafundamental dilemma inepidemiologic While hypothesized etiological relationships arevalidated inthelaboratory, theetiological relationships areproperties oflarge impossible isobserved within large populations. Risk, asused within epidemiology, isascientific construct describing measured uncertainty about these etiologic relationships. Thus, while thejustification ofetiologic hypothesis lies inaspecific process within of numerical probabilities andare seen aset cansuggest offunctioning anditsprogress through time. Studies ofindividuals cannot determine, even ina series ofcases, the limits ofthedisorder inrelation to normality orsecurely predict itsonset, progress, and this knowledge, toobtain between diseased andnon-disease persons isdifficult toascertain. Forepidemiologists, this has made accurate case definition difficult. Non-infectious diseases have long latency periods thus making itdifficult topinpoint the time ofonset. This has made itdifficult incidence been into public health policy andclinical practice (Cassel 1964, Mausner and Bahn 1974). Intheearly 1950's, these problems ledepidemiologists to question whether models could Orrather, need for new knowledge about these diseases? Much ofthis debate was formally carried out inthemajor epidemiologic andmedical journals, with the majority ofauthors arguing for thecreation ofnew knowledge rather than for ashift inepidemiological thinking. Thus, epidemiologic efforts were directed towards re-defining the concept ofcause and creating more complex models ofcausation rather than questioning the very nature ofepidemiological thinking (6). The Henle-Koch postulates were redefined toexplain and account for themulti-causal nature of chronic disease (Evans 1976, Lilienfeld 1959, 1973, Lilienfeld and -228\u20141. Lilienfeld incausal thinking about infectious andnon-infectious diseases -thelatter being more likely tohave multiple causal agents -depend upon the frame ofreference within which the investigator operates, andreflect differences inourknowledge of theetiology ofthese number have taken place inre-conceptualizing causal relationships (7). Instead ofthinking about thecausal relationship between and adisease, association(s) between one probability isintroduced todescribe thedegree ofcertainty (or degree ofuncertainty) concerning suspected relationships between factors anddiseases within populations. The concept ofrisk stems from thedual notions ofprobability (replacing certainty) and association (replacing cause). Thus, alanguage ofchronic disease etiology that speaks which may beassociated with anelevated risk ofdeveloping a disease. These factors are spoken ofas\"risk factors\". Models of chronic disease which quantitative, measured and suspected causal agents areunderstood as\"factors\". Risk inepidemiology expresses ameasured degree ofbelief about the relationship between one ormore factors and the incidence ofadisease~\u00ba 4-- -229-inalarge population (9). Drawing upon Toulmin's (1976) distinctions between general and particular knowledge within medicine, risk within epidemiology represents scientific knowledge about generalized relationships between causes andeffects while within clinical practice, risk isunderstood tobeanattribute ofanindividual. Within epidemiology, risk speaks ofany The asused within epidemiology isprecisely defined and operationalized. Much attention has been given todelineating different kinds ofrisk, thekinds ofrelationships they describe, and the methods bywhich they are tobecalculated. Risk precisely describes measured uncertainty. Itdescribes probable multifactorial andmultidimensional relationships; relationships which are too complex tobeobserved and measured with anycertainty within aparticular individual. Here lies thecrux oftheproblem; thetranslation of epidemiologic risk into clinical andindividual risk. Bateson (1979) has argued that there isagreat difference between statements about a class and statements about anidentified individual. \"Such statements are ofdifferent logical type, andprediction from one totheother is always unsure\" (1979: 42). Bateson argues that while a ofknowledge about thegeneric, thespecifics always eludes Toulmin situations, there isalways anamount ofuncertainty that can not be measured. Risk then, for theclinician, comes totake onthe added dimension ofunmeasured uncertainty. And here wehave the fundamental distinction between two kinds ofrisk. The first is measurable uncertainty represented bythe laws ofprobability. The second is unmeasured uncertainty, where numerical probabilities are notentirely applicable. Knight (1921) has argued that unmeasured uncertainty prevails where: ...numerical probabilities were inapplicable -insituations when thedecision maker was ignorant ofthestatistical frequencies tohisdecision; apriori concerned 1961:643). These two dimensions ofrisk, measured and unmeasured, can be applied tounderstanding islived, unmeasured risk. What distinguishes the twodimensions isboth the ambiguity inmeaning and theuncertainty intranslating meaning into practice. Objective risk isquantitative, measurable and unambiguous. \u2014231-Lived risk isqualitative, subjective andhighly ambiguous. Epidemiologists create objective risk, laypeople create andexperience lived risk, andmedical clinicians mediate dimensions ofrisk. Itistotheclinical experience ofrisk towhich Inow turn. 6.3 THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OFRISK: Epidemiologists have identified certain groups ofwomen who are unquestionably athigher risk fordeveloping breast cancer... For those ofuswhopractice clinical medicine, itisessential to separate those factors that aresignificant enough toinfluence our ownpractice ofmedicine from those factors that areperhaps statistically important when dealing with large populations but which are not enough tomake usalter theadvice wegive patients about thefrequency ofclinical examinations, intervals mammograms, and soforth. ...This then, becomes the crux ofthis discussion, namely, theclinical implications ofthese risk factors. Which, ifany, oftherecognized epidemiologically significant risk factors should trigger special treatment or follow-up for women (or men) soaffected? Byidentifying these groups ofindividuals can wedetect breast cancer earlier and thereby alter thecourse and outcome ofthedisease? (Schwartz 1982:26) The language ofrisk within clinical medicine arises from the translation ofoften ambiguous scientific knowledge into clinical practice. Within clinical medicine, risk comes totake onatleast two kinds ofmeanings. First, practitioners useepidemiologic concepts of risk toaid inthediagnosis, management andprognosis ofpatients. In this instance, clinicians must interpret scientific concepts ofrisk in such away astohave clinical significance. This type ofrisk Ishall call objective clinical risk and Ishall argue that clinicians understand this risk asresiding physically within individual patients. Asecond type ofrisk concerns theclinician's ownexperiences of uncertainty concerning diagnosis, management andprognosis. This uncertainty isanecessary part ofclinical practice because clinicians> /--- \u00ba * . -232-can never have perfect knowledge ofallthevariables that lead to disease states within particular individuals. Thus, necessary fallibility isalways apart ofclinical practice (Gorovitz and MacIntyre 1976). This type ofrisk Ishall call lived clinical risk. theclinician's uncertain application ofmedical and epidemiologic knowledge. Itpoints outthat clinicians are always at risk for medical error. Before exploring insome detail these twotypes ofclinical risk, toclinical medicine. While epidemiology andclinical share common assumptions about states ofhealth anddisease, thespecific applications ofknowledge give rise toimportant differences (10). As Ihave argued, knowledge about risk within epidemiology isscientific, objective, andmeasured. Risk isarelatively unambiguous andwell defined concept. Furthermore epidemiologic knowledge ofrisk isa general type ofknowledge that seeks toexplain relationships between a factor and adisease among large classes ofpeople. Unlike themedical practitioner, theepidemiologist does not need totranslate knowledge into practice andstates ofscientific uncertainty serve tostimulate thesearch for new knowledge (11). which understood asa science ofuniversals, thepractice ofmedicine can beunderstood asa science ofparticulars. While clinical medicine stems from similar historical traditions andshares with epidemiology, basic biomedical assumptions about causality and thenature ofhealth anddisease, the application knowledge about universals practical ofparticular individuals. One cannot expect. ..tobeable and application ofknown, certain knowledge andthus, uncertain knowledge represents clinical risk. Errors within epidemiology have theoretical consequences while errors within medical practice have immediate practical consequences. Risk within clinical medicine derives directly from thetranslation ofepidemiological andother scientific knowledge into clinical practice. Torecapitulate, objective clinical risk refers tothetranslation ofepidemiological risk into patient management. Inthis sense, Iamspeaking ofreinterpretations of objective measured risk into risk assigns and symptoms ofdisease. The second dimension concerns lived risk ortheclinician's experience oftherisk ofbeing wrong. The twodimensions breast cancer. Wecanbegin byexamining the first dimension, objective clinical risk. The assessment ofrisk factors plays animportant role inhelping thepractitioner reach a clinical Tomake arisk theclinician translate epidemiologic Thiss C -234-interpretation entails twoshifts inmeaning. First, risk comes to describe personal orindividual risk rather than population risk. Thus, instead that occurs isthat themeaning ofrisk shifts from that ofatheoretical statistical concept tohave a physical orreal existence. Theclinician comes tothink about risk within existing modes thought andpractice bytransforming risk into asign ofa\"possible\" current orfuture Thus, objective clinical risk comes tobeunderstood andtalked about inthe same way asother objective clinical signs ofdisease. This transformation ispartially illustrated byexamining the clinical diagnostic process that occurs when awoman first sees a clinician for abreast condition. When awoman isfirst seen atthe Breast Clinic attheuniversity hospital, apatient history istaken. During this process, risk factors areelicited along with other signs and symptoms. One nurse who worked inthis breast screening clinic explained: Wehave onourhistory form, significant risk factors and they are the ones that DrJones and DrSmith have identified asthe most significant...but these are notproven yet. The ones wehave identified aresex, age, obesity inpostmenopausal women only, personal family history ofinvasive breast cancer, conditions...My role assessment isspeaking factors asproperties ofthe patient. thedoctor has identified tobesignificant. Theclinician will heorsheassess themeanings L \u00ba\u00ba \u00ba -235-ofother signs and symptoms. Although clinicians elicit andassess risk factors, there remains much uncertainty concerning their significance. This isdue inpart to theambiguity oftheir meanings both within epidemiology and medical science. One surgeon explained: The problem isthat there arecertain accepted statistics for the female population asawhole and then there arethese statistics that involve specific populations that seem tocontradict the general, national, accepted, cancer study statistics. SoIdon't know. Andwhatever thegenetic predisposition, theenvironmental predisposition, what ever, them how toeliminate that risk 1 Many oftheclinicians interviewed expressed high levels ofuncertainty concerning theclinical significance oftherisk ofbenign breast conditions. Oneobstetrician explained: know what therelationship offibrocystic breasts are tocancer. Fibrocystic breasts are very common. No one knows how youpreselect from one totheother. We're all groping inrisk factors andtrying todefine thehigh risk population. When faced with interpreting theuncertainties ofrisk forpatient management, clinicians explained that they were hesitant totalk of risk instatistical terms. One surgeon explained howdifficult itwas todiscuss with women, their chances ofreoccurrence when they had already had adiagnosis ofbreast cancer. Iknow what theliterature says but when itcomes tometalking with that young woman with abreast cancer, all Ican doistalk about these ridiculous impersonal statistics. Forher, the statistics meaningless because andallthat other business. They are hollow statistics. They donothing when applied toanindividual. Ihave totell every single woman that our knowledge haslimits. Even ifIdothis disfiguring operation, Ican't offer any more than astatistical hope ofcure and only time will tell that problems intranslating statistics tohave personal relevance, clinicians dotranslate population risk into arisk figure forindividual patients. This isillustrated bythesurgeon who expresses concern over the chances that abenign condition might develop into breast cancer: Those women cysts, cancer. SoIdoworry about these patients. Ihave onehere...who Iamalittle bit concerned about. She has been coming insince 1976 and each time she comes inshe's got another cyst. ..andshe's been inseven times sofar. I'mgetting worried about her. There come atime when you have to sit down andsay, \"Well, look, statistically you've got about a 25% chance ofdeveloping breast cancer,\" and ask them tostart thinking bit about having asubcutaneous mastectomy. Here thesurgeon hastranslated apopulation risk into anindividual risk and, after doing has suggested amethod toremove therisk altogether. Andthis brings metomyfinal point concerning objective clinical risk. When faced with management ofrisk, surgeons have atendency to treat risk asthey would other undesirable physical conditions; removing thephysical condition that isassociated with risk. For example, biopsies areperformed both toobtain amore definitive diagnosis and toremove the lump Removal ofthe lump results inthe removal oftherisk ofapossible pre-malignant that of that resides inaparticular part ofthe body andsomething from which a patient then suffers. Two surgeons explained: Youreally have tosaytothe woman, \"You have this much risk in each breast over thenext 25years.\" Then they really have to decide how they feel about therisk. Itend tosee ayounger population, sometimes alower ofasifitwere disease, asign inaparticular part ofthe body and can beobserved bytheclinician. Risk, then, becomes transformed into aclinical entity, anentity that can now be manipulated andphysically removed bytheclinician. Faced with their ownuncertainties concerning the meaning oforgans ortissue atrisk, surgeons remove risk remove ofthebody. Bydoing so,they remove surgeon about doing biopsies and sometimes Iget alittle guilty about that. But you know, you have a situation that youfeel alittle guilty about only comment isrevealing asitintroduces the second dimension of clinical risk, the lived dimension. Lived clinical risk refers tothe clinician's ownexperiences ofrisk, primarily therisk ofbeing wrong. Lived clinical risk results from uncertainty concerning clinical knowledge anditsapplication inpractice. Objective clinical risk acts toincrease into asign Risk changes both clinical and layconcepts ofnormalcy. Apatient diagnosed with one or more risk factors enters astate where she isneither healthy nor diseased -agrey zone between health anddisease. Andthis ambiguous -238\u2014state ofbeing leads toclinical uncertainty concerning diagnosis, management andprognosis. Clinical uncertainty has always been aninherent component of medical practice. Theart ofdiagnosis consists ofbringing order meaning toaseries ofsigns inchapter themedical twobasic assumptions. Thefirst isthat there exists anobjective physical reality which medical andscientific knowledge candiscover and second, signs and symptoms refer tosome underlying physiological orchemical change the meaning ofwhich can beestablished agreed upon (Feinstein 1973, Mcghee etal. 1979) (12). Intheory, this process is itiscomplicated bythefact that the meanings ofstates ofill-health areforever between health anddisease and themeanings ofpatho-clinical states (Foucault 1973, King 1982). In reality, clinicians areforced tomake diagnoses based upon ever shifting andoften ambiguous kinds knowledge. Inmany cases, theelicitation ofrisk anditsclinical assessment helps tobring certainty totheclinical diagnosis and management. For example, inassessing the information elicited during aphysical exam andperhaps amammogram, factors helps the more invasive diagnostic procedures. Asurgeon explained: Iexamine her and make sure that Idon't feel anydistinct mass in herbreast, get mammograms, make sure that they're negative and that the woman gets followed. Butitdepends onfamily history, itdepends onsome oftheir risk meaning ofrisk with his orher ownuncertainties concerning the ability topredict andcontrol the outcome toremove theambiguity ofrisk byremoving thephysical condition itself. When faced with managing awoman with abenign condition, clinicians experience personal lived risk intwosenses. First, women diagnosed with benign conditions areatrisk asthey arethought tobe more likely Because oftheuncertainty astowhether ornot a woman condition will develop breast cancer, thecondition comes totake onthe double meaning ofbeing both normal and premalignant atthe same time. Clinicians must make clinical \u00ba decisions based upon anambiguous condition ofuncertain outcome. Second, women and doctors are atrisk for thefailure todetect asmall cancer hidden byabenign condition. Benign breast lumps canact to camouflage small cancers. Thus, clinicians experience lived risk asa uncertainty concerning the outcome ofacurrently benign condition and uncertainty concerning their ability todetect anexisting but camouflaged cancer (see quotes onpages 123-126). Objective risk andlived risk represent twodimensions ofclinical risk experienced bymedical practitioners. Ihave argued that clinicians translate objective risk into aclinical entity and then remove both objective risk andlived risk byremoving thephysical entity where risk resides. -240-6.3a Removing Through Surgery: Anextreme example time ofthis study, chronic fibrocystic disease combined with other risk factors, wasbeing advocated bysome clinicians asanindication forprophylactic Medicine\" breast inwomen offibrocystic medicine tomodify the risk factors forbreast cancer through non-invasive means, andsuggest that preventative surgery might beone way ofremoving risk. The major risk factors--age, prior breast disease, and afamily history--can beidentified but would ofearly made anumber offaulty assumptions about theepidemiologic meanings ofthe above risk factors. Concerning prior breast disease, they claim that \"...ahistory ofclinical or biopsy-proven fibrocystic disease cancer patients than incontrols\" (pp:503). From this data they assume that fibrocystic disease poses arisk factor forbreast cancer, yet, ofbenign Therelationships between these conditions andbreast -241-cancer have yet tobeclearly understood. There islittle evidence to show that two ofthe minor risk factors, caffeine andoral contraceptives, raise awoman's risk ofdeveloping breast cancer (13). Not only dotheauthors select risk factors which aredifficult to define within epidemiology but they make theassumption that thethree risk factors which they select asbeing most important (age, prior history offibrocystic breast disease andfamilial history), will have amultiplicative interaction. Calculated risk estimates for awoman with several risk factors will differ depending upon whether thefactors areadditive, multiplicative, synergistic that about howrisk factors interact toproduce breast cancer, isunknown. Theauthors then \"typical\" case reports ofwomen who elected tohave prophylactic mastectomy based upon their calculated personal risks. Because offibrocystic disease and family history ofbreast cancer, 29-year-old had ahole inhermattress inorder tosleep prone. She finally found asurgeon this complication which he relieved byclosed capsulotomy (pp:507-508). Theauthors andcontroversy, afewfirm conclusions emerge from this study and theliterature: (a) Women areraising questions about their personal risk of cancer androutes forprevention andcontrol; (b) Asmall number thelargest identifiable fraction ofanindividual's risk: sex, age, prior breast disease, and family history of histologically verified breast cancer; (c) Forcarefully counseled patients, prophylactic mastectomy may -242-beappropriate therapy (p:509). Ihave devoted time todiscussing this article asitillustrates several crucial points concerning trends intheclinical management of risk. While those whoadvocate prophylactic mastectomy toremove take that isbecoming increasingly common. Some ofthe surgeons who Iinterviewed illustrated this mode ofclinical thinking andpractice. which give rise totheindividual risk factors. Oneplastic surgeon explained: Surgeons who are concerned about breast disease have been trained. ..tohandle curative surgery. ...None ofushave been taught inmedical school orinresidency training about preventive surgery...There's Weare arepreventive types ofprocedures toprevent you from getting baddisease. Well, that's where, from asurgical philosophy, itisreally very different. Ifyou take awoman who hasbreast disease, proven disease bypathological tissue biopsy, ifyouthen combine family history; ifshe's of40and that that are dense anddifficult woman can be considered acandidate forprophylactic subcutaneous mastectomy. Another surgeon explained: Icertainly feel that probably anyone with avery risky family history isacandidate [for prophylactic mastectomy] orwhere you have patients with extremely difficult breasts tofollow... and of Course those who have more than one ofthose factors are definitely candidates. Both surgeons are speaking ofandfailing todistinguish between two kinds ofrisk; mastectomies, surgeons > clearly articulated that itistherisk that they are removing; risk L that resides asasign offuture disease within aparticular organ of t the body. Two surgeons explained: A Ifeel that when properly done, you canclean out 95% ofthe 3.* tissue and inessence, you're I've told maybe 10women tohave subcutaneous mastectomies rid ofwhen and how toperform aprophylactic mastectomy isacontroversial one. Much uncertainty exists over how much breast tissue needs toberemoved toreduce therisk significantly. Asyet, nocontrol studies have Thus, thebelief that a reduction inagiven percentage ofbreast tissue results inasimilar reduction inrisk isbased largely upon the assumption that risk is evenly distributed throughout thebreast. This assumption remains unproven. One surgeon expressed reservations with theprocedure, ashe alone would ever make medoamastectomy. Asapart ofthis research, Iregularly attended case conferences atthe theperiod ofayear. These special conferences were held todiscuss particularly problematic cases and the issues ofrisk andpatient management were common topics. The issue of risk andprophylactic mastectomy raised much debate among conference -244-participants and thefollowing case study illustrates many ofthe s dilemmas facing clinicians inthe management ofrisk. L The case ofa36year old woman waspresented toconference members because the woman's clinician was uncertain about theclinical andpathological meanings ofdetected breast changes. The woman's surgeon, Dr. Smith, began bysaying that the woman had been referred to himfor alump inherleft breast. Upon aphysical exam, hediagnosed the had come back \"suspicious with 3clusters then performed abiopsy which was diagnosed bythepathologist as\"severe atypia\" (13). are intheleft breast, onebenign and one less well defined.\" He then asked theclinicians what their diagnosis would to describe of 6women with similar conditions who were seen mammogram represented further evidence ofapossible carcinoma. Oneclinician cited studies which showed that 50% ofall women will have atleast one calcification and that three were not enough -245-anopen debate for women with chronic fibrocystic disease. Various studies were cited insupport ofdiffering positions. After approximately 10minutes ofargument, thepathologist called for the need for a\"management decision nodefinitive decision was won't letthat drop will you? There arecases when you would with high risks.\" This example illustrates several points. Theclinicians all agreed that thepresent diagnosis wasthat ofabenign condition, not a malignant one. However, itwas unclear astojust howbenign the from that ofa non-disease tothat ofdisease. The ambiguity ofthecondition was clearly for todeal with the ambiguous meaning byrecommending removal ofthe physical condition that gave rise tothis ambiguity inthefirst place. The removal ofthebreast represents removal ofrisk, both the objective risk oftheprobability that thecondition will become malignant and thelived risk ofclinical uncertainty anderror. The -246-result istheclinical creation ofaphysical condition over which the doctor now hascontrol. Thus, theclinical management ofrisk can result inthephysical manipulation ofthe body inorder tocreate a more certain physical world. 6.4 LIVED RISK: LAY EXPERIENCES OF THE AMBIGUITIES OF NON-HEALTH: For women, adiagnosis ofbenign breast disease often changes her perceptions ofhealth andillness. Forexample, consider thefollowing statements from women who diagnosed ashaving therisk factor ofbenign breast disease: Ihave very lumpy breasts. sure ifit's adisease or what the devil itis. Ihad some discomfort butI'dnever had thethought that this was adisease! You know, one dayyou're walking down thestreet feeling wonderful and then all ofasudden somebody tells youthat maybe you shouldn't feel sowonderful! Risk for the lay woman becomes experienced asasymptom ofa hidden orfuture illness and thus serves tofurther blur thealready ambiguous distinction between experiences ofhealth andexperiences of illness (15). Women speak ofrisk inthe same waythat they speak of experiencing other symptoms ofillness. Just asclinicians speak of risk assomething that women suffer from, women speak ofrisk asan experienced state ofbeing. Being atrisk isastate between health andillness. Furthermore, women have little control over changing their risk experience andthis canresult intheadditional risk towards asitdraws upon methodologies which areinterpretative innature andgives priority between aperson's experience ofagiven reality and science's explanation ofthat same reality 1976). difference isthat thelatter agood amount ofunmeasurable thought processes, atleast arecommunicated, are useful only inhandling material that be converted into language\" (Cassell 1976:36). Cassell's point isan important one aslived risk involves many factors that cannot beknown, cannot bemeasured andthus cannot always bespoken about. Even when there ismuch information about individual risk, this information often has ahigh degree ofambiguity about it. Daniel Ellsberg hasargued -248that: Ambiguity may behigh (and theconfidence inanyparticular estimate ofprobabilities where there when there arequestions ofreliability and relevance ofinformation, where is andevidence. This judgement ofthe ambiguity ofone's information, oftheover-all credibility of one's composite estimates, affect (1961:659). For women, information about their ownindividual risk will always behighly ambiguous forseveral reasons. First, there exists much uncertainty within epidemiology concerning thesignificance of identified risk factors, Second, there exists much uncertainty within both epidemiology andother biomedical sciences concerning the mechanisms bywhich identified risk factors might act toproduce breast cancer. Third, itisimpossible toaccurately translate population risk toindividual risk. Andfourth, itisimpossible toknow all the contextual factors they todetermine risk forunique individuals. itisprecisely toknow all oftheinformation needed topredict unique outcomes. Lived risk will always have asacentral characteristic, aninherent quality ofunmeasured uncertainty. Lived risk emerges from anindividual's subjective feelings about the meaning ofscientific andclinical risk mediated bythesocial andcultural contexts within which individuals live. Lived risk isnotobjective, cannot bequantified and isnotstatic. Rather, lived risk must be understood asadynamic experience ofpersonal uncertainty about one's future. Lived risk represents thesubjective experience ofhighly ambiguous states ofhealth.- * -249-Within clinical medicine andpublic health, lived risk isoften equated with objective clinical risk andwith epidemiologically determined risk. Health practitioners often believe that ifan individual fully understands therisks associated with thedevelopment ofaparticular disease, then they will take actions toreduce their risk. However, there isoverwhelming evidence toshow that individuals often ignore their risks and donothing tochange their style oflife. Smoking behavior isaprime example. Concerning breast health, much attention has been given tothe importance ofmonthly breast self examinations however, few women regularly engage inthis practice (American Cancer Society 1973, Magarey, Todd andBlizard 1977). The most common explanations given for anindividual's failure torecognize risk include psychological, social andstructural factors which inhibit ofinformation, orinhibit changes inbahavior. Decision-making theory and models are common approaches towards understanding how and why individuals make thedecisions they do concerning risk andchoice. However, these models are inadequate for understanding layconcepts ofrisk because they donotaccount for the fact that risk within epidemiology andclinical medicine isdefined by different terms ofreference (16). Lived risk hasits own terms of reference andtherefore, its ownstandards bywhich risks areassessed andevaluated. Thus, reasons why individuals often totake actions toreduce their risk ofdisease may inpart different three types ofrisk arelargely incommensurate often -250goes unrecognized. Even when health practitioners acknowledge dimensions oflived risk, itisdifficult for them totranslate this in apractical way when counselling individuals. For example, a geneticist whocounsels women concerning their personal risks for developing breast cancer explained that shelikes tobeable to\"give women anumber\": Well, myapproach istofind out from women what they think their risk is... and then Idetermine what their risks are. Italk to women about all the factors that can influence awoman's risk and then give them numbers; ofhow many women who have thecondition, what thepercent ofrisk Igive people anumber, arisk number. For some things like stress, personality, diet, it's very difficult toput anumber onthose things. Clearly this geneticist epidemiological andclinical assessments of risk? First, risk for women represents potential changes intheir experience oftherelationship between one's itfrom anobjective entity toa subjective experience. Risk becomes internalized. One woman explained tome: Iknew intellectually that Iwas athigh risk but Ididn't feel it inside. And then mymother died ofcancer ofthepancreas that's the tomeand Istarted getting alittle bit scared. Inthis research, women described their personal risk not inthe language ofobjective knowing butrather know ifI'mathigh risk now, more sothan Iwould beifIdidn't have this. Another woman expresses herfeelings lowrisk ofbreast CanCer: I've wondered about ofmeisfairly. isnot theright word, positive isabetter choice. Ifeel that for some reason, I'm here onthis earth and I'm meant tobehere... But then there isthis tiny part ofmethat thinks, happened toalot ofpeople impossible for women toexperience lived risk interms ofstatistical probabilities. Irving Good (1975) has argued that thenotion ofsubjective orpersonal probability is important forextending ordinary logic into useful everyday systems of reasoning. Using themetaphor ofa\"black box theory ofprobability and rationality\", heargues that subjective probabilities consist of inequities between probabilities andthat these inequities constitute a \"body ofbeliefs\" (1975:44). Thus, subjective areonly Kristin Luker (1975), hasapplied this notion ofsubjective probabilities why some continue dangerous risks pregancies. Inher tousecontraception, awoman must decide how\"likely\" itis that shewill become pregnant andthat often women discount future risks and focus instead upon thecost ofpresent consequences. Discounting isasocial process because itinvolves -252-interaction between herpersonal values and those ofothers. Risk taking emerges from awoman's subjective feelings about thecosts of immediate consequences compared tothose ofuncertain futures. The concept ofsubjective probability can beusefully applied to ourunderstanding ofwomen's experiences oflived risk andbreast cancer. First, the women interviewed were well aware ofthe uncertainty that exists inclinical medicine concerning themeaning of identified risk factors and were faced with having tomake asubjective decision concerning the meaning ofthese risk factors within the context oftheir ownlives. While women maydiscount their risk of getting breast cancer, adiagnosis ofbenign breast disease can immediately act tobring personal meaning torisk. Inthis sense, a diagnosis ofbenign breast disease can beunderstood tosymbolize a current state ofill-health. Awoman diagnosed with benign breast disease isimmediately thrown into ahighly ambiguous state ofbeing at risk, ofbeing suddenly neither healthy norill. Thediscounting of risk until itcomes tohave personal meaning isillustrated following quotes: Ialways Iwould never Idon't doalot ofthings togetit. But since then, Iconsider itareal possibility. Iread somewhere that women whodon't have children before the age of26ordon't breast feed are more likely togetit(breast cancer) butitdoesn't butfeel that I must have some sort ofpredisposition. For women who have developed breast cancer, risk has resulted in certain unwanted and feared futures. What was once risk isnow an experienced present. Andhere, risk loses much ofitsunmeasured -253-uncertainty. Risk iscertain experience \"risk\" asbecoming theillness they feared. In the same sense that women \"become ill\", the onset ofbreast explained that notonly was sheatrisk for a future cancer but that she had also become arisk statistic: After 5years, ifnothing has gone wrong, then you arefree (of cancer). Then youdon't have nothing toworry about. But Istill have fear. The thing Idoknow isthat I'mwhat youcall a statistic and Iamacancer patient. Andanother woman expressed similar feelings asshereflected upon why she had developed cancer: Ihadearly menarchy and Ihadlate cessation ofmymenses and the risk statistically. I've had nochildren andthat's another risk factor. Imean we're alljust bodies and I'mgoing tofall into some statistic eventually. These last two women express what isperhaps most important about lived risk and that isthe issue ofcontrol. The uncertainties ofrisk present women with many dilemmas asthere ispresently little they can dotochange their risk factors. Many ofthe women inthestudy expressed much frustration with this lack ofpersonal control over risk. For example, when Iasked a26year old woman ifthedoctors had told her ofanything she could dotoprevent further breast problems, she said: Well, you know, nocoffee, notea, nocaffeine, none ofwhich Ido anyway. Which was agreat let down tothedoctors, which was another thing that frustrated mebecause they over risk often leads medicalization. Because women often feel helpless todo -254-anything tochange their risk, they areleft atthehands ofthe One woman expressed explaining: Ialways feel that DrSmith ismore incontrol than Like I say, he's one ofthe fewpeople that canintimidate me, and I don't think hedoes that, certainly notintentionally. But he does. Icome out towait next time toseeifthat's it. But \"What you have is serious and towatch walk away from it,sure. Icould \"It's been 2years doctor, thank you very much foryour help. Idon't want todiscuss itany more. I don't want totalk about itanymore.\" And maybe one day Iwill do that. But Iamnot ready todothat yet. Ijust simply ready todothat. Hekeeps asking meifIkeep getting my periods. Ikeep thinking that maybe it's true that once your periods stop some ofthese lumps goaway with it. You know, I have nocontrol over that. Who knows. I'mnotabout toworry about something Ihave nocontrol over. Sofor the time being, we will play ithis way and see what happens. But ifhetells me something Idon't want, Idon't know what I'll do. This woman raises several important issues concerning layrisk. First, while itisclear that this woman does not have cancer, her doctor has diagnosed her ashaving aserious benign condition and she istherefore atrisk forcancer. The doctor isnotquite certain about the outcome the woman isnotquite certain ifshe is\"supposed\" uncertainty hissurveillance over hercondition until it either goes away orbecomes cancer. The woman isleft thinking that her menopause might cause her lumps todisappear but she has nocontrol over when this might occur anditisnotatallcertain astowhether this will clear uptheproblem. Therefore, the woman isleft feeling that shehas noalternatives being medicalized. Faced isnoway andthat early isa -255woman's primary tactic this woman iscaught inabind of being healthy but ofneeding medical surveillance until hercondition either becomes cancer orgoes away. Inhercurrent state, canthis woman ever walk away from herdoctor anddeclare herself well? Ina very real sense, being diagnosed arisk factor. It represents therisk ofmedicalization and therisk oflosing control over the definition ofone's own health. Risk for women represents many uncertainties concerning the meanings ofpresent health states and thepossibilities offuture ones. The loss oflaycontrol over risk management stems from medical construction ofrisk. AsIhave argued, medical practitioners deal with risk bytransforming itinto entity, asign ofa present risk factors inthe same waythat they arediagnosed with having disease. Within this context, women reconstruct these disease experiences into illness realities. Risk becomes experienced both asasymptom offuture illness aswell asacurrent illness. Asdoctors give into anexperienced abnormality intheir state ofhealth. Forexample, one woman diagnosed with fibrocystic breat disease, clearly experienced her condition asanillness. She states: Since Iknow that your breasts can befilled with fluid andthat itdrains through these little lymph nodes, Ihave animage of everything building upandhaving noplace togoanditmakes my body like awaste heap. And ifitdoes drain and Imean, the images aretotally stupid! It's like, what Iknow ofwhen they do mastectomies, that they sometimes have totake outthose lymph nodes and so, Ifeel like it's poison. It's poison building upin mybreasts with noplace togo! Ipicture these other women with their great systems that just run thestuff through! Andhere's me, these strange clogs, you know? women dotocontrol their illness ofrisk? Some choose todeny that they might beatrisk. They choose tocreate certainty by denying theexistence ofrisk factors. However, this can sometimes lead todeadly consequences asthedenial ofrisk results inthe failure totake Aswe have seen inChapter 5,Molly wasconsistently told that her lump represented nodanger andfive years later was diagnosed with alate stage breast cancer. Molly did not have the knowledge totake control over uncertainty. She did not have the power tojudge whether ornot herdoctors were making responsible decisions about herrisk ofcancer. Ontheother hand, women may choose toremove therisk through removal ofthephysical condition where therisk resides. One young woman who Iinterviewed asapart ofthelarge epidemiology terrible. Her death was worse than Iimagined. The cancer went toher spine andliver. She was only 41and had 3little children. She had found the lump 2years before andherdoctor told heritwasnothing toworry about and tocome back and they would follow it. Well, she came back ayear later anditwas CanCere Ithad been inme. Ifelt funny 'cause I had toinsist onsurgery. You normally don't dothat. But I wanted itout! Out ofthere! This woman, like clinicians, chose toremove therisk byremoving the lump itself. And inextreme situations, some women feel that they must control risk through prophylactic mastectomy. This extreme act toresolve the experiences oflived risk isvery much influenced bythepractitioner's attempt clinical offailing Itrepresents ashifting ofclinical-- responsibility foruncertainty tothe woman. Rather than throwing this uncertainty back tothedoctor, some women choose toresolve this conflict byallowing thedoctor toremove that part oftheir body uncertain. Butironically, while thedoctor isusually successful inremoving and regaining control over aphysical condition about which heorshe is now more certain, women suffer from the symptoms ofanowcertain-* illness: removal oftheir breasts. While doctors have treated andd cured risk through physical removal ofpart ofthe body, risk for women has been transformed into aphysical reality. For women, the ambiguities ofhealth andillness are now made clear. While the woman thinks shehas avoided breast cancer, she hasbrought about clear physical changes inherexperiences ofhealth. The following case study illustrates this dilemma. Asdescribed\u00ba inchapter 2,alarge part ofthis research emerged from myexperiences - conducting structured interviews with women participating inan epidemiology project concerned with risk factors ofbenign breast disease andbreast cancer. After each interview, Iwould teach women how toperform breast self-exams. complete, Iasked herifshe wanted metoreview with herbreast self exams. She said that she did. Iasked her toremove her blouse and she became upset, she was both angry and sad. Herstory assherelated -258-ittomeisthus: Alice had been seeing DrBrown for 7years because oflumpy breasts. Alice explained that she had had multiple lumps, had had 5 cysts aspirated and 2previous biopsies. DrBrown hadtold herthat but not enough toindicate acancer. However, because ofher lumpy breasts and hersuspicious mammogram, DrBrown had recommended that she have subcutaneous bilateral mastectomies. Alice said that hetold her that she had an 80% chance ofdeveloping nothing and a20%chance ofdeveloping cancer. She went home and thought about her chances anddecided that shedidn't want \"that 20% chance hanging soshe didit. Atthis Alice told methat she was happy that shediditbutthat itwas still painful. Shesaid that she would rather live with thepain than with the 20% chance. Sheexplained that when they did themastectomy that herdoctor told herthat they had found \"atiny, of apin, cell that waspre-cancerous.\" Shesaid that itwas good that they had done amastectomy because the 20% had gone to50%. Atthis point, Alice paused. She looked atme, looked down atherbreasts and then close totears shesaid \"But hard getting use tosomething that isnot that since she has been able toresume her normal activities, that her doctor considers theoperation asuccess. Alice that hehas know what Isitthere head and says that Iamdoing well andthat Ishouldn't worry. I feel like taking him and shaking him and saying \"Listen tome!\" I asked himifthemastectomy would affect myuterus -259-would not, that thebreasts were uphere and theuterus and ovaries were down there andthat they were twoseparate systems. But any woman knows that they arenot. Around your period, your breasts hurt and when you're pregnant, your breasts fill up. Any woman knows that they areconnected. Iasked him ifitwould that mybreasts hurt around myperiod but hesaid that they shouldn't because heremoved most ofthetissue. Alice then told methat she had afriend who had ahysterectomy but whostill knows when she issuppose you goask your wife .\"Mynewbreasts feel like stones onmychest, like big weights. But you know, thesilicone waslight, Iheld it. Why should itfeel soheavy? When Ilie feel like they're falling totheside but when Ilook atthem, they arenot. Iwent ahead anddiditbecause DrBrown isretiring soon and he has seen meall these years and Iwanted itdone before that so that Iwouldn't have toworry about it. How many women like Alice, choose toremove their risk inthis manner not knowing theconsequences that they must live with? The medical treatment ofrisk through surgical procedures represents a dangerous trend inmedical and laythinking andaction. Inmy interviews with surgeons, Iconcluded byasking them howthey would solve the whole breast health controversy ifthey had the power todo so. Only one surgeon spoke ofinventing non-invasive preventative measures while all theothers spoke ofnewtreatment procedures. alarming and she's going togetcancer, I'd know exactly -260what todo. That's real easy, atall, youdon't Ifyou doitontheright patient, you canprevent her from getting breast cancer. You can have aneffect ontheir life span! That's what it's all about. Let metell you avery interesting thing. Probably the bottom line for you and your study here. Breast cancer isthe most common cancer inthe female body. 26 %ofall carcinomas inthe female body arebreast. Over 110 or115thousand women every year getbreast cancer inthe United States. About 35thousand women every year die ofbreast cancer intheUnited States. Those arepretty awesome figures. OK? the advancement ofmammograms aspiration and inall the modern techniques ofsurgery andall these things we've evolved inthelast 15, 20years, the most interesting thing isthat there's still anincrease. We're finding more breast cancer, ...perhaps ourdiagnostic techniques are improving. But inspite ofall the improvement intechnique, themortality rate forbreast cancer over thelast 40 years, ...these figures are from theNational Cancer Institute, the mortality rate hasstayed almost flat! Almost the same! Soin other words, even though we're being more aware ofit.. .and we have all kinds ofmedical research going on,allthevarious things, westill have not had asignificant effect atlowering the rate. Sothat's where theconcern andperhaps the philosophy ifyouwill, ofsubcutaneous mastectomy comes into play. Ifinfact you can take women that are attruly, Imean without anyquestion, ...you eliminate the ones that there isa question on,truly athigh risk, and meet all thecriteria, and if you canoperate onthem and lower their risk factor from 40% to 2%, then youwill have aneffect over the long term onthe rate cancer. Andthat's where subcutaneous mastectomy opposed todying but Ithink you have tolive the way you want tolive and youcan't live inpieces Atleast that's the feel that way ifit were mylittle finger... Ijust think that there has tobe something else besides lopping things off. Mendon't loptheir private parts off when they have cancer. They simply don't do that. They find another way around it... Idobelieve that the -261-medical profession seems tolook, particularly atbreasts as something that isnotessential toliving, breathing, moving and all ofthese various things. Andthey're right. Butneither are testicles. They don't golopping those off. They can dowithout that whole bottom part andget along very well. But they don't do that. They don't dothat because itdoes something psychologically andthey understand itfrom that point ofview. But they seem tofind itreally rather ridiculous that awoman would think that that's important. Ithink the same thing iseven true with hysterectomies. \"It's disease, lets just cutitout and then wewon't have toworry itanymore.\" todo something. Imean, ifyou have brain cancer, andit's avery sad thing tohave, there isnoquestion but they don't cutyour head off. They have tothink ofsomething else todoifthey can. sense that themedicalization be understood asaculture bound syndrome. Being atrisk factors without the\"proof\". Itexpresses anillness state and a disease entity that arises from anxieties anduncertainties about our ability tocontrol future states ofhealth. Risk then, transforms an unpredictable future into apresent state ofbeing that can be diagnosed, treated andcontrolled. Ittransforms possible future states ofillhealth into apresent liminal state ofbeing that is between the dilemmas that arise inclinical practice. For abrief but well written description ofthehistorical relationships between therise ofscientific thought, biology and medicine see Capra 1982, pp97-117. The Henle-Koch postulates state that inorder for not befound with anyother disease 3. must beable tobeisolated from the one who has the disease and becultured through several generations and produce thediseases within experimental animals (Susser 1973). Many early scientists recognized thelimitations ofthe reductionist, mechanistic models, however, these models seemed to explanatory power andutility.

Iambasing myarguments concerning paradigm shifts onKuhn's ideas ofscientific revolutions. Kuhn argues that puzzles that resist solution are seen asanomalies rather than as falsifications ofaparticular paradigm ofunsolved puzzles does notnecessarily lead toa crisis. Scientific revolutions occur when competing paradigms are created and when more and more members ofthescientific community adopt the newparadigm. Kuhn compares scientific revolutions to political revolutions inthat choices between old and new political institutions orscientific paradigms represent choices between incompatible modes ofcommunity life. Thus, theshift from one paradigm toanother isnot one based upon logical argument, rather itisonebased upon persuasion. This iswhy Kuhn argues that competing paradigms are incommensurable. The concept anditsusewithin epidemiology andclinical within thecurrent biomedical paradigm. Myargument isthat the use of risk does notrepresent ashift toanewparadigm, butrather an attempt toexplain emerging anomalies within thecurrent paradigm. For amore in-depth discussion ofKuhn's ideas and the the philosophy ofscience see Chalmers (1978). Fewepidemiologists have openly advocated achange in epidemiological thinking itself nor have they seriously considered theepistemiological assumptions upon which epidemiological logic rests. Michael Marmot's article, \"Facts, Opinions tothis ofthought are found intheimplicit assumptions ofgeneral susceptibility theory. Theadvocates of this theory argue that instead offocusing upon causes ofdisease inthose beunderstood asashift modes ofthinking. Complex causal models may beinappropriate forthinking about health inthefirst place. This would obviously lead tonew models orways ofthinking about health, disease andillness. Berkman 1981, Berkman and Syme 1979, and Najman 1980 have presented discussions concerning this newtheoretical model. Lilienfeld andLilienfeld argue that \"acausal relationship would berecognized toexist whenever evidence indicates that the factors form apart kinds ofrisk aretobe defined andcalculated within epidemiology. Iamnot concerned here with particular kinds ofepidemiological risks butrather with the more general concept ofrisk. Although epidemiologists_*- : -> s : -265-10. ll. 12.have gone togreat lengths toprecisely define different types of risk (e.g. relative risk, attributable risk, etc.), few have considered the meaning oftheconcept itself. Adefinition of risk andprobability asgiven intheDictionary ofEpidemiological Concepts (Last 1983) lends some interesting insights into the epidemiological belief intheconcept ofrisk. Probability is defined as\"...a basic concept that may beconsidered undefinable, expressing \"degree ofbelief.\" Risk then, expresses that anevent 1983). inthe allqualified trained inmedicine. Epidemiology isoften referred toasabranch ofmedicine and there has been much controversy between Schools ofPublic Health intheUnited States concerning admitting non-medical scientists toepidemiology programs. Thus, most epidemiologists begin their training within thedominant medical model ofthinking andpractice. ofscience arefully respected\" (1976:53). Epidemiology shares this quest for unknown knowledge. The usehere ofthe terms signs and symptoms isconsistent with -266-13. 14. 15.thedefinitions given byStedman's Medical Symptom ordeparture from infunction, appearance, and indicative ofdisease.\" thehistory oftheconcepts ofsigns and symptoms areprovided byKing (1982) and Foucault (1975). Some studies have shown that caffeine isassociated with benign conditions however other studies have not confirmed this relationship. Caffeine has not been shown tobeassociated with breast cancer. Theepidemiological evidence concerning oral contraceptives isjust asdifficult. Oral contraceptives appear to beprotective against benign breast conditions andifone assumes that therisk factors forbenign conditions andbreast cancer are similar, then oral contraceptives might infact, beprotective against breast cancer. Thepoint Iamusing the s \u00ba -267-16.Symptoms andsigns ofill-health have corresponding relationships. are what suffers, they are thesubjective experiences ofillness. Signs arewhat thedoctor observes, they are theobjective manifestations ofdisease. Much has written concerning thedifferent dimensions oflay andbiomedical experiences andexplanations ofill-health, one oftheimportant points that while theclinician operates within abiomedical model where heorsheelicits signs leading todiagnosis, treatment and cure ofdisease, this approach may notheal a patient's illness. Thepatient's experience ofill-health often goes encounter. Thesubjective experience of ill-health isembedded within asocial and cultural context.

This istheprovince ofthetechnical experts. . ..The second 7: CONCLUSION 7.1 SUMMARY Inthis research, Ihave been concerned with exploring how women anddoctors forbreast andtheir doctors face when translating uncertain orambiguous information tohave clinical significance. Uncertainty will always form aninherent part ofmedical practice and assuch, clinicians will never befree ofnewtechnologies and maydecrease uncertainty insome areas, these developments will inturn produce new kinds ofclinical uncertainty. Thus, clinical fallibility will continue toexist along with advances intheproduction ofmedical knowledge and technology. Ihave that toplay a central role inmedical models ofhealth and disease. Risk has come to Condense multiple meanings ofuncertainty about health, illness and disease. Forepidemiologists, theconcept ofrisk has emerged from attempts measures thepossible associations ofvarious factors toa particular disease within large populations. The language ofrisk then, isquantifiable andobjective. But for theclinician, risk becomes more Concept. Ittakes Onasubjective, for thediagnosis and management ofaspecific patient. But because aclinician can never have perfect knowledge about aspecific l individual, clinical risk takes onthe added dimension oftherisk of- being wrong. Inherent inclinical risk, isthepatient's risk of developing disease andtheclinician's risk ofmaking awrong diagnosis \u00ba orprognosis. Within this context, risk not somuch asatheoretical concept, butrather, inthe same waythat they think ofother Risk becomes understood, spoken about andtreated asasign ofacurrent orfuture disease. Risk factors become understood, spoken about andtreated asifthey were a disease entity. Thus, clinicians tend todiagnose patients \"atrisk\" inthe same way they diagnose other disease states. And once diagnosed, clinicians often treat patients forrisk byremoving the tissue where risk isseen toreside. though theprescription ofdrugs, biopsies intheextreme case, prophylactic mastectomy. However, procedures donot remove therisk ofbreast cancer thepatient, butrather, they remove theclinician's personal risk ofmaking awrong diagnosis or prognosis. | For women, being diagnosed \"atrisk\" isadistressing and confusing experience. Being diagnosed with risk factors often leads to greater medical surveillance. Risk takes onthe added dimension ofa woman's ownpersonal risk Awoman's risk also includes herclinician's risk ofbeing wrong and the risks introduced with increased medical surviellance and intervention. The fact that these different dimensions ofrisk have -271gone unrecognized hasresulted intheinability ofwomen totake back control over their health. Often, they feel that theonly thing they can doistofollow their doctors advice. For women, being diagnosed atrisk changes herperceptions ofherhealth and her body. \"Being at risk\" isbeing somewhere between health andillness. This process I have referred toasthemedicalization ofrisk. Being diagnosed with risk throws a\"patient\" into aliminal space between health and disease. Themedicalization ofrisk isaprocess that isbecoming more common for together account for 67percent ofall (World Health 1984). The incidence andprevalence ofthese diseases arestrongly associated with socio-environmental risk and Syme 1979, Lindheim and Syme 1983). Yet, ithas been difficult formedical scientists, public health professionals andpolicy makers totranslate epidemiologic understandings ofthese diseases into preventive public health approaches. One ofthe dilemmas ishow toapply information about what keeps populations healthy orwhat makes them sick tounderstanding what keeps individuals healthy orwhat makes them sick (Rose 1985). The primary approach towards theprevention ofchronic disease has been directed towards individuals and themedical establishment has begun toput more emphasis onthepractice ofpreventive medicine. Yet, while enormous levels ofresources have been allocated tomedicine, ithas hadlittle impact upon improving 1977). Major -routine anddiabetes. Screening involves theelicitation ofrisk factors and \u00ba treatment for those patients found tobeathigh risk. Treatment typically involves theperscription ofexercise, modifications indiet, and drug therapy. While treatment forrisk may ormay not be successful forindividual patients, itdoes thewider socio-environmental andpolitical contexts that produce risk andill health. Why then, has theemphasis upon intervention inindividual risk factors gained somuch attention? First, thedominant research model, that oftheexperimental approach isbest suited tostudying interactions and effects onthe individual and sub-individual level. Thebiomedical model hashistorically ignored environmental andsocial factors. Second, thecultural values ofindustrialized societies place amajor emphasis theindividual. Individuals are seen tobe responsible fortheir ownwell-being andapproaches that emphasize individual responsibility andself-control are dominant (Wallack 1984). The dominant biomedical model andcultural values define the way in which problems of\"cause\" and\"prevention\" areunderstood. Both thedominant biomedical model which focuses upon diagnoses, treatment and cure andourcultural values which emphasize the importance ofindividual responsibility shape the way inwhich doctors think about Inacontext changes, themedical management of -273-risk becomes aparticularly difficult problem. The very concept of prevention embodies contradictions asprevention implies thecurrent absence ofanundesirable physical orpsychological condition. Prevention requires that thedoctor extend his orhercontrol toensure the absence ofthese future disease states. Doctors must control what does notyetexist. The future ofthese states isalways uncertain and arethus transformed into present states ofillhealth. Risk then, symbolically condenses what isunknowable anduncontrollable into a \"real\" disease category. What emerges isthecultural creation ofa newdisease andillness Ratcliffe etal. (1984) have argued that abasic conflict exists between health promotion andhealth protection. Health promotion isbased oneducating individuals about how toremove themselves from risk whereas health protection ispolicy-oriented and aimed atremoving risk from theenvironment. Health promotion is clearly linked totheprivatization ofmedicine and therise ofthe medical practitioner asthepolicy-maker inWestern uncritical acceptance scientific meaning ofrisk conceptualized within epidemiology thediagnosis risk inindividuals. Ithasdiverted attention away from translating epidemiologic knowledge into population level interventions and has allowed the focus tobedirected towards the medicalization ofrisk within individuals. 7.2 TOWARDS AN ANTHROPOLOGY OFRISK: The study ofrisk hasuntil recently been the domaine of -274psychologists, epidemiologists, economists, anddecision making theorists. Only oneanthropologist hasdirectly addressed risk from an anthropological view. Douglas andWildvasky (1982) have explored how cultural values andbeliefs shape the ways inwhich societies select risks they deem tobeimportant. Yet they fail toaddress thecultural creation oftheconcept itself. The concept ofrisk symbolizes contradictions indeeply held values ofoursociety. Risk forms aconstellation offormal and popular beliefs about thepossibility ofunwanted future states. Asa cultural concept, itrepresents oursociety's attempt reality and totake future. Butitalso expresses afundamental cultural dis-ease with being unable to understand theincreasing complexity ofourworld. Risk emerges from andpoints towidening gaps inourcurrent explanations and understandings about ourrelationships between past andpresent to future events. Itbrings meaning toandtherefore legitimizes the liminal states between current and future states inoursociety's core meanings andbehavioral norms about sickness (Carr 1978, Kleinman 1980). First, risk speaks ofa\"belief\" incause without theconcrete evidence. Itgives reality toambiguous causal agents such asstress, migration, diet, personality type, andexercise. Second, risk allows ustoapply traditional andculturally \"appropriate\" approaches of prevention tonewdisease entities. Itembodies deeply held values ofpersonal responsibility ustoperpetuate ourcultural myths toconquer and -275control disease. Risk has become acore cultural symbol expressing illusions ofcontrol over anincreasingly chaotic world. While risk, asacultural symbol, expresses meanings about control over future states ofill-health, thevery acceptance oftheconcept as apart inmeaning risk, which once expressed our very lack ofcontrol over the future, has become transformed into anentity which, ifcontrolled, can change ourfuture. Thecultural areresponsible for and assomething that that might reduce themedicalization ofrisk for breast cancer and other chronic conditions. First, medical scientists, clinicians and lay women need torecognize thelimits ofknowledge. Itisimportant that uncertainty inhealth science, medical practice and layhealth beaccepted as legitimate, resulting from knoweldge that changes andevloves along with the advances inresearch. Second, clinicians need torecognize thedifficulities of translating epidemiologic risk clinical practice. While epidemiologic studies areinvaluable interms ofpointing tospecific risk factors need toassess therelative and scientific knowledge into themanagement ofanindividual patient will always befraught with uncertainty. Itissimply notpossible to predict with certainty, disease outcomes within individuals. Itisimportant that women learn toaccept that their doctors are unable todiagnose many conditions with anycertainty and must themselves accept responsibility fortheir ownstate ofrisk. Often, patients want their doctors totell them todo, and anessential part ofthis relationship consists ofthetrust thepatient must develop with their doctor. Thesharing ofclinical uncertainty should not beseen tothreaten this bond oftrust. of thelimits kinds of knowing. Amutual sharing ofuncertainty canresult inamore equitable relationship between doctor andpatient leading togreater patient participation fordecision making. And here lies animportant caveat formedical anthropologists who areworking within thediscipline ofepidemiology. Many ofushave been concerned with applying ouranthropological understandings epidemiologically defined andcultural risk factors. Andwhile ourcontribution isgreatly needed, weshould bewary that social and cultural processes donot become reduced tofactors which are translated only into risk reduction within individuals. Rather, we must ensure that ourunderstandings are more general inapplication and have relevance tohealth protection research andhealth policy issues. that ourstrength lie -277-appliction ofour knowledge needs tobedirected primarily towards socio-cultural solutions rather than medical interventions. Finally, breast cancer kills approximately 30,000 women inthe United States each year. While emphasis upon mass screening, self breast examination, early detection andbetter treatment procedures is vital, none ofthese procedures prevent thedisease. The problem of breast cancer will not besolved through thedevelopment ofbetter detection andtreatment techniques. Theultimate solution lies in understanding theetiology ofbreast cancer. Although more research directed towards understanding how thedisease can beprevented is certainly needed, itisunlikely that such research will provide substantial results inthenear future. Thereality ofthesituation is that breast cancer isaserious health threat that currently cannot be prevented. Treatment ispainful and not always successful. Aswith many chronic diseases, theunderstanding andtreatment ofbreast cancer isfraught with many uncertainties. These uncertainties represent risks. And thedimensions ofrisk asconceptualizedd within epidemiology, medical science, clinical practice dimensions ofrisk arefully recognized and made legitimate, clinical control over uncertainty through themedicalization ofrisk will only increase. -278BIBLIOGRAPHY 1976 Causality J.ofMed.
