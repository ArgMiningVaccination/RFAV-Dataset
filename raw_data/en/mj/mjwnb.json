GENERAL TIPS FOR BODY DETOXIFICATION - Drink plenty of water (at least 8 glasses/day) - Add half a lemon to a warm glass of water with a pinch of cayenne pepper and \u00bd tsp of olive oil and enjoy it first thing in the morning - Eat your salads and greens - they provide you with lots and lots of live enzymes and minerals and also help detoxify heavy metals from the body - If you haven't eaten fruit and vegetables on a regular basis, start to eat lots of fruit; your body will detoxify itself first. Even if you do not change your use of stimulants (coffee, sugar and nicotine) - Steam bath to remove heavy metals - Using 1/2 cup of baking soda or 1/2 cup of sea salt. Soak for 15 - 20 minutes and then scrub the skin gently with soap on a loofah / face towel. Within a few minutes the water will turn murky and \"dirty\" due to heavy metals coming out of the skin, including aluminum and mercury. Do this once a week during detox and once a month for maintenance - Exercise regularly, for at least 20 minutes - Partner up with a friend or family member if motivation is a problem. Go for a brisk walk or jog, or try something different like a spinning class or Yoga! * DISCLAIMER: The information on this article is the property of Dr. Sushma Shah, Naturopathic Doctor, and is not intended to treat, diagnose or cure any diseases or promote any services or products mentioned on the website.
