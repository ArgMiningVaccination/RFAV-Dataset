NDF Plus\u00ae/NDF\u00ae or both More than 75% of parents are concerned about the side effects of vaccinations, according to a survey released by the Center for Disease Control in 2011. The choice of how and whether to vaccinate is a very personal one. It can be a daunting experience wading through the difficult options. If you do decide to vaccinate, you want the vaccine to be as effective as possible with the least amount of side effects. ORGANS TO SUPPORT WHEN GETTING IMMUNIZATIONS 1. Support the adrenal system to keep the body's natural stress responder strong. Getting shots is emotional and physically stressful. 2. It's important for our biggest filtration system, the liver, to be working well. The liver is responsible for cleaning the blood and has pathways for removing toxins. This allows vaccines and their byproducts to have the least negative impact. 3. The gastrointestinal system goes into overdrive, fighting invaders that have entered the body. Supporting the microbiome in the gastrointestinal tract keeps immunity strong . 4. Vaccines contain toxins which pollute the body and interfere with cellular and mitochondrial function. Removing toxins is a crucial component for the body's ability to repair and regenerate. Here are recommendations on how to use BIORAY Professional\u00ae, BIORAY Daily\u00ae or BIORAY Kids\u00ae product lines when getting immunized. Choose one line or mix them together for optimal support. Length of time: Take for a minimum of 5 days prior to vaccinations and continue for 3 weeks following each inoculation.

Medications like antibiotics have a negative impact in the body. Antibiotics destroy friendly and beneficial microbiology in the gastrointestinal tract which leaves us susceptible to bad bugs or invaders. Toxic byproducts of antibiotics stress the liver, kidneys, adrenals, GI tract and bowels. ORGANS TO SUPPORT WHILE USING ANTIBIOTICS 1. During antibiotic use, it's important to support the body's ability to filter toxins by nourishing the liver as well as supporting the adrenals which is the organ system that handles stress. Results are feeling less irritable and better sleep. 2. Many people experience gut issues or loose stools from antibiotics. Support healthy intestines with beneficial yeast and probiotic lysate during antibiotic use. 3. After antibiotic use, continue liver, adrenal support and detoxification . It's important to keep residue left behind from medication moving down and out of the body. 4. Reestablish beneficial flora in the gastrointestinal tract with your choice of live probiotics.
