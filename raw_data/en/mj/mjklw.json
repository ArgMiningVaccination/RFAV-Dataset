Contrary to popular belief, chakras are not the newest fad in the yoga world, but rather an ancient system for understanding your body's energy. The chakras are located in the central channel of the energetic spine, sometimes referred to as the sushumna. This major route of energy flow (nadi) starts at the base of the spine and runs up to the crown of the head. What exactly are each of the [chakra meanings](https://chopra.com/articles/what-is-a-chakra), where are the chakras located and how would you know if you were stuck? Signs of Blocked Energy at Each Chakra 1st Chakra: Being depleted of first chakra energy feels like a survival crisis. You can't get grounded because you are stuck in your head. By contrast, if you have too much energy at the root, you can become greedy or excessive in behaviors. These are misguided attempts to get grounded. 2nd Chakra: When someone is stuck in their sacral chakra, they struggle with being ruled by their emotions or the opposite of this, which is feeling numb or out of touch. There's also a correlation to sexual desire (or the lack thereof) at this level.

When there's a blockage at this energy level, anger, jealousy, grief, or self-hatred can be more prominent. 5th Chakra: This chakra is the source of speaking your most authentic truth. When energy is blocked or low here, fear of not being accepted or of being judged becomes a problem. You might also feel out of touch with your opinions and desires and have challenge in making choices. 6th Chakra: The word Ajna means \"beyond wisdom,\" and when this chakra is open, you experience expanded imagination, clairvoyance, and intuition. When there is a blockage at this level, there can be a tendency to be over-involved in fantasy or imagination.
