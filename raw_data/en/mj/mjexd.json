Und oubtedly, pharmaceu- ticals can contribute substantially to the treatment of various severe diseases such as asthma or diabetes and, of course, scientific progress regardin g the development of new drugs should be further fost ered. Pharmaceuticals can also play a fundamental role in the prevention of diseases (e.g. vaccines for diseases such as measles, cervical cancer, etc.) which, from a pub lic health view, may be their mo st important and effi- cient task. Some of the greatest achievements in public health are based on preventive measures with vaccines, for instance the eradication of smallpo x [1] or the elimination of poliomyelitis from most countries, including the whole World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [2,3]. The importance of pharmaceutical p roducts in health care is further reflected by the essential medicines list that is updated every 2 years by the WHO and is compiled for adul ts and children separately as w ell [4]. Last but not least, for several life-threatening diseases such as the acquir e d i m m u n e d e f i c i e n c y syndrome, treatment with pharmace uticals is at present the only medical option. The economic importance of pharmaceuticals in Europe is illust rated by the num- ber of people employed in the pharmaceutical industry, which wa s estimated at about 690,000 (figure for the European Union (EU), Switzerland, and T urkey) for 2012 [5], and also by the turnover in pharmaceutical products, which amounted to roughly 190 bil- lion euros in 2013 for the EU [6]. Depending on the source, six to nine European com- panies rank among the world's 15 largest pharmaceutical compani es [7-9]. In 2012, expenditures on pharmaceutical products accounted for about 1.5 % of the gross do- m e s t i c p r o d u c t ( G D P ) o f t h e E u r o p e a n U n i o n , c o m p a r e d w i t h a b o u t 8 . 7 % o f G D P f o r total expenditure on health [10]. Pharmaceuticals are also a re levant item for health insurance companies as, e.g., expenditure on drugs accounts for approximately 16% of the statutory health insurance c ompanies' expenditure in German y [6]. Evidently, the population seeking medical health by means of p harmaceutical products is, probably without be ing conscious of it, confronted with strong (and op- posed) economic interests. As in other branches of public servi ce, the public health care sector also has to deal with increasingly limited financial res ources. Therefore, in Ger- many and many other European countries, the health sector (and the pharmaceutical sector as a part of it as well) experienced major changes at th e turn of the new millen- nium, such as the deregulation of the pharmacy market, the libe ralization of drug sales, or cuts and price reductions regarding the reimbursement of pre scribed drugs [11-17]. For instance, freely available drugs (over-the-counter drugs), which account for a sub- 9 stantial part of all drugs utiliz ed by adults and children [10, 18], were gradually removed from the list of reimbursable drugs and, hence, have to be paid for out-of-pocket by the consumers or patients themselves [19,20]. This implies that, as a consequence, a higher financial burden is imposed on every consumer/patient. Furtherm ore, the administra- tions have partly moved the responsibility for proper and safe drug use from physicians to those who use self-medicated drugs, highlighting the growing importance of phar- maceutical advice in community pharmacies. By quantity of drug packages used in Eu- rope, prescribed drugs and self-medicated drugs are roughly at the same level, al- though the turnover in self-medicated drugs may account for abo ut 15% of total drug sales in the European Union [21]. The market in self-medication with over-the-counter drugs that are not covered by statutory health insurance compan ies was estimated at 27 billion euros for the European Union in 2011 [21] and can no rmally be promoted (with some restrictions) by the pharmaceutical companies with a dvertising materials [22,23]. In this context, inequa lities with regard to health li teracy, accessibility to drugs, and affordability of drugs are important aspects that have to b e considered carefully by the decision makers within the health sector to ensure that the phenomena of under- or oversupply of drugs in various population strata are avoided or at least minimized. Aims and objectives The objective of this dissertation is to analyse the patterns o f paediatric drug use with regard to the prevalence of use and the socioeconomic predictor s of drug utilization. Children represent the future of every society. Like elderly or chronically ill people, children belong to a particularly vulnerable group in the popul ation, as they normally do not take their own decisions on (self-) medication but have to rely on the corre ct decisions taken for them by other involved persons. This, of co urse, may gradually change during the transition fr om childhood to adolescence. I n a f i r s t s t e p ( chapter 2 ) , a s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f t h e u s e o f c o m p l e m e n t a r y a n d alternative medicine (CAM) among children in Europe was perform ed in comparison with paediatric CAM utilization outside Europe. The authors ant icipated that CAM use would be significantly higher in children with chronic conditio ns such as cancer, diabe- tes, or allergies. Therefore, st udies analysing CAM use exclusi vely among children with chronic conditions (which were the majority of available studie s on paediatric CAM use) w e r e e x c l u d e d f r o m t h e r e v i e w t o e s t i m a t e C A M u s e a m o n g t h e g e n eral paediatric population in European and non-European countries. Chapter 3 analyses CAM use among chronically ill adolescents and is an a ddendum to the systematic review on CAM use presented in chapter 2 . The results imply that, compared with the general adolescent population, the prevalence of CAM use is higher among adolescents with chronic conditions. Thus, the exclusion o f s t u d i e s c o n d u c t e d 10 exclusively among children/adoles cents suffering from any kind of chronic condition f r o m t h e s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w p r e s e n t e d i n chapter 2 may have yielded more unbiased estimates for CAM use among the general paediatric population i n Europe. Chapter 4 presents an updated view on paediatric CAM use based on data f rom a large German birth cohort (GINIp lus). Furthermore, the results on CAM use among 15- year-old adolescents were compar ed with the results for 10-year -old children from the 10-year follow-up of the same birth cohort to detect trends in CAM use. Chapter 5 focuses on the utilization of pharmaceutical products among 15 -year-old adolescents from the German GINIplus birth cohort. The research primarily addressed the comparison of self-medicated drugs with prescription drugs and investigated the differences regarding prevalence and the socioeconomic predicto rs of use. A comprehensive longitudinal analysis of drug use based on dat a for 10-year-old children and 15-year-old adolescen ts from the German GINIplus a nd LISAplus birth cohorts was performed in chapter 6 . Among other things, chapter 6 also analysed the association of drug use in adole scence with previous drug use d uring childhood. The research question treated in chapter 7 is whether the prices of over-the- counter drugs used by adolescents are associated with socioecon omic factors such as parental educational background or parental income. The final chapter 8 is devoted to the current issue of emergency contraceptives. The European Medicines Agency (E MA) recommended sw itching ulipr istal acetate to non-prescription status throughout the European Union in Novemb er 2014. This drug class is used by girls mainly dur ing adolescence and young adul thood [24]. The use of emergency contraceptives, which is known to be predicted by soc ioeconomic variables [24], may have been influenced by the switch to non-prescriptio n status. 11 The German GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts The GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts contributed data for se veral parts of the pres- ent thesis (Figure 1). Therefore, further information not given in the following chapters 2-7 is briefly presen ted at this point. Figure 1. Contribution of the GINIplus and LISAplus birth coho rts to chapters 2-7 Two German birth cohorts GINI plus LISA plus The association of prices for ov er-the-counter drugs with socio economic factors was investigated for a cohort of 4,6 77 adolescents from the GINIplu s and LISAplus studies. Drug use was compared longitudinally between 10-year-old childr en and 15-year-old adolescents from the partici in the 15-year follow-up; n=3,1 94 in both samples). The use of self-medication drugs and prescribed drugs among ado lescents in Ger- many was analysed based on data from the 15-year follow-up of t he GINIplus study (n=3,013).

Utilization of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was analysed among chronically ill adolescents from the GINIplus (n=3,013) and LIS Aplus (n=1,664) studies; total sample 15-year from the 10-year follow-up of the GINIplus and LISAplus studies (n=3,642) were included in the systematic r e v i e w o n p a e d i a t r i c u s e o f c o m plementary and alternative medicine (CAM ) in Euro pean and non-Euro pean countries. 2 3 7 6 5 4 12 The GINIplus study (German Infant study on the influence of Nut rition Intervention plus environmental and genetic influences on allergy development) an d LISAplus study (In- fluence of lifestyle factors on the immune system and allergies in East and West Ger- many plus the influence of traffic emissions and genetics) are two ongoing German birth cohorts [25-27]. At baseline, exactly 5,991 healthy full- term newborns were re- cruited for the GINIplus study between September 1995 and June 1998 from obstetric clinics in Munich and Wesel. The LISAplus study started with 3, 097 healthy full-term newborns who were enrolled between November 1997 and January 19 99 from obstet- ric clinics in Munich, Leipzig, Bad Honnef, and Wesel (Figure 2 ). For three children, the consent to participate already given was withdrawn by their par ents or legal guardians at a later stage in the study. Figure 2. Regional distribution of the four study areas over G ermany Both cohorts participated in the Enrieco project (Environmental Health Risks in Euro- pean Birth Cohorts), which was conducted within the European Un ion's 7th Framework Programme [28,29] and includes birth cohorts from 17 European c ountries. 13 Since the start of both cohorts, various research questions hav e been addressed at several stages of the cohorts. P aediatric drug utilization was assessed at the children's age of 10 years and 15 years. The data collection for the 15-ye ar follow-up, upon which a substantial part of the present thesis is based, started in J anuary 2011 and was com- pleted in October 2014 (Figure 3). For the assessment of drug u tilization at the age of 15 years, an identical questionnaire was used for the GINIplus and LISAplus studies (Appendix Figure S1; original German version used for the 15-ye ar follow-up of the GINIplus study), based on an a lmost similar questionnaire that had already been used at the 10-year follow-up in both studies. The assessment proces s over time is displayed for the 15-year follow-up in Figure 3. The amount and type of d rugs used may depend, among other things, on the season. Thus, an almost even distrib ution of the assessment over winter, spring, summer, and autumn would be desirable to g et a seasonally inde- pendent view of paediatric drug utilization. Figure 4 shows tha t spring (April-June) and summer (July-September) are slightly overrepresented at the 15- year follow-up in the GINIplus and LISAplus cohorts. Figure 3. Time schedule of the 15-year follow-up of the GINIpl us and LISAplus studies De facto, the 4-week prevalence of drug use (seasonal mean: 41. 1%) among adoles- cents from both cohorts together was highest in spring (43.6%) and lowest in summer (37.6%). For the 10-year follow-up, most (54%) of the questionn aires were collected in autumn (October-December), whereas 46% were collected in almost equal parts dur- ing spring, summer, and winter. 14 Figure 4. Distribution of data collection over the year (GINIp lus and LISAplus together) The mean age of the participating adolescents was 15.1 years, r a n gi n g b e t w e e n 1 4 . 2 years and 16.8 years (Figure 5).

For instance, the adolescents from the GINIplus an d LISAplus cohorts had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 20.8 kg/m2 ( F i g u r e 6 ) , w h i c h w a s l o w e r c o m p a r e d with the findings for 15-year-old boys (21.7 kg/m2) and girls (22.0 kg/m2) from a repre- sentative German study [30]. The proportion of adolescents that reported a physician-diagno sed chronic condi- tion during the preceding 12 mon ths was 13.7%.

Figure 6.

Participants from the highe r educational and income 16 levels were more likely to remain in the cohorts. The variation in cohort composition over time is displayed in Table 1. However, there was no signif icant difference (p=0. 56 28 ) wit h regard t o t h e propor tion o f male an d fe male par ticipants at baseline and at the 15-year follow-up. Table 1.

A s a b o u t 2 9 % o f the German population lives in the southern federal states Bava ria and Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg, 16% in the new federal states in eastern Germany, and 55% in the northern or western regions, the south of Germany was overrepre sented, whereas east Germany was underrepresented in the study. Some 41% of the participants resided in comparatively rural ar eas (Bad Honnef and Wesel), whereas 59% lived in an u rban environment (Leipzig and Munich). In compari- son with the study sample, only about 22% of the German populat ion [33] lives in an urban environment (cities>100,000 inhabitants). Maternal and paternal educational background O n a v e r a g e i n G e r m a n y , 2 4 . 8 % ( 3 0 . 7 % ) o f w o m e n ( m e n ) a g e d 3 5 - 4 5 years, an age group comparable to the participating mothers in the GINIplus/L ISAplus cohorts at the 15-year follow-up time point, had a low educational background ( < 1 0 s c h o o l y e a r s ) . Exactly 40.5% (33.2%) had a middle educational level, whereas 3 4.5% (36.2%) belonged to the highest educational level [33]. In comparison with the G erman mean, the parents of the participating adolescents from the GINIplus and LISAplus s t u d i e s a c h i e v e d a higher educational status. Household income status On average, the households of the participants had an equivalen t income of \u20ac1,763 at their disposal (median: \u20ac1,563). The median equivalent income ( MEI) in Germany for 2012 was reported to be \u20ac1,643. This figure is not directly com parable with the figure for the households in the GINIplus/LISAplus cohorts, as it incl udes both households with children and also single households. However, the share of the population af- fected by poverty as reported by the German federal statistical o f f i c e , a m o u n t e d t o 20.3% in 2013 [34], in comparison with 17% of the participating families from the GINI- plus and LISAplus studies that were poor (60% or less of the ME I) following the defini- t i o n o f p o v e r t y [ 3 5 ] f r o m t h e O r g a n i s a t i o n f o r E c o n o m i c C o - o p e r ation and Develop- ment (OECD). Therefore, the higher income classes may be slight ly overrepresented in the GINIplus/LISAplus cohorts. 18 Migration background The impact of migration background, another important socioecon omic variable, on drug use among adolescents from the GINIplus/LISAplus birth coh orts was not analysed for several reasons. In the LISAplus study, children of non-Ger man parents or with par- ents born outside Germany were excluded. In the GINIplus study, only participants with sufficient German language skills were recruited. Migration bac kground was not di- rectly available for the 15-yea r follow-up of the GINIplus coho rt. Instead, nationality of mothers and fathers was assessed for the baseline survey only. Since then, 15 years have passed, and parental nationality may have changed for some participants. More- over, the proportion of parents with German nationality is very h i g h ( f o r t h e 3 , 0 1 3 children from the 15-year follow-up cohort, about 95% of mother s and 93% of fathers reported German nationality at baseline), and some of the parti cipants who reported German nationality may nevertheless have a migration background , but this infor- mation is not available. Overall, only about 5.6% of the recrui ted newborns at baseline had a non-German mother (6.8% had a non-German father), and thi s share fell further at the 15-year follow-up of the GINIplus/LISAplus studies, e.g. only 3.1% of the adoles- cents had a non-German mother (4.1% had a non-German father). C ompared with Germany, where about 9.5% of the population [33] has non-German nationality, for- eign children are underrepresented in the GINIplus/LISAplus coh orts. In sum, the GINIplus and LISAplus cohorts are population-based cohorts that, however, do not exactly reflect the mean adolescent population in German y e.g. with regard to parental educational level or migration background. Thus, the r esults can be projected to the general German paediatric population to a limited extent only. 19 References 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Wolfe nstetter, Christina M. Teuner. Patterns of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in children: a system- atic review. Eur J Pediatr 2014;173:1413-1428. doi:10.1007/s00431-014-2300-z The final publication is ava ilable at link.springer.com 26 Abstract Utilization of Complementary and A lternative Medicine (CAM) amo ng chil- dren/adolescents is popular. This review summarizes the interna tional findings for prevalence and predictors of CAM use among children/adolescents . We therefore sys- tematically searched four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, P s y c I N F O , A M E D ; last update in 07/2013) and reference lists of existing reviews and all included studies. Publications without language restriction reporting patterns of CAM utilization among children/adolescents without chronic conditions were selected f or inclusion. The preva- lence rates for overall CAM use, homeopathy, and herbal drug us e were extracted with a focus on country and recall period (lifetime, 1 year, current use). As predictors, we extracted socioeconomic factors, child's age, and gender. The database search and citation tracking yielded 58 eligible s tudies from 19 countries. There was strong variation regar d i n g s t u d y q u a l i t y . P r e v a l e n c e rates for overall CAM use ranged from 10.9-87.6% for lifetime use and from 8-48.5% fo r current use. The r e s p e c t i v e p e r c e n t a g e s f o r h o m e o p a t h y ( h i g h e s t i n G e r m a n y , U n i t ed Kingdom, and Canada) ranged from 0.8-39% (lif etime) and from 1-14.3% (curren t). Herbal drug use (highest in Germany, Turkey, and Brazil) was reported for 0.8-8 5.5% (lifetime) and 2.2-8.9% (current) of the children/adolescents. Studies provide d a relatively uniform picture of the predictors of overall CAM use (higher parental i ncome and education, older children), but only a few studies analyzed predictors for single CAM modalities. Conclusion : CAM use is widespread among ch ildren/adolescents. Prevalence rates vary widely regarding CAM modality, country, and reported recall per iod. Key words Complementary therapies Homeo pathy Phytotherapy Child Drug utilization Socioeconomic factors 27 Introduction Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) covers a broad var iety of therapy approaches that are usually not part of conventional medicine. According to the PubMed hits (searching with \"Complementary Th erapies\"[Mesh]), research activities regarding CA M have grown markedly in the pa st decades and within only about 20 years increased fr om 2,260 publications in 1991 t o 9,441 articles in 2011. This may reflect an increased scientific interest in this field , but also a growing popular- ity of CAM among the general population making CAM use an impor tant public health topic. Due to the considerable number of publications, there is now a substantial knowledge of CAM utilization pa tterns in adults. Two recently p ublished reviews sum- marize the results of the respective studies [15,23]. Data on t he CAM utilization of chil- dren are still limited, even thoug h the knowledge gap has been reduced in recent years. A review published in 1999 [16] c ould only incl ude 10 studies ( 7 w e r e c o n d u c t e d i n children with chronic conditions), because no other data were a vailable at that time. Another review [7] assessed CAM us e exclusively in pediatric ca ncer patients. A recently published narrative review summarized survey data and experts' extrapolations on pediatric CAM use in 20 European countries [71], while a scopin g review from 2013 i n v e s t i g a t e d t h e d e p t h a n d b r e a d t h o f p e d i a t r i c C A M u s e a n d i d e ntified knowledge gaps regarding the epidemiology of CAM use in children [59]. There is, however, a sizeable difference in the findings for t he patterns of CAM use, which in part may result from th e different methodology used, b ut makes comparison of the figures quite difficult. In view of a responsible use of CAM, it is of particular in- terest to get a clearer picture of CAM utilization in children as they usually do not choose a medical therapy on their own. This systematic review h as three main aims: Firstly, to present an updated overview of the reported preval ence of CAM utiliza- tion in children and adolescents, with a focus on homeopathic a nd herbal remedies (for practical reasons we use the ter m \"prevalence\" as a synonym for \"rate\"). Secondly, to summarize the findings with respect to the predic ting factors for CAM utilization, with a focus on child 's gender, child 's age, and s ocioeconomic indicators such as parental (or caregiv ers') education and income. Thirdly, to compare the utiliz ation patterns across both Europ ean and non- European countries. 28 Methods Database search The screening for relevant literature was performed using four databases. A combina- tion of Mesh-terms (exploded) and free text terms were used to search PubMed (Table 1). Three further databases (Embase, AMED, PsycINFO) wer e searched with an almost identical set of free text terms (Table 1), using the se arch interface of the Ger- man Institute of Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI). Initially, no limit was set regarding the language of publication. The last search upda t e w a s p e r f o r m e d o n 1 July 2013. Table 1.

Mesh , medical subject heading * and ? standing for truncated terms In addition, all reference lists of relevant articles and exist ing reviews were checked for further relevant literature. Full-text copies of all the identi fied publications were ob- tained. Data extraction from one Argentinian publication was su pported by a native Spanish speaker. Studies for this review were eligible if they reported figures for children's/adoles- cents' CAM use in the general population (prevalence of use and preferably at least one 29 of the predicting variables under research). Studies including adults were only eligible if stratified figures for children/ adolescents were available. Stu dies on children with chronic diseases or disorders su ch as cancer, asthma, etc. were excluded because of possible bias towards higher prevalence rates. Studies comparin g chronically ill children with healthy children were excluded as well, whereas surveys as sessing general drug utilization in children/adolescents were included, if figures f or CAM utilization were extractable. Studies focusing on single CAM modalities other th an homeopathy or herbal drugs were also excluded. Data extraction and reporting of findings The result lists from the databas e searches were screened by on e reviewer for publica- tions to be excluded by title, abstract, or language. The remai ning publications were fully screened to evalu ate possible eligibility. Prevalence rates (calculated al ways as a percentage of the who le study cohort) and response rates were extracted directly from the text and, if po ssible, recalculated using given values for approached persons, participants, and CAM user s. For consistency, all prevalence and response rate values were rounded to one decimal place; it should be emphasized that the prevalence figures are estimates and that a respective precision is not given for all studies ( e.g., small-scaled ones). In some cases, the prevalence figures had to be extracted from histograms because no percentages or numbers of CAM users were available in the te xt. Publications with unclear data were read by all authors and finally discussed to eliminate ambiguity of interpretation. Where information was missing, we tried to contact the corresp onding authors. If clarification was not possible for the recall period, prevalenc e was interpreted as life- time use to present rather conservative estimates for utilizati on. Unclear information regarding prevalence for single CAM modalities was not consider ed if clarification was not possible. In a few cases, only CAM provider consultation (homeopath, her balist) was re- ported or it was unclear whether \"pharmacological\" treatment wi th homeopathic and herbal remedies was included. In these cases, we interpreted po sitive reporting as homeopathic or herbal drug use, respectively. We hypothesized t hat most consulta- tions with a homeopath will result in homeopathic drug use and that most of the per- sons visiting a herbalist will subs equently use herbal drugs. 30 Findings for predictors of CAM use were excluded if association s were only reported in a descriptive manner without test ing statistical significance, e.g., by bivariate Chi2-test or multivariate logistic regre ssion. Finally, the publications were sorted by country and publication date to take into account country- and time-specifi c differences in CAM use. To estimate overall prevalence rates for different recall peri ods (up to 1 month, 1 year, lifetime) grouped by continent (i.e., Europe versus North America), meta-analysis was performed for homeopathy and herbal drugs using the package 'meta' in the statis- tical software 'R'. Reported probabilities were combined via th e random effects inverse variance method, where the logit of probabilities was assumed t o follow a normal dis- tribution. Quality assessment For assessing the quality of the included studies, we used an e xisting quality- assessment tool [7] and modified it for our purpose. We checked whether the following quality criteria had been f ulfilled by the studies: 1. Attempts to achieve a representative sample for the populat ion of focus, e.g., by population-based surveys or inv olving more than one setting 2. Setting, as an indicator for potentially higher proportions of chronically ill partici- pants (e.g., emergency departmen ts or hospitalized patients) 3. Validation of the selected assessment tool (e.g., piloted q uestionnaire, structured interview, or previous use of study materials) 4. Analysis of non-responders a nd/or inter-rater reliability 5. CAM defined to participants (e.g., by presenting a list of specific CAM modalities) or an expert investigator identifie d the responses as CAM if all a dministered drugs/therapies were assessed by the study 6. CAM defined in the article (e.g., by presenting a list of t he assessed CAM modalities or reporting figures for specific CAM modalities) 7. Prevalence and/or predictors of specific CAM modalities rep orted The quality assessment is available as an appendix to this revi ew (see appendix Table S1). Further relevant quality aspects such as sample size or ch ild 's age are integra ted into Table 2. 31 Results Selected studies The search of the four databases yielded a total of 8,540 resul ts. A total of 8,301 publi- cations could be excluded by title or abstract as they evidentl y did not supply infor- m a t i o n a b o u t t h e p r e v a l e n c e o r p r e d i ct o r s o f C A M u s e i n ch i l d r e n/adolescents. After removing duplicates and adding 85 articles from citation tracki ng, 227 articles were obtained which at first view reported patterns of CAM use in ch ildren/adolescents or needed further screening for possible eligibility. Of these, 12 studies were excluded because the samples consist ed of adults and no stratified data for children/adol escents were available. A furt her 118 studies were re- moved because they had been conducted with mainly small samples (46 studies with 100 participants) of chronica lly ill children, e.g., cancer (3 8 studies), asthma (12 stud- ies) or diabetes (7 studies). Ei ghteen studies assessed only no n-focused CAM modalities (14 only vitamins/minerals, 3 only traditional Chinese medicine , 1 only nutritional sup- plements). In three studies, the authors investigated CAM use f or one specific indica- tion or purpose only. The comple te flow diagram of the selectio n process is shown in Figure 1. Finally, 58 studies were consider ed eligible for this review (T able 2). This included six studies [1,20,43,52,63,66] which were available only as abstrac ts or short reports, but supplied information on utilization patterns for countries wher e no or only few other studies had been conducted so far. Studies of the following countries are included in this review : Denmark (DEN), Fin- land (FIN), Germany (GER), Ireland (IRE), Israel (ISR), Italy ( ITA), Netherlands (NL), Nor- way (NOR), Switzerland (SWI), Turkey (TUR), United Kingdom (UK) , Canada (CAN), United States (USA), Australia (AUS), New Zealand (NZ), Argenti na (ARG), Brazil (BRA), South Korea (SKO), and Taiwan (TAI). The size of the included studies varied from 92 [9] to 20,219 [43] participants. Twenty-one of the studies had been conducted with more than 1,0 00 participants [4,6,13,14,27,28,31,34,37,43,50,55,57,58,60,65,67-70,72]. Most of the studies investi- gated CAM use in children, six assessed CAM use in samples comp osed only of adoles- cents (12-19 years) [8,21,58,64,65,69]. Exactly 43% of the stud ies had been conducted in 11 European States, including Turkey and Israel, 41% in Nort h A m e r i c a , a n d 7 % i n Australia/New Zealand. Only five studies reported CAM use in So uth America or Asia. We found no eligible studies from Eastern Europe (except Turkey ) or some of the bigger Western European countries such as France or Spain. 32 Figure 1.

Quality assessment The quality of methodology and reporting varies widely, from ve ry small-scaled and simple surveys to large and well performed studies. The results of the quality assess- ment are displayed in the appendix Table S1. Eleven studies were read and analyzed by at least two reviewer s independently as interpretation of data was ambiguous. The accordance between th e reviewers' inter- pretations was 86%. Inconsistenci es were resolved by discussion . Additionally, we tried to contact 18 authors for clarification. Eight responded and su pplied clarifying infor- mation [13,22,24,26,41,50,51,63]. Prevalence Table 3 shows the reported prevalence rates for all CAM, homeop athy, and herbal drugs, sorted by country, publication date, and recall periods (only studies with more than 100 participants considered). Most studies reported lifeti me or 1-year prevalence, and six [9,14,18,27,31,55] chose only shorter recall periods. F or practical reasons, stud- ies with a recall period of 0.5 years, 1.5 years, and 3 years w ere allocated to the col- u m n s f o r t h e 1 - y e a r p r e v a l e n c e . W e d e f i n e d c u r r e n t u s e ( = p o i n t prevalence) as use within the last month. One study [10] compared the results of two included studies [1 1,36] and therefore used the same sets of data. In this comparison article, some pr evalence rates for ho- meopathy and herbal drug use were reported that were missing in the original publica- tions. This additional information was considered in the respec tive lines of Table 3. Overall, CAM use differs enorm ously across the included studie s (e.g., lifetime use was reported between 10.9 and 87.6%). For homeopathy, the preva lence rates (recall period) range between 0.8-39% (lifetime), 1.2-30% (1 year), and 1-14.3% (current use) across all studies. The respectiv e ranges for herbal drugs are 0.8-85.5% (lifetime), 2.4-58.6% (1 year), and 2.2-8.9% (current use). As expected, lo nger recall periods yielded (in part noticeably) higher prevalence rates. Within Europe, the highest prevalence rates for homeopathy and herbal drug use reported were 27.7% (1 year) and 85.5% (lifetime), respectively from two German stud- ies [30,70]. Herbal drug use am ong children was also very popul ar in Turkey (58.6% for 1-year prevalence) [2]. 37 Table 3.

In South America, homeopathy was given to 8.8% of the children in Argentina (life- time use) [19] and 3.5% of the pediatric population in Brazil ( lifetime use) [24]. No use of homeopathy was reported in the studies from Turkey and South Korea [2,34,45]. Meta-analysis (studies grouped by continent; values for preval ence rates given with two decimal places as estimated by the software 'R') yielded an overall 1-year preva- lence for homeopathy of 8.98% (Europe) and 3.08% (North America ) . T h e r e s p e c t i v e figures for herbal drug use are 13.53% (Europe) and 12.05% (Nor th America). Figures 2 and 3 show the forest plots for the calculated 1-year prevalenc e rates (P) with their 95% confidence intervals. One study reported different prevalen ce rates due to several follow-ups [60]. In this case, we used the value in the middle of the reported range of 39 prevalence rates for meta-analysis (6.25%) based on the smalles t sample size (N=7,205). Further forest plots of the respective prevalence ra tes for lifetime and cur- rent use are available as an appendix to this review.

Small discrepancies in prevalence rates are due to rounding errors. Predictors Regarding predictors of CAM use, we limited this review to the following variables: parental education, parental income, parental or child's ethnic ity/country of birth, geographic region inside the country, parental CAM use, child's age, and gender. Among the 58 included studies, 43 tested the association of CA M use with at least one of the aforementioned variables. The majority reported the predictors for overall CAM use. Only four studies, of those assessing various CAM moda lities, analyzed pre- dictors for homeopathy or herbal drug use as well [6,31,38,65], although most studies did also report prevalence rates for those CAM modalities. The predictors are shown in Table 4 (we were unable to summarize the magnitude of the predi cting effects because 41 of variable methodologies such a s different coding of categoric al variables, different statistical tests, etc.). In a ll listed studies, the level for significance was at least P<0.05. Predictors for overall CAM use Thirty-six studies analyzed predictors for overall CAM use (se e Table 4, category \"all CAM\"). Education of either paren t was tested in 18 studies (10 significant [2,4,6, 28,34,39,40,45,48,55]), maternal in 6 studies (4 significant [1 1,57,62,72]), and paternal in 3 (3 significant [11,62,72]). All significant results showed that higher parental educa- tion is associated with hi gher CAM use in children. Parental/maternal income was te sted in 20 studies. Only seven studies [4,11,26,28, 34,41,48] indicated that higher income was associated with high er CAM use, while one s t u d y f o u n d h i g h e r C A M u s e i n t h e f i n a n c i a l l y w e a k e s t g r o u p [ 6 5 ] (the results of all other studies were not significant). Parental CAM use was the s trongest predictor for CAM use in children (22 tests, 21 of them significant [2,4,6,9, 22,29,34,38,44-46,48,50, 51,54,55,57,62,64,65,68]). Out of 27 studies analyzing gender, only 3 showed a signifi- cant result, all 3 suggesting, that female children/adolescents u s e m o r e C A M [58,65,68]. The classification of the age groups was inhomogeneous across the included stud- ies. However, with regard to age, 12 studies found the older ag e groups of the respec- tive sample to use more CAM [4,6,8,36,38,39,44,50,51,57,68,72]. Only in one study was younger age [40] a posit ive predicting factor. With respect to ethnicity, five out of six significant results from the North American studies [4,8,28,38,68] suggested that overall CAM use was highe st in white chil- dren/adolescents (only in one st udy [65] was the highest overal l CAM use reported for black adolescents). In the European and Australian studies, whi ch mainly assessed pa- rental/child's country of birth instead of ethnicity (one study assessed ethnicity [48], one parental nationality [30]), all significant results [36,72] showed that those children without migrant background use more CAM. Two American studies a nalyzed both eth- nicity and country of birth [35,50], and one found higher CAM u se in children with mi- grant background [50]. The association of CAM use with the geographic region was only tested in German and American studies. Homeopathic drug use Predictors for homeopathic drug use were analyzed in four studi es [14,31,67,70]. High- er parental education and income, younger age, and female gende r were positive pre- dictors for homeopathic drug use (age was tested only in one st udy [14], and gender 42 was tested in two studies [14,31] with one showing no significa n t r e s u l t s [ 1 4 ] ) . T h e association with parental own us e of homeopathy was not tested in any of the studies. Herbal drug use Eight studies which reported predicting factors for herbal drug use were included in the review [6,21,30,31,35,38,65,69]. Parental education was positiv ely associated with herbal drug use in children. One out of three tests for income was not significant [31], while two showed a positive association [30,38]. The results fo r age indicate that older children take more herbal drugs. All but one tests for gender-s pecific differences were not significant. Additional results Eighteen studies provide information on the gender of responden ts [1,2,9,11,26,29- 32,34,36-38,44,45,60,63,72], and all stated that predominantly mothers had been interviewed or had completed the questionnaires. Reasons for CA M use such as worry- ing about side effects of conventional medicine were reported b y 21 studies [2,8,9,19- 22,24,29,30,35,39,46,51,52,54,57,62,63,66,72] and costs were as sessed by only 10 studies [8,11,30,31,40,41,54,57,66,68]. In 25 publications, the authors provided some information on the intensity of CAM use and whether CAM was use d complementarily t o c o n v e n t i o n a l t h e r a p i e s o r u s e d a s a s u b s t i t u t e f o r i t [ 8 , 9 , 1 1,14,21,22,26,28,30, 31,35,36,41,46,48,50,53,55,60-64,66,69]. Twenty-seven studies a ssessed medical disorders CAM was administered for [1,2,6,8,13,24,30-32,34-36,4 1,43-46,48,52,53,56, 57,60,63,66,70,72]. Discussion Our findings imply that in those countries where CAM use in chi ldren has been investi- gated by epidemiological studies , utilization of some form of C AM is widespread among children and adolescents. Previous reviews on patterns of pedia tric CAM utilization included in part or exclusively st udies with samples of chronic ally ill children [7,16,71], b u t c o m p a r e d t o h e a l t h y c h i l d r e n , C A M u s e m a y b e h i g h e r i n c h i l dren with chronic conditions. A study analyzing Ame rican insurance claims data of 187,323 children showed significantly higher prevalence rates for (provider-base d) CAM use in children with chronic disorders such as cancer or low back pain [5].

In accordance with our results, a recently published review confir med the lack of pub- lished data from Eastern Europe [71]. Utilization of specific CAM modalities seems to be very varied across different countries. Homeopathy use in children is very common in Germany , UK, or the Nether- lands, but was not reported from e.g., Turkey or South Korea [2 ,34,45]. According to a comparative study [49], there is an indication that the use of homeopathy in children may also be unpopular in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Russia, and Spain, as no homeopathics were found among the drugs/remedies prescribed by pediatricians or physicians (no data was supplied for self-medication or other CAM modalities; for France, the propor- tion of homeopathics in all administered drugs was reported to be 1.7%). Possible rea- sons for this variability may be differences in acceptance, lim ited availability of homeo- pathic remedies, or le gal aspects [34,71]. In countries such as Brazil or Turkey, herbal remedies like te as evidently play an important role in the treatment of ill children. It may be hypo thesized that good access to herbal remedies (and probably poor access to conventional tr eatments for a part of the population) and lower or no costs for this kind of treatmen t (e.g., when picked in the own garden or in nature) could be one reason for the high p opularity especially in these countries. The socioeconomic predictors for CAM use seem to be uniform ac ross the included studies, but only very few studies differentiated between singl e CAM modalities. The impact of parental income, education, and parents' own CAM use appears to be signifi- cant, but factors that are not influenced by parental backgroun d such as child's gender and age may also have an impact. In all instances of significan t results for gender, fe- male children used more CAM than male children. Two further lar ge studies analyzing insurance claims data (for CAM provider visits) [5] and physici ans' prescribing patterns (for anthroposophic remedies), respectively [33] also found fem ale children to use significantly more CAM. As it is unlikely that the high CAM popularity is only a passi ng phenomenon, the results of this review may have implications for decision maker s. Seemingly, there is a demand for (supposedly) gentle and holistic therapy approaches (if in some countries or regions limited access to conventional medicine or limited f i n a n c i a l r e s o u r c e s a r e one reason for CAM use, respecti ve measures for improvement by authorities are in- dispensable). Meanwhile, CAM has also become an economic factor . In 2011, the sales of herbal, homeopathic, and anthroposophic drugs together amoun ted to one billion euros in German pharmacies [25]. Homeopathy and herbal drugs, l isted in many studies 47 among the most popular CAM moda lities, exhibit two problems oft en mentioned in the context of CAM use: it is not superior to a placebo (\"homeopath y\") or it has prob- lematic side effects/interactions (\"herbals\") [18,35,52,68,69]. It is essential that CAM with poor evidence of efficacy are not used as a substitute for conventional medicine in patients with severe conditions. Physicians should be aware of possible CAM use espe- cially in their pediatric patients. Nevertheless, harmless CAM may have a benefit, even if it is only due to placebo effect. It should also be noted th at there are approved con- ventional drugs which lack clear evidence of efficacy (e.g., Ac etylcysteine, a mucolytic drug widely used for children [ 42]). With respect to the high p revalence rates in Europe, costs and benefits of the single CAM modalities have to be inve stigated more intensely. Health care managers should then take position if and which CAM should be covered by health insurances. Also, with respect to the new European patie nt mobility, it would be desirable that the regulations for covering CAM would increasin gly converge across the European Union. T o e v a l u a t e t h e e x t e n t o f C A M u s e i n c h i l d r e n , r e l i a b l e a n d i n formative data are needed. Many of the included studies are not comparable with re spect to the range of assessed CAM modalities. In this context, the analysis of clear ly defined individual CAM modalities and the reporting of the underlying recall period ar e two important aspects to obtain comparable figures. For future publications (especially data from Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa are currently lacking), it would be desirable that r esearchers increasingly analyze the single CAM modalities as prevalence rates and predi ctors for overall CAM use have only limited informational content. A respective sugge stion for a tool towards a more detailed and standardized assessment of CAM use has been developed [47]. To reduce the risk of bias, the data of only one child per surveye d family should be ana- lyzed and seasonal factors shoul d also be considered. When anal yzing the impact of the family's financial situation on CAM use, equivalent income migh t be more appropriate than parental income. With regard to \"alternative\" drugs such as homeopathic or herb al remedies, it is important to know both the prevalence of use and the quantities of the remedies actu- ally consumed, as well as t he duration of CAM use. For decision makers, precise figures on expenditures for CAM u se (both covered by insurance companies and paid out-of-pocket) would be helpful. I nformation on how many conventional prescription drugs are ultimately not used by patients because of poor tolerance (eventually in duced by nocebo e ffect) or missing acceptance (after read- ing the patient information leaflet) would also be valuable. In this context, future stud- ies could compare expenditures for conventional treatment with CAM therapies and how CAM use affects the financia l situation of health care syst ems. 48 This review has several strenghts and limitations. The database search strategy yielded a high number of results to be screened, increasing the probabi lity of including most of the relevant literature. Data for prevalence rates and predicto rs were carefully ex- tracted for the single CAM modalit ies (homeopathy, herbal remed ies). To our knowledge, this is the first comp rehensive international review displaying the figures for CAM use sorted by recall period, facilitating comparison of the various findings. For the first time, the findings for some of the main socioeconomic predictors of CAM utili- zation in children/adolescents were compared. Despite the extensive literature search, we cannot exclude the possibility that some potentially important publications were missed, as we did not s earch in non-English databases or gray literature. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, a pooling of the findings for pre- dictors was not feasible. Furthermore, it is not ensured that a llocation criteria for ho- meopathic remedies and herbal drugs, respectively were uniform across all included studies. Differences in the definition of CAM may be the reason for some remarkably h i g h o r l o w p r e v a l e n c e r a t e s f o r h e r b a l o r h o m e o p a t h i c d r u g u s e r e p o r t e d b y a f e w studies. To our knowledge, there is no universally valid defini tion of CAM. This might have an impact on the prevalence rates of overall CAM use summa rized in this review especially when looking at different countries. To account for the huge variety of CAM definitions in the reviewed studies, meta-analysis was not perf ormed for overall CAM use but restricted to homeopathic and herbal remedies. We anticipated that use of homeopathy and herbal remedies woul d differ noticea- bly across countries and thus to obtain data for as many countr ies as possible, we also considered studies with lower quality and possibly limited repr esentativeness. Due to different settings, some studies contained substantial percentages (up to 37%) of children with chronic diseases presumably overestimatin g CAM use [e.g., 3,9,32,39,40,45]. Conclusions This review presents prevalence r ates (sorted by recall period) and predictors for over- all CAM use in children/adolesce nts and, if available, detailed information on homeopa- thy and herbal drug use is given. Prevalence rates vary noticea bly across the compared countries but are generally on a high level, depending among ot hers on the viewed CAM modality. Information on predictors for single CAM modaliti es is rare, and for many European and no n-European countries no published studies a re available. 49 Acknowledgments This work was supported by the Munich Center of Health Sciences (MC-Health) at Lud- wig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t (LMU) M\u00fcnchen.

Wolfenstetter. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among chronica lly ill adolescents from two German birth cohorts. Forsch Komplementmed [accepted 18 May : I m V e r g l e i c h z u r G e s a m t k o h o r t e w a r d i e P r \u00e4 v a l e n z d e s G e b r a u c h s aller Arzneimittel zusammengenommen (60.1% vs. Abstract Background : Pediatric use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is popu- lar in Europe, and utilization may be even more prevalent in ch ronically ill chil- dren/adolescents. This study's a im is to assess CAM use among a dolescents with chronic conditions. Methods : Data on drug utilization (past 4 weeks) and consultation with CAM providers (past year) were collected using a self-administered questionna ire from 4,677 adoles- cents from the German birth cohorts. All repo rted drugs were classi- fied into therapeutic categories (conventional drugs, homeopath y, herbal drugs, etc.). Additionally, participants were asked to report chronic disease s (allergies, atopic der- matitis, asthma, or other chronic diseases) that were parent-re p o r t e d d i a gn o s e s b y a physician during the past 5 years. Results : Compared with the total sample , drug utilization in general ( 60.1% vs. 41.1%), h o m e o p a t h y u s e ( 1 1 . 1 % v s . 8 . 1 % ) , a n d c o n s u l t a t i o n w i t h C A M p r o v iders (16.9% vs. 10.9%) was significantly more pr evalent among chronically ill a dolescents. However, chronically ill adolescents used relatively (proportion of the defined therapeutic ca- tegory among all drugs used) more conventional drugs than healt hy adolescents. Conclusion : Compared with healthy adolescents, CAM use is more prevalent among adolescents with chronic conditions. Owing to the higher drug u se in general, the risk of pharmacological interactions may be elevated in chronically ill adolescents. Key words Adolescent Complementary thera pies Homeopathy Phytotherap y Drug utilization Chronic disease 66 Introduction Non-conventional therapy approaches that are not part of mainst ream medicine are often referred to as complementary and alternative medicine (CA M). For analysis of utilization patterns, a universally valid definition for CAM wo uld be desirable but may be very difficult. However, according to available studies and literature reviews , utilization of CAM products such as homeopathy or herbal drugs is widespread among children and ado- lescents in Europe and worldwide as well [1,2]. The prevalence o f p e d i a t r i c C A M u s e may be even higher among children/adolescents suffering from ch ronic conditions [3]. The number of studies that invest igated CAM use in this pediatr ic subgroup by directly comparing healthy a nd chronically ill children from the same sa mple is limited [4-8], especially with regard to the use of non-conventional medicinal products such as ho- meopathic remedies, herbal drugs , or nutritional supplements, s ome of the most com- monly used medicinal CAM [9]. A 2013 study conducted in Germany with 163 healthy children and 242 chronically ill children found higher prevalen ce r a t e s o f C A M u s e i n children with chronic conditions [5]. Some further studies yiel ded similar significant result for the pediatric or general population [6,10-13] or lis ted the presence of chronic conditions among the commonest motivating factors for CAM use [ 14-17], whereas other authors found no higher prevalence rates for CAM use in c hildren with (specific) chronic conditions [4,7,8,18]. As children/adolescents with chr onic conditions may belong to a particularly vul- nerable patient group, a thorough view on their (self-)medicati on with CAM is im- portant with respect to possible side-effects, interactions, or the substitution of con- ventional drugs by non-conventional drugs without the physician 's knowledge. This study aims at a comparison of CAM use among chronically i ll adolescents from two large German birth cohorts with the utilization of CAM amon g adolescents without chronic conditions from the same sample. In addition to the ana lysis of prevalence rates, the amount of medicinal products (with a focus on homeop athic and herbal drugs) actually used within a def ined observation period has al so been addressed. Material and Methods Study population The GINIplus (German Infant study on the Influence of Nutrition Intervention plus envi- ronmental and genetic influences on allergy development) and LI SAplus (Influence of lifestyle factors on the immune system and allergies in East an d West Germany plus the influence of traffic emissions and genetics) studies are based on two German birth 67 cohorts that started with 5,991 (GINIplus) and 3,097 (LISAplus) healthy full-term new- borns. The children were recruited between September 1995 and J anuary 1999 from obstetric clinics in Munich, Leipzig, Wesel, and Bad Honnef. Th e recruitment sites were chosen to achieve a heterogeneou s sample with regard to geograp hic region (South Germany = Munich; East Germany = Leipzig; West Germany = Wesel and Bad Honnef) and degree of urbanization (urban areas = Munich and Leipzig; m ore rural areas = Wesel and Bad Honnef). From both studies, non-term children and children of less than 2,500 g birth weight were excluded. Data collection For the 15-year follow-up, 6,094 participants' parents or legal guardians were con- tacted between January 2011 and October 2014. With the main que stionnaire, the parents/legal guardians were asked whether they had consulted p hysicians from vari- ous medical specialties and alternative health care providers ( non-medical health pro- vider (\"Heilpraktiker\"), homeopat h, osteopath, and \"others\") du ring the past 12 months for their children's illness or d isorder. The questionnaire als o assessed further variables such as children's gender, parenta l education, and household in come. One question addressed the diagnosis of several diseases by a physician. The parents/legal guardians w e r e a s k e d t o r e p o r t w h i c h d i s e a s e o u t o f a p r e s e n t e d l i s t o f 1 0 d i s e a s e s h a d b e e n diagnosed in their child within the 5 past years. Additionally, the exact year of diagnosis was assessed. Furthermore, the participants were given the poss ibility to enter other chronic diseases or disorders suffered by their child (and the year of diagnosis) that were not part of the present ed list of chronic diseases. The data on pediatric drug utilization (use within the past 4 weeks) were collected using a separate self-administered questionnaire, where the par ticipants could enter the drug names and the pharmaceutical identification numbers (P ZN) into 5 designated spaces. The PZN exactly identifies the drugs with respect to pa ckage size, dosage, man- ufacturer, etc. In case the limit ed designated spaces were not sufficient to enter all drugs, the participants were invited to note separately the pre c i s e n u m b e r o f d r u g s used. The data collection was performed almost evenly over the four seasons, with slight peaks in April and June. Drug classification All reported drugs were classified into several therapeutic mod alities. The classification and the exact definition of the various modalities have been de scribed in detail in a previously published study [19]. For the present study, the fol lowing medicinal CAM modalities were considered: 68 (1) Homeopathic remedies (medicinal products prepared according to the produc- tion specification of the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia HAB [20], al so including anthroposophic drugs) (2) Herbal drugs (3) Other non-conventional medicinal products (nutritionals such as vitamins and combined food supplements, minerals and trace elements, non-pat hogenic microorganisms, further medicinal CAM such as Bach flower remed ies or tradi- tional Chinese medicine). Outcome definition and statistical analysis Participants who reported the use of at least one homeopathic r emedy during the past 4 weeks were classified as \"homeopathy users\". Those taking one or more herbal drugs were classified as \"herbal drug users\", respectively. \"Overall medicinal CAM users\" took at least one drug from the defined medicinal CAM modalities 1-3 . A \"CAM provider user\" provider (\"Heilpraktik er\"), a homeopath, an osteopath, or another type of CAM provider at least once during the past year. Finally, \"overall drug users\" took one or more drugs from any therapeuti c category (conven- tional or non-conventional) within the past 4 weeks. For analysis, the statistical sof tware package SAS was used (S AS Institute Inc., Cary, N C , U S A , v e r s i o n 9 . 3 ) . T h e d i f f e r e n c e i n C A M u s e b e t w e e n a d o l e s cents with chronic conditions and adolescents without the defined chronic diseases was tested using the Pearson Chi2 test (p<0.05). The following cat egories of chronic conditions (diagnosed in the last year; diagnosed in the preceding 5 years) were defined : (1) Allergies (hay fever, perennial allergic rhinitis, food allergy ) (2) Atopic dermatitis (neurodermatit is, allergic or atopic eczema) (3) Asthma (4) Any kind of chronic condition: Adolescents who suffered from al lergies (1), atopic dermatitis (2), asthma (3), or from other self-reported chronic condi- tions that were not part of the presented list of diagnosed dis eases (e.g., dia- betes, celiac disease, etc.) The GINIplus and LISAplus cohorts obtained approval from the et hics committees of the Bavarian Medi cal Coun cil, th e University of Leipzig, and t he Me dical Council of North Rhine-Westphalia. Furthermore, written informed consent was giv en by the partici- pants' parents or legal guardians and by participants. 69 Results The majority (68.0%) of the reported 3,873 drugs were \"convent ional drugs\" con- taining chemically defined as or para- cetamol. Some 15.1% were homeopathic drugs, 8.4% were herbal dr u g s , a n d 3 . 8 % belonged to the category of \"other non-conventional medicinal p roducts\". Owing to the possibility of ambiguous interpretation, 2.7% of the reported d rugs (e.g., medicinal products containing iodide normally used for prophylaxis accord ing to medical guide- lines) were allocated to neither the category \"conventional dru gs\" nor the category \"medicinal CAM drugs\". For 2.0% of the reported drugs, an alloc ation to a specific ther- apeutic category was not possible and the information was inter preted as \"overall drug use\" only. In sum, 41.1% of the total sample of 4,677 adolescents had use d at least one type of drug during the past 4 weeks. The 4-week prevalence for home opathy use was 8.1%, and 5.9% of the adolescents had used herbal drugs (fig. 1). The 1-year prevalence of consultation with any type of CAM provider was 10.9%. Herbal dr ug use and consulta- tion with CAM providers were positively associated with higher maternal education, whereas homeopathy was used most by girls and by participants r esiding in Munich, confirming the results from a pr eviously published study analyz ing the GINIplus cohort only [19]. From the total sample, 13.7% re ported the diagnosis of a chron ic disease in the past year. The corresponding figure for the past 5 years was 26 .5%. The corresponding percentages for adolescents suffering from allergies, atopic de rmatitis, or asthma are displayed in table 1, together with the stratified prevalence r ates of drug use and con- sultation with CAM providers. As shown in figure 1, drug utiliz ation in general (60.1%), homeopathy (11.1%) and consultati on with CAM providers (16.9%) were significantly more prevalent among adolescents who reported any type of chron ic condition (diag- nosed in the past year) compared with adolescents without chron ic conditions (after- wards also referred to as \"total sample\").

While hom eopathy use, utilization of any type of medicinal CAM, and consultation with CAM provide rs were more preva- lent among adolescents with alle rgies, adolescents with atopic dermatitis or asthma did not use significantly more CAM. Only consultation with CAM prov iders was more preva- lent among those participants wi th an asthma diagnosis in any o f the preceding 5 years. In none of the analyzed chronic conditions was the prevalence o f herbal drug use signif- icantly higher compared with its use among apparently healthy a dolescents. The re- spective prevalence rates for herbal drug use were only slightl y higher among chroni- cally ill adolescents compared wit h use among the total sample (table 1). Figure 1. Prevalence (with 95% confidence intervals) of medici nal product use (within the last 4 weeks) and consultation with CAM providers (within t he last year) among the total sample (\"total\") and among adolescents with any kind of c hronic disease diag- nosed in the last year In most instances, the prevalence rates of CAM use and overall drug use were higher, if the chronic conditions were diagnosed in the past year compared with those diagnosed in any of the precedin g 5 years (table 1). The average number of used packages from the category \"homeopa thic drugs\" was slightly higher in the strata of chronically ill adolescents (n ot in those with asthma or atopic dermatitis), whereas adolescents with any type of chroni c conditions took sub- stantially more conventional drugs on average. For herbals drug s, there was hardly any difference between chronically ill and healthy adolescents (tab le 2). If only those ado- lescents were considered who took at least one drug from any th erapeutic category, then the average numbers of used drug packages show that chroni cally ill adolescents take even fewer medicinal CAM on average compared with drug use rs from the total sample (table 2).

Hence, all adolesce nts with a diagnosed chronic c ondition used relatively more conventional drugs than their healthy counterparts (fig. 2 ). Also, the proportion of adolescent drug users who took no conventional drugs but med icinal CAM products only was lower in chronically i ll children than in apparently h ealthy adolescents (fig. 3). Figure 2. Proportions of the various categories of medicinal p roducts among all drugs used for the total sample and fo r chronic diseases diagnosed in the last year (-1y) and in any of the preceding five years (-5y) Discussion The findings of this study demonstrate that adolescents from th e GINIplus and LISAplus cohorts who suffer from any kind of chronic conditions have sig nificantly higher preva- lence rates for medicinal CAM use and consultation with CAM pro viders. This is in line with the results from other studies conducted in children or ad u l t s [ 3 , 5 , 2 1 ] . A m u c h smaller German study assessing lifetime prevalence of CAM use [ 5] also found higher p r e v a l e n c e r a t e s f o r C A M u s e a m o n g c h i l d r e n w i t h c h r o n i c m e d i c a l conditions com- pared with healthy children. No prevalence rates were assessed for the single CAM modalities. Therefore, a direct comparison with our results is difficult. However, in contrast to our results, the prevalence of CAM use was highe st among children with a 73 Figure 3. Proportion (among all drug users from the correspond ing stratum) of adoles- cents who used medicinal CAM only (total sample versus chronic diseases diagnosed in the past year (-1y) or in any of the 5 preceding years (-5y)) respiratory or skin disease, a s ubgroup that showed no signific antly higher prevalence rates for medicinal CAM use. In accordance with our results, another German publication on pediatric use of herbal drugs found no significant difference between chronicall y ill children and healthy ones [22], whereas a Swedish study found that a chronic disease significantly predicted higher use of herbal products among a population aged 16 years and above [23]. In our study, the prevalence rates of CAM use were usually higher if t he chronic disease was diagnosed in the last year, instead of in any of the past 5 yea rs. This might result in part from the fact that most patients may cope better with some chro nic conditions with time. Studies assessing CAM use in children with allergies or atopic dermatitis are rare. One Japanese study stated that CAM use among children with food allergies is very high, but comparability with European studies is limited [24]. Another study conducted in an Israeli CAM clin ic found that allergy problems were the m ost mentioned reason for using CAM [25], and Canadian children reported allergies am ong the most reported reasons for visiting a naturopathic college clinic [26]. Intere stingly, an English study [27] reported that traditional Chinese medicine was the most commonl y used CAM modality for the treatment of children su ffering from atopic dermatitis. In our study, traditional Chinese Medicine was reported by none of the participating 4,67 7 adolescents. As in our study, two larger studies in vestigating CAM use among child ren with asthma [28,29] found a modest use of herbal and homeopathic drugs amon g children with Table 2 Average number of drug packages used per child (n) an d per drug user ( User ) of the corresponding stratum n User Overall drugs Conv. drugs Homeopathy Herbal drugs All med.

Despite the fact that chronically ill adolescents show higher prevalence rates of CAM use, this does not mean that they unreasonably substitute t reatment with con- ventional drugs for a non-conventional medicinal therapy approa ch with CAM. The higher prevalence rates for medicinal CAM use among chronically ill adolescents (com- pared with healthy adolescents) found in this cohort may result mainly from the gener- ally higher dru g use (from any thera peuti c categor y) am ong adol escents with chronic conditions. Nevertheless, with regard to the average number of drug packages used, chronically ill adolescents used substantially more conventiona l drugs (e.g., any chronic condition diagnosed in the last year = 1.05 drug packages vs. t otal sample = 0.56 drug packages), but only slightly more homeopathic remedies (0.17 vs . 0.13) or herbal drugs (0.08 vs. 0.07). A more detailed view on the drugs utilized rev eals that, compared with the total sample, chronically ill adolescents actually use rela tively more conventional drugs, as the proportion of conventional drugs among all drugs used was higher for any of the defined chronic categorie s compared with the proportion of conventional drugs among all drugs used for the total sample. Additionally, higher CAM use seems to de- pend on both the type of chronic condition and the underlying C AM category, as e.g., adolescents with atopic dermatitis did not show significantly h igher prevalence rates for any CAM category, whereas adolescents with allergies used s ignificantly more ho- meopathic remedies but not more herbal drugs. In spite of the h igher prevalence rates for medicinal CAM found among adolescents with chronic conditio n s , i t s e e m s t h a t medicinal CAM products do not play a bigger role in the treatme nt of chronically ill adolescents, when comparing the findings with the drug consumpt ion among the total sample. This study has several strengths and limitations. The results are based on recently assessed data from two large German birth cohorts. Several cate gories of chronic con- ditions (with the year of diagnosis) were assessed, and the pre dicting effect of the chronic condition was analyzed for various specific (medicinal) CAM categories. On the other hand, some of the self-reported chronic conditions (other than the 10 diseases in the presented list of diseases) may not be interpreted as chron ic diseases or conditions in the strict sense (e.g., iron deficiency, allergy to erythrom ycin). However, the number of these \"ambiguous cases\" is ve ry limited. Additionally, the n umber of used packages is only a rough estimation of the actually consumed amount of m edicinal products, as the size or the defined daily dos es are not considere d. C AM use is known to be very high among children suffering from severe diseases with poor pr ognosis such as cancer [31]. Data for such diseases were not available in this study. With regard to adolescents who consulted a CAM provider, it must be considered that a home opath may also be a conventional physician who uses the term \"homeopath\" as an addi tional title. Never- 76 theless, the results were very similar if only non-medical heal th providers (\"Heilprak- tiker\"), the most mentioned type of \"CAM provider\" were conside red for analysis. Fi- nally, owing to the higher educational and income levels compar ed with the German m e a n , t h e f i n d i n gs f o r t h e t o t a l co h o r t a n d t h e s u b gr o u p s w i t h chronic conditions as well do not exactly reflect CAM use among the German adolescent population. Conclusions Depending on the underlying chronic disease, adolescents with c hronic conditions showed significantly higher prevalence rates of homeopathy use, utilization on any medicinal CAM category, and consultation with CAM providers. Ne vertheless, the pro- portion of medicinal CAM among all drugs utilized was lower amo ng adolescents who suffered from a chronic disease. This indicates that chronicall y ill adolescents do not substitute conventional medicinal products with medicinal CAM b ecause of their chron- i c d i s e a s e , b u t m a y u s e n o n - c o n v e ntional therapy approaches as an additional treat- ment option. Owing to the fact that chronically ill adolescents evidently use more me- dicinal products in general, the risk of pharmacological intera ctions (e.g., between con- ventional drugs, but between conventional drugs and non-convent ional drugs as well) may be higher among adolescents with chronic conditions compare d with healthy ado- lescents.

BMC Complement Altern Med 2015;15:49. doi:10.1186/s12906-015-05 69-8 82 Abstract Background : The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is wi despread among children in Germany and other European countries. Only a few studies are avail- able on trends in pediatric CAM use over time. The study's obje ctive was to present updated results for prevalence, predictors, and costs of CAM us e among German chil- dren and a comparison with findings from a previous follow-up o f the same birth co- hort. Methods : Data were collected for 3013 children on their utilization of medicinal prod- ucts (during the last 4 weeks) and consultation with CAM provid ers (in the preceding year) from a German birth cohort study (GINIplus, 15-year follo w-up) using a self- administered questionnaire. CAMs were cl assified into six cate- gories (homeopathy, herbal drugs, nutritionals, minerals and tr ace elements, microor- ganisms, further CAM). Drug pric es were traced using pharmaceut ical identification numbers (PZNs), or otherwise conservatively estimated. Finally, the results were com- pared with data obtained from the 10-year follow-up of the same birth cohort study by adopting the identical methodology. Results : In all, 26% of the reported 2489 drugs were medicinal CAM. Th e 4-week preva- lence for homeopathy and herbal drug use was 7.5% and 5.6%, res pectively. Some 13.9% of the children used at least one type of medicinal CAM i n the preceding 4 weeks. The 1-year prevalence for consultation with CAM provid ers was 10.8%. From the drugs identified as CAM, 53.7% were homeopathic remedies, a nd 30.8% were herbal drugs. Factors associated with higher medicinal CAM use were female ge nder, residing in Munich, and higher maternal education. A homeopathy user utilized on aver age homeopathic remedies wort h EUR 15.28. The corresponding figure for herbal drug users was EUR 16.02, and E UR 18.72 for overall medicinal CAM users. Compared with the 10-year follow-up, the prevalence of homeopat h y u s e w a s m o r e than halved (-52%) and dropped substantially for herbal drug us e (-36%) and overall CAM use (-38%) as well. Conclusion : CAM use among 15-year-old children in the GINIplus cohort is popular, but decreased noticeably compared with children from the same cohor t a t t h e a g e o f 10 years. This is possibly mainly because German health legisla tion normally covers CAM for children younge r than 12 years only. Key words Complementary therapies CAM Homeopathy Phytotherapy Chi ld Germany Drug utilization Socioeco nomic factors Trends 83 Background Therapy approaches that are not part of conventional medicine a re often referred to as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), although there is no universally valid definition of CAM. However, there seems to be an unbroken high demand for such kinds of therapy approaches in the European population and outs ide Europe as well. Some recently published reviews give updated overviews on the p revalence of CAM use in adults [1,2] and children [3,4]. Owing to different methodol ogy and CAM definition, the findings of the included studies on CAM use vary widely wit h respect to the preva- lence and predictors of use. For instance, overall CAM use in c hildren without chronic conditions was reported to be between 1.8% and 87.6%, depending on included CAM modalities, country, and unde rlying recall period [3]. When looking at specific CAM categories, many of the reviewed studies listed ho- m e o p a t h y a n d h e r b a l d r u g s a m o n g t h e m o s t p o p u l a r t y p e s o f C A M . Within Europe, Germany ranks between the countries with the highest prevalence rates for homeopa- thy and herbal drug use in children. For homeopathy, prevalence rates of 27.7% (1-year prevalence) [5] and 14.3% (4-week prevalence) [6] were reported in German children. Other European countries with high prevalence rates for homeopa thy use are The N e t h e r l a n d s w i t h 1 4 . 6 % ( 1 - y e a r p r e v a l e n c e ) [ 7 ] a n d t h e U K w i t h 16.9% (lifetime use) [8]. With concern to herbal drugs, a 2010 publication found 85. 5% of German children [9] using herbal drugs (lifetime use). In Turkey, the prevalenc e of pediatric use of herbal drugs was 58.6% (1-year prevalence) [10]. The evidently high po pularity of non- conventional medicine in Germany and other countries makes CAM use a relevant public health topic. This article presents data from the recently completed 15-year follow-up of a Ger- man birth cohort study. The aim was to extract prevalence rates and predictors for the utilization of various CAM modalities (homeopathy use, herbal d rug use, medicinal CAM utilization in general, and consultation with CAM providers ). Furthermore, ex- penditures on pediatric CAM use were analyzed. Finally, in orde r to detect possible time trends and differences in CAM use, the results were compar ed with the findings from the 10-year follow-up of a smaller but similarly composed sample from the same birth cohort. Methods Study population GINIplus (German Infant study on the Influence of Nutrition Int ervention plus environ- mental and genetic influences on allergy development) is a Germ an birth cohort study 84 [11]. It started with 5991 health y full-term newborns (children with a birth weight <2500 g were not eligible for inclusion), who were recruited be tween September 1995 and June 1998 from obstetric clinics in an urban region of sout hern Germany (Munich) and a more rural region in the w estern part of Germany (Wesel). For the 15-year follow-up, 3895 participants were contacted be tween January 2011 and September 2013. With regard to the season, 27% of the quest ionnaires were col- lected in winter 29% in spring (April-June), 2 6% in summer (July- September), and the remaining 18% in autumn (October-December). A m o n g o t h e r things, the main questionnaire assessed the children's gender, parental income and education, and consultation with various alternative health car e providers during the previous 12 months. In addition to the main questionnaire, a self-administered que stionnaire on the consumption of drugs and medicinal products was included based on an almost identi- cal questionnaire that had already been adopted for the 10-year follow-up. The design of the questionnaire on drug ut ilization corresponds to the val idated questionnaire from the German KiGGS-Study that was conducted with 17641 child ren [12]. Par- ents/legal guardians were invited to report the drugs their chi ld used during the last 4 weeks by entering the drugs' n ames into designated spaces or attaching the empty drug packages to the questionnaire. The exact number of drugs u sed was assessed by an additional question in case the limited number (five) of des ignated spaces would not suffice to report all drugs utilized. Moreover, the participants were also asked to enter the pharma ceutical identifica- tion number (PZN) of the reported drugs. PZN, which is prin ted on the drug pack- age, precisely identifies the dr ug utilized and provides furthe r information such as the size of the package, the dosage, the pharmaceutical manufacture r, the listed price, etc. To avoid ambiguity of interpretation, the authors would like t o note that we also considered preparations that are no medicinal products in the s trict sense (e.g., nutri- tional supplements), b ut were reported as drugs utilized by the participating children. Drug classification All reported drugs were classified into several therapeutic cat egories. The following medicinal CAM modalities were defined and extracted from the en tity of reported drugs: (1) Homeopathic/anthroposophic drugs (afterwards referred to as ' H o m e o p a t h y ' ) : Drugs that have been prepared according to the production speci fication of the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia HAB and biochemic remedies (Schuessler salts). 85 (2) Herbal drugs: Herbal extracts and their preparations, teas . Preparations containing active pharmaceutical ingredient s of herbal origin (e.g., codei ne) that are available by prescription only were excluded. (3) Nutritionals: Vitamins and combined food supplements. Prep arations containing vitamin D for prophylaxis according to medical guidelines were excluded. (4) Minerals and trace elements: Mono-preparations of minerals or trace elements such as calcium, magnesium, selen ium, etc. Preparations contain ing iodide and/or fluoride for prophylaxis accordin g to medical guidelines were e xcluded. (5) Microorganisms: Non-pathoge nic microorganisms or their met abolites used to regulate the intestinal flora or stimulate the immune system. (6) Further medicinal CAM: Bach flower, traditional Chinese me dicine, etc. As well as medicinal CAM use, consultation with CAM providers w as assessed during the previous 12 months (non-medical health provider ('Heilprakt iker'), homeopath, osteopath, and 'others') for t he child's disease or disorder. Cost accounting Parents were asked to report expenditures for consultations wit h CAM providers. Prices for medicinal CAM were traced via PZNs (official pharmacy price s from the 'Lauer' price list as of August 2012). For drug entries without PZNs, conserv ative assumptions were made (e.g., smallest package size, most favorable price). Comparison of the results The results were compared with d ata based on the 10-year follow -up of the combined GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohort studies (n=3642) [6]. For co mparison, only data from the GINIplus subset were used, which included 2065 children fro m Munich and Wesel. The distribution of the participants with regard to gender, stu dy area, maternal educa- tional background, and parental income background was very simi lar to the composi- tion of the GINIplus cohort of the 15-year follow-up (n=3013). Furthermore, the same methodology (drug classificatio n, logistic regression model, et c.) was adopted for the analysis of both follow-ups. Outcome definition and statistical analysis Several outcomes were defined for the statistical analysis. Tho se participants who re- ported utilization of at least one homeopathic drug during the past 4 weeks were de- fined as 'homeopathy users' and those taking at least one herba l drug as 'herbal drug 86 users', respectively. 'Overall CAM users' took at least one dru g from the therapeutic categories 1-6. Finally, a 'CAM provider user' consulted at lea st once during the past year with a non-medical health provider ('Heilpraktiker'), a ho meopath, an osteopath, or another type of CAM provider. The statistical analysis was performed with the SAS software p ackage (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA, version 9.3) . Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using a mult ivariate logistic regression mod el. The significance level for the estimates was set at p<0 .05. All independent variables included in the model were checked using the F-test for significance. Bivariate assoc rates were analyzed by Chi2 test (p<0.05). To define educational status, the mothers' educational backgro und was classified into four levels based on the ir highest school degree: Level 1: secondary school Level 2: junior high school Level 3: baccalaureate (= qualif ication for university entranc e) Level 4: university degree Mothers who reported no school d egree at all (n=5) were allocat ed to education l e v e l 1 . E n t r i e s f o r m o t h e r s ( n = 4 ) r e p o r t i n g a n o t h e r ( n o t f u r t h er specified) kind of school degree than those listed above, were treated as missing values for educational background. The income status was defined u sing the median equivalent inco me (MEI) for 2012 (\u20ac1633 net/month) [14] where the household members were weighte d according to the new scale of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [15]. The income cut-offs were chosen according to the definiti on of poverty (60% of MEI) [16]. The GINIplus cohort obtained approval from the ethics committe e of the Bavarian Medical Council and the Medical Council of North Rhine-Westphal ia. Furthermore, written informed consent was given by the participants' parents or legal guardians and by participants. Results Cohort structure and prevalence of CAM use Out of 3895 distributed questionnaires assessing drug utilizati on, 3013 were completed and returned, yielding a response rate of 77.4%. The children's average age was 15.1 years, ranging between 14.5 years and 16.8 years. Mothers compl eted 85.5% of the 87 questionnaires, fathers 5.1%, and questionnaires completed by b oth parents accounted for 2.7% (missing values = 6.7%) . Compared with the baseline su rvey, the parents of those children who participated i n the 15-year follow-up have h igher levels of school education and income.

As defined in the methods section, 10 prescrip tion drugs containing opium alk aloids (noscapine, morphine) or allergens extracted from pollen were excluded from t h e C A M m o d a l i t y 'herbal drugs'. Looking at all CA M categories, 418 children [13 .9% (12.6;15.1)] used at least one drug from the CAM categories 1-6. Table 1.

The total numb er of drugs utilized was 88 2489, of which 2444 could be allocated to a therapeutic categor y . T h e r e m a i n i n g 45 drug entries did not provide enough information to identify the therapeutic category a n d w e r e t h e r e f o r e i n t e r p r e t e d a s d r u g u s e o n l y. T h e m a j o r i t y o f utilized drugs were conventional drugs with chemica lly active pharmaceutical ingred ients such as ibuprofen or paracetamol. Nevertheless, about 26% (n=643) belonged to the n o n - c o n v e n t i o n a l drug categories, as defined abov e in the section 'drug classifi cation'. Of the 643 identi- fied CAM, 642 were available without medical prescription. The detailed distribution of non-conventional drugs over the various CAM modalities is shown in Figure 1. Homeo- pathic remedies were the most commonly used CAM modality (14.1% of all identified drugs), followed by herbal drugs (8.1%), minerals and trace ele ments (1.9%), and nutri- tionals (1.1%). Other medicinal CAM as Bach flo wer remedies or tradi- tional Chinese medicine played only a marginal role. Figure 1.

A further 146 were single homeopath ic drugs such as Arnica (n=26), Belladonna (n=9), and Gelsemium (n=9), which wer e the most frequent single homeopathic remedies. Twelve drugs were clearly identifi ed as anthroposophic remedies. Single remedies as well as biochemic remedies accordi ng to Dr. Schuessler 89 are partly used for several disease patterns. An allocation to ATC categories is therefore not possible. With respect to herbal drugs, more than 70% of the 198 drugs f rom this category were used for the treatment of coughs and colds. The mean durat ion of overall CAM use was 11.1 days (median=6). The corresponding figures for hom eopathy and herbal drugs were 9.7 days (median=5) and 8.6 days (median=5). In comp arison with CAM, the mean duration of conventional drug use was 11.4 days (median=5) . Table 2.

The prevalence for consultation with CAM providers (within the p r e v i o u s 12 months) was lower than for med icinal CAM use. Some 144 child ren (4.8%) visited a non-medical health provider ('Heilpraktiker'). Consultation wit h a homeopath was re- ported for 98 children (3.3%), with an osteopath for 102 childr en (3.4%), and 38 partici- pants (1.3%) consulted with othe r CAM providers. Overall, 324 c hildren [10.8% (9.6;11.9)] visited at least one type of CAM provider during th e 12 months prior to the assessment date. 90 Predictors of CAM use Table 3 summarizes the ORs for pr edicting factors for CAM use. Female gender significantly predi cted homeopathy use (OR=1.48) and overall CAM use (OR=1.49). Girls were more lik ely to be 'herbal drug users' as well, but the ORs were not significant for this CAM modality. Compared with Munich (urban area), the participants from Wesel (rural area) used fewer homeopathic drugs (OR=0.62) and were less likely to be 'o verall CAM users' (OR=0.75). Children from Wesel also consulted CAM providers les s (OR=0.57). Higher education has a positive effect on CAM use. With the lo west maternal edu- c a t i o n l e v e l a s a r e f e r e n c e , c h i l d r e n w h o s e m o t h e r h a d a u n i v e r sity degree showed significantly higher ORs for herbal drug use (OR=2.03), and con sultation with CAM pro- viders (OR=2.49), but no significant association with education al status was found for homeopathy use.

However, children from poor households tend to consult CAM prov iders less.

Expenditures on medicinal CAM and CAM providers Prices were traceable via PZNs f or 300 (46.7%) of the 643 repor ted CAM. The prices of a further 324 CAM were conservatively estimated. The remaining 19 drug entries were not considered for cost analysis as information content was too poor to estimate a price. The mean price of a homeopathic drug was \u20ac10.14 (range: \u20ac3.70-\u20ac116.69), and the average price herbal dru gs amounted to \u20ac13.72 (range: \u20ac 1.99-\u20ac94.45). Looking at all medicina l CAM , the me an cost of o ne dru g was \u20ac 12 .56, ran ging b etween \u20ac 1.0 2 and \u20ac116.69. Within a period of 4 weeks, a 'homeopathy user' ut ilized on (range: \u20ac3.70-\u20ac124.54). The respec t i v e f i g u r e s f o r 'herbal drug users' 'CAM provider users' reported expendi- tures for consultation with a CAM provider during the previous 12 months. The mean expenditure was \u20ac214 (range: \u20ac5-\u20ac1600). Comparison of the results with the results from the 10-year fol low-up Children from the 15-year follow-up the GINIplus birth cohort used signif- icantly less medicinal CAM than t hose from the 10-year follow-u p (= GINI-10). The 4 - w e e k p r e v a l e n c e f o r h o m e o p a t h y u s e w a s m o r e t h a n h a l v e d , a n d herbal drug use dropped by more than a third. In sum, the prevalence of overall medicinal CAM use decreased from 22.3% (GINI-10) to 13.9% (GINI-15), whereas the prevalence of conven- tional drug use increased from 30.6% to 34.1%. The decline in consultations wit h CAM providers was lower comp ared with medici- nal CAM use. However, the 1-year prevalence fell from 12.6% (GI NI-10) to 10.8% (GINI- 15). Altogether, the prevalence of overall drug use (convention a l + n o n - c o n v e n t i o n a l drugs put together) did not change significantly. The prevalenc e rates from both follow- ups and the mean package consumption per child with respect to the various CAM modalities are shown in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 4 visualizes th e relative change in CAM utilized, comparing GINI-10 with GINI-15. The findings for pred icting factors were in line with the results from the 10-year follow-up. 92 Figure 2.

Relative change in pediatric CAM use (prevalence of use and average con- sumption of drug packages) in GINI-15 compared with GINI-10 Discussion The present results imply that C AM use in Germany is considerab le among 15-year-old children and confirm the popularity of CAM among German childre n found by other studies. [5,6,9,17-19]. A birth cohort study from 2007 [5] anal yzing homeopathy use and consultation with a non-medical health practitioner ('Heilp raktiker') in 2-year-old children found a 1-year prevalence for homeopathy use of 27.7%. Furthermore, 4.5% of the parents had consulted a 'Heilpraktiker' within the last 6 m onths for their child's disorder, which is well in line with our findings for GINI-15 ( 4.8%, 1-year prevalence) and GINI-10 (6.2%, 1-year prevalence). Another study reporting a lifetime prevalence of 85.5% for herbal drug use [9] a lso included lifetime use of her bal teas such as chamo- mile or fennel, presumably explaining the very high utilization compared with our find- ings. A recent publication on herbal drug use (based on data collect ed between 2003 and 2006) in a sample of German children aged between 0 and 17 years [18] found a 7-day prevalence of 5.8%. The same data source yielded a 7-day prevalence for home- opathy use of 4.6% [17]. Both results were close to the finding s of the present study for homeopathy and herbal drug use, considering the shorter recall period (7 days vs. 4 weeks) which may explain the slightly lower prevalence rates compared with ours. Further results from studies conducted in children with chronic conditions may have yielded higher prevalence rates than in the respective general population and were therefore not considered for comparison with our results. 94 The children's financial background seems to have only a weak i mpact on CAM use in Germany, but education significantly predicted the use of sever al CAM modalities. Children from the level with the lowest maternal education show ed the lowest preva- lence of herbal drug use, overall CAM use, and consultation wit h CAM providers, whereas there was hardly any difference between the three highe r education levels. It may be assumed that CAM use is also a matter of health literacy , and children or their mothers from the lowest education stratum are less able or less motivated to inform themselves about health issues s uch as alternative therapy appr oaches. Nevertheless, this positive association of drug u s e w i t h a h i g h e r m a t e r n a l e d ucation level was also true for 'conventional drugs'. Interestingly, the prevalence rates for medicinal CAM use were substantially lower than the respective figures from the 10-year follow-up in a sim ilar German birth cohort. In contrast to our results, most of the studies reporting a sig nificant association of CAM use with the children's age found higher prevalence rates in ol der children [3]. Only three studies (two were German studies) found decreasing preval ence rates with older age [17,18,20]. The fall in CAM u se among 15-year-old children (compared with the children from GINI-10) cannot b e explained by lower drug utiliz ation in general, as the consumption of 'conventional drugs' in GINI-15 did not decrease a t t h e s a m e t i m e . Another German study [21] (using data collected between 2003 an d 2006) showed that the prevalence rate for drug utilization in general is not lowe r in 15-year-old children than in 10-year-old children (children aged between 14 and 17 y ears were compared with children aged between 7 and 10 years). Owing to German health legislation from 2004, statutory health insurance covers costs for CAM only in exceptional cases for patients older than 12 years. Therefore, it can reasonably be assumed that most of the medicinal CAM utiliz ed by the children in the present cohort was bought over the counter without medical prescription or a phy- sician's knowledge. In contrast to the 15-year follow-up, statutory health insuran c e w o u l d n o r m a l l y cover most of the medicinal CAM prescribed by a physician for t he 10-year-old children. De facto, 29.3% of homeopathy, 35.6% of herbal drugs, and 31.3% of overall CAM were prescribed by physicians for the 10-year-old children in GINI-1 0 (prescription status was assessed in GINI-10 only). A German population-based study also found a reverse asso- ciation of herbal drug use with children's age [18]. The author s' hypothesis is in line with our supposition that this correlation may be due to the po ssibility of getting ex- penditure on CAM reimbursed from statutory health insurance. Ch ildren may use less CAM if it has to be paid for out of pocket, regardless of their financial background. Con- sultations with CAM providers we r e n o t a f f e c t e d b y t h e r e i m b u r s ement cuts in the 2004 health act. This may explain the moderate decline in CAM p rovider visits com- pared with the substantial fall in medicinal CAM use. 95 Two longitudinal studies analyzin g pediatric CAM use [22,23] fo und increasing or al- most stable prevalence rates over time. A Norwegian publication p r e s e n t e d a 1 - y e a r prevalence of 8.7% for visits to CAM practitioners among adoles cents (17-19 years), an increase of 26% compared with the same group surveyed 4 years b efore. Another longi- tudinal study conducted in the UK found only a small variation in homeopathy use, with the same prevalence of 8.0% at the first and last follow-up (at the age of 18 months and 103 months respectively; variable underlying recall periods bet ween 1 and 1.5 years), while the results from the other follow-ups ranged between 5.4% a n d 6 . 6 % . T h e s e results obtained from studies with a longitudinal design furthe r support our hypothesis that the decrease in CAM use in GINI-15 compared with GINI-10 m ay result from Ger- man restrictions (for children ol der than 12 years) concerning reimbursement for CAM. This study has strengths and limitations as well. The various CAM modalities were strictly classified and carefully extracted by a pharmacist. Ow i n g t o t h e a l m o s t e v e n distribution of data collection ov er winter, spring, summer, an d autumn, the seasonal impact on drug utilization was minimized. The comparably short recall period of 4 weeks presumably reduced recall bias. To our knowledge, only a very few other studies have performed a longitudinal comparison of CAM use over time f or cohorts compar- able in size and socioecono mic variables [22,23]. Compared with the German mean, the higher education and income levels were overrepresented in the present cohort, because of the dispropor tionate number of dropouts from the lower socioeconomic levels since the start of the study. Additionally, it must be considered that 15-year-old children may begin to ma ke their own decisions concerning their (self-) medication, and CAM use may also have been influenced by the children's educational level, w hich was not assessed in this st udy. Furthermore, we were unable to rule out non-response bias, as 49.7% of the chil dren recruited at the beginning of the study did not participate in the 15-year follo w-up. With regard to children who consulted a CAM provider, it must be considered that a homeopath may be a conventional physician who uses the term ' homeopath' as an additional title. However, a sensitivity analysis that excluded a ' h o m e o p a t h ' f r o m t h e definition as a 'CAM provider' yielded no substantial differenc es with regard to the predictors of consultation with 'non-conventional' health provi ders. The questionnaire for the 15-year follow-up did no t explicitly assess whether the reported drugs were prescribed/recommended by a physician or bought on the children 's/parents' own i n i t i a t i v e . M o r e o v e r , n o i n f o r m a t i o n w a s a v a i l a b l e o n t h e p r o p o rtion of privately in- sured participants among all participating children (with regar d to reimbursement for CAM, private health insurance co mpanies may have fewer restrict ions than statutory health insurance companies). Therefore, we cannot determine exa ctly how much of the decrease in CAM use (GINI-15 vs. GINI-10) can be attributed to fewer CAM prescriptions from physicians. Nevertheless, the proportion of over-the-count er drugs (such as me- 96 dicinal CAM) among all prescribed drugs is estimated to be 17% [24]. The aforemen- tioned figure may be somewhat lower in the present cohort, sinc e the figure refers to the whole German population incl uding children younger than 12 years. Due to poten- tially different definitions of CAM, the comparability of our r esults with other interna- tional findings may be limited with regard to the predictors an d the prevalence of over- all CAM use. Prices for over-the-counter drugs are freely calculable in Ger many. The present analysis of expenditures on CAM is based on rough price estimat ions. Owing to compe- tition, pharmacies may offer CAM at prices lower than those lis ted in the official price list 'Lauer'. On the other hand, prices for drugs without avail able PZNs may have been underestimated by conservative assumptions. Nevertheless, we fo und no other Ger- man studies on pediatric CAM use tracking or estimating prices for the reported reme- dies utilized. Conclusions Health insurance contributions a re mainly generated by the insu red persons. Therefore, it may be appropriate that the u se of these financial resources should also adequately reflect the obviously existing w ish of a noticeable percentage of the German population to integrate CAM into the treatment of their disorders. People with minor ailments may (subjectively) experience a benefit from the use of harmless CA M . A t t h e s a m e t i m e , patients with severe conditions should be aware that CAM is not a suitable substitute for conventional medicine. The 2004 German health act removed nearly all over-the-counter dr u gs from the list of reimbursable drugs for children older than 12 years. Th is may have contributed t o t h e d e cr e a s e i n m e d i ci n a l C A M u s e i n c h i l d r e n f r o m t h e G I N I - 15 cohort compared with those from GINI-10, but other reasons such as a possibly l ower acceptance of CAM among adolescents (compared with younger children) may have con tributed to the drop in CAM use as well. Since 2012 [25], German statutory heal th insurance compa- nies have again had the possibility to reimburse the costs of o ver-the-counter drugs (including medicinal CAM such as homeopathy, herbal drugs, etc. ). Nevertheless, still many health insurance companies do not cover expenditures on CA M or limit the cov- erage to a fixed yearly amount [26]. For health insurers, it mi ght be valuable infor- mation if reimbursement of CAM influences the decision of insur ed persons to choose a specific health in surance company. Future studies assessing exactly how many medicinal CAM are pr escribed by physi- cians may support policy makers and health care managers in the ir further decision- making process concerning the inclusion of CAM in the list of r eimbursable therapy approaches. 97 Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Methods : Data were collected for 3,013 children on their utilization o f drugs (4-week prevalence) from a German birth cohort study (GINIplus, 15-year follow-up) using a self-administered questionnaire. The drugs were grouped into ov er-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs, and were classified according to the an atomical therapeutic chemical classification system. Predictors were analysed using a logistic regression model with four independent variables (gender, study area, mate rnal education, and parental income). Results : Some 69% of the reported 2,489 drugs were over-the-counter dr ugs, and 31% were prescription drugs. The 4-week prevalence for using any ty pe of drug was 41.0%. Drug categories with high prevalence rates of use were antiinfl ammatory drugs (10.3%), analgesics (7.1%), and antiallergics (5.0%). Factors associated with higher use of over-the-counter drugs we re female gender (OR=1.56, p<0.0001) and higher maternal education (OR=1.60, p=0 .0021; university degree vs. secondary high school). Maternal education was corre lated with the use of prescribed or self-medicated ant iallergics (positive associatio n) and contraceptives (negative association). The use of antibiotics, methylphenidate , and drugs for thyroid therapy was associated with lower parental income. Conclusion : The use of over-the-counter drugs in 15-year-old children fro m the GINI- plus birth cohort is very common and is predicted by socioecono mic factors such as maternal education. This has to be considered by health care ma nagers when deciding about the exclusion of over-the-counter drugs (normally used fo r self-medication) from reimbursement or the deregulation of drug sales. Key words Germany Adolescent Drug utiliz ation Self-medication Pre scription drugs Socioeconomic factors Pharmacoepidemiology 103 Introduction Drug use among adolescent children may be influenced by various factors. Normally, their physicians decide on those drugs available on prescriptio n only, whereas self- medication may depend not just on parental decisions but also o n the children's own attitude as, e.g. 15-year-old children may begin to purchase dr ugs on their own initia- tive. By law, 15-year-old adolescents are still underage childr en, but with respect to the reimbursement of over-the-counter drugs (OTC), German Health Le gislation practically treats them as adults, as OTC drugs are usually reimbursed for children up to the age of 12 years only [1]. With regard to the safe use of drugs, many a spects have to be consid- ered, such as side-effects, pharm acological interactions, but a lso undersupply or over- supply of drugs in different population strata. To our knowledg e, the data on the preva- lence and socioeconomic predicto rs of paediatric drug utilizati on in Germany are com- paratively rare, especially with regard to self-medication. A s tudy that investigated drug utilization among German children aged 14-17 years [2] reported a 1-week prevalence of 50.7% (prescription drugs and self-medication drugs together ). Another publication based on the same data source found that 25.2% of children aged 17 years had used self-medication drugs during the past 7 days, and self-medicati on accounted for 38.5% of the total medicine use [3]. Two further studies looking at b oth prescription drugs and self-medication reported a 4-mon th prevalence of 70% among chil dren aged 5-7 years [4] and a 4-week prevalence of 42.3% among 10-year-old children [ 5 ] . A g e - s t r a t i f i e d data on prescription drug use is also provided by health insura nce companies [6,7]. According to the available studies, the paediatric use of drugs may be very common in Germany. Surveillance of the pre valence of drug utilization amo ng adolescent children and the determinants of use are relevant Public Health issues, particularly in relation to those drugs taken by children wi thout their phy sicians' knowled ge. The aim of this paper is to analyse drug utilization among ado lescents from the German Infant study on the Influence of Nutrition Intervention plus environmental and genetic influences on allergy development (GINIplus), based on data from the recently completed 15-year follow-up. A f urther objective of this study is the comparison of prescription drugs with OTC drugs, predominantly used for self- medication, and analy- sis of the utilization patterns of the most mentioned drug cate gories addressing both prescription and self-medication drugs. 104 Methods Study population and data collection The GINIplus study is based on a German birth cohort [5,8,9] th at start ed with 5, 99 1 healthy full-term newborns. The c hildren were recruited between September 1995 and June 1998 from obstetric clinics in an urban region of Southern Germany (Munich) and a comparatively rural region i n Western Germany (Wesel). For the 15-year follow-up, exact ly 3,895 participants were con tacted between Jan- uary 2011 and September 2013. The assessment was distributed al most evenly over the seasons. Among other things, the main questionnaire assessed th e children's gender, parental income and education, and consultation with physicians from various medical specialities during the last year. In addition to the main questionnaire, a self-administered que stionnaire on con- sumption of drugs and medicinal products was included based on a slightly modified questionnaire that had already been used for the 10-year follow -up [5]. The children's parents/legal guardians were asked to report all drugs' names t heir child used in the previous 4 weeks or to enclose the empty drug packages with a s elf-addressed enve- lope. The precise number of drugs used was assessed with an add itional question in case the limited number (five) of designated spaces would not s uffice to enter all drug names. In addition, the particip ants were also invited to repor t the pharmaceutical identification number (PZN) of the drugs used. The PZN is print ed on the drug package and precisely identifies the drug utilized with regard to the s i z e o f t h e p a c k a g e , t h e dosage, etc. Those drugs available on prescription only were defined as pre scription drugs (Rx). All medicinal products available without medical prescription ( which may be sold by a pharmacist and also those that may be sold in any shop) were de fined as OTC drugs. Allocation of the drugs subdivid ed into prescription drugs and OTC drugs was per- f o r m e d a c c o r d i n g t o t h e G e r m a n O r d i n a n c e o n P r e s c r i p t i o n - O n l y M edicinal Products [10]. If available, the respective codes from the anatomical th erapeutic chemical classi- fication (ATC) were assigne d to the drugs [11,12]. Outcome definition and statistical analysis The participants who reported utilization of at least one presc ription drug during the past 4 weeks were defined as 'Rx users' and those taking at lea st one OTC drug as 'OTC users', respectively. 'Overall us ers' took at least one drug of any type. Based on the ATC classification, the most mentioned drugs were grouped, and the following therapeutic 105 categories were defined for the analysis of those children usin g at least one drug from the defined categories: Antiinflammatory drugs: ATC M01 A n a l g e s i c s : A T C N02 C o n t r a c e p t i v e s : A T C G03A , G03HB01 , G02BB01 Drugs for obstructive airway diseases ( ' a n t i a s t h m a t i c s ' ) : A T C R03 A n t i a l l e r g i c s (systemic, nasal, M e t h y l p h e n i d a t e : A T C N06BA04 A n t i b i o t i c s : A T C J01 Thyroid therapy: ATC H03 The statistical analysis was perf ormed using the SAS software p ackage (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA, version 9.3). Interaction between the inde pendent variables (gen- der, study area, maternal educat ion, and parental income) was c hecked using Pearson correlation coefficients. Bivariate associations were tested wi th Pearson Chi2 test. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtai ned from a multivariate logistic regression model (signi ficance level: p<0.05). Mothers rather than fathers may decide on the (self-) medication of their children. Hence, for the definition of educa- tional status, the mothers' educational background was classifi ed into four levels based on their highest school degree: Level 1: secondary school Level 2: junior high school Level 3: baccalaureate (= qualif ication for university entranc e) Level 4: university degree Mothers who did not report any school degree at all (n=5) were allocated to education level 1. Entries for mothers (n=4) reporting another (but not f urther specified) kind of school degree than those listed above were treated as missing v alues for educational status. Income status was classified following the median equiv alent income (MEI) for 2012 (\u20ac1,633 net/month) [13] where the household members were w eighted according t o t h e n e w s c a l e o f t h e O r g a n i s a t i o n f o r E c o n o m i c C o - o p e r a t i o n and Development ( O E C D ) [ 1 4 ] . T h e i n c o m e c u t - o f f s w e r e c h o s e n i n a c c o r d a n c e w i t h the definition of poverty (60% of MEI) [15]. The GINIplus cohort received approval from the ethics committe e of the Bavarian Medical Council and the Medical Council of North Rhine-Westphal ia. Additionally, writ- 106 ten informed consent was provided by the participants' parents or legal guardians and by participants. Results Study population and prevalence of drug use From the 3,895 distributed quest ionnaires, precisely 3,013 were c o m p l e t e d a n d r e - turned (response rate: 77.4%). T he children's average age was 1 5.1 years (range: 14.5- 16.8 years). The questionnaires were completed mainly by the mo thers (85.5%). In all, 41.0% (n=1,234) of the children used at least one drug within t he defined recall period of 4 weeks. The number of reported drugs amounted to 2,489. The majority (44.3%) of the 1,234 drug users took one medicinal product only. Neverthel ess, 29.7% used two drugs, 13.5% took three drugs, and 12.5% took four or more drug s (up to nine drugs in one case) within a period of 4 weeks. About 28% of the reported drugs were available on prescription only, whereas 69% of the drugs utilized were OT C drugs (Figure 1). Exactly 74 drugs (3%) were narcotics available by specific narc otic prescription forms only (one with ATC N02AA01 containing morphine, and 73 with ATC N06BA04 contain- ing methylphenidate for the treatment of attention deficit (and hyperactivity) disorder). Figure 1. Proportion of over-the-counter drugs (OTC) and presc ription drugs (Rx) in all drugs utilized (data availa ble for n=2,446 drugs) 107 The 4-week prevalence (95% CI) o f prescription drug use (n=514 Rx users) was 17.1% (15.7-18.4), and 31.6% (30.0-33.3) of the children (n=952) used O T C d r u g s . T h e d e - tailed composition of the cohort and the stratified prevalence rates of drug utilization are displayed in Table 1, which also includes the children's co nsultation with a physician of any medical speciality within the last year.

Maternal education background had a strong positive influence on the use of an- tiallergics (e.g. university degr ee vs. secondary school: OR=2. 81) and a clearly negative impact on the use of contraceptives (e.g. junior high school vs . secondary school: OR=0.40). A higher parental income (>100% of MEI vs. 60% of MEI) was in versely associated with the use of methylphenidate (OR=0.41), antibiotics (OR=0.46 ), and drugs for thyroid therapy (OR=0.34). The four variables included in the logistic regression model did not predict the use of antiasthmatics (ATC R03) , c o u g h a n d c o l d p r e p a r a t i o n s ( A T C R05), mucolytics (ATC (ATC R01AA ), four further therapeutic (sub)groups that were among the most mentioned therapeutic groups. Discussion The findings of this study indic ate that the 4-week prevalence of drug use, both Rx (17.1%) and OTC drug use (31.6%), among 15-year-old children fr om the present cohort is quite high. The majority (69%) of the drugs utilized were OT C drugs, many of them presumably bought out-of-pocket without medical prescription. M oreover, the results imply that gender, study area, and socioeconomic variables such as maternal education and parental income significantly predict the use of OTC drugs or the utilization of spe- cific therapeutic categories. Co mpared with the prevalence rate s of the 10-year follow- up, 10-year-old children used more OTC (35.6%) and fewer Rx (15 .3%) drugs [5], which may be explained by the fact that, owing to the 2004 German hea lth act OTC drugs are not normally reimbursed by statu tory health insurance for child ren older than 12 years. Another German study [2] reported a 7-day prevalence for overa ll drug use (Rx and OTC drugs together, age stratum 14-17 years) of 50.7%, which wa s even higher than in our study (41.0%), a nd 58% of the drugs utilized were prescribe d by a physician. The same data source yielded a 1-week prevalence of OTC drug use of 25.2% for all children aged 17 years (and slightly higher for children between 14-17 years), which is roughly in line with our results consider ing the shorter recall period [3]. A smaller study with German adolescents (15-17 years) found a 2-week prevalence of 5 7% for drug use [16]. The regional differences in consultation with physicians may pa rtly be explained by the higher physician density in Munich because an increased supply with services/products may generally result in an increased demand [17].

On the European scale, prevalence rates for OTC drug u se during childhood or adolescence were reported with 17-39% (use within the last 2 d a y s ) f o r F i n l a n d [18,19], with 35% (2-week prevalence) for the (1-year preva- lence) for Sweden [21]. Prescription drugs were found to be uti lized by 15% of the Finn- ish children within an observation period of 2 days [18]. In De nmark, Italy, and the Netherlands, 38-57% of the adolescents used at least one prescr iption drug during the last year [22-26]. In Spain [27], 31.6% of the children older t han 10 years took a medic- i n a l p r o d u c t ( R x a n d O T C d r u g s t o g e t h e r ) w i t h i n a p e r i o d o f 2 w e e k s , w h i c h i s q u i t e similar to the corresponding prevalence in our study (41%) cons idering use within the last 4 weeks. Overall, the data on the socioeconomic predictors of paediatri c drug u se are lim- ited. Du and Knopf [3] found a positive association of self-med ication with maternal education (in accordance with our findings) and parental income (in contrast to our results). In a study that analys ed the use of specific drug cat egories among Danish ado- lescents, higher socio economic status predicted higher use of e .g. drugs for treating headache or nervousness [28]. As in our study, a Dutch study fo und a positive associa- tion of socioeconomic status wit h adolescents' use of OTC drugs only and no associa- tion with prescription drugs [20], whereas in a Finnish study ( children <12 years), OTC drug use or Rx use was not associated with parental education o r income [19]. Efficient drugs with a benefit for the patients, regardless of whether they are Rx or OTC drugs, are valuable products, and their affordability/acces sibility or proper use should not depend on the patient s' socioeconomic status. Just r ecently, the European Commission has confirmed the particular status of medicinal pro ducts by leaving the responsibility for medicines in the hands of the Health Commiss ioner rather than mov- ing it to the Directorate-General for Industry and Entrepreneur ship [29,30]. However, as soon as drugs are sw itched to non-prescription sta tus, they are subject to free pricing and advertising. Moreover, to a large extent, t he patients' health literacy influences the appropriate use of drugs, emphasizing the role o f pharmacists and the importance of pharmaceutical advice when dispensing OTC drugs. In Germany, compe- tition has meant that OTC drugs such as analgesics are partly a vailable at prices lower than one euro. Low prices may to some extent explain the high p revalence of, e.g. anal- gesic drug use among adolescents found in Germany [2,3] and oth er European coun- tries [21,31-33]. In Norway (and elsewhere in Europe, but not i n Germany), OTC drugs such as analgesics are partly sol d outside pharmacies [34]. Int erestingly, a Norwegian study [33] conducted in 2007 (in Norway, since 2003, analgesics have been freely avail- able outside pharmacies) found a much higher 4-week prevalence of OTC analgesics use (61% vs. 39%) among 15- to 16-year-old teenagers than a Nor w e g i a n s t u d y [ 3 2 ] conducted just 5 years before. Presumably, the facilitated acce ss may have contributed 114 to the increase in analgesic use among teenagers and may also l ead to higher consump- tion of analgesics in adulthood [35]. Apparently, socioeconomic factors predict the use of OTC drugs among adolescents stronger than utilization of prescription drugs, and OTC drugs account for the majority of drugs utilized. With the 2004 German Health act, the reimbur sement of OTC drugs was restricted substantially for patients older than 12 years. Since 2012 [36], OTC drugs sold by pharmacies may again be covered (with restrictions) by a limited number of German statutory health insurance companies [37]. The OTC marke t is a relevant eco- nomic market (for 2011, estimated to be worth 3 billion euros [ 38] in Germany and 27 billion euros in the European Union [39]) and accounts for r oughly 50% of all drugs utilized in Europe [38,39]. Curre ntly, a discussion is going on as to whether OTC drugs should generally be reimbursed b y statutory health insurance co mpanies, at least for children (up to 18 years) and for those older than 65 years [40 ,41]. In the context of reimbursement of OTC drugs or the deregulati on of OTC sales making them available outside pharmacies, decision makers from the various stake- holder groups should consider not only the economic aspects (e. g . t h e p o t e n t i a l f o r savings of financial resources, the acquisition of new health i nsurance members, the increase in OTC sales in the sta gnating OTC market [38,41,42], etc.), but also the impact of socioeconomic variables on drug use and the subsequent under supply or oversupply of medicinal products in s pecific population strata. This study shows strengths and limitations as well. The drug c lassification was care- fully performed by a health professional. With regard to minimi zation of the seasonal impact, the data collection was distributed almost evenly over the year. Moreover, the relatively short observation period of 4 weeks may have minimiz ed recall bias. On the other hand, underreporting may be possible for some specific dr ug categories (e.g. contraceptives). Owing to the disproportionate number of dropou ts from the lower socioeconomic levels since the beg inning of the study, this coh ort does not exactly reflect the mean socioeconomic status of the German population. The distribution of the education and income levels differed between Munich and Wes el, and the magni- tude of the variables' predicting effect may vary between the t wo included study areas. Furthermore, we were not able to rule out non-response bias, as o n l y 5 0 . 3 % o f t h e children recruited at the start of the GINIplus study responded to the questionnaire at the 15-year follow-up. The questionnaire did not explicitly assess whether the report ed drugs were pre- scribed or recommended by a physician or bought over the counte r without medical prescription. Despite the fact that OTC drugs are usually not r eimbursed by the statu- tory health insurance agencies, some OTC drugs that were not re imbursed may never- theless have been prescribed by t he children's physician as a m edical recommendation only (the proportion of prescribed OTC drugs in all OTC drugs s old may be estimated at 115 1 7 % f o r G e r m a n y [ 4 2 ] ) . N o i n f o r m a t i o n w a s a v a i l a b l e o n t h e p r o p ortion of privately insured children among all participants (with regard to reimbur sement for OTC drugs, private health insurance companies may have fewer restrictions than statutory health insurance companies). However, p rivately insured individuals in Germany only account for about 13% of all insured people, but this proportion may be slightly higher in the present sample [43]. Owing to the specific regulatio ns for prescription-only medici nes, the prescription status is not only defined by th e active ingredient and its dos e, but may also depend on the specified indication (e.g. ibuprofen 400 mg, acetylcystein e). Hence, for 76 drug entries with ambiguous information the prescription status was conservatively as- sumed, and the respective drugs were allocated to OTC drugs. Ho wever, a sensitivity analysis yielded no substantial differences relating to the pre dictors of use for either OTC or Rx drugs. Finally, other socioeconomic variables that we re not analysed in this study may also predict drug use (e.g. migration background). Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest. KEY POINTS Overall, the 4-week prevalence of drug use among 15-year-old children from the GINIplus birth cohort was high (41%), and more than two thirds of the drugs uti- lized were over-the-counter drugs. Parental income did not predict the use of over-the-counter d rugs or prescription drugs among adolescent children, whereas a higher maternal educ ation level was positively associated with the utilization of over-the-counter drugs. Socioeconomic factors such as maternal education or parental income have an impact on the use of various specific drug categories, e.g. ana lgesics, antiallergics, contraceptives, methylphenidate. Health care managers should also consider the impact of socio economic variables on drug utilization when deciding on the exclusion of (over-the -counter) drugs from reimbursement by statutory health insurance companies or t he liberalization of drug sales. 116 Acknowledgements We thank the families for particip ation in the study, the obste t r i c u n i t s f o r a l l o w i n g recruitment, the GINIplus study team for excellent work, and se veral funding agencies listed herein.

Eur J Clin Pharmacol 2016;72:301-310. doi:10.1007/s00228-015-19 77-x 122 Abstract Purpose : The purpose of this study was to compare longitudinal data on drug utilization between 10-year-old children and 15-year-old adolescents and to analyse the associa- tion of drug use at the age of 15 years with drug use at the ag e of 10 years. Methods : Based on the German GINIplus (German infant study on the Infl uence of Nutrition Intervention plus environmental and genetic influence s on allergy develop- ment) and LISAplus (Influence of lifestyle factors on the immun e system and allergies in East and West Germany plus the influence of traffic emissions a nd genetics) birth co- horts, data on drug utilization (past 4 weeks) were collected u sing a self-administered questionnaire for 3,642 childre n (10-year follow-up) and 4,677 adolescents (15-year follow-up). The drugs were classified by therapeutic categories (conventional drugs, homeopathic drugs, etc.) and by codes according to the anatomic al therapeutic chemi- cal (ATC) classification system. Associations of adolescents' d rug use with gender, study a r e a , m a t e r n a l e d u c a t i o n , p a r e n t a l i n c o m e , p r e s e n c e o f c h r o n i c conditions, and prior drug use at the age of 10 years were analysed u sing a logistic regression model. Results : The 4-week prevalence rates of overall drug use were similar for adolescents (41.1%) and children (42.3%). How ever, adolescents used noticea bly more anti- inflammatory drugs, analgesics, and systemic antihistamines. actly 3,194 dren/adolescents participated in both follow-ups. Adolescents' use of anti- inflammatory drugs was predicted (OR=3.37) by use of anti-infla mmatory drugs as a child. In summary, the strongest predictor of adolescents' use of specific therapeutic categories or ATC groups was the previous use of the same thera peutic drug category or ATC group as a 10-year-old child. Conclusions : Despite similar prevalence rates of overall drug utilization among both age groups, there is a noticeable difference concerning the use of drugs from specific ATC groups. Drug use as a child may partly determine what they use as an adolescent. Key words Adolescent Child Drug utilization Longitudinal study An ti-inflammatory drugs Germany 123 Introduction Pharmaceutical products play an important role in the health sy stem, both from the medical point of view as well as in economic terms. In Germany, the turnover in medic- inal products (prescription drug s and self-medicated drugs toge ther) amounted to about 34 billion euros in 2013 [1]. At about 30 billion euros, expenditures on medicinal products accounted for about 16% of the total expenditures cove red by the German statutory health insurance companies. They ranked third among t heir expenditure items in 2013 [1], only exceeded by costs of hospital treatment s (65 billion euros) and medical expenses (32 billion euros). According to available pub lications, the prevalence of drug use is generally quite high among adolescents in German y and other European countries as well. In Germany, a 1-week prevalence for overall drug use (prescription drugs and self-medicated drugs together) of 50.7% was reported for adolescents aged 14-17 years [2]. Another German study that included both prescr iption drugs and self- medicated drugs found that 41% of 15-year-old adolescents used a t l e a s t o n e d r u g w i t h i n a n o b s e r v a t i o n p e r i o d o f 4 w e e k s [ 3 ] . A S p a n i s h s t u d y y i elded similar results, with 31.6% of children older than 10 years using prescription d rugs or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs during the last 2 weeks prior to the assessment [4] . In other studies from Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands that analysed prescription drug use only, the 1-year prevalence ranged between 38 and 57% [5-9]. Moreover, th e share of self- medicated drugs among all drugs used by adolescents may be cons iderable (e.g. re- p o r t e d a t 6 9 % a m o n g 1 5 - y e a r - o l d a d o l e s c e n t s a n d 3 8 . 5 % a m o n g c h i ldren aged 0-17 years, respectively, from two German studies [2,10]). Further E uropean studies yielded prevalence rates for OTC drug or self-medicated drug use during childhood or adoles- cence of 17-39% (use within the last 2 days) in Finland [11,12] , about 35% (2-week prevalence) in the Netherlands and 67% (1-year prevalence ) in Sweden [14]. The evidently high prevalence o f (self-medicated) drug use amo n g t h e g e n e r a l adolescent population raises so me public health questions, e.g. whether all of the drugs taken are medically advisable and appropriate, or whether some self-medicated drugs such as analgesics are considered by adolescents to be ordinary commodities that may become part of everyday life over time. The aim of this study is to analyse drug utilization longitudi nally among children from two German birth cohorts by comparing drug use at two defi ned time points (at the age of 10 years and 15 years, respectively). A further obje ctive of this study was to detect whether there was an association of drug use at the age of 15 years with prior drug use at the age of 10 years. 124 Methods Study population The GINIplus study (German infant study on the Influence of Nut rition Intervention plus environmental and genetic influences on allergy development) an d the LISAplus study (Influence of lifestyle factors on the immune system and allerg ies in East and West Germany plus the influence of traffic emissions and genetics) a re based on two German birth cohorts [15,16] that started with 5,991 (GINIplus) and 3, 097 (LISAplus) healthy full-term newborns who were recruited between September 1995 an d January 1999 from obstetric clinics in four Ge rman regions (Munich, Leipzig, Bad Honnef, Wesel). The recruitments sites were chosen to achieve an almost heterogeneo us sample with re- gard to geographic region (South Munich; of urbanization (urban a reas: Munich and Leipzig; comparatively rural areas: Bad Honnef and Wesel). From both studies, non- term children and children of less than 2,500 g birth weight we re excluded. Children with non-German parents or parents born outside Germany were no t enrolled for the LISAplus study. Additionally, participants with insufficient Ge rman language skills were not eligible for both cohorts. Data collection For the 15-year follow-up, exactly 6,094 participants' parents or le gal guardians wer e contacted between January 2011 and October 2014. Socioeconomic variables such as parental education and income were collected with the main ques tionnaire, which also assessed the participants' gender. Additionally, a separate sel f-administered question- naire on drug utilization within the past 4 weeks assessed vari ous details on the drugs that had been used by the adolescents within the past 4 weeks. The participants were asked to enter the drug names and the pharmaceutical identifica tion numbers (PZN) into five designated spaces or to enclose the empty drug packag es in a self-addressed envelope. The PZN, which is printed on the drug package, exactl y identifies the drugs with respect to package size, dos age, manufacturer, listed pric e, etc. In case the limited number of designated spaces was not sufficient to enter all dru gs, the participants were invited to separately note the precise number of drugs used. An almost similar meth- odology was adopted for the 10-year follow-up, in which 6,541 p arents/legal guardians had been contacted between October 2006 and October 2009. Exact ly 3,194 subjects participated in the 10-year follow-up and the 15-year follow-up as well. 125 Drug classification According to the German Medicines Act, homeopathic, anthroposop hic, and herbal products are defined as medicinal products as well. Therefore, all reported drugs were considered for analysis and were classified into several therap eutic modalities such as conventional drugs with chemical active pharmaceutical ingredie nts, homeopathic drugs, and herbal drugs. The exact definition of the various th erapeutic modalities has been described in detail in a p reviously published study [17]. If available, codes were assigned to the drugs according t o the anatomical therapeutic c hemical (ATC) classifica- tion system [18,19]. Outcome definition and statistical analysis Participants who reported use of at least one drug from any the rapeutic category within the past 4 weeks were cla ssified as 'overall drug users' . Those participants taking one or more drugs from a specific drug category (e.g. homeopath ic drugs) or ATC group (e.g. ATC N02 for 'analgesics') were classified as users of the respective d rug category (e.g. 'homeopathy users') or ATC group (e.g. 'analgesic users') . For analysis, the statistical sof tware package SAS was used (S AS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA, version 9.3). Bivariate associations were tested with the Pearson chi2 t e s t (p<0.05). Interaction between the independent variables was che cked using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confi dence intervals (CI) were obtained from a multivariate l ogistic regression model that inc luded several independ- ent variables (study area, child's gender, maternal education, parental income, pres- ence of a child's chronic disease, previous use of the same def ined drug categories or ATC groups at the age of 10 years). In addition, for all models , a stepwise backward elimination procedure was performed at a significance level for r e m o v a l f r o m t h e model with p0.05. Associations with p<0.05 were considered to be significant. Moth- ers rather than fathers may decide on the (self-) medication of their children. Thus, for the definition of educational status, the mothers' educational background was used. To account for differences in school systems between West and East G e r m a n y b e f o r e reunification in 1990, maternal education was classified into t hree levels based on the mothers' maximum completed years of schooling: Level 1: low education level (<10 years) Level 2: medium education level (exactly 10 years) Level 3: high education level (>10 years) 126 Mothers who did not report any school degree at all (n=26) were allocated to the low education level. Entries for mothers (n=14) reporting another ( but not further specified) kind of school degree than those listed above were treated as m issing values for educa- tional status. Income status was classified following the median equivalent i ncome (MEI) for 2012 (\u20ac1,633 net/month for the 15-year for the 10-year follow-up) [20,21], where the household members wer e weighted accord- ing to the new scale of the Organisation for Economic Co-operat ion and Development (OECD) [22]. Three income levels were defined: low (60% of MEI ), medium (60-100% of MEI), and high (>100% of MEI). The income cut-offs correspon d to the definition of poverty (60% of MEI) [23]. To take into account also the impact of chronic disorders on d rug use, adolescents were defined as chronically ill if the participants reported th e diagnosis of a chronic disease by a physician during the pre cedin g 5 years. T he follow ing chronic conditions (physician diagnosed) were considered: hay fever, perennial all ergic rhinitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and a sthma. Additionally, also furt her self-reported chronic conditions such as diabetes and celiac disease were considered. The GINIplus and LISAplus cohorts obtained approval from the e thics committees of the Bavarian Medical Council, the University of Leipzig, and the Medical Council of North Rhine-Westphalia. Furtherm ore, written informed consent w a s g i v e n b y t h e participants' parents or legal guardians and by participants. Results The questionnaires on drug utiliz ation were completed for 3,642 children at the 10-year follow-up (response rate: 55.7%) and 4,677 adolescents at the 1 5 - y e a r f o l l o w - u p ( r e - sponse rate: 76.8%). Compared with baseline, both samples showe d no variation with regard to gender (p=0.9936 (10-year follow-up); p=0.4437 (15-ye ar follow-up)), while the composition differed significantly with regard to study are a (p<0.0001 (10-year follow-up); p=0.0023 (15-year follow-up)) and maternal educatio n (both samples at p<0.0001). The differences between the samples in the 10-year f ollow-up and the 15- year follow-up were not significant with regard to gender (p=0. 5375) and maternal education (p=0.3696), whereas both samples varied significantly (p<0.0001) with regard to study area and household income. The detailed composition of the cohorts over time is displayed in Table 1. The total number of reported drugs amo unted to 3,215 drugs in the 10-year follow-up and 3,873 drugs in the 15-year follow-up. In summary, there was no statist ically significant difference (p=0.2555) with regard to the prevalence rates of overa ll drug use between 15-year-old About 71% of 127 the drugs used by adolescents were OTC drugs (29% were prescrip t i o n d r u g s ) . T h e corresponding figures for 10-year-old children were 75% (OTC dr ugs) and 25% (pre- scription drugs). Compared with 10-year-old children, 15-year-o ld adolescents used fewer homeopathic and herbal drugs, whereas they took more conv entional drugs containing chemical active ingredients (Supplementary Figure S1 ) . T h e r e s p e c t i v e prevalence rates of use differed significantly between both age groups at p<0.0001 (homeopathy use), p<0.0001 (use of herbal drugs), and p=0.0006 (use of conventional drugs). Overall, adolescents took fewer OTC drugs than children (p=0.0077). Table 1.

Additionally, there was no gender difference with regard to the use of anti- inflammatory drugs or analgesics among 10-year-old children, wh ereas girls used anti-inf lammatory drugs or analgesics t han 15-year-old boys (Figure 2).

Adoles- cents were more than twice as likely (OR=2.25; 95% CI: 1.94-2.6 1 ) t o b e a n ' o v e r a l l drug user' if they had already been an 'overall drug user' at t he age of 10 years. With regard to the use of the various drug categories (Table 3), the likelihood of being a drug user of the same drug category at the age of 10 years and as an adolescent as well was highest for homeopathic drugs (OR=3.82; 95% CI: 2.91-5.00). The independent variables for previous use of conventional dru gs, homeopathy, and herbal drugs, as displayed in Table 3, remained in the mode ls after performing a backward elimination procedure. The longitudinal association of drug use was also given for various ATC groups. Table 4 shows the odds ratios of drug utilization from the most common ATC groups (except ATC group G03, where no use was reported among 10-year-old children), derived from the final multivariate logi stic regression model with backward elimination. In most instances, the strongest predictor of adolescents' dru g use was the previ- ous use of drugs from the same ATC group at the age of 10 years . For example, adoles- cents used significantly 1.67-8.38), if they had used drugs from the same ATC group 5 years before. 131 Table 3.

A detailed table that also contains t he 95% CI of the ORs shown in Table 4 is available as supplementary material to this artic le (Supplementary Table S2). Discussion The findings of this study reveal ed that the prevalence of over all drug use was almost at the same level when comparing 15-year-old adolescents with 10-y ear-old children. At the same time, there was a not iceable difference in drug utiliz ation with regard to spe- cific ATC groups, e.g. a signifi cantly higher anti-infla mmatory drugs (ATC M01 among 15-year-old adolescents. The gender difference among 15-y ear-old adolescents may presumably in part result from the fact that female adolesc ents use e.g. ibuprofen for period pains. A high paediatric use of anti-inflammatory dr ugs or analgesics was also found in other European studies [2,10,14,24-26]. Generally, the h i g h p r e v a l e n c e o f drug use raises the question of whether all the drugs used by a dolescents were really medically necessary or advisable, not least in view of the fact that medicinal products such as anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, or antihistamines can also have severe side-effects [27-29]. Another finding of this study was that adolescents used f ewer homeopathic drugs and herbal drugs. Other studies analysing herbal drug use only [30] or various comple- mentary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities [31] also fou n d lo wer prevalenc e rates for herbal drugs or homeopathy. This may be explained in part by the fact that OTC drugs (almost all homeopathic and herbal drugs were OTC dru gs) are not normally reimbursed by German statutory in surance companies for children older than 12 years [32], but a lower acceptance of homeopathy or phytotherapy migh t also be a reason for the lower prevalence rates found for adolescents, as adolescent s may begin to take their own decisions on self-medication with drugs. Moreover, th e perception that ho- meopathic or herbal drugs are supposedly gentle remedies (one p ossible reason for their high use among children) m ay decrease or may play a less important role during transition to adolescence. A further striking outcome was that adolescents' drug use from a specific ATC group was strongly predicted by the previou s use of a drug from the same ATC group. This could have been expected for drugs that ar e used for the treat- Table 4.

On the other hand, this is a remarkable result for medicinal products (prescribed drugs as well as self-medicated drugs) that are suppos- edly used predominantly to treat an acute condition such as ant ibiotics, anti- inflammatory drugs, or analgesic s. With regard to analgesics, a nother study [33] yielded a similar result, finding a strong association between headache medicine use at the age of 27 years and prior use of headache medicine at the age of 15 years or 19 years. An additional aspect that has t o be considered is the differen ce between both age groups with regard to the propor tion of prescribed drugs. While most (64%) of the drugs used by 10-year-old children were prescribed by a physici an (only 36% were pur- chased on the participants' own initiative), the share of presc ribed drugs may be much lower among adolescents (this proportion was not directly asses s e d i n t h e 1 5 - y e a r follow-up, but may be estimated at somewhat higher than 30%, as exactly 29% were prescription drugs and presumably only a few of the reported OT C drugs used by ado- lescents may have been prescribed or recommended by a physician [32]). This high share of OTC drugs emphasizes the importance of personal health literacy and the role of advice from a physician or a pharmacist with regard to adole scents' self-medication with drugs. This study has strengths and limitations as well. The data are based on the recently completed follow-ups of two larg e German birth cohorts. The dat a collection for the 15- year follow-up was performed almost evenly over the four season s, with slight peaks in April and June, whereas data for the 10-year follow-up were col lected mainly in the a u t u m n ( 5 4 % ) . N e v e r t h e l e s s , t h e p r e v a l e n c e r a t e f o r o v e r a l l d r u g use in the autumn was roughly at the same level as for all four seasons together (it was highest in spring and winter and lowest in summer). The difference between the di stributions of data assessment over the year may also partly explain the different prevalence rates of use o f s e a s o n a l l y s e n s i t i v e A T C - g r o u p s ( e . g . c o u g h a n d c o l d r e m e d i e s, anti-allergy). Addi- tionally, the different composition of both cohorts with regard t o s t u d y a r e a a n d household income may also have contributed to the different pre valence rates of drug use between both age groups. Moreover, other socioeconomic vari ables may also pre- dict paediatric drug use, but could not be analysed in this stu dy because of lacking availability (e.g. migration back ground). To our knowledge, the number of studies that analysed longitudinal data on pa ediatric drug use is very limit ed. Owing to the relatively short observation period of 4 weeks, the recall bias may have b een minimized. On the other hand, underreporting may be likely for some types of drug s (e.g. contraceptives). Furthermore, categorization by the main ATC groups is relativel y rough, as some ATC groups such as R05 include various types of chemical active ingredients. On the o ther hand, similar associations with prior drug use were found for v ery narrowly defined ATC groups as well. Defined daily doses could provide further impor tant data for the com- 135 parison of drug use between both age groups, but were not consi dered in this study because for many of the reported drugs (e.g., homeopathic drugs or drug entries with an unclear package size) no defi ned daily doses were available. In sum, both studies cannot be considered as being representat ive for the total G e r m a n p o p u l a t i o n d u e t o a r b i t r a r i l y s e l e c t i o n o f t h e f o u r s t u d y areas, the exclusion criteria at baseline, and the selective follow-up. Therefore, t he results can be projected to the general German adolescent population to a limited extent only, as the present cohort may not exactly reflect the German mean, e.g. with regar d to maternal educa- tion level, parental income, or the adolescents' general health status. Conclusions Apparently, adolescents' drug utilization depends partly on the ir drug use as children and may also determine what they will use in adulthood. It shou ld be kept in mind that drugs are special products and not simple commodities. They sho uld be utilized accord- ing to need and not following habitual patterns only. In Europe , OTC drugs are also gradually becoming available out side pharmacies [34,35] and are often subject to free advertising. It remains a difficult balancing act between free availability of medicinal products, adequate drug prices, and the appropriate use of self -medicated drugs. Over- a l l , a go o d a d v i ce o n t h e s a f e u s e o f s e l f - m e d i ca t i o n d r u gs m i g ht best be ensured by pharmacies [36,37] rather than non-medical sales points such as supermarkets or pet- rol stations.

Das Gesundheitswesen [submitted 15 April 2016] 146 Abstract Purpose : This study's objective was to analyse the prices of over-the- counter (OTC) d r u g s u s e d b y a d o l e s c e n t s i n G e r m a n y a n d t h e i r a s s o c i a t i o n w i t h socioeconomic fac- tors. Methods : Based on the German GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts, data on drug utili- zation among 15-year-old adolescents (n=4,677) were collected u sing a self- administered questionnaire. The reported drugs were subdivided into prescription drugs and OTC drugs. Prices of OTC drugs were tracked by the ph armaceutical identifi- cation numbers. Results : Overall, 1,499 OTC drugs with clearly identifiable prices wer e eligible for analy- sis. Their mean price was \u20ac9.75 [ 95% CI: \u20ac9.27-10. 22]. About 75 % of the OTC drugs cost less than \u20ac10. Higher mean prices were associated with residing in Munich (\u20ac10.74; 95% CI: \u20ac9.97-11.52), with \u20ac10.17; 95% CI: \u20ac9.47-10.86), and with higher highest income group: \u20ac10.24; 95% CI: \u20ac9.34-11.14). Conclusions : The price of \u20ac10 for OTC drugs that have to be paid for out o f pocket may represent a psychological threshold. Higher prices could discou rage especially adoles- cents from a lower socioeconomic background from taking medical ly advisable but not reimbursable OTC drugs. Key words Adolescent Dru g utilization Drug price s Socioeconomic fac tors Over-the-counter drugs 147 Introduction In Germany, drugs available with out a physician's prescription are not normally covered by statutory health insurance fo r c h i l d r e n a g e d 1 2 y e a r s . A s i n Germany, over-the- counter (OTC) drugs are not reimbursed in many other European c ountries as well [1]. However, the prevalence of paediatric utilization of OTC drugs has been found to be significantly associated with soc i o e c o n o m i c f a c t o r s s u c h a s m a t ernal education [2,3]. Many OTC drugs are useful, but socioeconomic barriers might res ult in adolescents not taking medically advisable (espec ially higher priced) OTC drugs in case of illness if they have to be paid for out of pocket. To our knowledge, there are no data on how socioeconomic facto rs are correlated w i t h t h e p r i c e s o f O T C d r u g s u s e d b y a d o l e s c e n t s i n G e r m a n y . T h erefore, the main objective of this study is to analyse whether there was an asso ciation between drug prices and socioeconomic factors with regard to OTC drugs used by 15-year-old adoles- cents from the German GINIplus/LISAplus birth cohorts. Methods The GINIplus/LISAplus studies are based on two German birth coh orts that started with 5,991 (GINIplus) and 3,097 (LISAplus) healthy full-term newborn s who were recruited between September 1995 and Janu ary 1999 from obstetric clinics in the southern (Mu- nich), eastern (Leipzig), and north-western (Bad Honnef and Wes el) parts of Germany. F o r t h e 1 5 - ye a r f o l l o w - u p , s o m e 6,094 participants' parents/le gal guardians were contacted between January 2011 and October 2014. Using a self-a dministered ques- tionnaire on drug utilization within the past 4 weeks, the part icipants were asked to enter the drug names and the pharm aceutical identification numb ers (PZNs) into five designated spaces. The PZN is used for almost all products sold by German pharmacies. It is printed on the drug package and precisely identifies the drugs with respect to package size, dosage, manufacture r, listed price, etc. Prices w ere tracked via PZNs using the official price list 'Lauer-Taxe' (August 2012) which provid es data for all pharmaceu- ticals dispensed in German phar macies. In the present analysis, only those drugs used were considered where the prices were clearly identifiable via the PZNs. The reported drugs were subdivided into prescription drugs and OTC drugs (availa- ble without a physician's prescription) according to the German Ordinance on Prescrip- tion-Only medicinal products [4] . Parental education and househ old income were clas- sified into three levels (low, middle, high) based on the compl eted years of schooling and the equivalent income, respectively. Further information on the methodology (e.g., inclusion criteria, definition of the drug categories, classifi cation of socioeconomic vari- ables, etc.) is availa ble in detail in previous publications [5 ,6]. 148 The GINIplus/LISAplus cohorts obtained approval from the respec tive ethics commit- tees. Furthermore, written informed consent was given by the pa rticipants' par- ents/legal guardians and by participants. Results Questionnaires on drug use were returned for 4,677 adolescents (response rate: 76.8%). Exactly 3,873 drugs had been used by the study particip ants within the past 4 weeks. The majority (70%, n=2,694) were OTC drugs. For 1,499 OT C drugs that were eligible for the further analysis, listed prices were tracked b y the reported PZN number. The mean price was n = 1 , 1 1 8 ) o f t h e d r u g packages had listed prices of le ss than \u20ac10, whereas 74 (4.9%) packages were sold at more than \u20ac25 (Supplementary Figure S1). A high percentage (12. 1%) of OTC drugs cost between \u20ac9.50 and \u20ac9.99, the price segment just below \u20ac10 (only e i g h t O T C d r u g s (0.5%) were in the next, same-siz ed price segment between \u20ac10.0 0 and \u20ac10.49). There was a noticeable variation in the mean OTC drug prices i n the different ther- apeutic categories. Whereas conventional drugs with chemical ac tive ibuprofen 13.41-16.56; SD: 11.41]. The average price of male adolesc ents (\u20ac10.14; 95% CI: 9.27-11.01; SD: 11.39) was higher than the mean price of dr ugs used by female adolescents (\u20ac9.44; 95% CI: 8.92-9.95; SD: 7.57). OTC drugs tha t were purchased in Munich had the highest mean prices (\u20ac10.74; 95% CI: 9.97-11.52; SD: 10.80), about \u20ac2 above OTC dru gs sold in Wesel (\u20ac8.65; 95% CI : 7.98-9.32; SD: 8.02), where the mean drug price was lowest. Higher maternal or paternal education was correlated with high er mean prices for OTC drugs used (e.g., lowest pat ernal education level (\u20ac8.12; 9 5% CI: CI: 9.4 7-10.86; SD: 10.40)). On average, adolescents from the lowest income group bought ch eaper OTC drugs (\u20ac9.18; 95% CI: 7.92-10.44; CI: 9.34-11.14; SD: 11.08). This association of hi gher drug prices with higher educational or income levels was also shown within speci fic drug categories (conventional drugs, homeopathic drugs, herbal drugs) or even w ithin the very nar- rowly defined category of drugs containing ibuprofen only (the most mentioned active ingredient), where children from the highest socioeconomic leve l used higher priced 149 ibuprofen containing drugs (e.g. lowest income level (\u20ac4.82; 95 % CI: 4.37-5.27; SD: (\u20ac5.94; 95% CI: 5.38-6.51; SD: 2 .86)). Generally, adolescent users of OTC drugs priced at \u20ac10 were significantly more likely (tested with Chi2) to reside in Munich (p=0.0060) and to have a father (p<0.0001 ) with the highest education level. However, general use of OTC d rugs (regardless of the price) was also positively associated (tested with Chi\u00b2) with r esiding in Munich (p=0.0459), paternal education level (p=0.0002), or maternal ed ucation level (p=0.0003). Figure 1. Stratified mean drug prices of over-the-counter drug s Discussion The results indicate that adolescents' use of higher priced OTC drugs may be associated with the geographical region and with parental (mainly paternal ) education. There may also be an association with parental income, but further resear ch is needed to confirm this on a significant basis. In Germany, only very few OTC drug s are included in the list of reimbursable OTC drugs [7]. However, the relatively moderate p r i c e o f \u20ac 1 0 f o r a n OTC drug seems to be a psychological threshold that may discour age consumers from buying higher priced OTC drugs. This is not an issue as long as cheaper alternatives of 150 comparable quality are available or OTC drugs are covered by he alth insurance. On the other hand, it should also be considered that higher priced but medically advisable OTC drugs are possibly not used if they have to be paid for out of pocket, especially in view of adolescents from the lowest s ocioeconomic level. The '10-eur o - b a r r i e r ' m a y a l s o have implications with regard to the use of e.g. not reimbursab le herbal drugs (mean price: \u20ac14.99), which may be less attractive just because they cost more than \u20ac10 on average. But also with regard to other drug categories (e.g. em ergency contraceptives, recently switched to OTC status and costing roughly \u20ac18 (levono rgestrel) in Germany), the price should not be the predominant factor that determines whether a drug is used or not. Nevertheless, a limiting factor of the above-mentioned results is that prices for all OTC drugs are freely calculable in Germany and only the lis ted prices were consid- ered, which may vary from the actual prices paid in the pharmac ies. Moreover, no in- formation was available on how many of the included OTC drugs w ere actually paid out of pocket.

KEY POINTS The mean price of OTC drugs us ed by adolescents in Germany is \u20ac9.75, and about 75% of all OTC drugs used cost less than \u20ac10. On average, adolescents from a higher socioeconomic backgroun d used higher priced OTC drugs. Higher prices could discourage especially adolescents from a lower socioeconomic background from taking medically advisable but not reimbursabl e OTC drugs. 152 References 1.

Status of emergency contraceptives in Europe one year after the European Medicines Agency's recommendation to switch ulipristal acetate to non-pre scription status. Public Health Genomics [pub lished online 30 March 2016] 156 Abstract Background : In November 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recomme nded switching the emergency contrace ptive (EMC) ulipristal acetate to non-prescription status. This study's objective was to assess the current legal status of the two EMCs ulipristal acetate and levonorge strel in Europe and to report t he development of sales figures for EMCs since they were made freely available. Methods : Health authorities were contacted in autumn 2015 and asked ab out the cur- rent status of EMCs and whether the sales figures had changed a fter a switch to non- prescription status. Additionally, data on consumption were col l e c t e d i n 1 8 G e r m a n community pharmacies. Results : As of November 2015, most countries in the European Union hav e followed the EMA recommendation. Hungary kept the prescription-only stat us. In Malta, EMC drugs are not authorized. Germany and Croatia switched levonorg estrel to non- prescription status as well. Of the EU candidate and European f ree trade association countries, ulipristal acetate is available without prescription in Norway and Bosnia and Herzegovina only. Several countries reported an increase in EMC s sales since the switch. Conclusions : An EMA recommendation can strongly contribute to the harmoniz ation of a drug's legal status in the European Union. In most European c ountries, ulipristal ace- tate and/or levonorgestrel are now freely available. Key words Emergency contraceptives Ulipr istal acetate Levonorgestrel Europe Prescription status Availability 157 Introduction Unintentional pregnancy and terminations of pregnancy are relev ant public health issues that, not least, affect adolescent girls [1,2] and are p redicted by socioeconomic factors such as educational background or income [3-8]. In 2009 , the active pharma- ceutical ingredient 'ulipristal a cetate' obtained marketing aut horization through the centralized procedure of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to be used for emer- gency contraception throughout the European Union (EU). Another active ingredient used for emergency contraception is levonorgestrel (1.5 mg as a single dose), which is authorized in most European countries on a national level. An emergency contraceptive (EMC), also known as the 'morning-a fter pill', can prevent unintended conception in case of, e.g., failure of othe r contraceptive measures, if it is taken within 72 hours (levonorgestrel) or 12 0 hours (ulipristal acetate) after sexual intercourse. Effect iveness is increased by taking EMCs very quickly, prefer- ably within 24 hours [9]. In November 2014, the EMA recommended switching the EMC drug u lipristal ace- tate (ellaOne\u00ae) from prescription status to non-prescription st atus [10]. On 7 January 2015, the European Commission issu ed a legally binding decision valid (in principle) throughout the EU, which makes this EMC freely available as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug [11]. This decision was also based on the safety profile f or ulipristal acetate, which is considered to be comparable wi th levonorgestrel [12], and wa s supposed to speed up w o m e n ' s a c c e s s t o e m e r g e n c y c o n t r a c e p t i v e s . P r i o r t o t h e E M A r e commendation, u l i p r i s t a l a c e t a t e ( U P A ) w a s a v a ilable on prescription only in all European countries where it was marketed (with some exceptions in the United Kingd o m ( U K ) , w h e r e i t was partly already available without a prescription on a trial basis). At the time of the EMA recommendation, levonorgestrel (LNG) was already available without a physician's prescription to be used for emergency contraception in most Eur opean countries. This study has two main objectives: First, to summarize the current legal and availability status o f the two emergency contraceptive drugs UPA and LNG in Europe. Second, to describe the impact of the switch of emergency contr aceptive drugs to non-prescription status on EMC sales in Germany and other Europ ean countries where respective data were available. 158 Methods Included countries For this study, all 28 member states of the EU and the four mem bers of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, were addressed. Additionally, EU candidate countries and potential c andidates [13] were also considered for the assessment. Assessment of the prescription status To obtain information on the current legal status of EMCs and f urther data, the coun- tries' national pharmacists' asso ciations, on the hom epage of the Pharmaceu- tical Group of the European Union (PGEU) [14], were contacted b y email between Sep- tember 2015 and November 2015. A list was attached to the email with several ques- tions on EMCs. In deta il, the following issu es were addressed: - Current prescription status of UPA and LNG? - If not yet switched to free av ailability, implementation proc ess underway? - Available in pharmacies only? - Dispensed behind the counter only? - Any restrictions when dispensin g an EMC (e.g. for girls >18 y ears)? - Can EMCs be advertised in the common media such as TV or prin t media? - Are the prices of EMCs fixed b y legislation or freely calcula ble? - Any information available as t o whether the EC sales figures changed markedly since the change to non-prescription status? - Any information on drug shorta ges in relation to EMCs availab le? If no response was obtained from the pharmaceutical association s, other health author- ities (e.g. national medicines a gencies, national health minist ries, pharmacists' cham- bers, etc.) were contacted and/or the authorities' homepages as well as the website of the European consortium for emergency contraception [15] were s creened for infor- mation with regard to the current legislation on EMCs. In addit ion, the market leader for EMCs in Europe (HRA Pharma) was also contacted and asked to supply market data on EMCs. 159 Assessment of pharmacy dispensing data in Germany Own data on EC sales figures were assessed in 18 community phar macies from various German regions (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine- Westphalia, Saar- land, Schleswig-Holstein) by dire ctly contacting the pharmacy o w n e r s . S a l e s f i g u r e s were collected for the period between January 2014 and October 2015. Results EU member countries A s o f N o v e m b e r 2 0 1 5 , n e a r l y a l l E U c o u n t r i e s f o l l o w e d t h e E u r o p ean Commission's decision and made UPA freely ava ilable. The decision was transp osed to national legis- lation very quickly (by January 2015) in, e.g., Spain, Austria, Belgium, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom. UPA is registered but not yet available (expect ed by 2016) in Estonia. One country (Hungary) did not follow the recommendation and dec ided in January 2015 to classify all orally admin istered contraceptives (includ ing UPA for emergency contraception) as prescription drugs. No EMCs containing UPA or LNG are licensed in Malta. Normally, UPA is available in pharmacies behind the counter on l y. I n t he Ne ther- lands and Sweden, UPA is also sold outside pharmacies. In Luxem b o u r g , e . g . , U P A i s additionally distributed in family planning centres, whereas th e U K a l s o o f f e r s a c c e s s through UK-based internet sites. In the context of the UPA implementation process, Germany and Croatia (where LNG was subject to medical prescription before November 2014) s witched LNG to non- prescription status as well. LNG remained a prescription drug i n Hungary, Italy and Poland. In Cyprus, LNG has non-prescription status, but is not available on the market because of the financial crisis since 2013. LNG is also partly available outside pharma- cies (Netherlands, Portugal, Swed e n ) . I n L u x e m b o u r g a n d R o m a n i a , e.g., UPA is addi- tionally distributed in family planning centres, whereas the UK a n d F r a n c e a l s o o f f e r access through government-based internet sites. In the Principality of Monaco, formally not part of the EU, bo th UPA and LNG are freely available. No data were available for San Marino and And orra, two further mi- crostates closely related to the EU. EFTA countries UPA is available without prescription in Norway (switch by the end of December 2014), but still requires a prescription in Liechtenstein (according t o Swiss law) and Switzer- 160 land. UPA is not yet available in Iceland. LNG is available wit hout prescription in all four EFTA countries. In Norway, both UPA an LNG are sold also outsid e pharmacies, whereas in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, only pharmacies are allowed to sell UPA or LNG. EU candidate and potential candidate countries UPA is not marketed in Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Mon- tenegro, but it is available as a prescription drug from pharma cies in Serbia. According to the information provided by the Istanbul Chamber of Pharmaci sts (Istanbul Ezcac Odas), although subject to medical prescription, UPA may somet imes be sold without prescription in Turkish pharmacies. Bosnia and Herzegovina is t he only candidate or potential candidate country (no data were available for Kosovo for UPA or LNG) where UPA can be bought without a physician's prescription. LNG has prescription-only status in Albania and the Former Yug oslav Republic of Macedonia, whereas it needs no prescription in Montenegro and S erbia. LNG has non- prescription status in Turkey as well, but has not been availab le since 2014. LNG is also not available in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Development of sales figures Although only UPA was included in the EMA recommendation, the G erman administra- tion switched both UPA (restricted ellaOne \u00ae) and LNG contempo- raneously to non-prescription status by a respective modificati on of the ordinance on prescription-only medicinal products. The relevant decision was published in the Fed- eral Law Gazette dated 13 March 2015. Dispensing a drug as an O TC product requires packages to be labelled accordingly. By the middle of March 201 5, only ellaOne\u00ae was available in German pharmacies as an OTC-compatible product. Su itable LNG products were available about 1 month later by the middle of April 2015. Figure 1 shows the number of EMCs sold (data available for 18 community pharmacies ) per month for the assessment period from January 2014 until October 2015. The 18 included pharmacies w e r e d i s t r i b u t e d o v e r s i x d i f f e r e n t f e d e r a l s t a t e s o f G e r m a n y . Ten pharmacies were located in small cities (5,000-20, 000 inhabitants) and five in mid-sized cities (20,000- 100,000 inhabitants). A further two pharmacies were in larger c ities (>250,000 inhabit- ants). One pharmacy was located in a town with a rather rural c haracter (2,500 inhabit- ants). 161 Figure 1. EMC packages sold in 18 German community pharmacies (all four EMC brands of levonorgestrel (LNG) and all reimported medicinal products o f ulipristal acetate (UPA) currently available in Germany considered) According to the cumulated data from the 18 participating pharm acies (Figure 2), the overall increase in EMC sales in 2015 (May-October) for both UP A and LNG together was 38% for all pharmacies together, compared with the same per iod in 2014. How- ever, the increase in consumption was visible for UPA only (+62 %), whereas the num- ber of LNG packages used remained at an almost stable level (+1 %). Figure 2. Consumption of ulipristal acetate (UPA) and levonorg estrel (LNG) containing emergency contraceptives since the switch to free availability, in comparison with the corresponding period in 2014 162 In the 2 months before the change in prescription status, the c onsumption of EMCs was very similar to the corresponding m o n t h s i n 2 0 1 4 ( J a n u a r y a n d F ebruary 2015: n=88 EMCs sold vs. n=85 EMCs sold in January and February 2014). Sin ce May 2015, exactly 74% of the EMCs sold were purchased without presenting a physic ian's prescription (based on dispensing data (n=99 E MC packages sold) from two of the 18 included pharmacies only). Further information on the impact of the switch on German sale s of EMCs is inte- grated into Table 1, which also summarizes the development of E MC consumption in Europe for those countries with available studies or reports on consumption since the change in classification status.

For the rest of Austria, no such clear trend was reported . The increase espe- cially in Vorarlberg may be explained by the short distance fro m Germany, where LNG was available by prescription only in 2009, and Switzerland , where prices for LNG may be higher [16]. C r o a t i a S o m e i n c r e a s e i n U P A s a l e s ( n o t f u r t h e r q u a n t i f i e d ) a f t e r t h e s w i t c h t o n o n - prescription status in April 2015 was reported for Croatia by t he Croatian Pharma- ceutical Society (Hrvatsko Farma ceutsko Drutvo). LNG was not y et switched at the time this information was provid ed, but was expected to gain no n-prescription status very soon. Denmark Prior to the switch to a vailability without prescriptio n in 2001, the use of LNG increased slightly from 23,000 DDD in 1996 to 29,000 DDD in 200 0 . A f t e r t h e change in classification status in 2001, LNG use increased from 39,000 DDD (in 2001) to 103,000 DDD in 2008. Since t hen, the sales figures hav e remained almost s t a b l e .

Estonia According to the 2015 yearbook of the Estonian agency o f medicines (Ravimiamet), the consumption of LNG was almost stable in the period 2010-201 4 at levels be- tween 0.06 and 0.07 DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day Finland In Finland, LNG has been available as an OTC drug since 2002. In 2002, EMC sales increased by 62% [17]. France LNG was switched to non -prescription status in 1999. The proportion of women aged 15-24 years who had ever used EMCs rose from 14.6% in 1999 to 31.7% in 2004 [18] 163 Table 1 (continued) Germany Based on data collected by a market research company (I MS Health), the con- sumption of emergency contraceptives increased by about 30% in the first 6 weeks after the change in classificati on status (compared with consum ption in the corre- sponding period in 2014). Compared with the week prior to the c hange (9,500 packages), consumption increased by 42% in the week directly af ter the switch (13,500 packages) [19]. Similar da ta provided by the Federal Un ion of German Associations of Pharmacists (ABDA ) based on results from anothe r market research c o m p a n y ( I n s i g h t H e a l t h ) s u g g e s t a n i n c r e a s e i n E M C c o n s u m p t i o n from 37,330 packages in February 2015 to 49,298 packages (+32%) in March 20 15 and 60,152 (+61%) packages in May 2015 (the mean consumption per month in 2013 and 2014 was about 38,000 packages). Iceland LNG was switched to OTC status in 2001. A 2009 publicat ion [20] stated that use of LNG has become more common since the switch (consumption roughl y doubled). Latvia No increase in emergency contraceptives use during the l ast year was reported for Latvia by the State Agency of Me dicines (Zu valsts aentra). Montenegro A stable consumption of 0.04 DDD/1,000 inhabitants/d a y o f L N G b e t w e e n 2 0 1 2 and 2014 was reported by the agency for medicines and medical d evices of to a newspaper article in 'Die Welt', ellaOne\u00ae was sold out in Warsaw pharmacies shortly after the classification switch to non-presc ription status, pre- sumably because women feared that the decision regarding the sw itch might be reversed again [21]. Switzerland In Switzerland, LNG w as made freely available in 20 02. About 8,000 packages of the leading brand of EMCs were sold in the year of the switch. This figure in- creased to 78,500 packages in 2007 and 93,500 packages in 2008 (based on data from the Swiss Pharmaceutical Un ion 'pharmaSuisse'). Simultane ously, the use of condoms steadily decreased in the Swiss population [22]. United Kingdom LNG has been available without prescription since January 2001 in the United Kingdom. Compared with 2001, when 8.4% of women aged 16-49 year s used EMCs once, the proportion of women using EMCs did not change si gnificantly in 2001 (7.9%) and 2002 (7.2%). However, in the youngest age group (16-19 years), there was a (not significant) rise from 15.3% in 2000 to 21.5% in 2001, and a signif- icant drop to 8.9% in 2002 of women using EMCs. At the same tim e, the propor- tion of women obtaining EMCs directly from a pharmacy increased f r o m 0 % i n 2000 to 19.7% in 2001 and 32.6% in 2002 [23]. DDD , defined daily dose acetate 164 Discussion EMCs and the linked aspect of unintended pregnancy are relevant public health topics and important issues with relevance to women's self-determinati on and empowerment as well. However, the debate on EMC drugs, also in terms of the ir availability without a physician's prescription, is not free from emotions or ethical objections. Hence, it might have been assumed that harmonization of the legal status across the various European countries would be quite difficult. This study showed that a de cision by the European Commission in relation to the legal status of an active pharmac eutical ingredient may be followed and transposed to national legislation by most of t he EU members within a time period of approximately 1 year or less, despite existing p ossibilities for circum- venting the Commission's decision (e.g. in the case of EMCs, by adopting Article 4 \u00a7 4 of the Directive 2001/83/EC [24]). Even in countries that used to have a negative attitude towards freely available EMCs (e.g. Germany, Italy, Poland) bef ore the EMA recom- mendation, the national administra tions decided to liberalize a ccess to EMCs (at least for UPA). Evidently, in the context of the EMA recommendation f or UPA, some coun- tries such as Germany or Croatia generally reassessed their att itude towards EMCs and switched LNG to non-prescription status as well. Nevertheless, other EU countries (It- aly, Poland) did not extend the EMA recommendation to LNG, but limited the change in classification status to UP A containing EMCs only. As expected, the option of getting EMCs directly over the coun ter resulted in greater use of EMCs in most of the countries with available dat a on drug consumption. Apparently, women make use of this new possibility quickly. Add itionally, most phar- macists may not refuse (for what ever reason, e.g. no need to us e, ethical aspects [25], etc.) to dispense EMCs if request ed without prescription. For i nstance, in Ireland, where LNG has been freely available sin c e s p r i n g 2 0 1 1 , o n l y 3 % o f t h e consultations with a pharmacist resulted in no delivery of EMCs (based on data from the 2014 annual report o f t h e I r i s h P h a r m a cy U n i o n ) . A l m o s t t h e s a m e r e f u s a l r a t e o f 2 % of pharmacists (on account of moral or religious be liefs) was reported for pharmac ies in Boston, Atlanta and Philadelphia (United States) [26]. The magnitude of the inc rease in EMC use may also depend on the local setting and may vary between urban and more rural regions [18,19]. It is also conceivable t hat women might prefer 'anonym ous' urban pharmacies to a more rural pharmacy in their home town where everybody wou ld know everybody, although in theory discretion at the counter should be given in all pharmacies. At the same time, women should bear in mind that the use of EMCs canno t prevent sexually transmitted diseases (in Switzerland, the use of condoms has de creased since the s w i t c h o f L N G t o O T C s t a t u s [ 2 2 ] ) a n d a r e a l s o n o t a p p r o p r i a t e for regular use as an ongoing contraceptive method [27]. However, in some countries, the change in pre- scription status has had only a weak impact on the use of EMCs (e.g. UK [23]). 165 In the context of consumption figures, it should also be mentio ned that the change in classification status touches different economic interests. Evi dently, first and foremost, pharmaceutical manufacturers of EMCs will benefit economically from facilitated ac- cess to EMCs that may result in higher demand for those medicin es [28]. Additionally, according to the data on EMC consumption in Germany, UPA sales may profit the most from the switch to OTC status. This may be explained in part by more intense promo- tion of the use of UPA, not simply because of possibly favourab le pharmacological properties in comparison with LNG, but also because of the high er prices of UPA (e.g. listed prices in Germany are about 30 euros for UPA vs. 16-18 e u r o s f o r L N G ) . F u r - t h e r m o r e , w i t h o u t t h e n e e d f o r a p r e s c r i p t i o n , w o m e n a r e m o r e l ikely to consult a pharmacist directly rather than a physician. In Germany, shortl y after the change in classification status, about 78% of EMCs were sold without a ph ysician's prescription [19]. Similar trends had been observed in the UK and in France [23,29]. As a conse- quence, physicians may consider the switch as an intrusion into their sphere of compe- tence. However, they may also lose consultancy fees and may the refore try to impede a switch to non-prescription status, even if the physicians' orga nizations mainly use drug compliance and safety problems as arguments for their reluctant attitude [21,30,31] towards a change in classification status. A further aspect of presumably growing importance in the conte xt of approving new drugs or switching already approved drugs to free availabil ity is the issue of per- sonalized pharmacotherapy. LNG an d UPA through the cytochrome P450 3A4/5 systems [32,33], which are known to be su bject to genetic variability between individuals of the European population. Gen etic polymorphism may influence the efficacy and the to lerance of emergency contracep t i v e s . F o r i n s t a n c e , high LNG doses (1.5 mg) as administered for emergency contracep tion can cause nau- sea and vomiting, which in turn may result in an increased fail ure risk of emergency contraception (if no further LNG dose is applied). In theory, s ide effects such as nausea could occur even more among slow metabolizers, owing to increas ed LNG plasma con- centrations. However, only little data is available on the infl uence of genetic polymor- phism on UPA or 32]. Hence, the a spect of pharm acogenetics may not have been investigated sufficiently yet with regard to emergenc y contraceptive drugs. Furthermore, also personal body p arameters such as the body wei ght may influence efficacy of emergency contraceptives. Results from a 2012 publi cation [34] suggest, t h a t e f f e c t i v e n e s s o f 3 0 m g U P A f o r e m e r g e n c y c o n t r a c e p t i o n i s lower among obese women. However, UPA is only availa ble as tablet with a dose of 30 mg so far. In general, prescription-only status for EMCs might not appear very meaningful, if those products are available without a prescription in neighbou ring countries. This may presumably lead to an increase in drug tourism in border region s, probably including communication problems between customers and dispensing pharmac ists because of 166 insufficient language skills whic h, in sum, are likely to have a negative effect on drug compliance. In particular, Maltese women may perceive their sit uation as rather unsat- isfactory, as neither LNG nor UPA is available even on prescrip tion in their country. This is a remarkable state of affairs, especially as the World Healt h Organization recom- mends levonorgestrel for EMC and included this active ingredien t in the essential medi- cines list [35]. Nevertheless, Maltese women could adopt the Yu zpe method (by pre- scription only), which is however less effective and less well tolerated [36,37]. Of course, they may also undertake, e.g. a trip by speedboat to Si cily (which would be the nearest EU territory with freely available EMCs), but this woul d be rather strenuous, hypothetical and quite unreasonable. Presumably, women living i n countries without f r e e l y a v a i l a b l e E M C s a r e a l s o m o r e l i k e l y t o s t o c k u p w i t h t h o se products whenever t h e y h a v e t h e o p p o r t u n i t y t o d o s o ( f o r i n s t a n c e w h e n t r a v e l l i n g to other European countries), which might be contr ary to the original intention o f the legislators. Reimbursement policies vary across the European health care sy stems [15]. Some countries fully cover the costs of UPA or LNG if prescribed or procured in family plan- ning clinics, whereas in other countries EMCs have to be paid o ut-of-pocket (in Ger- many, free for <18 years, 5 euros prescription charge for <20 y ears, not covered for 20 years). This may also have socioeconomic implications, as mainl y women from lower socioeconomic levels are known to be more affected by unintende d pregnancy [3-5]. High prices may discourage especially women from a lower socioe conomic background f r o m p u r c h a s i n g a n e m e r g e n c y c o n t r a c e p t i v e [ 3 8 ] . I f c o n c e r n e d , t h e y m a y j u s t b e tempted to take nothing, resulting, of course, in a higher risk of unintended pregnancy. Results drawn from our own research on the use of OTC drugs amo ng adolescents in Germany (study sample size n=4,67 7; data not yet published) imp ly that a price of 10 euros or more for an OTC drug may represent a psychological threshold beyond which (socioeconomically weaker) adolescents are likely not to buy an OTC drug (75% of the OTC drugs utilized cost less than \u20ac10). This may be rele vant especially for those countries (e.g. Italy, Poland) where EMCs are not covered by th e social system and UPA is the only emergency contracepti ve drug available without pres cr i p t i o n , a s U P A n o r - mally has a much higher price than LNG and is usually marketed at prices roughly be- tween 20 and 40 euros in the EU [ 15]. Presumably, potential soc ioeconomic disparities regarding access to EMCs would have been further reduced if the relevant national authorities had not limited the change in classification status t o U P A , b u t h a d i m p l e - mented free availability of LNG as well. This study has some limitations . The sample consisting of 18 i ncluded pharmacies cannot be considered representative of Germany, although the re sults are roughly in line with findings (cumulated for UPA and LNG together) for the first 3 months after the switch reported by the Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists (ABDA). However, no other data source for the period under research was available that could 167 provide sales figures specified by active ingredient (UPA, LNG) . Additionally, for five EU countries, we had to refer to data from the European consortium for emergency con- traception [15] only, as no response was obtained directly from the relevant national authorities. Conclusions Based on the results of this study, it may finally be concluded that Europe is able to harmonize the positions of the sin gle European countries after an EMA recommenda- tion or decision, even towards controversially discussed health topics such as the legal status of EMCs. At the same time, European countries can and do u s e t h e i r s co p e o f action to adapt their positions regarding (current) political a nd societal circumstances and attitudes, e.g. by recomme nding checklists for pharmacists as a tool for dispensing E M C s ( e . g . A u s t r i a , C r o a t i a , F i n land, Liechtenstein, Germany, I reland, Spain, Switzer- land), setting advertising restrictions or prohibitions (e.g. C roatia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania), minimum age limits fo r customers (e.g. Bulgaria, Cr oatia, Italy, Latvia, Po- land, Slovenia) or implementing a ban on internet sales (e.g. G ermany, Italy). Neverthe- less, there still remain (a very few) countries within the Euro pean community that per- sist in their own legitimately different position, which may ch ange with time or might even be reduced to absurdity by the versatility of concerned wo men who will know where to procure EMCs when necessary.

From a public health point of view, various research qu estions with regard to paediatric drug use are of interest and relevance, such as phar macoepidemiological issues, the promotion of the development of new drugs for orpha n diseases that very often also affect children [1-3], the lack of availability of n umerous (approved) drugs with dosages or forms of administration that are suitable for c hildren [4-6], etc. How- ever, it is in the nature of things that not all relevant issue s may be addressed in a com- prehensive way by one dissertatio n. Therefore, this disseration focuses on the pharma- coepidemiological and socioeconomic aspects of drug use among c hildren and adoles- cents in Europe, with a particular emphasis on paediatric drug use in Germany. The first chapters concentrate on the use of medicinal products from the field of complementa- ry and alternative medicine (CAM) such as homeopathic remedies or herbal drugs. The following chapters are dedicated to paediatric drug use in gene ral and the longitudinal associations of drug use. Fina lly, the current issue of emergen cy contraception is ad- dressed, as adolescents are also directly concerned with this t opic. Main results Chapter 2 investigated patterns of paediatric CAM use in Europe an countries and non- European countries as well, with a focus on the use of homeopat hic remedies and herbal drugs, two of the most commonly used CAM modalities [7]. A systematic review detected 58 eligible studies from 19 countries, mainly from Wes tern Europe (43%) and North America (41%). No data were available for Eastern Europe (except Turkey) and Africa, emphasizing the need for research with regard to these regions. Based on the included studies, a meta-analysis was performed in order to est imate the prevalence rates of use in Europe, North America, and 'other' continents. Furthermore, the socio- economic predictors of CAM use are summarized in a descriptive manner. Overall, the prevalence of use of homeopathic products was rel atively high among children in Europe, where, for example, the use within the past year was estimated at 8.98% (95% confidence interval: 5.07-15.43). It was highest in G ermany, the Nether- lands, and the United Kingdom. Compared with the estimates for North America, the prevalence of homeopathy use was about three times higher in Eu rope, regardless of the underlying recall period. The 1-year prevalence rate of herbal drug use was estimated at 13.53% for Europe (95% confidence interval: 2.30-50.96), which was almost on the same level as in North America. Very high prevalence rates of herbal drug use were rep orted from Germany, Turkey, and Brazil. 173 With regard to the socioeconomic predictors of CAM use, most st udies did not analyse predictors for specific CAM modalities, although it has been sh own that predictors may vary between the single CAM categories [8]. Only four studies r eported predictors for homeopathy use, and eight studies presented predictors for herb al drug use. In sum- mary, mainly parental CAM use and parental education predicted their children's use of CAM. The findings may have implications insofar as paediatricia ns should, with concern for potential interactions, be aware of their patients' high CA M use when prescribing pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, health care managers should take note of the evidently existing wish of a noticeable part of the European population t o integrate CAM into their medical treatment. The main findings of chapter 3 are based on data from the Germa n GINIplus and LISA- plus birth cohorts and complement the research performed in cha pter 2. The results in chapter 3 show that the prevalence of complementary and alterna tive medicine use, compared with healthy adolescents, is usually higher among adol escents suffering from chronic conditions. This was particularly the case for adolesce nts suffering from aller- gies or 'any chronic condition' with respect to the use of home opathic remedies and the consultation with CAM providers such as non-medical health providers ('Heilprak- tiker') or osteopaths. These fi ndings support the assumptions f rom chapter 2 that stud- ies assessing the prevalence of CAM use among chronically ill c hildren only should be excluded from a systematic review if the review's objective aim s to estimate the preva- lence of CAM use in the general paediatric population. However, the prevalence of use does not reflect drug usage com prehensively, and higher prevalence rates of e.g. homeopathy or herbal drug use a mong chronically ill children do not necessarily mean that they unreasonably substit ute treatment with conventional drugs for a non-conventional medicinal therapy app roach with CAM. The findings of chapter 3 imply that, despite higher prevalence rat es of C A M use , chroni- cally ill adolescents and their parents/legal guardians rely mo re on conventional drugs and may use medicinal CAM produc ts as an additional ('complemen tary') rather than 'alternative' treatment. This apparently contradictory result i s explained by the fact that chronically ill adolescents used more drugs in general and , at the same time, the proportion of medicinal CAM products among all drugs used was l ower among adoles- cents with chronic conditions than among healthy adolescents. N evertheless, paediatri- cians should know about the presumably higher prevalence of CAM u s e a m o n g t h e i r patients with chronic conditions and should take into account t hat the risk of pharma- cological interactions (e.g. between conventional drugs, but be tween conventional drugs and non-conventional drugs as well) may be higher among t heir chronically ill patients, as they generally use more medicinal products than ap parently healthy chil- dren. 174 Chapter 4 presents an updated view of paediatric CAM use in Ger many based on find- ings from a large German birth c ohort (GINIplus) . The results s how that about 26% of all drugs utilized are medicinal CAM products. Homeopathic remedies and herbal drugs, the two most mentioned CAM moda lities, which accounted for abou t 85% of all re- ported medicinal CAM products, were used by 7.5% and 5.6%, resp ectively, of the 15- year-old adolescents within the observation period of 4 weeks. Exactly 10.8% consulted CAM providers (non-medical healt h providers ('Heilpraktiker'), homeopaths, or osteo- paths) within the preceding year. Compared with the findings fr om the 10-year follow- up of the same birth cohort, the prevalence of homeopathy use w as practically halved (-52%) and dropped substantially for herbal drug use (-36%), wh ereas the prevalence of 'overall drug use' remained almost on the same level, as 15- year-old adolescents used only slightly fewer drugs in general (-6%) than 10-year-ol d children. All but one of the medicinal CAM products were over-the-counter drugs availabl e without a physi- cian's prescription. On average, homeopathic rem edies cost \u20ac10. 14, and the mean price f o r a h e r b a l d r u g a m o u n t e d t o \u20ac 1 3 . 7 2 . T h e a v e r a g e p r i c e o f c o n v entional over-the- counter drugs containing chemical active ingredients such as ib uprofen was lower (\u20ac6.06) compared with medicinal CAM products. This may in part have contributed to the lower prevalence rates of CAM use among 15-year-old adolesc ents in comparison with 10-year-old children, as medicinal CAM are not normally re imbursed by statutory health insurance companies for children older than 12 years. Th us, higher prices of homeopathic and herbal drugs may lead to a preference for conve ntional over-the- counter drugs among adolescents if drugs have to be paid for ou t-of-pocket. However, the presence of other factors may also have led to lower preval ence rates of CAM use, for instance a lower acceptance of CAM among adolescents (compa red with 10-year- old children). Household income was not associated with the use of any CAM mo dality. Female gender and residing in Munich predicted the use of homeopathic remedies and consul- tation with CAM providers. Adolescents whose mothers had a high er educational back- ground used more herbal drugs and consulted more with CAM provi ders. Very similar r e s u l t s w i t h r e s p e c t t o t h e p r e d i c t i n g f a c t o r s h a d a l r e a d y b e e n found at the 10-year follow-up of the GINIplus study. Overall, the results imply tha t the users' profile not only varies between users of conventional drugs and CAM users, but between users of the single CAM modalities as well. In chapter 5, patterns of paediatric drug utilization are compa red between prescription drugs available on a physician's prescription only and freely a vailable over-the-counter drugs. Since the implementation of the 2004 German health act [ 9], OTC drugs are no longer reimbursed by German statutory health insurance companie s for children older than 12 years. OTC drugs may st ill be prescribed or recommended by physicians, but 175 are covered by statutory health insurance only in exceptional c ases for children aged over 12 years and therefore have to be paid for out-of-pocket. The research in chap- ter 5 reveals that the 4-week prevalence of drug use among 15-y ear-old adolescents in the German GINIplus birth cohort was quite high (41.0%). Furthe r m o r e , t h e m a j o r i t y (69%) of the drugs u tilized by adolescents were OTC drugs. In sum, socioeconomic factors such as gender, study area, mate rnal education, or household income did not predict the use of prescription drugs in general. On the other hand, higher use of OTC drugs wa s significantly associated with female gender, residing in South Germany (Munich), and a higher maternal educational ba ckground. Looking at specific drug categories classifie d by the anatomical therapeut ic chemical classification ( A T C ) s y s t e m , s o c i o e c o n o m i c f a c t o r s p r e d i c t e d t h e u s e o f v a r i o u s drug groups, e.g. antiinflammatory drugs, antialle rgics, methylphenidate, or drug s for thyroid therapy. Health care managers should therefore take into account the imp act of socioeconomic variables on paediatric drug use when deciding on the prescript ion status of drugs (with subsequent consequences for the r eimbursability of those drugs) or the further liberali- z a t i o n o f d r u g s a l e s , a s r e s p e c t i v e m e a s u r e s m a y l e a d t o o v e r - or undersupply with drugs in specific population strata. In chapter 6, a longitudinal analysis of drug use is performed by comparing drug use among 15-year-old adolescents from two German birth cohorts (GI NIplus and LISAplus) with drug use among 10-year-old children from the same cohorts at the 10-year follow- up. The overall prevalence of drug use was almost on the same l evel when comparing b o t h a g e g r o u p s . N e v e r t h e l e s s , t h e r e w e r e n o t i c e a b l e d i f f e r e n c e s with regard to the use of specific drug categories. For instance, the prevalence o f antiinflammatory drug use (mainly ibuprofen) more than doubled among 15-year-old adol escents compared with 10-year-old children. Of the 12 most mentioned active ingr edients used by adoles- cents, four were naproxe n) analgesics (pa- acetylsalicylic aci d). About 11% of the adolescen t s t o o k a t l e a s t o n e antiinflammatory drug within the (relatively short) observation period of 4 weeks, and almost 7% used at least one analgesic drug. A further remarkabl e finding from chap- ter 6 was that one of the strong est predictors for using a spec ific drug category or ATC group at the age of 15 years was previous use of the same drug category or ATC group a t t h e a g e o f 1 0 y e a r s . T h i s m i g h t b e i n t e r p r e t e d s u c h t h a t d r u g u s e a s a c h i l d m a y partly determine the kind of dru gs that will be used in adolesc ence or adulthood. The main result from chapter 7 is that higher prices for OTC dr ugs used by adolescents (and presumably bought predominantly without a physician's pres cription or recom- mendation) may be directly associated with socioeconomic factor s. For instance, ado- l e s c e n t s r e s i d i n g i n M u n i c h o r t h o s e h a v i n g a f a t h e r w i t h a h i g her educational level 176 used more higher priced OTC drugs on average, compared with ado lescents residing in Wesel or adolescents with fathers from a lower educational stra tum. In sum, the find- ings could have implications insofar as high prices of OTC drug s may discourage espe- cially adolescents from a lower socioeconomic background from b uying medically ad- visable but not reimbursable OTC drugs. The final chapter 8 deals with the current issue of emergency c ontraception. In Novem- ber 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended chang ing the classifica- tion status of ulipristal acetate from 'subject to medical pres cription' to 'not subject to medical prescription'. As a result, most EU countries followed the recommendation, although it would have been possible to evade the EMA decision. The decision to make ulipristal acetate freely availa ble also had an impact on the s ales figures, which have increased noticeably since the switch (e.g. by about 38% in Ger many within a period of 6 months after the switch for ulipristal acetate- and levonorge strel-containing emer- gency contraceptives together). According to the results from ch apters 2-8, drug utilization is considerably prevalent among children and adolescents in Germany and other European co untries as well. Furthermore, socioeconomic variab les evidently have a significa nt impact on paediatric drug use. With regard to the overall use of prescription drugs, there were no big varia- tions between the socioeconomic strata in Germany. Nevertheless , when viewed in detail, it seems that the use of prescription drugs from specif ic ATC categories varies between the higher and lower income and educational strata. For instance, children from the lowest income groups used more psychoanaleptics and an tibiotics compared with those from the highest inco me group. If it is assumed that the higher use results from a higher prevalence of the underlying disorders (attention deficit and hyperactivi- ty disorder, bacterial infections) in the lowest income groups, the question arises whether and how the prevalence of those disorders could be redu ced in children from low income households by respect ive (public health) measures. The picture changes when focusing on over-the-counter drugs, n o t n o r m a l l y co v - ered by the German statutory hea lth insurance companies for ins ured persons older than 12 years. In case of need, OTC drugs have to be purchased on the patient's (or the patient's parents') own initiati ve. This may require a certain level of health literacy, the ability to judge the child's healt h status correctly, and a cri tical attitude towards exag- gerated advertising messages. At the same time, efficient OTC d rugs that are necessary (or at least do no harm and have a subjectively perceived benef it for the patient) but are not covered by statutory health insurance must also be affo rdable for people from 177 a lower socioeconomic background. The results based on the Germ an GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts indicated that, in sum, the prevalence o f OTC drug use was low- est in the children of mothers w ith the lowest educational leve l (paternal education had almost no impact on the prevalence of drug use, either OTC drug use or the use of pre- scription drugs) and from poor households (60% of MEI). Also a closer look at single drug categories (e.g. herbal dru gs, mainly available without pr escription) or specific ATC categories that included mostly OTC drugs (e.g. antiinflammator y drugs, analgesics, antiallergics) showed that higher use of OTC drugs was associat ed with higher maternal education. In no instance of analysed 'OTC subgroups' was a hig her use of the respec- tive 'OTC subgroup' associated with lower maternal education or l o w e r p a r e n t a l i n - come. Additionally, the mean prices of the OTC drugs used were highe st in children with the highest maternal/paternal ed ucation background and househol d income. Hence, the decision to use (or not to use) higher priced OTC drugs may be directly associated w i t h t h e c h i l d ' s s o c i o e c o n o m i c b ackground. Overall, this is a r emarkable result for a country that is ranked quite hig hly in the list of countries wi th the best or most efficient health care systems [10-12]. Of course, Europe should set high standards for the population 's supply with me- dicinal products. The availability, the quality, and the afford ability of pharmaceutical products must also be ensured for the future. Social inequaliti es regarding access to drugs are not acceptable and must be reduced to a minimum. Neve rtheless, these ap- parently self-evident points cannot be taken for granted in tim es of ageing populations, economic crisis, and austerity po licies that are putting Europe a n h e a l t h c a r e s y s t e m s under pressure [13]. Countries such as Greece, which have been particularly hard hit by the financial crisis, are current ly experiencing severe problem s with drug shortages [14-16], although this phenomenon is not limited to those count ries and shortages have been reported for Germany as well, for example [17]. The p harmaceutical industry is important and has been defined as a strategic sector for the European economy [18], not only in terms of the development of new drugs. On the other h a n d , i t h a s t o b e pointed out that the pharmaceutical market is not free from eco nomic interests. Cor- ruption among health professionals and counterfeit drugs are fu rther challenges that need to be addressed. Initial steps in this direction have alre ady been taken [19-21]. However, it is likely that less well-off people may face more p roblems in accessing nec- essary drugs, especially when it comes to exceptional circumsta n c e s . A n e x t r e m e e x - ample is the case of the life-saving antiretrovirals for the tr eatment of HIV/AIDS that were not affordable because of disputes over property rights [2 2-24] for large sections of the adult and paediatric populations in the developing count ries before the 2001 Doha declaration. 178 The data from the GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts did not r eveal extreme social disparities with regard to paediatric drug use in Germany, but they highlighted the importance of health literacy an d showed significant tendencies t o w a r d s l o w e r O T C drug use among socially weaker children, which should be taken seriously. Against this background, the German decision to exclude OTC drugs from reimb ursement for child- ren older than 12 years should p robably be reassessed. Financia l resources should be spent prudently and health services and medicinal products shou ld be priced adequate- ly, but it should be kept in mind that the people's, and especi ally children's, health, must come first, not anyone's ec onomic interests. Therefore, it would be desirable that all actors and stakeholders within the health systems should ag ain judge pharmaceuti- cals more as valuable (and approp riately priced) products for t he treatment of disor- ders rather than classifying them merely as a cost factor or, o n the other side, having predominantly the potential of high profits in mind [25,26]. 179 References 1.

Finding the truth in a world full of spin: myth-busti ng doi:10.1016/j.clinthera.2015.02.009 181 Annex 182 Valorisation The results of this thesis can be valorised by the relevant imp lications they have on the following aspects of Public Healt h at a national or European le vel. a. Saving financial resources by avoiding oversupply with pharm aceuticals In general, it should be stated that both prescription drugs an d OTC drugs should be used according to need and after a careful risk-benefit evaluat ion only. In light of the high prevalence rates of drug use among a supposedly quite heal thy sample of chil- dren/adolescents in Germany, it may at first be critically ques tioned whether all drugs used by children/adolescents are really necessary from a medica l perspective, not least i n v i e w o f t h e f a c t t h a t a c t i v e pharmaceutical ingredients also have the potential to harm. Consumption of drugs is, of course, a consumption of priv ate or public financial resources as well. The mean price of pharmaceuticals used by ad olescents in Germany is around \u20ac9.75 for OTC drugs and \u20ac69.28 for prescription drugs . The results of this thesis suggest that, on average, an adolescent may use about 0. 5 8 p a c k a g e s o f O T C drugs and 0.24 packages of prescription drugs within an observa tion period of 4 weeks, c r e a t i n g m o n t h l y e x p e n d i t u r e s o n d r u g s ( O T C a n d p r e s c r i p t i o n d r ugs together) of roughly \u20ac24 on average per adolescent. Furthermore, the finding s of c hapter 6 imply that the use of prescription drugs and OTC drugs also partly fo llows habitual patterns. Drug utilization during childhood may to a certain degree deter mine drug use during adolescence or adulthood and, hence, result in (probably avoida ble) expenditures on pharmaceuticals in the future. Thus, detecting the 'necessity' of drug use already at an early stage in life and subsequent efforts to reduce drug utili zation to the required amount could be a relevant contribution to keep the expenditure s of statutory health insurance companies on pharmaceu ticals under control. However, 'necessity' might be perceived differently by different individuals and needs to be defined accurately. b. Value of self-medication and over-the-counter drugs to socie ty According to evidence based on studies conducted in the United States, Australia, and Brazil [1-3], self-medication with OTC drugs helps to relieve s ocial security systems. Depending on the source, every dollar/Brazilian real spent on s elf-medication saves 4-7 dollars/Brazilian reals for the health care systems. Savings ca n be derived from reduced costs for prescription drugs, avoided costs for physician visit s, and maintenance of the population's working productivity . A prerequisite for exploitin g the potential benefits of OTC drugs is that they are used in time as 'early intervention' to prevent, e.g. sick leave or consultation with a physician , which additionally would be l ikely to result in using 183 cost-intensive prescription drugs ( i n G e r m a n y , p r e s c r i p t i o n d r u g s a r e a b o u t s i x t i m e s more expensive than OTC drugs). However, as shown in chapter 5, lower social back- g r o u n d m a y p r e d i c t l o w e r u s e o f O T C d r u g s a m o n g a d o l e s c e n t s . F u rthermore, accor- ding to the results from chapter 7, adolescents from a higher s ocial background may be more likely to use higher priced OTC drugs. Thus, higher prices could generally discou- rage particularly people from a lower socioeconomic background from taking medically advisable but not reimbursable O TC drugs. Against this backgrou nd, reimbursement of at least some defined categories of OTC drugs by social securit y could also make sense economically in relation to public health expenses to avoid hig her costs caused by de- layed treatment. Of course, all OTC drugs (as well as prescript ion drugs) should be used properly. This highlights the importance of further fostering o f personal health literacy and good medical and pharmaceuti cal advice that is ideally not influenced by conflicting economic interests. Additionally, it could be worth reflecting on whether and how the role of pharma- cists could be strengthened with regard to the reimbursability o f O T C d r u g s w h e n bought without a medical prescription. For instance, in Germany , in the meantime, an increasing number of statutory health insurance companies reimb urse expenditures on OTC drugs again, but coverage normally still requires a physici an's prescription (causing consultancy fees) on an OTC pres cription form, which can be pre sented for reimburse- ment after having purchased the OTC drug at the pharmacy. c. Pharmaceuticals as an economic factor The pharmaceutical indu stry is one of Europ e's key markets. As mentioned in chapter 1, it generates a yearly turnover of about 190 billion euros in Eu rope and provides jobs for roughly 690,000 employees (figures for 2012 and 2013). Addition ally, a substantial number of people are working in the public health care sector ( e.g. some 150,000 peop- le as pharmaceutical personnel alone in German community pharma c i e s [ 4 ] ) . W h e r e pharmaceuticals promote health in any way, expenditures on phar maceutical products appear to be justified. A proper use of, e.g. OTC drugs, may no t only save costs for health insurance companies but also supports the health economy . However, according to the results in chapter 5, there might be an undersupply of O TC drugs espec ially in the socioeconomically lowest stratum of the (paediatric) population . Closing this supply gap could bring further revenues to the health economy and at the s a m e t i m e a h e a l t h benefit to those who are presumably using fewer drugs than actu ally needed or at least recommended. However, market mechanisms have to make sure that OTC drugs as well as generic or innovative prescription drugs also remain af fordable in the future, if necessary regulated by political measures. 184 d. Harmonization of supply with medicinal products across the E uropean Union Health and access to healthcare services such as treatment with medicinal products are high values that should not be limited by national borders and, undoubtedly, a healthy population is also an important pillar of a productive and pros perous society. The European Union promotes freedom of movement for goods, wor kers, services, and capital. Not least against the background of the new EU dir ective on patients' rights in cross-border health care, it m ay not appear very meaningful if different rules apply for the same medicinal products a cross the various EU member co untries, e.g. with regard to the classification of drugs into freely available, pr esciption only status, or narcotics, but also with regard to the coverage of medicinal pr oducts by social security. The case of emergency contraceptives (chapter 8) suggests that a centralized re- commendation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) can strongl y contribute to harmonization of, e.g., the legal status of a medicinal product across the EU member countries. Therefore, centralized drug supply standards may hel p to reduce disparities between EU countries with regard to access to medicinal product s (which, in a certain sense, also represents a social inequality) and might contribut e t o f u r t h e r p r o m o t e European integration.

The focus was placed on drug use among children/adolescen ts in Germany, as new data from the 15-year follow-up of two ongoing German birth cohorts were avail- able. The analysis was not limited to conventional drugs, but i ncluded alternative me- dicinal products such as homeopathic or herbal remedies as well . Furthermore, the use of prescribed drugs and self-m edicated drugs was assessed. The starting point of the research was a systematic review on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among children in Europe, in com parison with CAM use in North America and other regions. Out of 58 included studies, 49 studies were con- ducted in Europe or North America, whereas only nine studies an a l y s e d C A M u s e i n Australia/New Zealand or South America. One main result was tha t the estimate for the prevalence of homeopathy use in Europe (1-year prevalence: 8.98 %) is about three times the prevalence in North Am erica (1-year prevalence: 3.08% ), whereas for herbal drug use, there is only a small difference between the two regi ons (1-year prevalence: 13.53% for Europe vs. 12.05% for North America). Studies conduc ted with chronically ill children were excluded from the review because of a hypothesize d bias towards higher prevalence rates of CAM use, which was demonstrated to be true in a following, sepa- rately conducted study in this thesis. A detailed view on CAM use in Germany yielded quite high preva lence rates (use within the last 4 weeks) of homeopathy use (7.5%) and herbal dr ug use (5.6%) among adolescents. A higher use of homeopathy was significantly predi cted by female gender and by residing in Munich (compared with Wesel in Northwest Ger many), whereas herbal drug use was positively predicted by higher maternal edu cation. However, com- pared with the results from the follow-up of the same birth coh ort study at the age of 10 years, the use of homeopathy was more than halved and herbal drug use dropped by more than a third among 15-year-old adolescents. This may be explained in part by the fact that medicinal CAM products are normally reimbursed by German health in- surance for children younger than 12 years only. The subsequent investigation focused on the comparison of pres cription drugs with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs used by 15-year-old adolescents in Germany, including all kinds of medicinal products (conventional and alternative ones) . The results showed that the use of OTC drugs (accounting for roughly 69% of all dr ugs used and not nor- mally reimbursed by statutory health insurance) was significant ly predicted by socioec- onomic factors such as maternal educational background, whereas there was almost no d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n t h e s o c i o e c o n o m i c s t r a t a i n r e l a t i o n t o t h e use of prescription 186 drugs. At the same time, the use of drugs from specific anatomi cal therapeutic chemical (ATC) categories seems also to de pend on the adolescents' socio economic background. A longitudinal analysis of drug use revealed that the stronges t predictor of 15-year- old adolescents' use of a defined drug category (conventional d rugs, homeopathic drugs, herbal drugs) or ATC group was the previous use of the s ame drug category (conventional drugs, homeopathic drugs, herbal drugs ) or ATC g roup at the age of 10 years. Evidently, drugs may not only be utilized according to n eed but might also follow habitual patterns. It may be concluded that drug use as a child partly determines what kind of drugs they use during adolescence or adulthood. Socioeconomic factors were also associated with prices of OTC drugs. On average, the prices for OTC drugs used were highest among adolescents re siding in Munich or among those with parents from the highest education and income levels. The results were significant for the area of residence and paternal educati on. Generally, prices of \u20ac10 or more for an OTC drug seem to be a psychological threshol d, as about 75% of all OTC drugs cost less than \u20ac10. In this context, it should be tak en into account by health care managers that non-reimbursable but medically advisable OTC drugs could be used less, especially by th ose children from the socioeconomically w eaker levels. The research was completed by consideration of the current Eur opean issue of emergency contraceptives. In November 2014, the European Medici nes Agency (EMA) recommended switching the emergenc y contraceptive ulipristal ac etate from prescrip- tion status to non-prescription status and, thus, making freely available without a phy- sician's prescription. Although retaining the possibility of ci rcumventing the EMA deci- sion, most EU member countries implemented the recommendation a nd transposed it into national legislation within a period of 1 year. Since the switch, the use of emer- gency contraceptives has increased substantially in Germany and other European coun- tries. In summary, it may be concluded that paediatric use of medicin al products, espe- cially those available without a physician's prescription (whic h account for a substantial part of the drugs used), is significantly predicted by socioeco nomic background. This may have implications insofar as children and adolescents from the socioeconomically weaker levels might use fewer (medically advisable) drugs if th ey have to be paid for out-of-pocket, not least because the higher prices of the OTC d rugs used are presuma- bly associated with higher socio economic status. Against this b ackground, the list of reimbursable drugs may need to be reassessed in those countries where OTC drugs are not normally covered by statutory health insurance. However, me dicinal products, both prescription drugs and OTC drugs as well, should keep their sta tus as special products. Therefore, decisions on exclusion from reimbursement ought to b e evaluated carefully, as well as decisions on the liberalization of drug sales that w ould make them available outside pharmacies without the possibility of medical or pharma ceutical advice. 187 Samenvatting Het voornaamste doel van het onderzoek in deze dissertatie was d e a n a l y s e v a n h e t geneesmiddelengebruik bij kinderen, zowel met een van het gebruik van complementaire en alternatieve geneesmiddelen (CAM) door ki nderen vergelijking met CAM-gebruik in Noord-Amerika en andere regi o ' s .

In chap ters 2 and 8, the authors' co ntributions were not pu- blished by the journal and are therefore stated as follows: Chapter 2 (Patterns of Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( CAM) use in children: a systematic review) SI performed the literature search, screened all included studi es, extracted the relevant figures on CAM use, contacted the corresponding authors, and pe rformed the quality assessment. Furthermore, he initialized the first draft of the manuscript and approved the final manuscript as submitted. SI and CT were involved in t he meta-analysis that was finalized by two further stat istical experts as stated in t he acknowledgement section of chapter 2. SW and CT critically revised the initial manuscript and approved the final manuscript as submitted. Chapter 8 (Status of emergency contraceptives in Europe one yea r after the European Medicines Agency's recommendation to switch ulipristal acetate to non-prescription status) SI designed the study and contacted all authorities and pharmac eutical organizations. He conceptualized the initial manuscript and approved the final manuscript as submitted. HB critically revised the initial manuscript and app roved the final manuscript as submitted. 197 Annotations The questionnaires for the 15-year follow-up were collected unt il September 2013 for the GINIplus study, whereas the data collection for the LISAplu s study was only comple- ted in October 2014. Therefore, chapters 4 and 5, which were am ong the first chapters by chronological order, considered data from the GINIplus study only. In the process of the PhD trajectory, data for the LISAplus cohort were also avai lable and, hence, were used for chapters 3, 6, and 7. Chapters 2-8 correspond to the manuscripts as published by the journals or to the versions submitted to the journals in case they were still unde r review at the time of submitting the dissertation to the assessment committee. Owing to the journals' diffe- rent editing and requirements, the format is not uniform across the dissertation's chap- ters, e.g., with regard to spel ling (American English or Britis h English), reference style, or the use of thousand separators. Furthermore, the orthography of medical terms may vary between the articles' pub lished version and the dissertati on, for instance 'anti- inflammatory' (journal's version) vs. 'antiinflammatory' (as pa rtly used in the dissertati- on, based on the WHO collaborating centre for drug statistics m ethodology). Because of limited margins, some tables were modified slightly (e.g. by using abbreviations that were not used in the o riginal publications). 198 Abbreviations ATC Anatomical therapeutic chemical classification CAM Complementary and alternative medicine CI Confidence interval DDD Defined daily dose EFTA European Free Trade Association EMA European Medicines Agency EMC Emergency contraceptive EU European Union GINIplus German infant study on the influence of nutrition int ervention plus environmental and genetic influences on allergy development LISAplus Influence of lifestyle factors on the immune system an d allergies in East and West Germany plus the influence of traffic emissions a nd ge- netics LNG Levonorgestrel MEI Median equivalent income OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OR Odds ratio OTC (drug) Over-the-counter (drug) PZN Pharmazentralnummer (pharmaceutical identification number ) Rx (drug) Prescription (drug) UPA Ulipristal acetate WHO World Health Organisation 199 Acknowledgements I would like to thank Professor Dr Helmut Brand for supervising this thesis and for his confidence that the Public Health aspects of drug utilization c ould open a new field of activity within the Department of International Health at Maast richt University.

He attended primary school at the 'Grundschule Wullenstet ten' and received the general German qualification for university entrance ('Abitur') at the 'Nikolaus- Kopernikus-Gymnasium' in Wei\u00dfenhorn (Bavaria) in 1986. Afterwar ds, he started his a c a d e m i c c a r e e r a t t h e U n i v e r s i t y o f A p p l i e d S c i e n c e s i n U l m , w here he enrolled for electrical engineering. During the first 6 months, he did an in ternship at Mannesmann Tally, a computer printer producing company. In 1987, he decide d to change to the life s c i e n c e s e c t o r a n d b e g a n h i s s t u d i e s o f p h a r m a c y a t t h e E b e r h a r d Karls Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, motivated not least by the fact that pharmacy contain ed both aspects of natural sciences with a strong chemical emphasis and medicine a s well. The study in- cluded 6 months of internship at a community pharmacy and a fur ther 6 months at the hospital pharmacy of the university hospital Ulm. After 5 years of study, he gained his degree in December 1992. On completion of his studies, he spent some time abroad in Australia and Italy before starting work as a pharmacist at a c ommunity pharmacy in Aalen in November 1993. In 2008, Salvatore accepted a new profe ssional challenge and joined JRS Pharma, a leading company of the pharmaceutical exci pients branch, where he worked as an Area Manager for Germany until 2010, which incl uded both commer- cial and technical assistance for customers in Germany. Simulta neously, he started his postgraduate studies in Public Health at the Ludwig-Maximilians -Universit\u00e4t Munich in October 2009. He comp leted his Master's thesis at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munich (German Research Center for Environmental Health) and received the Master of Public Health in October 2011.
