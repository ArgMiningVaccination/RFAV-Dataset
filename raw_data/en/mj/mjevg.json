U.S. House Speaker Pelosi is talking up the potential for a 4th emergency COVID -19 supplemental, including more aid for state, tribal and local governments and an emphasis on infrastructure to help jump -start the economy post -COVID -19. The politics and vote counting are becoming harder and harder with each package A. Does your county and/or state association of counties have specific priorities for any future federal COVID -19 aid packages, including specific policy guidance, policy changes or targeted funding needs ? B. For example , NACo is already focus ing on the need to add \"lost revenue due to COVID -19\" as an eligible federal reimbursement under Treasury's $150 billion state stabilization program .

U.S. Treasury will play a key role in two major provisions: 1) 500 billion in loans, loan guarantees and other investments for critical businesses (I.e. airlines, air cargo companies, companies of national security significance), general businesses and state and local governments (I.e. Federal Reserve assistance with municipal bond market) 2) $150 billion state stabilization fund, including direct aid for states, tribes, territories and units of local government above 500,000 population.

Generally, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for: Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick time at the employee's regular rate of pay where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined (pursuant to federal, st ate, or local government order or advice of a healthcare provider), and/or experiencing COVID -19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis; or Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick time at two -thirds the employee's regular rate of pay because the employe e is unable to work because of a need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to federal, state, or local government order or advice of a healthcare provider), or to care for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID - 19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Department of Health and Human Services; and Up to an additional 10 weeks of paid family and medical l eave at two -thirds the employee's regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID -19. DOL published a temporary rule and series of Questions and Answers, including several requested by NACo related to public sector employees as well as health care providers and emergency DOL \"Q and A\" responses to issues related to public sector employees, including health care providers and emergency responders: 52. I am a public sector employee. May I take paid sick leave under the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act? Generally, yes. You are entitled to paid sick leave if you work for a public agency or other unit of government, with the exceptions below. Therefore, you are probably entitled to paid sick leave if, for example, you work for the government of the United S tates, a State, the District of Columbia, a Territory or possession of the United States, a city, a municipality, a township, a county, a parish, or a similar government entity subject to the exceptions below... NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES | COVID -19 FEDERAL AID UPDATE | April 7, 2020 | 12 Further, health care providers and emergency responders may be excluded by their employer from being able to take paid sick leave under the Act. See Questions 56 -57 below. These coverage limits also apply to public -sector health care providers and emergency responders. 53. I am a public sector employee. May I take paid family and medical leave under the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act? It depends. In general, you are entitled to expanded family and medical leave if you are an employee of a non-federal public agency. Therefore, you are probably entitled to paid sick leave if, for example, you work for the government of a State, the District of Columbia, a Territory or possession of the United States, a city, a municipality, a township, a county, a parish, or a similar entity ... Further, health care providers and emergency responders may be excluded by their employer from being able to take expanded family and medical leave under the Act. See Questions 56 -57 below. These coverage limits also apply to public -sector health care providers and emergency responders. 54. What do I do if my public sector employer, who I believe to be covered, refuses to provide me paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave? If you believe that your public sector employer is covered and is improperly refusing you paid sick leave under the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act or expanded fa mily and medical leave under the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act, the Department encourages you to raise your concerns with your employer in an attempt to resolve them. Regardless whether you discuss your concerns with your employer, if yo u believe your employer is improperly refusing you paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave, you may call WHD at 1 -866-4US- WAGE (1 -866-487-9243) or visit www.dol.gov/agencies/whd . Your call will be directed to the nearest WHD office for assistance to have your questions answered or to file a complaint. In some cases, you may also be able to file a lawsuit against your employer directly without contacting WHD. Some State and local employees may not be able to pursue direct lawsuits because their employers are immune from such lawsuits. For additional information, see the WHD website at: https://www.wagehour.dol.gov and/or call WHD's toll free information and help line available 8am -5pm in your time zone, 1 -866-4-US- WAGE (1 -866-487-9243). 55. Who is a \"health care provider\" for purposes of determining individuals whose advice to self -quarantine due to concerns related t o COVID -19 can be relied on as a qualifying reason for paid sick leave? The term \"health care provider,\" as used to determine individuals whose advice to self- quarantine due to concerns related to COVID -19 can be relied on as a qualifying reason for paid sick leave, means a licensed doctor of medicine, nurse practitioner, or other health care provider permitted to issue a certification for purposes of the FMLA. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES | COVID -19 FEDERAL AID UPDATE | April 7, 2020 | 13 56. Who is a \"health care provider\" who may be excluded by their employer from paid sick leave and/ or expanded family and medical leave? For the purposes of employees who may be exempted from paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave by their employer under the FFCRA, a health care provider is anyone employed at any doctor's office, hospita l, health care center, clinic, post -secondary educational institution offering health care instruction, medical school, local health department or agency, nursing facility, retirement facility, nursing home, home health care provider, any facility that per forms laboratory or medical testing, pharmacy, or any similar institution, employer, or entity. This includes any permanent or temporary institution, facility, location, or site where medical services are provided that are similar to such institutions. This definition includes any individual employed by an entity that contracts with any of the above institutions, employers, or entities institutions to provide services or to maintain the operation of the facility. This also includes anyone employed by any entity that provides medical services, produces medical products, or is otherwise involved in the making of COVID -19 related medical equipment, tests, drugs, vaccines, diagnostic vehicles, or treatments. This also includes any individual that the highest official of a state or territory, including the District of Columbia, determines is a health care provider necessary for that state's or territory's or the District of Columbia's response to COVID -19. To minimize the spread of the virus associated with CO VID-19, the Department encourages employers to be judicious when using this definition to exempt health care providers from the provisions of the FFCRA. 57. Who is an emergency responder? For the purposes of employees who may be excluded from paid sick leav e or expanded family and medical leave by their employer under the FFCRA, an emergency responder is an employee who is necessary for the provision of transport, care, health care, comfort, and nutrition of such patients, or whose services are otherwise needed to limit the spread of COVID -19.

This also includes any individual that the highest official of a state or territory, including the District of Columbia, determines is an emergency responder necessary for that state's or territory's or the District of Columbia's response to COVID -19. To minimize the spread of the virus associated with COVID -19, the Department encourages employers to be judicious when using this definition to exempt emergency responders from the provisions of the FFCRA. April 3, 2020 The Honorable Stev en T. Mnuchin Secretary U.S. Department of Treasury 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20220 Dear Secretary Mnuchin, As the national representative of America's 3,069 county govern ments, we are writing to request further clarification on the Coronavirus Relief Fund, outlined in the C ARES Act (P.L. 116136). We also wish to offer our understanding and interpretation of the law. We first want to express our sincere appreciation for your effo rts, and we want to acknowledge the passionate work of your team. We appreciated the opportunity t o engage with your team earlier this week as part of the intergovernmental consultation process. This is essential for county officials since we serve at \"ground zero\" of this unprecedented public health and economic crisis. Our 3,069 county governments employ 3.6 million proud public servants, including within our nearly 1,000 public hospitals, 1,900 local public health departments, and 750 behavioral health department s. Our first responders and frontline personnel, including our public and community health profession als, sheriffs, 911 operators, firefighters, EMT/paramedics, Emergency Operat ions Center (EOC) experts, coro ners/medical examiners, child welfare and aging service providers, substance abuse and mental health counselors, veterans service officers, homelessness program coordinators and jail administrators, amon g many others, depend on a strong intergovernmental partnership of federal, state, tribal and loc al officials. We want to address two main issues that were raised by Treasury officials during our intergovernmental consultation: (1) the baseline a mount for each State and how th is impacts the potential amount for direct payment to eligible units of local govern ment above 500,000 and (2) Treasury's preference to combine and limit the direct access and/or a llocation for eligible counties with cities also abov e 500,000 population. We also want to acknowledge our joi nt understanding that counties below 500,000 are eligible as subgrantees of the state. First, in reading the statute fo r the determination of direct payment to eligible units of local government the law clearly states that \"the Secretary shall reduce the a mount determined for that Stat e by the relative unit of local government population proportion amount described in subsection (c)(5) and pay such amounts directly to such uni t of local government.\" Under the (c) section outlining the minimum amount for each Sta te, the law does not include any qualifiers, such as a \"notwithstanding\" clause, that would support Treasury's current argument and app roach to subtract the state's minimum threshold before applying the 45 percent multipl ier for eligible units of local NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIE S | UPDATED: APRIL 2, 2020 2 government. In our view, there is no basis for calculating the local government share after removing the minimum share from the state's total. Treasury's argument of \"double funding\" is inconsistent with co ngressional intent. Under the Coronavirus Relief Fund, Treasury is empowered to provide state and local o fficials authority to control roughly $425 for each American. In most counties, a governor has authority over 100 percent of that individual's portion, including the estimated 19 states and territories identified un der the Congressional Research Service report, CARES Act, Title V: Background and State and Local Allocations . In some large counties, a governor has authority over 55 percent of tha t individual's portion, while c ounties may bear authority over 45 percent. In the approximately 26 large counti es with major cities also abov e the population threshold, the governor may have authority over 10 perce nt, the city has authority over 45 percent and the county has authority over 45 percent. Therefore, no community is \"get extra funding\" because of local government population. The formula merely adjusts which level of government has author ity over that community's share. Second, we believe the congressional intent was straightforward that each unit of local government above 500,000 population is entit led to receive direct payments , based on the 45 percent multiplier. By using the singular, or \"a\", unit of local government, the law is clear in several refere nces that each local jurisdiction should stand on its own, including for the calculation of its individual direct payment allocation based on its individual population proportion of the state total. The law specifically intents for the 45 percent to be applied solely as a multiplier and does not convey any limitation to an allocation for an individual county or city. As stated above, the 45 percent reference in (5)(A) is solely a multiplier. Some in the Treas ury Department have misconstrued this reference as to establish a statewide li mitation of 45 percent for all local governments within that state. F ortyfive percent was placed i n the bill solely to instr uct Treasury as to how much funding a local government shall receive under Section 500 1 proportional to its population . A reading of the text confers that in the case of an eligible city locate d within an eligible county, both the city and the county are entitled to their full 45 percent multiplier under the formula Congress wrote. In our reading, as noted earlier, the amount for each local gov ernment eligible for direct payments is calculated from the \"amount determined for that State\". There are no references or limitations to considering only certain portion s of a county in determining ei ther its population or its potential funding amount. I n the states with more than one local jurisdiction with popu lations above 500,000 population, the law applies the total stat e allocation amount as the multiplier for each local jurisdiction, rather than adjusting the state am ount, including the st ate minimum allocat ion, as locals are pulled from the total. In other words, a simple readi ng of Section 5001 shows Congress did not intend for the formula to be used to restrict counties of more than 500,000 from receiving their full amount. This formula has only three terms. None of the terms in this formula stipulate that funds for eligible cities within eligible counties are offsetting. Nor do these terms exclude certain populations fro m one unit of local government because they reside in another unit of local government. In fact, all residents who live within a city are also part of the county (except independent cities in Virginia and the two eligible independent cities of Baltimore and St. Lo uis, who also operate traditional county services similar to a consolidat ed citycounty). The overwhelmi ng majority of county services cover the entire county boundary, not just those areas outside of a city. Meanwhile, all co unty residents are not part of a city. Therefore, the logical order goes: Federal, State, County and City. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES | UPDATED: APRIL 2, 2020 3 Lastly, President Trump and Vice President Pence have repeatedly described the federal government's philosophy toward emergency manage ment as \"locally executed, st ate managed, federally supported.\" We share these beliefs. In most cou nties across the country, it i s our county elected officials and our county health professionals who are in strumental in executing our publ ic health, safety net and economic recovery response. If Treasury proceeds with its preliminary allocation rules for the local government population proportion amount, it will harm our nation's ability to execute our COVID19 emergency plans. America's counties have led this nation's response to COVID19 and providing counties with the flexible, essential financial resources to which they are entitled under Section 5001, and so despe rately need, is the surest way to see that that our nation's preparedness and respo nsivity continues. We hope the Treasury Department will apply the local go vernment population proportio n amount as written by Congress in the CARES Act and provide counties with more than 500,000 residents with their full allotment. Thank you for your continued hard work and leadership during th ese challenging times. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue further. We are committe d to a solution that hel ps our nation mitigate, respond and recover from these historic times. With respect, Matthew D.

Counties remain on the frontlines of our nation's ongoing local public health emergency response and overall public safety efforts . We are committed to continuing to work with both Congress and the administration to address the man y significant health, safety and economic impacts associated with the virus. As we move toward recovery, further strengthening the intergovernmental partnership is ess ential for county officials serving at \"ground zero\" of this unprecedented public health and economic crisis. Our 3,069 county governments employ 3.6 million proud public servants, including within our nearly 1,000 public hospitals, 1,900 local public health departments , more than 800 long -term care facilities and 750 behavioral health departments. Our first responders and frontline personnel, including our public and community health professionals, sheriffs, 911 operators, firefighters, EMT/paramedics, Emergency Operation s Center (EOC) experts, coroners/medical examiners, child welfare and aging service providers, substance abuse and mental health counselors, veterans service officers, homelessness program coordinators and jail administrators, among many others, depend on a strong intergovernmental partnership of federal, state, tribal and local officials. As Congress considers a fourth COVID -19 response package, we urge you to provide direct and flexible funding and resources to counties of all sizes. As we work to protect our citizens , local businesses and economies , we are mak ing significan t financial invest ments to address immediate public health and safety need s. At the same time, we are experiencing massive and unprecedented declines in revenue as a result of the economic downturn and are working to quickly reprogram resources and staff to respond to the crisis. The decline in revenue is occurring when the need for county services and functions is skyrocketing for things like child protective services, emergency 911 assistance, law enforcement and emergency management, nutrition assistance programs, assistance for older Americans and affordable housing , all of which are becoming more complicated and costly to maintain. National Association of Counties | 2 Countie s are required to operate with balance budgets , and due to the extremely steep and sudden unforeseen expenses for COVID -19 response efforts, some are already cutting services and laying off employees. In fact, t he Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) just released a report detailing how local governments have projected an unanticipated $23 billion budget impact in the first two weeks of the pandemic alone. If you mo ve forward with a fourth legislative package , we urge you to consider the following priorities for counties: Include A Relief Fund for Local Governments of All Sizes That Can Be Used to Address the Unique Needs of Local Communit ies: While we appreciate Congress' work to pass the CARES Act (P.L. 116 -136) and the inclusion of the Coronavirus Relief Fund, we are concerned that under the language as written, very few counties will be able to access the funding with the majority going to cities with populations above 500,000 and the states . Counties and other local governments below 500,000 are not even eligible for direct funding. Moving forward, we urge you to consider including a relief fund that is flexible and can be used to address lost revenue and supplement eligible personnel and administrative costs as a result of COVID -19 response. Provide Clear Federal Guidance on the Distribution of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Essential Medical Equipment : As COVID -19 continues to sprea d throughout our country, and we brace for a growing wave of patients in our hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs), ensuring that we have the equipment needed to care for patients and keep our essential health care workforce safe is crucial. State and local governments are currently competing for resources that are not necessarily being distributed based on need. We applaud efforts to increase the availability of medical supplies in the most recent legislation (P.L. 116 -136); however , beyond increasing the supply, we are requesting that the federal government issue clear guidance to coordinate the allocation of PPE and essential medical equipment to ensure that areas hardest hit by the pandemic are receiving needed equipment in a timel y manner. Expand Federal Support for Local Medicaid Programs : As the threat of COVID -19 persists, our citizens are simultaneously grappling with both unemployment and the loss of their employer -sponsored health insurance, creating a critical need for expanded health insurance coverage. While we applaud the proposed increase to Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) included in P.L. 116 -127 that will provide counties with additional federal funding to test for and treat the virus, we urge congress to provide further increases to the FMAP so that local governments can effectively mitigate the surplus of low income or indigent residents and continue to diagnose and treat all residents facing the virus. Implement Moratorium on Medicaid Fisc al Accountability Regulation (MFAR) : Counties appreciate federal flexibilities being granted at this time regarding the administration of the Medicaid program ; however, we continue to encourage Congress and the Administration to suspend all changes to Medi caid financing. As we stated in our March 13 letter, counties support a moratorium on the MFAR because it would reduce the ability of localities to finance the non -federal share of Medicaid, resulting in a reduction in federal Medicaid funding for the publ ic health and hospital system. If finalized, this rule would destabilize our county public health systems at a time when our resources are already heavily strained. Address the Unfunded Mandate Included in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCR A): Paid leave is a significant challenge for county governments who employ over 3.6 million people , or one percent of all Americans. While we appreciate that the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116 -127) expands paid leave benefits for workers affected by COVID -19, the legislation imposes substantial new sick leave and family medical leave requirements on government employers of all sizes. Counties request that Section 70 01(e)(4) and Section 7003( e)(4) be repealed so that state and local government employers fully qualify for both credits. National Association of Counties | 3 Eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Non -Federal Cost Share Currently Required Under the Presidential Disaster Declaration : Increasing the federal cost share of FEMA public assistance would prov ide much -needed relief and additional federal assistance for state, local, tribal and territorial governments on the front lines of the pandemic. Counties encourage you to eliminate the local match requirement in any fourth package. Bolster Counties' Ability to Serve and Protect Our Veterans : Counties applaud the increased resources for veterans' services provided under the CARES Act as we address the growing COVID -19 pandemic in ou r communities. At the local level, county veteran service offices (CVSOs) play a critical role in ensuring veterans' access to a range of service -connected programs, processing approximately $22 billion in federal benefits each year, from VA health care to housing and transition assistance. However, these programs and personnel are funded almost entirely by counties and are seeing significant increases in demand as more veterans enroll in health and social services during the current crisis. To address this challenge, counties urge Congress to increase resources for CVSOs, as detailed under legislative proposals such as the bipartisan Commitment to Veteran Support and Outreach (CVSO) Act (H.R. 5516/S. 3020). Pause Shot Clocks and Public Comment Periods : As counties are increasingly tasked with quickly identifying, assessing and addressing the many challenges associated with the COVID -19 crisis, it is now more important than ever for local governments to be able to prioritize emergency response efforts. With the recent implementation of \"shot clocks\" on local governments to process small cell applications, counties are forced to choose between processing applications and maintaining focus on the efforts to preserve the health and safety of our communities. We urge you to consider suspending all shot clocks and public comment periods to allow local governments to focus personnel and resources on the crisis. Increase Funding for the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) : SSBG is a proven key source of support to help communities respond to critical needs during national disasters by aiding states and counties quickly. Counties administer SSBG in 10 states and draw on these funds to provide essential services to vulnerable populations, including children and youth in foster care, older adults at risk of abuse and people with disabilities. We urge Congress to provide emergency funding for SSBG so that counties can meet growing demand for services for our most vulnerable resi dents during the COVID -19 pandemic. Increase Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Benefits : Counties appreciate the $15 billion in contingency funding for SNAP to help states and localities meet unexpected costs provided for in P.L. 116 -136. Given the proven effectiveness of SNAP as a counter -cyclical economic program, we encourage Congress to provide a uniform SNAP benefit increase of 15 percent to help low -income families cope with the economic impacts of the crisis, stimulate local economie s and relieve pressure on other county human services programs. Restore Advance Refunding Bonds : Municipal bonds allow state and local governments to immediately finance critical projects that support our nation's infrastructure needs while protecting th e economy during a crisis. Restoring governments' ability to advance refund tax -exempt municipal bonds would free up billions of dollars that state s and local governments could invest in other critical infrastructure projects, such as hospitals and other p ublic health facilities. To ensure that local governments can adequately respond to immediate infrastructure needs as a result of COVID -19, America's counties urge you to restore advance refunding that would provide savings to taxpayers. Establish Mandatory Funding for Payments In -Lieu of Taxes (PILT) : The PILT program helps to offset costs incurred by counties in 49 states for services provided to federal employees, the public and to the users of federal public lands. Approximately 61 per cent of counties nationwide have non -taxable federal public lands within their jurisdictions and use PILT funding to pay for public health crisis management and emergency responses, among other key services. County governments need stable revenue streams i n these times of economic stress and request full, long -term and mandatory funding of the PILT program, as laid out in legislation such as H.R. 3043, the Permanently Authorizing PILT Act , or S. 2480, the PILT Reauthorization Act . Additionally, counties und er 5,000 in population are not on a level playing field due to the PILT formula's population tiers. National Association of Counties | 4 Counties ask that Congress include the minor formula change laid out in S. 2180/H.R. 3716, the Small County PILT Parity Act , which would create new populati on tiers for counites under 5,000 without impacting payments to counties with larger populations. Expand Use of Secure Rural Schools (SRS) : Counties appreciate the two -year reauthorization of SRS included in the FY 2020 appropriations package. However, co unties request that important additional reforms be included to provide greater stability for national forest counties facing potential revenue shortfalls, such as stopping the annual five percent reduction in SRS payments and allowing counties to elect wh ether to receive SRS payments or timber harvest receipt sharing payments. Additionally, with many schools experimenting with online coursework in response to coronavirus quarantines, it is imperative that Congress also expand the allowable uses of SRS fund s to include broadband connectivity for educational purposes. These policies were agreed to by the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee during their markup of S. 430 in December 2019. Furthermore, the SRS program is due to expire at the end o f FY 2020. National forest counties need stable revenue streams moving forward, and ask Congress to include a long -term solution, such as S. 1643, the Forest Management for Rural Stability Act . This legislation would establish an endowment fund where inter est collected through the fund would make payments to national forest counties and schools in perpetuity and exempt them from the annual appropriations cycle. Ensure Broadband is an Option for Everyone : Access to high -speed internet is a necessity for add ressing and overcoming the challenges presented by the COVID -19 crisis. However, many rural and low -income communities continue to face barriers to broadband adoption. Municipal broadband can often provide an affordable, reliable option and help attract ad ditional investment from the industry. Currently, 25 states have imposed roadblocks or outright bans on municipal investments into broadband infrastructure. The next package should include language that would remove these roadblocks and allow for local gov ernments to invest in the necessary tools to tackle this crisis. Additionally, public health departments are being forced to expand their service footprint to effectively address this crisis. We urge you to consider updating existing progra ms like the FCC's Rural Health Care Program to help cover broadband -related costs associated with tele -health services. Repeal T -Band Spectrum Auction to Support Critical Public Safety Communications Networks : We urge you to consider repealing Section 6103 in Title VI of P.L. 112 -96 as part of a fourth response package. Without such action, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will be forced to remove public safety communications from the T -Band spectrum (470 MHz -512 MHz). As emergency medical service (EMS) providers, fire and law enforcement personnel and other critical safety workers keep our communities safe and healthy during the crisis and in the future, it is imperative that counties utilizing T -Band have conti nued access to the resources necessary to provide these life -saving services. Provide Funding and Flexibility for Elections : The unprecedented nature of the rapid spread of COVID -19 has fundamentally altered the landscape of the 2020 election cycle. With concerns over transmission of the virus, counties are working closely with federal, state and local election officials to ensure the highest level of voter access and election security, while also protecting the health and safety of our residents. We urge you to temporarily suspend the requirement for state matching funds and provide dedicated funding to assist counties with meeting any new federal voting requirements in any future package addressing COVID -19. Increase Funding for the 2020 Census : The decennial census, which aims to count every U.S. resident each decade, is critical to county governments. Counties are concerned that the rapid spread of COV ID-19 will weaken outreach efforts for a complete count of our nation's residents. While counties applaud the U.S. Census Bureau's response to the outbreak, we urge lawmakers to allocate additional funding and reevaluate the current timelines needed to ens ure a complete count for the 2020 Census. Additionally, should Congress include legislation addressing the nation's comprehensive infrastructure needs, counties urge you to also consider the significant role that we play in our nation's transportation and infrastructure systems. As owners of 45 percent of public roads and almost 40 percent of the National Bridge Inventory who also directly support 78 percent of the nation's public transit systems and 34 percent of public airports, counties are stepping up at the local National Association of Counties | 5 levels to deliver critical projects for our residents despite a lack of federal investment and many state laws that prevent us from raising local taxes to support these efforts. Counties are steadfastly committed at the local level to good financial stewardship, investing $134 billion annually in the construction of infrastructure and the operation and maintenance of public works, and the record reflects the effectiveness of local governments in putting federal dollars to work where they are needed most. As committed public servants with significant infrastructure responsibilities, counties urge Congress to consider the following recommendations : Provide Increa sed Direct Funding Opportunities for Locally Owned Infrastructure : The Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) and the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant programs are two of the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT ) most flexible direct federal funding source s for counties and can be utilized to deliver critical infrastructure projects that may be delayed due to the necessity to reallocate funds to other measures to address more immediate consequences of COVID -19. T his reallocation of funds is likely to result in a domino effect on local infrastructure that already faces a significant backlog. Counties urge Congress to appropriate considerable additional federal resources for both the BUILD and INFRA programs so that county governments may put federal dollars directly to work where they are needed most. In addition, counties also support increasing the local share of the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program (STBGP). In any future package that addresses COVID -19, counties urge Congress to infuse more federal dollars directly into the sub -allocated local area share of STBGP in order to facilitate the delivery of important transportation projects that support local economies. Return Solvency to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) : In addition to funding highway programs, public transit agencies are also funded by revenues from the HTF, including the 78 percent of those that are directly supported by counties. We appreciate the inclusion of $25 billion for public tr ansit systems in P.L. 116 -136. Additionally, counties urge lawmakers in any future package that addresses COVID -19 to return solvency to the Highway Trust Fund and pave the way for a new, long -term surface reauthorization by transferring federal funds from the Treasury's general fund (GF) to the HTF to cover its immediate shortfalls and also to determine a permanent legislative fix that will provide consistent, adequate revenue levels for the HTF. Increase Access to Capital for Small Borrowers : Counties ur ge you to include a temporary extension and permanent restoration of proven financing tools utilized by state and local governments, schools, hospitals, airports and special districts and other public sector entities to provide efficient and low cost finan cing for critical investments in infrastructure that will move the country forward. Specifically, we urge you to increase the bank qualified borrowing limit from $10 million to $30 million, and apply the limit at the borrower level, which would ensure that small local governments could provide access to capital for immediate infrastructure. Fund Key Workforce Development Programs : We urge you to include critical funding for our nation's workforce development system, specifically programs serving adults and youth under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to ensure that we can respond quickly to helping those who have lost their jobs as a result of this crisis to transition to new work opportunities and meet the demands for workers in key industries such as healthcare, manufacturing and construction. Increase Funding and Financing for Local Water Infrastructure : Counties recognize the threat that crumbling water and wastewater infrastructure poses to the health and safety of our communities. In 2016 alone, counties invested $21.6 billion in sewage and wastewater management. As Congress considers a fourth suppleme ntal package, we encourage lawmakers to increase funding for Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loans; to increase the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water State Revolving fund accounts; and to establish a water trust fu nd to provide matching funds for projects and other assistance. Preserve Access to Clean Water and Sanitation Services for Rural Counties : More than 98 percent of rural Americans receive their drinking water from small systems, the cost of which to operat e and maintain is significantly higher in comparison to urban areas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) - Rural National Association of Counties | 6 Development's Water and Wastewater Program has consistently supported funding to help small communities improve existing infrastructure, protect their drinking water resources, and comply with federal drinking water regulations. Counties urge you to increase funding for this program to assure that the highest quality drinking water and sanitation services are available to rural America during the pandemic. Ensure Impoverished Rural Counties Remain Connected : USDA -Rural Development's Electric Loan Program is a $46 billion portfolio that helps nearly 700 borrowers in 46 states finance safe, modern and efficient infrastructure. USDA -Rura l Development's financed electrical systems provide service to more than 90 percent of the nation's counties that are identified as suffering from persistent poverty, out -migration or other economic hardships. The program also provides financial assistance through High Energy Cost Grants to rural communities with extremely high energy costs to acquire, construct, extend, upgrade and otherwise improve energy generation, transmission or distribution facilities. Counties urge you to fully fund these programs t hat are critical to maintaining services to millions of rural Americans during the crisis. Local governments are facing massive challenge s in responding to the COVID -19 pandemic , and our resources are becoming more constrained by the day. As you consider developing a fourth supplemental package , we hope that you will support our efforts to effectively implement containment and community mitigation strategies that will preserve the health and safety of our residents and local communities. We thank you again for your important work and stand ready to help advance additional legislation that continues to address the widespread effects of the virus on our nation.
