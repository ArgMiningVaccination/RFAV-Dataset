But with few products tried and tested, should we believe the hype? By [Amy Corderoy](/by/amy-corderoy-hveau) Ken Harvey may well be a sucker for punishment. That's not my assessment - it's his. \"No one in their right mind would spend the time or effort needed to complain about these products,\" the adjunct associate professor in the school of public health at La Trobe University says. He is talking about complementary and alternative medicines. And he has complained about them - a lot. Inthe past three years, he has made 43 complaints to Australia's drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), about dodgy products. Of the complaints that have been assessed by the TGA's complaints resolution panel, all have been upheld. Of the nine that have yet to be assessed, a third have been waiting more than a year for a verdict. Harvey estimates he spends between two and four hours preparing each complaint. That's a lot of time, and a lot of waiting. In the process, he has become the last line of defence between Australians and the shonkiest medicine men offering to fix their ills. Harvey says the current system allows dodgy medicines on the market too easily, with companies allowed to \"list\" products on the register of therapeutic goods without external evaluation. \"The end result is a market flooded with shonky products, making it very difficult for consumers, and health professionals, to pick the small amount of evidence-based wheat from the voluminous, hype-driven chaff,\" he says. The world has a long history of salesmen selling a cure for whatever ails you: \"There is no sore it will not heal, no pain it will not subdue!\" \"Weak heart? Weak blood? Weak nerves? Well, we've got the solution for you!\" But while the medicine men of the past sold their wares in travelling shows or small shopfronts, today business is booming. Contributing to this turbocharged growth has been a decade-old, two-tier regulatory reform: a \"light-touch\" regime of self-assessment; and a more rigorous registration process backed by independent evidence. Self-assessment has seen products making health claims unsupported by evidence flood the market. Worse, the few products that are evidence-based and get through an expensive and rigorous registration process can be quickly swamped by imitators riding on their coat-tails. The result is a wild west market of so-called \"natural medicines\", where consumers can be overwhelmed by competing claims. \"It's no secret it's a $2billion business and there are more than 250 companies in Australia selling these products,\" says Nick Williams, a healthcare consultant at Roy Morgan Research. \"Over the past five years, the number of people who report buying vitamin or mineral supplements within the past six months has risen from 35.5 to 41per cent.\" That is about 7million teens and adults swallowing a huge range of products. Everything from supplements such as fish oil (which is recommended by the Heart Foundation for people who do not eat enough oily fish, although there is little evidence of a protective effect for people who don't already have heart problems) to multivitamins and echinacea. Williams says the complementary and alternative market is fascinating because of the differences in motivation people have for using them. Consumers are generally people with higher discretionary incomes, and are often women - although some products such as Berocca attract more men. \"One of the things that emerges is that people who are using complementary medicines aren't necessarily interested in evidence of efficacy,\" he says. \"Consumers like to feel in control of their own wellness ... they are mostly influenced by word-of-mouth advocacy from trusted friends.\" Many people are suspicious of mainstream pharmaceutical treatments, and a prescriptive process that may involve the doctor telling them what to do, with little chance for input. \"People perceive complementary medicines as safe, they don't perceive them as potentially causing any adverse reactions or interactions, and typically don't discuss them with their doctors,\" he says. And an interesting trend is emerging in the data. There has been a slight decrease in people saying they have purchased \"herbal products\" or natural medicines, while vitamins, minerals and supplements - generally produced by bigger companies, with bigger marketing budgets - have increased. Sales through health food shops have declined and the big supermarkets and pharmacies have grabbed a larger share of the market. A quick look at the data from two of the biggest Australian brands, Swisse and Blackmores, shows that between them in 2011 they spent nearly $50million on marketing For Swisse, its share was just $2million less than what it spent on its \"cost of sales\", thought to be the cost of producing the products, although Swisse did not confirm this. Swisse chief executive Radek Sali is energetic and passionate. Fresh from a TGA rebuke, when it cancelled the registration of a Swisse-claimed appetite suppressant, and its rebirthing under a new name, he remains upbeat. When he misses a phone call, his voicemail message says he is too busy getting people healthy. He says the Swisse advertising spend is increased by in-store advertising that big pharmacies and supermarkets insist on, and its overall marketing budget is small compared with other consumer goods. He points to a Nielsen list of top advertisers for 2012, filled with companies like McDonald's, Nestle and, ironically, Jenny Craig. \"People aren't eating healthily, and health and wellness should be our top priority,\" Sali says. \"There are people who are choosing to spend their money on their health and wellness, and it's an industry we should be championing.\" Wellness is a noble goal, but one that is hard to pin down, and test. Furthermore, almost all evidence, reviews and national health bodies say there is no credible evidence vitamin use will help otherwise healthy people stave off disease. And when you do produce an evidence-based natural medicine, selling it is costly and difficult, says Craig Weller, the managing director of natural medicine company Flordis. \"You can get these products to market quite easily in Australia, but the biggest problem is there are many disreputable companies out there who will make the same claims based on no evidence,\" he says. \"They will make the same claim but might be using a different part of the plant, or a different plant.\" The problem is Australia's dual system for regulating medicines. Products considered higher risk, including all prescription medicines and some over-the-counter and complementary medicines, are registered, meaning they are assessed by the TGA. But low-risk products made from a pre-approved list of ingredients are \"listed\" on the register with no external assessment. Weller says to get a product registered - rather than the light-touch listing process - costs about $300,000 and takes about three years. Imitator products are then \"listed\" without jumping through any hoops. Weller is dismissive of companies that claim vitamins and supplements are needed for overall \"wellness\". \"They call it wellness, whatever that means, but they are not putting anything much in their capsules and people are getting ripped off,\" he says. \"We are trying to get these products established as medicines - the fact they are herbs is just a bonus.\" Overall, Weller estimates, only about 1per cent of the complementary and alternative medicines sold in Australia today are evidence-based. So how did we get here? A key turning point was the year 2001. That was when the government introduced the system of \"self-assessment\" for certifying that low-risk complementary medicines satisfied the regulatory requirements that allowed them to be listed. Another significant blow occurred when the health department ordereda major recall of vitamins produced by Pan Pharmaceuticals, only to be sued by the company - a case it lost - according to a review released by the Auditor-General's office in 2011. By the time the Labor Party was elected, it had inherited a system in which 90per cent of products reviewed were found to be non-compliant with the regulatory requirements. \"In this context, the available evidence indicates that the regulation of complementary medicines in Australia has been of limited effectiveness,\" the Auditor-General's review found. You have to wonder whether, today, the TGA has the legal power, resources or will to deal with a hugely expanded industry, says Bruce Arnold, a law lecturer at the University of Canberra. \"It's a watchdog, but it's a watchdog that's been biffed in the past,\" he says. \"Does it have enough money to do what it is supposed to do, and does it have the perception it should be activist?\" Arnold says part of the problem is that many products make misleading claims about their benefits, which could in theory be dealt with by the TGA or the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, but in practice just fall through the cracks. \"Companies just need to tick the box that their products aren't harmful, but there's no enforcement that [the products must] actually work.\" Recently, the government has been chipping away at the problem. Legislation is before Parliament that will allow the Health Minister to intervene and remove products from the federal register. The Department of Health has also created a panel to review private health insurance subsidies - which are partially funded through taxpayer rebates - for a limited number of alternative therapies. Ana Lamaro, from the Australian Homeopathic Association, is furious about the review. On the one hand, she argues that homeopathic remedies are supported by a number of studies (largely published in homeopathic and alternative medicine journals) - but also that the structure of medical science is not suited to assessing the holistic, overall health support provided by homeopathy. She also argues that when mainstream scientific review bodies such as the Cochrane Collaboration - an international group of 28,000 experts dedicated to assessing medical evidence - have reviewed homeopathy, they have targeted areas with the weakest research. \"One has to question the motivation for taking such an approach,\" she says. Homeopathy is based on the concepts of dilution, and treating \"like with like\". So, for example, coffee can cause insomnia, and thus hugely diluted amounts of it are used to treat insomnia. Critics argue this makes little sense. But Lamaro says we should not ignore it on the basis we don't understand how it works. \"The mechanism of action should not be the stalling point regarding homeopathy,\" she says. She believes the way the private health insurance review has been set up means it will not support the homeopathic approach. It might be the only point on which Lamaro and John Dwyer, the president of Friends of Science in Medicine, would agree. He says the insurance review is vital, not for the estimated $90million the government is currently spending subsidising alternative treatments, but because removing the subsidy will send a message to the community that these treatments have been rejected. \"The really important thing will be the chief medical officer of the nation telling the community that there is no credible evidence for this. That's never happened before,\" he says. Dwyer argues people should rely on credible organisations such as the Cochrane Collaboration for overarching reviews, rather than being confused by \"cherry-picked\" evidence from natural medicine proponents. \"Credible sources show homeopathy has no role other than placebo, so unless you are the greatest conspiracy theorist of all time, [industry] claims are incredibly inaccurate,\" he says. But Dwyer, along with Arnold and Harvey, says the review itself will not be enough to protect consumers. They argue products listed through a light-touch regulatory process should be labelled as not tested by the drug regulator. And when lies are discovered, they must be actively prosecuted. But most of all, Dwyer says, political leadership is needed. \"Australians are being given the impression they can neutralise an unhealthy lifestyle with supplements,\" he says. \"People have been hoodwinked into thinking this is legitimate medicine, and we really need to crack that credibility.\" Some of what we know Echinacea It is not known whether echinacea can prevent or treat colds or flu because most preparations have not been tested in reliable clinical trials. There is no dependable information on the quantity, form or duration of an optimal dosage, and limited safety information. One clinical trial in children with colds found those taking echinacea experienced more rashes than those taking a placebo. Vitamin C Vitamin C supplements have not been shown to prevent colds or give reliable effects in treating symptoms. No clinical trials have tested the effect of vitamin C on colds in children. Most people won't experience any side effects if vitamin C is taken by mouth at the recommended doses, but taking more than 2000mg every day may cause side effects, including kidney stones and diarrhoea. Fish oil Eating oily fish several times a week as part of a healthy diet is recommended for cardiovascular health. Research shows fish-oil supplements are unlikely to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke in people who already have cardiovascular problems. Evidence of benefits in people who don't have heart disease is weak. Fish oil (omega-3 fatty acid) supplements can reduce high levels of triglycerides (a type of fat). Zinc Clinical trials have shown zinc may shorten the length of a cold and improve symptoms in generally healthy people if taken within 24 hours of symptoms appearing. But studies have not established the quantity, form or duration of an optimal dosage.
