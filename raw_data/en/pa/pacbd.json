Due to the changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, some information may have changed since the original publication date. So, you got COVID-19. Luckily, you recovered and are back to living your normal life. COVID-free, immune to any future infection, no vaccination needed. Right? Although there is some natural immunity and protection from a repeat infection of COVID-19 after recovering from the illness, it is not yet clear how long this natural immunity lasts. So, the question remains: Do you need to get vaccinated if you have already contracted and recovered from COVID-19? University of Utah Health experts, along with the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html), say yes. The COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for everyone [6 months and older](https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2022/06/covid-19-vaccines-and-children), regardless of a previous COVID-19 infection. \"While there is some evidence natural infection provides strong immunity, there is variability from person to person and less predictability than vaccine immunity,\" says [Emily Sydnor Spivak, M.D., M.H.S.](https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u0786699&name=emily-rm-sydnor-spivak), an associate professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at University of Utah Health. \"Clinical antibody tests available also are not great correlates of immunity to COVID-19 and have wide variability from test to test.\" A [recent CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_e&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM63289&ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20August%206%2C%202021&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM63289) shows that those who have had COVID-19 and are not vaccinated, are more than twice as likely than those who are fully vaccinated to contract COVID-19 for a second time. And avoiding COVID-19 also means sidestepping any potential short or long-term side effects of the disease. \"Letting people get COVID rather than a vaccine to protect them from COVID means they're at risk of severe disease, long COVID, and even death,\" Spivak says. \"I say this as we are seeing young, twenty-year-old patients being admitted with very severe disease. And even if only a few people have this unfortunate turn of events, it's not worth the risk. Please get your COVID vaccine.\" Beyond the reinfection rates, the COVID-19 vaccination helps prevent death or other potential serious side effects of COVID-19. The vaccine can also prevent you from spreading the virus to those around you and contributes to herd immunity. Unfortunately, [misconceptions](https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2021/08/facts-about-covid-19-and-vaccines) surrounding not only the COVID-19 vaccination, but the disease itself, are preventing people from choosing to get the vaccine. And with the onslaught of at-your-fingertips information surrounding the topic, it's easy to become overwhelmed or confused by the contradictory messages. Luckily, there are credible sources that do provide up-to-date, science-backed information. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) has a webpage of its own, with up-to-date information on the science of the disease, including any change in protocol or recommendations in treating and preventing COVID-19. \"If anyone has questions about the vaccine, I'm happy to provide non-judgmental support and evidence-based medical advice,\" said "}
