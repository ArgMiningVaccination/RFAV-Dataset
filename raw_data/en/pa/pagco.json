The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone ages six months and older annually. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), millions of people get the flu every year, hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized and tens of thousands of people die from flu-related causes each year. Anyone can become ill with the flu. The elderly, young children, pregnant women and individuals with chronic health conditions are more susceptible to serious health complications such as pneumonia, sinus infections, ear infections and bronchitis if they contract the illness. Hy-Vee's pharmacies make it easy for patients to receive their flu shot. With convenient hours and no appointment needed, patients can stop in anytime their local pharmacy is open to receive their flu shot. For a quicker, more convenient experience, patients can also schedule their flu vaccination and complete their vaccine consent form in advance online by visiting [www.hy-vee.com/my-pharmacy/vaccine-consent](http://www.hy-vee.com/my-pharmacy/vaccine-consent). Hy-Vee pharmacists will conduct a screening process prior to vaccination to ensure each individual is receiving the most beneficial flu vaccine for their health. Both regular- and high-dose flu vaccines are available at Hy-Vee Pharmacy locations*. Medicare and most insurance plans cover the flu vaccine and other immunizations at no charge. Currently, flu vaccines are available without a prescription during regular pharmacy hours to patients 6 months and older at Hy-Vee's Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota locations; or 3 years and older in Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin locations, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' PREP Act. Each patient who receives a flu vaccine at a Hy-Vee Pharmacy can earn a 20-cent Hy-Vee Fuel Saver + Perks reward, which can be redeemed at any Hy-Vee Fast & Fresh or Dollar Fresh Market fuel location. See [www.Hy-Vee.com](http://www.hy-vee.com/) for details. Restrictions apply. Hy-Vee will also be offering workplace vaccination clinics using its fleet of Hy-Vee Healthy You Mobiles and Hy-Vee Health mobile trailers. Employers who wish to schedule an onsite clinic for their employees can email [vaccineclinic@hy-vee.com](mailto:vaccineclinic@hy-vee.com) for more details. Clinics are typically held September through November. "}
