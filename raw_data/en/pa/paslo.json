We anticipate the income to be as projected, assuming a 10% non -renewal rate for these categories: Veterinary renewals: 2400 x = $180,000 crematory renewals: 19 $400 = 7,600 15% assumed non -renewal rate: Certified veterinary technicians: 935 x $100 = $93,500 License reinstatements are also included in this item = approximately $5, 000 Total renewal fees for licenses/certificates = $1,246,1 00 x 90% = $1, 121,490 (10% goes to General Fund) Note: Credit card convenience fees collected will increase revenue initially ($4.00 per transaction - assume 10% increase in online use from FY17) = $7,280. However, credit card discount fees paid (as a deduction to revenue) is expected to be approximately $14,560. Thus, the licensee is paying one half of the approximate $8.00 convenience fee taken by the credit card companies and the Board 's revenues are deducted by one half of the $8.00 fee. 4REVENUE SCHEDULE - AZ VETERINARY MEDICAL EXAMINING BOARD EXPLANATION FOR SIGNIFICANT D ECREASE IN EXAM FEES (4 312) & PROFESSIONAL LICENSES (4415) PROJECTED FOR FY18 AND FUTURE YEARS With the initiation of the availability of fee waivers (HB2372), revenues for examination fees and licensing are expected to decrease. Because the agency has no data to know at this early stage the percentage of future applicants who may qualify for the fee waiver, the assumptions below have been made with the belief that most applicants are students, who will likely qua lify: Veterinary applicants: assume 40% will qualify = 92 applicants Exam revenue decrease = $27,600 License fee decrease = $27,600 CVT applicants: assume 50% will qualify = 82 applicants Exam revenue decrease = $12,300 Certificate fee decrease = $4,100 Total Examination Fee loss = $39,900 Total Licensing/Certification Fee loss = $31,700 $ 71,600 TOTAL REVENUE DECREASE 5Sources and Uses of Funds State Veterinary Medical Examining Board Agency: Estimate FY 2018Actual FY 2017Estimate FY 20192078 Veterinary Medical Examiners Board Fund Fund: Cash Flow Summary Balance Forward from Prior Year 1,485.5 2,181.8 1,670.7 Revenue (From 2,211.7 Estimate FY 2018Actual FY Expenditure 234.2 359.2 359.2 Employee Related Expenses 77.5 116.7 116.7 Prof. And Outside Services 37.5 37.7 99.4 Travel - In State 5.4 4.5 4.5 Travel - Out of State 0.0 1.6 1.6 Food 0.0 0.0 0.0 Aid to Organizations and Individuals 0.0 0.0 0.0 Other Operating Expenses 161.0 68.8 75.0 Equipment 2.6 1.5 1.5 Capital Outlay 0.0 0.0 0.0 Debt Service 0.0 0.0 0.0 Cost Allocation 0.0 0.0 0.0 Transfers 3.8 0.0 0.0 522.1 590.0 657.9 Expenditure Categories Total: Non-Lapsing Authority from Prior Years 0.0 0.0 0.0 Administrative Adjustments 2.0 3.0 0.0 Capital Projects (Land, Buildings,Improvements) 0.0 0.0 0.0 Appropriated 27th Pay Roll 0.0 0.0 0.0 Legislative Fund Transfers 0.0 0.0 0.0 IT Project Transfers 0.0 0.0 0.0 524.1 593.0 657.9 Appropriated Expenditure Total: 4.0 6.0 6.0 Apppropriated FTE: Fund Description Revenues consist primarily of license and applications fees.

ADAMS) SHARED FACILITY COSTS I SSUE DESCRIPTION/HOW RECOMMENDING AGENCY'S REQUEST FURTHERS THE AGENCY'S MANDATES: With the agency's required move in early 2018 (FY18) to the 1740 W. Adams building, the agency has partnered with the other agencies and Central Services Bureau to share some common costs that will be required. PR OPOSAL: Please see the attached \"ADOA FY201 9 Budget Issue\" document created by the ADOA General Accounting Office/Central Services Bureau (CSB). This proposal includes funding for: (1) shared services such as security guards for the main lobby, phones in common meeting rooms, wi/fi, and a new E -fax solution; and (2) shared costs for an administrative staff member allocated to/managed by C SB to staff the lobby service windows. A LTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION: Please see the attached \"ADOA FY201 9 Budget Issue\" document created by the ADOA General Accounting Office/Central Services Bureau (CSB) I MPACT OF NOT FUNDING THIS F ISCAL YEAR: The agency's FY18 appropriation does not include coverage for these costs. Without funding in FY19 and in future years, the agency would not be able to pay its share along with the other 26 agencies being moved to 1740 W. Adams. Please also see the attached \"ADOA FY201 9 Budget Issue\" document created by the ADOA General Accounting Office/Central Services Bureau (CSB). ST ATUTORY REFERENCE: Please see the attached \"ADOA FY201 9 Budget Issue\" document created by the ADOA General Accounting Office /Central Services Bureau (CSB) . EQ TO BE PURCHASED: None CL ASSIFICATION OF NEW POSITIONS: None for the Veterinary Board. 12 Please also see the attached \"ADOA FY201 9 Budget Issue\" document created by the ADOA General Accounting Office/Central Services Bureau (CSB). ANNUALIZATIONS: Please see the attached \"ADOA FY201 9 Budget Issue\" document created by the ADOA General Accounting Office/Central Services Bureau (CSB) for totals expected for the Arizona Veterinary Medical Examining Board. These allocated costs include: Shared BUDGET ISSUE Summary: The Arizona Department of Administration requests an increase from the Special Services Fund in the GAO Division of $ 186,598 to fund AD4208. P rogram: General Accounting Office/Office of the Controller/Central Services Bureau D escription of issue and how recommending the agency's request furthers the agency's mandates : The Central Services Bureau (CSB) will be relocating to the 1740 West Adams Street building along with 27 other boards, commissions, and agencies. In an effort to consolidate core building costs, it has been proposed that CSB will be billed for 3 armed guards, building WIFI, common area phones, common area data center charges, and efax services. CSB will also provide an administrative positio n located in the building lobby. CSB is asking for an appropriation increase for consolidated building costs of $150,889 and 1- FTE $35,709. Total request $186,598. P roposal : This shared services model will enable vendors to have one point of contact within the building which will enable the state to respond faster. Vendors will also be able to provide a single invoice for service, rather than one for each agency in the building. This will drive efficiencies not only for the vendor, but also for the state. The proposed shared costs are: S hared Cost Annualized Security Guards Armed 111,478 Building -Wide Wi-Fi 9,118 Common Room Phones IP 10,305 Common Room Network 7,988 eFax Solution 12,000 Total $ 150,889 B y sharing an administrative assistant position in the lobby, each agency will not require its own FTE. The current building model is such that constituents will not have access to floors 2 -4. All board rooms will be located on the first floor, as well as windows that will serve as the first point of contact for constituents. Several of the larger agencies w ill have a dedicated window using current FTEs, however approximately 20 of the smaller agencies will need CSB assistance to staff an FTE on the first floor to assist constituents and stakeholders. CSB will bill the agencies for actual expenditures related to the shared building costs . Cost allocation for the shared building costs will be based on each agency's square footage in the buildings space allocation plan as detailed below. The costs for the shared administrative assistant position in the lobby will be allocated to the participating agencies as a percentage of their total FTE count as detailed below. 14Agency/Board/Commission Square Foot Allocation % Occupancy Dollar Allocation Medical 100% Measures to display the effects of the proposal: Current Performance Measures for Issue: (without proposed change) Performance Measure Type FY 16 Actual FY 1 7 Actual FY 1 8 Expected FY 1 9 Expected FY 20 Expected Customer satisfaction with CSB QL N/A N/A 6.5 6.5 6.5 15Expected Performance Measures for Issue: (with proposed change) Performance Measure Type FY 1 6 Actual FY 1 7 Actual FY 1 8 Expected FY 1 9 Expected FY 20 Expected Customer satisfaction with CSB QL N/A N/A 6.5 6.5 6.5 A lternatives considered and reasons for rejection : The alternative would be for each agency to contract individually with vendors for services. The shared constituent window that CSB will staff, could be replaced by a phone and list, where the constituent could call up to the agency, and have the agency come down and respond as needed. This does not however align with the states approach of deciding faster, responding faster, resolving faster, or saving taxpayer dollars. I mpact of not funding t his fiscal year: CSB would not be able to provide the agencies with the level of service that is required or needed to drive efficiencies in the 1740 building. S tatutory reference : Although there is no statutory or legal mandate that requires this be the course of action, there is statutory authority to use the Special Services revolving fund in this manner in A.R.S. \u00a7 35- 193.02. E quipment to be purchased, if applicable : None C lassification of new positions - 1 - FTE , Administrative Assistant II, Grade 15, Job code AUN06609, Salary $25,507, ERE $10,202 (calculated at 40%) . Total for FTE is $35,709. Cost allocation for Administrative Assistant II will be based on each participating agency's current FTE count (not all agencies will be using the shared window: the Medical Board, Board of Nursing, and Cosmetology Board will each service their own windows).

PROPOSAL: The Board proposes that an IT contractor provide services to modify several sections of the agency's database and online license renewal system to: Enhance the online license renewal system with new features that were suggested by customer input to improve ease of use. This system was launched in FY17 and will be used again in FY19. Improve ability to capture all email addresses as the agency moves toward email notifications of announcements, renewal notices, etc. Add capability to record and search licensees by previous last name. This will aid staff as well as the public when searching for a veterinarian. Increase public information by adding the type of license issued to veterinarians on the website directory (i.e. Faculty, Specialty, State Employee, Regular licenses) Modify the mailing address selections and reports to aid in the creation of accurate licensee directories (public record requests). This project would also include up to 20 hours of IT support to assist upon request during the FY19 license renewal cycle. Improving ease of use of the online license renewal system for customers will encourage use of the system moving into the future, saving agency funds and resources that would otherwise be spent on processing renewal applications by hand. Adding more automated featu res to provide public information and create reports that are used for a variety of analytical functions in the agency will also provide cost savings overall and increase productivity. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION: Alternatives considered included addressing each of the above tasks individually over several years, or not completing them at all. The improvements for the online license renewal system must be completed by October 2018 to be ready for the late 2018 license renewal cyc le, thus waiting to complete this item was rejected. Because the Board receives many public record requests related to licensee contact information, the agency finds it a priority to improve productivity by moving this process from one where staff must cr eate an Excel spreadsheet to sort individuals and verify that the agency is not disclosing personal information, to an automated electronic process. 18 IMPACT OF NOT FUNDING THIS FISCAL YEAR: Without the FY19 funding, tasks that must occur prior to the FY1 9 license renewal system will be left incomplete, leaving some gaps in the flow and information gathering contained in that application. Board staff can continue to create licensee directories largely by individual input into a spreadsheet; however, this is a very slow process that could easily be replaced by funding this task in FY19.

PROPOSAL: The Board expects to launch its Monitored Aftercare and Treatment Program (MATP) for licensees and certificate holders in mid -FY18. The MATP will allow individuals to self -refer into a confidential (if eligible) treatment program that is operated by a private contractor identified through the State Procurement process. The Board may also mandate individuals to participate in the program by Board Order or Consent Agreement. The MATP will include mandatory evaluation by an addiction specialist (physician), participation in a treatment plan, drug and/or alcohol random testing, and participation in support groups. At this stage, prior to launch of the program, it is unknown how many individuals will participate, but the number is expected to increase each year as the program is publicized by various means. While most costs would be paid by the individual, the agency is expected to incur costs related to consultations and expert witness assistance by the Program's medical professional staff . In the early stages of program initiation, the Board is projecting the need fo r 50 hours of the program's Medical Director or designee's time as follows: Estimated hourly fee: $325 Estimated hours: 50 Total cost: $16,500 per year ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION: The Board could choose not to offer a p rogram; however, based on the interest expressed by the regulated community, the Board's interest in furthering its goals of protecting the public and animals, and the increased community interest in assisting those impacted by substance abuse issues, moving forward with the program is preferred. IMPACT OF NOT FUNDING THIS FISCAL YEAR: The projected cost of $16,500 would not be easily absorbed by the Board's typical operating expense budget. Without the additional funding each year moving forward, the Board may have to discontinue the program or significantly decrease the number of individuals who could participate in the program at any one time. 23 STATUTORY REFERENCE: A.R.S. \u00a732-2209 notes that the Board may establish a plan for the treatment and rehabilitation of licensees or certificate holders who are impaired by alcohol or drug abuse. The program is expected to include education, intervention, therapeutic treatment and post -treatm ent monitoring and support. A.R.S. \u00a732- 2209(C) notes that the Board may allocate up to five percent from each fee collected from the renewal of veterinary licenses for implementation of this program. Currently, the license renewal fee for veterinarians i s $400 ($20 per renewal toward MATP implementation). In FY17, 2229 veterinarians renewed licenses, thus 5% of the total renewal fee collected would allow $44,58 0 of agency funds to be expended on the MATP. This program is also authorized by A.R.S. \u00a732-3233. EQUIPMENT TO BE PURCHASED: None CLASSIFICATION OF NEW POSITIONS: None at this time ANNUALIZATIONS: TOTAL REQUESTED: $ 16,500 ongoing 24FY19 FUNDING ISSUE - #4 LEGAL FEES ISSUE DESCRIPTION/HOW RECOMMENDING AGENCY'S REQUEST FURTHERS THE AGENCY'S MANDATES: Services provided by the Arizona Attorney General's Office (AG) are essential to the core components of the agency's operation by providing legal services to the Board. For FY18, fees charged by the AG's office have increased and are expected to increase further in FY19. PROPOSAL: I ncreased funding to cover the FY18 AG costs as outlined in the FY18 Interagency Service Agreement (ISA) is needed. AG costs have been increasing each fiscal year. FY17: $23,200 FY18: $24,800 (7% FY19: $3,336 (difference between FY17 actual paid and FY19 projected). ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION: The agency's ISA with the Arizona Attorney General's Office includes services provided by an Assistant Attorney General (AAG) at the .21 FTE level . Decreasing the amount of time requested of the AAG was considered, which would decrease the total amount charged to the agency on an annual basis. This alternative was rejected, as staff has already traditionally taken on some tasks that could be done by the AG's office, and the need for the AAG is unpredictable due to the unknown complaint case load and case appeals that may occur each year. IMPACT OF NOT FUNDING THIS FISCAL YEAR: The agency's operating costs have gradually risen over the past several years. Due to open staff positions at various times, the increased operating costs were covered by the personnel savings. However, the agency expects to be fully staffed and there may not be excess funds to cover these increased operating costs which offer little opportunity for the agency to decrease. STATUTORY REFERENCE: A.R.S. \u00a732- 2206 notes that the Board may contract with other State or federal agencies as required to carry out its duties. EQUIPMENT TO BE PURCHASED: None CLASSIFICATION OF NEW POSITIONS: None ANNUALIZATIONS: TOTAL REQUESTED: $ 3,336 ongoing 25 FY19 FUNDING ISSUE - #5 ONLINE LICENSE VERIFICATION SERVICE ISSUE DESCRIPTION/HOW RECOMMENDING AGENCY'S REQUEST FURTHERS THE AGENCY'S MANDATES: The Board's Strategic Plan includes developing additional ways to provide online customer services that are more cost -effective and better meet customer expectations. PROPOSAL: The Board proposes to initiate an IT project, implemented by an IT contractor, to create the ability for licensees to request for a license verification online and pay for it via credit card. Currently, this process cannot be completed through the Board's website and payment must be via a method other than credit card. Once developed, a licensee could log in to his/her online account that has likely already been set up during the online license renewal process. A request for a license verification would then only involve the customer providing direction on where to send the verification and the quantity desired. The system would flag staff to complete the request. The agency would utilize the State's Web Portal processing system for credit card payments, saving staff time of opening mail, recording payments, and making deposits. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION: The Board can keep its current process of requiring a writ ten request (via email, fax, in -person, or mail) and collecting the required fee via cash, check, or money order. This process is more time consuming for both Board staff and the customer, but accomplishes the goal. The Board prefers to streamline the process and improve ease of transaction for the customer . IMPACT OF NOT FUNDING THIS FISCAL YEAR: If the project is not funded, the agency will be unable to initiate the project. While the license verification service can operate adequately as is, the desired new ordering/payment system would be more highly efficient and cost -effective. STATUTORY REFERENCE: A.A.C.

Implementing the law requires efforts to determine eligibility. PROPOSAL: Per guidance provided by the Governor's Office, the agency should utilize services provided by the Arizona Department of Revenue (DOR) , which will determine if an individual meets the qualifications for a fee waiver. DOR has notified agencies that each eligibility determination will incur a fee of $10 paid by the requesting agency. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION: The agency does not have the experience or knowledge in determining eligibility, which are services usually provided by agencies such as the Department of Economic Security and DOR . Since the Governor's staff recommended use of DOR as a reference to fulf ill this statutory requirement, the agency did not consider other alternatives. IMPACT OF NOT FUNDING THIS FISCAL YEAR: T his requirement is new, effective in August 2017; therefore, the agency had not planned for this extra expense in FY18 or moving for ward. STATUTORY REFERENCE: A.R.S. \u00a741- 1080.01 (HB2372) - Is a new requirement of an agency to waive any fee for an initial license for a first -time applicant whose family income does not exceed two -hundred percent of the federal poverty guidelines. EQUIPMENT TO BE PURCHASED: None CLASSIFICATION OF NEW POSITIONS: None ANNUALIZATIONS: TOTAL REQUESTED in FY19: $1,740 Based on projected 174 applicants (40% of veterinarians and 50% of CVT applicants in one year ) requesting the fee waiver @ $10 per verification by the Arizona Department of Revenue. 28 FY19 FUNDING ISSUE - #7 DOCUMENT IMAGING/MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ISSUE DESCRIPTION/HOW RECOMMENDING AGENCY'S REQUEST FURTHERS THE AGENCY'S MANDATES: Operating at maximum efficiency requires the agency to lessen its burden on paper files. The agency currently has files that could be scanned and managed via a document imaging service and management system. PROPOSAL: It is understood that ADOA may award a document imaging/management contract in fall 2017. The agency proposes to begin exploration in FY18 for use of this method, and assume that the project would be funded and built in steps. The initial planning would occur in FY19 and include working with the contractor to scan selected documents. Any required software and/or hardware would be purchased als o, as funding allowed. As more information is released about the contract awarded and the services and products that can be provided, the agency can better project steps of implementation and related costs. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION: Several years ago, the agency researched options for a document imaging/management system but found the price prohibitive. IMPACT OF NOT FUNDING THIS FISCAL YEAR: With the agency's move to 1740 W. Adams, there will be significantly less space in which to place file cabinets filled with paper files. Ideally, those files that can be converted to digital files and appropriately organized, would be digitized, freeing up space and eventually lowering rent costs. Ideally, all agencies would now have information related to the contract that may be awarded for these services. However, since that is not available, the agency is choosing to estimate costs for FY19 rather than make no request at all. If the agency waits to request funding through the FY20 budgeting process, the operation of a document imaging/management system could not begin until at least mid -2019.
