Personally, I believe that vaccination is a very personal issue and prefer to educate my patients on making their own choices, but note that deciding when and how to vaccinate can be useful factors in this choice. For these latest corona virus vaccinations, I consider that it is good social responsibility to vaccinate, to protect yourself, to protect those around you, and those in the community. We need to learn to live with this virus, and those which will follow, and finding a way to lessen the effect of the virus on the community and those at risk is imperative. I appreciate that there are those who have noted side effects, but in the big picture, these seem to be less detrimental to actually getting and transmitting the virus. Again, these opinions are mine, and do not reflect how I support the individuals choices to go ahead with their own decisions. For those who are about to vaccinate, or are mid-way through their journey on this, it is definitely worth considering supporting your immune system before as well as after the jab. Supplements can also be useful, as follows: Probiotics: there is strong evidence supporting the important role of the microbiota in maintaining a healthy host immunity, and supporting gut microbiome with prebiotic and probiotic oral supplementation may be a part in the management of COVID-19 vaccine induced adverse reactions. Taking these 1-2 weeks before vaccination is strongly recommended. Vitamin D is commonly low, especially in severe COVID-19 patients. This often reflects in their high inflammatory response. Taking vitamin D prior vaccination and throughout winter is recommended. Vitamin C and Zinc can be helpful in supporting healthy tissue response to inflammation, and would be key in managing a healthy immune system. Lifestyle: - Don't smoke - Eat a nutritionally dense diet - Exercise regularly - Maintain healthy weight - Avoid excessive alcohol intake - Get sufficient sleep (7-8 hours of actual sleep every night, as opposed to time in bed) - Manage and minimise stress - Spent time outdoors, enjoying fresh air Other management of good immunity can include taking herbal tinctures. I maintain a full dispensary of herbs, and am happy to make up a blend suited to your particular health needs, during an appointment. For any immune or general health support, please book in for an appointment with me, to get the best from your health over the winter "}
