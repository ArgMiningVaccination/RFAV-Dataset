While we are happy that the vaccine is becoming more widely available, we know that taking difficult steps, like restricting visitation, is still necessary to help us keep our patients and our staff safe.\" Please note: masks will still be required to be worn by everyone, regardless of vaccination status. In early April, Beaumont will release additional information and visitation guidelines for people who have been fully vaccinated. All of Beaumont's hospitals are safe and remain open to all patients needing health care including emergency visits, testing and surgery. Patients should continue to go to any Beaumont Emergency Department for medical issues that need urgent attention. Starting March 25 at 8 a.m., and until further notice, the following visitation restrictions are in effect for all Beaumont campuses: No one will be allowed in rooms of patients with pending or positive COVID-19 tests except for individuals who are approaching the end-of-life, patients under 21 years of age, women in labor, or other extreme circumstances where the benefits of presence outweigh the risk of COVID-19 exposure. All exceptions must be approved by clinical leadership. For patients who do not have COVID-19, one family/friend may be present in the following situations: - Person who is in serious or critical condition. - Person being evaluated for hospice care or near the end-of-life. Additional family may take turns at their loved one's bedside (two people are permitted at the bedside). - Adult with disability who needs help with communicating or managing anxiety. Person undergoing a surgical procedure. - When required for support, and arrangements are made in advance, person having an outpatient test or procedure. - Each site determines whether a support person may stay after the patient is received by an Emergency Center (EC) staff member. Please check upon your arrival to the EC. - Woman in labor or with pregnancy complications. A doula in addition to the designated partner is permitted. - Children who are 21 years of age or under. Two parents are permitted. Exceptions only apply if a family member or friend screens negative for symptoms of respiratory infection. Anyone under the age of 16 is restricted from visiting, except under extreme circumstances. After a visit is complete, everyone must leave the hospital and cannot remain in waiting areas, public areas or cafeterias. \"We decided to restrict visitors after thoughtful conversations with our physicians, nurses and staff. We know that families are critical to the healing process,\" Beaumont Health Chief Nursing Officer Susan Grant, RN, said. \"It's troubling to see COVID-19 numbers climbing again just as more vaccine is finally starting to become available.
