Experts say the Government doesn't need to send them back [Gareth Hutchens](https://www.abc.net.au/news/gareth-hutchens/12002796) Let's introduce a concept to our political discussion. It's called \"iatrogenic unemployment\". It draws on the word \"iatrogenesis,\" which is a combination of two words in ancient Greek \u2014 \"iatro\" means healer or doctor, and \"genesis\" means origin. Iatrogenesis refers to something originating from a doctor. In the medical community, the word is used to describe a situation where a doctor, whose job is to care for someone, makes a patient's condition worse through negligence, error, or misdiagnosis. It is also used to explain side effects of treatment. Like hair loss from chemotherapy. The hair loss was not the point of the treatment, but it wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the treatment. Let's apply the concept to economics. Australia has seen \"iatrogenic unemployment\" this year. The Federal Government's decision to close international borders and shutter parts of the economy to prevent COVID-19 spreading has caused the worst recession in 90 years. Its intention was not to make people unemployed, but unemployment resulted from its efforts to prevent the health system being overwhelmed by a virus. Is it useful to draw on the concept of iatrogenesis in this way? I think it's illuminating. It focuses the mind on how economic policies have flow-on effects, and how a policymaker's \"intentions\" can colour how we feel about the consequences of their policies. The Government didn't intend to cause unemployment this year, but it still happened For instance, we know the Federal Government didn't intend to cause unemployment this year. We also know it was conscious that its efforts to prevent COVID-19 spreading would lead to extreme unemployment, and that's why it extended hundreds of billions of dollars in financial assistance to workers and businesses. Those details matter. Our recession wasn't caused by government negligence. It was caused by emergency public health measures. Therefore, the Government wasn't to blame. However, remember how the medical community uses the word \"iatrogenesis\" in two senses? In one (negative) sense, the word is used to describe a situation where an expert causes harm through negligence, misdiagnosis, or error. In the other (neutral) sense, it describes a situation where necessary treatment causes unwanted side effects. But what if an expert or policymaker deliberately causes harm? That would be far more serious than negligence. That's why doctors swear variations of the Hippocratic Oath to \"first, do no harm\". Could deliberate harm also be called iatrogenic? I guess it could, by definition. That means there's another way to think about iatrogenic unemployment. It's generally accepted that the Federal Government's JobKeeper program has benefited the economy by keeping millions of workers employed and attached to their workplace. But what about the level of [unemployment in the university sector this year](/news/2020-10-02/university-sector-new-era-as-international-students-reform-hit/12654828)? Australia's public universities claim the Government has deliberately chosen to exclude them from the JobKeeper program, with a series of rules (and rule changes) that have [kept JobKeeper payments out of the reach of university staff](/news/2020-09-18/new-york-university-receives-jobkeeper-australian-unis-miss-out/12676956). Universities Australia says it expects 21,000 job losses in the sector by the end of the year (and the union is concerned that that doesn't take into account the entire number of casual positions that will disappear). Let's turn to social policy. In the medical literature, the concept of \"iatrogenic poverty\" already exists. It describes a situation where the healthcare costs for an individual or family become so extreme that it pushes them into poverty. It also refers to a situation where death or serious illness strikes a household's income earner or earners, damaging the household's ability to earn income. If the chain of events depletes the household's wealth, it can impact the education of their children and push the next generation into poverty. JobSeeker cut reportedly pushed 370k back into poverty But what would you call it if a government policy knowingly caused poverty? Would that be iatrogenic poverty, too? This year, the Federal Government's stimulus payments have lifted hundreds of thousands of Australians out of poverty temporarily. Its \"coronavirus supplement\", [which was worth $550 a fortnight (or $39 a day) when it was introduced earlier this year](/news/2020-03-23/coronavirus-supplement-payment-what-is-it-and-how-to-apply/12080326), was given to welfare recipients on top of their eligible income support payments, and immediately lifted 425,000 people out of poverty. But last month, [the Government reduced the size of the fortnightly supplement from $550 to $250 ](/news/2020-07-21/jobkeeper-jobseeker-extended-rates-cut-coronavirus-morrison/12475716)(and the $250 payment could disappear completely on December 31). It was against the advice of social policy experts and economists, ostensibly done to ween people off the emergency-level payment and encourage people to start looking for work again. The decision pushed 370,000 people back into poverty, according to modelling from The Australia Institute. Dr Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said with just one job available for every 12 people looking at the moment, and over twice that number in regional Australia, the cut in the supplement condemned hundreds of thousands of people to poverty. And if the remaining portion of the supplement is abolished later this year, it would compound the damage, she said. \"There are a lot of things that are not in our control in this pandemic but one thing that the Government does have control over is ensuring that everyone has enough to cover the basics of life, including a safe place to live,\" Dr Goldie said. What could happen if the Government kept JobSeeker around? She said if the coronavirus supplement was left in place \u2014 effectively boosting the size of the JobSeeker unemployment benefit (previously called Newstart) \u2014 it would keep millions of Australians out of poverty with the stroke of a pen. It's not just the people receiving the unemployment benefit who suffer when the payment's cut \u2014 it's the communities they spend money in too. Deloitte Access Economics has found the cut to the coronavirus supplement will cost the economy $31 billion (in lost economic activity) and 145,000 jobs over the next two years. Last month, 49 prominent economists were asked what government programs they'd like to see in coming years. A majority said the two most effective programs in the next 24 months would be boosting social housing and permanently increasing JobSeeker. The Melbourne University economist John Freebairn, one of those surveyed, said there had been no real increase in Newstart since 1993 \u2014 which was 27 years ago \u2014 and many Australians relying on the payment were in demonstrable poverty. Which brings us back to iatrogenesis. When doctors realise a treatment they've prescribed has been doing more harm than good, regardless of their original intention, they'll change the treatment and look for different solutions to improve their patient's health. But doctors are bound by the principle to first do no harm. Governments are not. As demonstrated this year by the lockdowns, governments aren't faced with a binary choice between protecting the economy and caring for the vulnerable. As the economist Chris Richardson told the National Press Club last month, \"protecting lives, and protecting livelihoods, turns out to be the same thing\". "}
