Constipation can broadly be defined as the passage of stools less frequently than the patient's own normal pattern.2 Stools are often dry and hard, and may be abnormally large or small.3 In the clinical consultation, if a person continues to complain about constipation after a discussion of what is normal and what is abnormal (especially with respect to frequency), they are asking for help in managing their problem. In children, the signs and symptoms of constipation may be different and may be poorly recognised. They can include infrequent bowel activity, foul smelling wind and stools, excessive flatulence, irregular stool texture, passing occasional enormous stools or frequent small pellets, withholding or straining to stop passage of stools, soiling or overflow, abdominal pain, distension or discomfort, poor appetite, lack of energy, an unhappy, angry or irritable mood and general malaise.4 What is meant by \"normal\"? Establishing what is 'normal' for a particular person, and whether or not the person has constipation, can be difficult. Bowel habits vary widely.5 The commonest reported frequency of bowel movements is once per day,6,7 but a Swedish survey found that this was reported by only 20% of respondents.7 A UK survey identified that a frequency of less than three bowel movements per week was more common in women than men.6 Definitions used for constipation The diagnosis of constipation is often arbitrary and is largely dependent on the patient's per ception of \"normal\" bowel function. Doctors often define constipation based on stool frequency,8 but patients define constipation as a multi- symptom disorder that includes infrequent bowel movements, hard/lumpy stool, st raining, bloating, feeling of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement and abdominal discomfort.9 The Rome III criteria were developed to provide a working definition of chronic constipation.10 The criteria highlight the difference between stool frequency and stool form and emphasise that infrequent bowel movements alone do not necessarily define constipation (See Box ONE ). Although symptoms of constipation are assessed over the prior 3 months, patients must be symptomatic for at least 6 months prior to diagnosis. 10 While these criteria stand as a guideline Glossar y Chronic constipation Constipation lasting longer than 3 months Functional constipation Chronic constipation without a known cause.

Patients with constipation typically point to type 1 and type 2 bowel movements as their predominant stool form. What should be advised about the role of lifestyle in preventing and treating constipation? Many guidelines recommend general lifestyle modifications before considering drug treatment. Traditionally, individuals with chronic constipation are told to increase dietary fibre intake in order to alleviate symptoms, but there is little evidence from randomised contro lled trials (RCTs) that this approach is of any benefit. 25,26 However, observational studies suggest a beneficial ef fect of dietary fibre in constipated patients.27,28 In general, the diet should be balanced and contain whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. This is recommended as part of the treatment for constipation. It is also recommended for general health and promoted by the 'five-a-day' policy. Fibre intake should be increased gradually (to minimise flatulence and bloating) and maintained for life. Adults should aim to consume 18-30g fibre per day. (As a guide, a medium-sized bowl of porridge contains aro und 2g of fibre; 2 slices of brown bread contain 2.5g of fibre). Although the effects of a high fibre diet may be seen in a few days, it may take as long as 4 weeks. Adequate fluid intake is important (particularly with a high fibre diet or fibre supplements), but can be difficult for some peop le (e.g. frail or elderly). Fruits high in fibre and sorbitol, and fruit juices high in sorbitol can help prevent and treat constipation. Fruits (and their juices) that have a high sorbitol content include apples, apricots, gooseberries, grapes (and raisins), peaches, pears, plums (and prunes), raspberries, and strawberries. The concentration of sorbitol is about 5-10 times higher in dried fruit. In addition, exercise and increasing fluid intake are often recommended to treat constipation, but again, there is insufficient evidence that these interventions help in chronic constipation.27 Despite limited data supporting their use in clinical practice, the suggested lifestyle changes promote general health and may improve bowel symptoms in some patients.29-32 Another behavioural modification to consider includes ensuring that patients spend an adequate amount of time on the toilet for bowel movements, preferably at a regularly scheduled time (typically in the morning to coincide with the body's natural gastrocolic response). In children, NICE4 indicate that dietary interventions alone should NOT be used as first- line treatment for idiopathic constipation. Constipation in children should be treated with laxatives and a combination of: Negotiated and non-punitive behavioural interventions suited to the child or young person's stage of development. These could include scheduled toileting and support to establish a regular bowel habit, maintenance and discussion of a bowel diary, information on constipation, and use of encouragement and rewards systems Dietary modifications to ensure a balanced diet and sufficient fluids are consumed Advise parents, children and young people that a balanced diet should include: Adequate fluid intake Adequate fibre. Recommend including foods with high fibre content. Do not recommend unprocessed bran, which can cause bloating and flatulence and reduce the absorption of micronutrients Drugs used in the management of chronic constipation A variety of treatment options are available for patients with chronic constipation, ranging from older over-the-counter (OTC) laxatives to more recently developed prescription drugs. A majority (96%) of patients who seek consultation for constipation will have already attempted self-medication with OTC products.33 In spite of these different treatment approaches, there remains a s ubstantial unmet need in the treatment of chronic constipation.34 Laxatives are divided into the following main groups: Bulk-forming laxatives Stimulant laxatives Faecal softeners Osmotic laxatives Bowel cleansing preparations (not covered in this review) There are also newer agents for managing constipation that do not fit into any of these traditional groups: Peripheral opioid-receptor antagonists 5HT 4-receptor agonists This simple classification di sguises the fact that some laxatives have a complex action. Guidance about which laxative(s) to use in adults With the exception of relatively recent evidence comparing the efficacy of macrogols with lactulose (see later), there is limited clinical evidence on whic h to judge the comparative efficacy of individual laxatives. Therefore management of chronic constipation in adults is largely based on expert opinion.3 Begin by relieving faecal loading/impaction, if present. Set realistic expectations for the re sults of treatment of chronic constipation. Advise people about lifestyle measures and adjust any constipating medication, if possible. Exclude underlying causes (e.g. hypothyroidism, metabolic disease, anal fissure, haemorrhoids). Laxatives are recommended: if lifestyle measures are insufficient, or whilst waiting for them to take effect for people taking a constipating drug that cannot be stopped for people with other secondary causes of constipation as 'rescue' medicines for episodes of faecal loading The aim of treatment with laxa tive agents is to adjust the dose, choice, and combination of laxative to produce comfortable de faecation with soft, formed stools once or twice a day. Expert consensus opinion35 tends to favour starting treatment with a bulk-forming laxative . It is important to maintain good hydration when taking bulk-forming laxatives. This may be difficult for some people (e.g. the frail or elderly).

If stools are soft but the person still finds them difficult to pass or complains of inadequate emptying, add a stimulant laxative . Adjust the dose, choice, and combination of laxative according to symptoms, speed with which relief is required, response to treatment, and individual preference. The dose of laxative should be gradually titrated upwards (or downwards) to produce one or two soft, formed stools per day. Guidance on managing constipation in children All children and young people with idiopathic constipation should be assessed for faecal impaction.4 Use a combination of history-taking and physical examination to diagnose faecal impaction - look for overflow soiling and/or faecal mass palpable abdominally and/or rectally if indicated. If impaction is present, see the section on disimpaction if needed. If impaction is not present or has been treated, treat the child promptly with a laxative (even if the history of constipation is very short). Delays of greater than 3 days between stools may increase the likelihood of pain on passing hard stools leading to anal fissure, anal spasm and eventually to a learned response to avoid defaecation.36 NICE recommend polyethylene glycol 3350 ( Movicol\u00ae Paediatric Plain) the for the management of constipation in children.4 Ensure that an effective dose is used, by adjusting the dose according to response to treatmen t. (If the child has needed disimpaction, the usual dose is half the disimpaction dose). If this approach does not work, add in a stimulant laxative; or if this approach is not tolerated, substitute a stimulant laxative. If stools are hard, consider adding in lactulose or another laxative with softening effects, such as docusate. Do not use suppositories or enemas in primary care unless all oral medications have failed and preferably following specialist advice . Doses above the licensed maximum dose may be needed, so informed consent should be verbally obtained and documented. 4 Continue medication at maintenance dose for several weeks after regular bowel habit is established - this may take several months.4 Children who are toilet training should remain on laxatives until toilet training is well established. Some children may require la xative therapy for several years. A minority may require ongoing laxative therapy.4 Disimpaction in children Offer the following oral medica tion regimen for disimpaction if indicated:4 polyethylene glycol, using an escalating dose regimen as the first-line treatment add a stimulant laxative if polyethylene glycol does not work substitute a stimulant laxative if polyethylene glycol is not tolerated by the child or young person. Add another laxative such as lactulose or docusate if stools are hard Please note: do not use rectal medications for disimpaction unless all oral medications have failed and only if the child or young person and their family consent administer sodium citrate enemas only if all oral medications for disimpaction have failed do not administer phosphate enemas for disimpaction unless under specialist supervision in hospital/health centre/clinic, and only if all oral medications and sodium citrate enemas have failed Review children and young people undergoing disimpaction within 1 week. Start maintenance therapy as soon as the child or young person's bowel is disimpacted. Reassess children frequently during main tenance treatment to ensure they do not become re-impacted and assess issues in maintaining treatment such as taking medicine and toileting. Tailor the frequency of assessment to the individual needs of the child and their families (this could range from daily contact to contact every few weeks). Where possible, reassessment should be provided by the same person/team. Please note: At the time of publication (January 2012), Movicol\u00ae Paediatric Plain does not have UK marketing authorisation for use in faecal impaction in children under 5 years, or for chronic constipation in children less than 2 years. Informed consent should be obtained and documented. Stopping laxatives Laxatives should not be stopped abruptly. Laxatives should be gradually withdrawn when regular bowel movements occur without difficulty (e.g. 2 - 4 weeks after defaecation has become comfortable and a regular bowel pattern with soft, formed stools has been establ ished). The rate at which doses are reduced should be guided by the frequency and consistency of the stools. Doses should be reduced in a gradual manner in order to minimise the risk of requiring 'rescue therapy' for recurrent f aecal loading. If a combination of laxatives has been used, reduce and stop one laxative at a time. Stimulant laxatives doses should be reduced first, if possible. However, it may be necessary to also adjust the dose of the osmotic laxative to compensate. The patient should be advised that it can take several months to be successfully weaned off all laxatives. It is common to get relapses and these should be treated early with increased doses of laxatives. Bulk-forming laxatives (ispaghula, methylcellulose and sterculia) How do constipation by increasing faecal mass which stimulates peristalsis. During treatment with bulk-forming laxatives, adequate fluid intake must be maintained to avoid intestinal obstruction.2,36 Proprietary preparations containing a bulking agent are often difficult to administer to children.36 Is there any evidence for the use of bulk-forming laxatives? There is a lack of high-qu ality data demonstrating the efficacy of bulk-forming laxatives. A systematic review found that ispaghula husk increased stool frequency; however, there were insufficient data on methylcellulose to provide evidence-based recommendations for its use in chronic constipation. 11 Despite the lack of dat a, substantial clinical experience supports the use of these agents as a first-line intervention. \u0004Prescribing Notes: Laxatives2 Before prescribing laxatives it is important to be sure that the patient is constipated and that the constipation is not secondary to an underlying undiagnosed complaint It is important for those who complain of c onstipation to understand that bowel habits can vary considerably in frequency without doing harm. Some people tend to consider themselves constipated if they do not have a bowel movement each day. A useful def inition of constipation is the passage of hard stools less frequent ly than the patient's own normal pattern and this can be explained to the patient Misconceptions about bowel habits have led to excessive laxative use. Abuse may lead to hypokalaemia The BNF recommends that laxa tives should generally be avoided except where straining will exacerbate a condition (such as angina) or increase the risk of rectal bleeding as in haemorrhoids Laxatives are of value in drug-induced constipation , for the expulsion of parasites after anthelmintic treatment, and to clear the alimentary tract before surgery and radiological procedures Prolonged treatment of constipation is sometimes necessary COMPASS Therapeutic Notes on the Management of Chronic Constipation in Primary Care January 2012 Page 4 laxative .

There is a lack of high-qu ality data demonstrating the efficacy of bulk-forming laxatives. A systematic review found that ispaghula husk increased stool frequency; however, there were insufficient data on methylcellulose to provide evidence-based recommendations for its use in chronic constipation. 11 Despite the lack of dat a, substantial clinical experience supports the use of these agents as a first-line intervention. \u0004Prescribing Notes: Laxatives2 Before prescribing laxatives it is important to be sure that the patient is constipated and that the constipation is not secondary to an underlying undiagnosed complaint It is important for those who complain of c onstipation to understand that bowel habits can vary considerably in frequency without doing harm. Some people tend to consider themselves constipated if they do not have a bowel movement each day. A useful def inition of constipation is the passage of hard stools less frequent ly than the patient's own normal pattern and this can be explained to the patient Misconceptions about bowel habits have led to excessive laxative use. Abuse may lead to hypokalaemia The BNF recommends that laxa tives should generally be avoided except where straining will exacerbate a condition (such as angina) or increase the risk of rectal bleeding as in haemorrhoids Laxatives are of value in drug-induced constipation , for the expulsion of parasites after anthelmintic treatment, and to clear the alimentary tract before surgery and radiological procedures Prolonged treatment of constipation is sometimes necessary CO Ho Pat of b dev the inc in/s In use Bus m the hae witad j Buco n Are for Budif f fae Ma the diff Wh The upo con the Alte from is n Raor c Isp Ora Isp The term limcli n wit Me In a sho lea bow tab rec Ste No fran sac afte am and wit be ple (* F eva OMPASS Thera p ow quickly d o tients and/or c bulk-forming l a velop.2,36 If aft eir constipatio n creased to the switching to a n which patien eful? lk-forming lax a mall hard stool s a h diverticular d juncts in ulce r lk-forming lax a nstipation, bu t e there any s rming laxativ e lax a ficulty in swall impaction aintaining an a e possibility of ficult for som e hat are the si d ere is often in on initiation o f ntinued use, t h e agent is star t ernatively, pa t m using meth y not fermentab rely, side-eff e colon have b e paghula hus k range\u00ae, Regu l paghula husk i ere is publish e m treatment o ited evidence nical experien c h long-term u s ethylcellulos e adults and ch i ould be taken ast 300 ml of li wel function i s blets should b e Cautio n shoul d ngula*) are in chets or 1-2 h e er meals.

Docusate sodium probably acts both as a stimulant and as a softening agent. This group also includes glycerol suppositories. How do stimulant laxatives work? Stimulant laxatives increase intestinal motility by stimulating the colonic myenteric plexus on their contact with the colonic mucosa, and by inhibiting water absorption, thereby inducing passage of stools.17,39,46,48,53 These agents usually produce an effect within 6 to 12 hours of ingestion and so are commonly administered at bedtime to produce an effect in the morning.16 Rectal preparations (supposit ories/enemas containing phosphates or sodium citrate) can be used effectively to produce rapid evacuation (within 30 minutes) but should be used with caution in the elderly and debilitated.2 Glycerol suppositories act as a rectal stimulant by virtue of the mildly irritant action of glycerol.2,36 Both bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate are prodrugs that are converted in the gut into the same active metabolite, which causes the desired laxative effect. Is there an evidence-base for the use of stimulant laxatives? Although widely used, there is a limited evidence base supporting the use of stimulants in chronic constipation. The clinical data supporting the use of stimulant laxatives in chronic constipation are derived from studies which were often done in specific subsets of patient populations and had ill-defined endpoints.54-61 Placebo-controlled trials show that bisacodyl and picosulfate are more effective than placebo, but most trials are of s hort duration and quality is variable.17,39,46 In a recent 4-week placebo-controlled trial, picosulfate improved bowel function, symptoms and quality of life.62 Practically speaking, however, many patients report clinically relevant benefits from these agents and symptom recurrence upon discontinuation. What adverse effects are associated with using stimulant laxatives? Gastrointestinal adverse effects Stimulant laxatives are generally well tolerated, but may induce abdominal pain.17,39,46,63 This can often be managed by dose titration.62 Stools should be softened by increasing dietary fibre and liquid or with an osmotic laxative before giving a stimulant laxative.2,36 Stimulant laxatives should be avoided in intestinal obstruction.2,36 Table TWO : Macrogol laxatives as listed in the BNF2 Agent Formulation, dosage and administration Licensed?

In initial clinical trials, the adverse effects which were experienced more frequently by patients treated with prucalopride versus placebo include: headache nausea diarrhoea abdominal pain These effects resolved within a few days of continued treatment. Other unwanted effects included abnormal bowel sounds, anorexia, dizziness, dyspepsia, fatigue, fever, flatulence, frequent urination, malaise, palpitations, rectal haemorrhage, tremors and vomiting. During long-term follow-up studies, the most frequent adverse effects which resulted in study discontinuation were abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and nausea.81 Cisapride, a drug in the same class, was withdrawn from the UK market in July 2000 because it prolonged the Q-T C interval. However, prucalopride has been reported to be more selective than cisapride; c linical trials on prucalopride found the incidence of QT interval prolongation to be low and similar to that with placebo.68,79,80 Additionally, extensive cardiovascular safety assessm ents, including a study in elderly institutionalised patients, showed no arrhythmogenic potential for prucalopride.83 The SmPC advises prucalopride should be used with caution in patients with a history of arrhythmias or ischaemic cardiovascular disease.82 What do national or regional guidelines say? In its 2010 Technology Appraisal of prucalopride, NICE recommends:84 prucalopride is an option for symptomatic treatment for chronic constipation in women who have had inadequate relief with at least two laxatives (from different classes , at the highest tolerated recommended doses for at least 6 months ) and for whom invasive treatment for constipation is being considered prucalopride should be prescribed only by a \" clinician with experience of treating chronic constipation \", and only after the clinician has carefully reviewed the woman's previous laxative treatments if treatment with prucalopride is not effective after 4 weeks , the woman should be re-examined and the benefit of continuing tr eatment reconsidered In contrast, in 2011, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has recommended against the use of prucalopride for the second time. The SMC states that in the key trials, most patients did not achieve the primary or the key secondary outcome measures and that t he outcomes most relevant to the licensed indication are derived from post-hoc subgroup analyses in women. The SMC stated that t he company did not present a sufficiently robust clinical and economic analysis. How much does prucalopride cost? See Figure ONE . The cost of 28 days treatment with prucalopride 1-2mg daily is \u00a339 to \u00a360 per patient compared with, for example, around \u00a34 for a typical formulation of ispaghula husk, around \u00a312 for macrogols around \u00a32 for a typical stimulant laxative Key points from the NICE guidance on prucalopride 84 Prucalopride is an option fo r the treatment of chronic constipation only in women for whom treatment with at least two laxatives from different classes, at the highest tolerated recommended doses for at least six months, has failed to provide adequate relief and invasive treatment for constipation is being considered. If treatment with prucalopride is not effective after four weeks, the woman should be re-examined and the benefit of continuing treatment reconsidered. Prucalopride should only be prescribed by a clinician with experience of treating chronic constipation, who has carefully reviewed the woman's previous c ourses of laxative treatments. Constipation in pregnancy and breastfeeding How should constipation in a pregnant or breastfeeding woman be managed? Constipation is quite common during pregnancy. For pregnant and breastfeeding wom en the emphasis lies in first-line use of dietary and lifestyle measures. The use of laxatives should only be considered if these measures fail.3 Using laxatives in pregnancy If dietary and lifestyle changes fail to control constipation in pregnancy or breastfeeding, moderate doses of poorly absorbed laxatives may be used. Consider a bulk-forming laxative first. If stools remain hard, add or switch to lactulose or a macrogol. If stools are soft but the woman still finds them difficult to pass or complains of inadequate emptying, consider a short course of bisacodyl or senna. 4 Occasional use of glycerol or ONE : Cost comparison chart for laxatives (28 days treatment) (Prices taken from BNF 62)COMPASS Therapeutic Notes on the Management of Chronic Constipation in Primary Care January 2012 Page 9 Bulk-forming laxatives , lactulose and macrogols are not absorbed from the gastr ointestinal tract and are therefore suitable for use during pregnancy Bisacodyl is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (only about 5%). It has not been reported to cause teratogenic or fetotoxic effects and is therefore suitable for use during pregnancy. Senna is partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but does not appear to be teratogenic. Concerns have been raised that senna should be avoided in the third trimester because a stimulating effect on uterine contractions has been reported with other anthraquinone derivatives. However, this has not been reported with senna. Glycerol suppositories are also suitable for use during pregnancy Laxatives that are not recommended : Docusate is less preferred because there is a single case report of neonatal hypomagnesaemia after maternal overuse of oral docusate sodium. However, docusate could be considered in low doses if the recommended laxatives (above) are unsuccessful Sodium picosulfate: there is less experience with its use in pregnancy, so it is therefore not recommended Sodium citrate and sodium phosphate enemas should be avoided if possible during pregnancy, because they may cause fluid and electrolyte imbalances Reference List 1.
