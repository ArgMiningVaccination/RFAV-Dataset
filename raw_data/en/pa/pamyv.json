By improving this communication, your body gains greater access to energy and life force, resulting in enhanced healing, improved health, and a more vibrant life. Dr. Michael Baba was led to discover energy healing and chiropractic from a life full of sports injuries and various accidents. He began receiving full-time chiropractic care to address his physical and spiritual pain, which led him to an evolution of consciousness and a pursuit of truth and awareness in all aspects of his life. Throughout his healing journey, Dr. Michael has acquired a diverse range of healing modalities, including psychological, energetic, and physical techniques. During each session, he combines these modalities with chiropractic to provide comprehensive healing for your entire being. With a natural gift and a deep passion for helping others achieve wholeness, Dr. Michael is committed to supporting your journey towards optimal health and well-being. Our body's natural intelligence directs the flow of energy and controls our vital systems, including breathing, blood flow, organ function, and healing. Imbalances in the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual/energetic systems can distort this flow, creating disease. As chiropractors, we identify and treat the root cause of the disease, enabling the body to heal itself. Each treatment starts by reestablishing connection within the body, using breath, body position, and specific forces. These forces remove blockages and enhance communication between the brain and body, allowing for new healing strategies to emerge. Our role is to facilitate healing, while your role is to allow the body to heal and express health. "}
