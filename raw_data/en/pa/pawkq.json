E. longifolia, is one of the well-known folk medicines for aphrodisiac effects as well as intermittent fever (malaria) in Asia. Decoctions of E. longifolia leaves are used for washing itches, while its fruits are used in curing dysentery. Its bark is mostly used as a vermifuge, while the taproots are used to treat high blood pressure, and the root bark is used for the treatment of diarrhea and fever. Mostly, the roots extract of E. longifolia are used as folk medicine for sexual dysfunction, aging, malaria, cancer, diabetes, anxiety, aches, constipation, exercise recovery, fever, increased energy, increased strength, leukemia, osteoporosis, stress, syphilis and glandular swelling. The roots are also used as an aphrodisiac, antibiotic, appetite stimulant and health supplement. The plant is reported to be rich in various classes of bioactive compounds such as quassinoids, canthin-6-one alkaloids, -carboline alkaloids, triterpene tirucallane type, squalene derivatives and biphenyl neolignan, eurycolactone, laurycolactone, and eurycomalactone, and bioactive steroids. Among these phytoconstituents, quassinoids account for a major portion of the E. longifolia root phytochemicals. An acute toxicity study has found that the oral Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) of the alcoholic extract of E. longifolia in mice is between 1500-2000 mg/kg, while the oral LD50 of the aqueous extract form is more than 3000 mg/kg. Liver and renal function tests showed no adverse changes at normal daily dose and chronic use of E. longifolia. Based on established literature on health benefits of E. longifolia, it is important to focus attention on its more active constituents and the constituents' identification, determination, further development and most importantly, the standardization. Besides the available data, more evidence is required regarding its therapeutic efficacy and safety, so it can be considered a rich herbal source of new drug candidates. It is very important to conserve this valuable medicinal plant for the health benefit of future generations.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2016-03-10", "cleaned_text": "Review on a Traditional Herbal Medicine, Eurycoma longifolia Jack (Tongkat Ali): Its Traditional Introduction Traditional Medicine [2](#B2-molecules-21-00331)]. 1.1.3. [2](#B2-molecules-21-00331)]. 1.1.4. Traditional Use of Herbal Medicines [2](#B2-molecules-21-00331)]. Traditionally employed, indigenous herbal or herb-derived medicines have been very popular from time immemorial; and today, these medicines have commanded much attention worldwide, due to their natural origin and nutraceutical potential [ [2](#B2-molecules-21-00331), [3](#B3-molecules-21-00331)]. The World Health Organization has estimated that 80% of people worldwide rely on herbal medicines for some part of their primary health care needs [ [4](#B4-molecules-21-00331)]. When adopted outside of its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often called complementary and alternative medicine [ [1](#B1-molecules-21-00331)]. [3](#B3-molecules-21-00331)]. Today, the increasing demands of use of traditional herbal therapies, more likely based on the good past experiences of the effectiveness as well as safety of these herbal medicines, still require positive research evidence, so recent developments in the biological and analytical sciences, along with innovations in proteomics and genomics surely can play a dominant role in the validation of traditionally based herbal medicines, to further improve their quality, safety and efficacy with clinic-based evidence [ [5](#B5-molecules-21-00331), [6](#B6-molecules-21-00331)]. is planted mainly in Malaysia for its medicinal value in order to conserve the wild plants [ [12](#B12-molecules-21-00331), [13](#B13-molecules-21-00331), [14](#B14-molecules-21-00331), [15](#B15-molecules-21-00331)]. [16](#B16-molecules-21-00331)]. [17](#B17-molecules-21-00331)], an herb or herbal compound that assists in combating stress and disease and improves physical strength without adverse effects. 1.2.3. Description [18](#B18-molecules-21-00331), [19](#B19-molecules-21-00331), [20](#B20-molecules-21-00331)]. 1.3. Genetic Diversity [21](#B21-molecules-21-00331)], and microsatellite markers have been studied as tools for DNA profiling and genetic diversity studies [ [22](#B22-molecules-21-00331)]. Razi et al., showed that in an uncontrolled cultivated area, the E. longifolia samples could be characterized based on their cultivar's origins. They proved that identification of E. longifolia from various cultivars can be obtained using PCR-RAPD, with the help of some analytical software. The method yielded high quality and quantity of DNA. Six random primers (OPA-3, OPA-4, OPA-13, OPA-18, OPC-5 and good amplifications of E. longifolia DNA samples [ [23](#B23-molecules-21-00331)]. Some scientists are interested in the in vitro production of the E. longifolia plantlets or plant tissues for sustainable production of [24](#B24-molecules-21-00331), [25](#B25-molecules-21-00331), [26](#B26-molecules-21-00331), [27](#B27-molecules-21-00331), [28](#B28-molecules-21-00331), [29](#B29-molecules-21-00331), [30](#B30-molecules-21-00331), a protocol to optimize protoplast isolation from callus of E. longifolia [ [32](#B32-molecules-21-00331)]. Most recently, Lulu et al., optimized the conditions for the production of adventitious roots from E. longifolia, in balloon-type bubble bioreactor cultures, suitable for the large-scale commercial production of its roots containing high yield of bioactive compounds [ [33](#B33-molecules-21-00331)]. 2. Historical or Traditional Uses [12](#B12-molecules-21-00331), [34](#B34-molecules-21-00331)]. E. longifolia is one of the most popular folk medicines for its aphrodisiac effects and treatment of intermittent fever (malaria) [ [35](#B35-molecules-21-00331)]. Decoctions of E. longifolia leaves are used for washing itches, while its fruits are used in curing dysentery [ [12](#B12-molecules-21-00331)]. Its bark is mostly used as a vermifuge [ [12](#B12-molecules-21-00331)], while the taproots are used to treat high blood pressure, and the root bark is used for the treatment of diarrhea and fever [ [36](#B36-molecules-21-00331)]. Mostly the roots extract of E. longifolia are used as folk medicine for sexual dysfunction, aging, malaria, cancer, diabetes, anxiety, aches, constipation, exercise recovery, fever, increased energy, increased strength, leukemia, osteoporosis, stress, syphilis and glandular swelling, as well as it is used as an aphrodisiac, antibiotic, appetite stimulant and health supplement [ [36](#B36-molecules-21-00331), [37](#B37-molecules-21-00331), [38](#B38-molecules-21-00331), [39](#B39-molecules-21-00331), [40](#B40-molecules-21-00331), [41](#B41-molecules-21-00331), [42](#B42-molecules-21-00331)]. [7](#B7-molecules-21-00331)]. Due to the many traditional and scientific benefits, there has been a demand for E. longifolia products with over 200 E. longifolia products registered with the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau of Malaysia (NPCB, 2016). It is now currently sold as a Traditional Herbal Medicine in Malaysia. Approximately 21,000 kg of E. longifolia are harvested by collectors per year, with a demand of approximately >54,000 kg per year. 3. Chemical Constituents [36](#B36-molecules-21-00331)]. E. longifolia is a rich source of various classes of bioactive bitter tasting quassinoid phytoconstituents account for a major portion in the E. longifolia root contents. The quassinoids are a group of nortriterpenoids with dynamic pharmacological properties [ [40](#B40-molecules-21-00331)]. Quassinoids, are even effective at inhibiting cell growth in nanomolar and subnanomolar concentrations [ [41](#B41-molecules-21-00331)]. The presence of tirucallane and squalene-type triterpenes might be the quassinoids' alkaloids formed as metabolic by-products are natural amine compounds that repel herbivores and insects [ [46](#B46-molecules-21-00331)]. The metabolite type and concentration in E. longifolia plant extracts, depend on the processing temperature as well as geographical factors. For standardization, it is crucial to ensure the consistency of the chemical bioactive components, particularly for the efficacy of herbal medicines [ [47](#B47-molecules-21-00331)]. Summarized here are some major constituents of E. longifolia with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is recognized as a most suitable and powerful tool for identification as well as quantification of various herbal product and their constituents [ [95](#B95-molecules-21-00331), [96](#B96-molecules-21-00331), [97](#B97-molecules-21-00331)]. From the plant kingdom, quassinoids are bitter constituents found exclusively in various species of the Simarouboidaea (a subfamily of the Simaroubaceae) and are biogenetically degraded triterpenes displaying a wide range of physiological properties in vitro and/or in vivo [ [98](#B98-molecules-21-00331), [99](#B99-molecules-21-00331)]. Numerous research reports are available on liquid chromatography methods for the analysis of quassinoid E. longifolia bio-constituents, using photodiode array or fluorescence and UV detection. However, none of these methods are sensitive enough to detect nonchromophoric bioactive constituents, such as eurycomanol present in E. longifolia [ [57](#B57-molecules-21-00331), [58](#B58-molecules-21-00331), [100](#B100-molecules-21-00331)], so mass spectrometry is the best option for analysis of all constituents and secondary metabolites from E. longifolia. Chua et al., used a number of three liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hybrid systems (QTof, QTrap and TripleTof), to scan for small metabolites and also to detect the targeted metabolites, such as alkaloids, quassinoids, triterpene and biphenylneolignans from E. longifolia extracts [ [47](#B47-molecules-21-00331)]. Teh et al., developed and optimized a LC-MS method using ESI in a positive ion mode for bioactive compounds simultaneous determination, from E. longifolia [ [101](#B101-molecules-21-00331)]. Recently, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of six major quassinoids of E. longifolia i.e., eurycomanone, 13(21)-epoxyeurycomanone, 13,21-dihydroeurycomanone, eurycomalactone was developed. By using a LC-MS method, the content of these quassinoids was measured in in dietary supplement tablets and capsules, to confirm the purity of E. longifolia in commercial products [ [102](#B102-molecules-21-00331)]. For quick screening of sildenafil analogues in E. longifolia products, a two-tier screening method using a near infrared (NIR) spectral database was developed. This method has allowed rapid screening on the test samples to verify their content as labelled despite not having the spectra of those products in the database. It could be used for product identification, drug screening for mixed adulteration as well as drug quality surveillance, particularly in cases where reference samples are difficult to obtain [ [103](#B103-molecules-21-00331)]. 5. Evidenced-Based Pharmacology 5.1. Male Fertility Enhancement Effect [104](#B104-molecules-21-00331)]. Male infertility refers to a male's inability to achieve a pregnancy in a fertile female. In humans, this accounts for 40%-50% of infertility cases [ [105](#B105-molecules-21-00331), [106](#B106-molecules-21-00331)]. Infertility in males is a multifactorial disease, based on numerous factors including reduced spermatogenesis and also production of dysfunctional sperm, which are the major prevalent underlying characteristic in idiopathic male infertility cases [ [107](#B107-molecules-21-00331), [108](#B108-molecules-21-00331)]. One meta-analysis of sixty-one studies worldwide reported s downward trend in the sperm count and semen volume over the past fifty years [ [109](#B109-molecules-21-00331), [110](#B110-molecules-21-00331)]. [111](#B111-molecules-21-00331), [112](#B112-molecules-21-00331)] [111](#B111-molecules-21-00331)]. [112](#B112-molecules-21-00331)]. Also, standardized extracts of E. Jack containing a high concentration of quassinoids (20% eurycomanone and 4% of penile erection index (PEI). In boars, an carthamoides increased libido (volume, [ [130](#B130-molecules-21-00331)]. [131](#B131-molecules-21-00331)]. [132](#B132-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.2. Antimalarial Effect [133](#B133-molecules-21-00331), [134](#B134-molecules-21-00331)]. There are about 10,000 malaria cases per year in Western Europe, and 1300-1500 in the United States [ [135](#B135-molecules-21-00331)]. E. longifolia extract is traditionally used for malarial fevers and has good anti-malarial effect against P. falciparum. [60](#B60-molecules-21-00331)]. [61](#B61-molecules-21-00331)]. Low et al., concluded that the administration of the bioactive standardized extract Fr2 (200 mg/kg) showed a good antimalarial effect. 13(21)-epoxyeurycomanone and eurycomanone may be the only quassinoids contributing to the overall antimalarial activity of E. [137](#B137-molecules-21-00331)]. [36](#B36-molecules-21-00331)] isolated and identified nearly 65 compounds from the roots of E. longifolia and screened them for the potential cytotoxicity and anti-HIV activities by in vitro assays. Among the compounds evaluated, [ for in vitro cytotoxicity against A-549 and MCF-7 tumor cell lines [ [138](#B138-molecules-21-00331)] and no inhibition of HIV replication in H9 lymphocytes except for cell line. [51](#B51-molecules-21-00331)] compounds [49](#B49-molecules-21-00331)], [140](#B140-molecules-21-00331)], both A549 and MCF-7, while 13,21-dihydroeurycomanone [ [140](#B140-molecules-21-00331)] was more selective against A549 and eurycomanone [ [140](#B140-molecules-21-00331)] showed cytotoxic effects only against longilactone, and 14,15-dihydroxyklaineanone displayed significant ranging from 21.01% \u00b1 2.46% to 66.9% \u00b1 triterpene, named eurylene, from E. longifolia which were found to be cytotoxic [ [53](#B53-molecules-21-00331)]. Chan et al., isolated a new C19 quassinoid 6-hydroxyeurycomalactone from the roots of E. longifolia and have reported that the cytotoxic activity of these quassinoids was not mediated through DNA cleaving properties [ [49](#B49-molecules-21-00331)]. [145](#B145-molecules-21-00331)]. CML accounts for 15-20 percent of all leukemias [ [145](#B145-molecules-21-00331), [146](#B146-molecules-21-00331)] with a worldwide incidence of 1-2/100,000 [ [147](#B147-molecules-21-00331), [148](#B148-molecules-21-00331), [149](#B149-molecules-21-00331)]. The various isolates and purified eurycomane, an active compound from the roots of E. longifolia, were examined for their cytotoxic effect in K-562 cells isolated from patients with chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML). [150](#B150-molecules-21-00331)]. The cytotoxic activity of quassinoids was not found to be mediated through DNA cleaving properties [ [49](#B49-molecules-21-00331)]. In vitro, the anticancer effects of a fraction of E. longifolia were due to apoptosis via a caspase-9 and p53-independent manner [ [151](#B151-molecules-21-00331)] [ [152](#B152-molecules-21-00331)]. [153](#B153-molecules-21-00331), [154](#B154-molecules-21-00331)]. Dysregulation of proliferative rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, tumor growth and metastasis [ [155](#B155-molecules-21-00331)]. It is well recognized that angiogenesis is essential for the growth and metastasis of most solid malignancies, an increased body of evidence supports the enhancement of angiogenesis in hematologic malignancies as well [ [156](#B156-molecules-21-00331)]. Therefore, angiogenesis is currently becoming an important target for chemotherapeutic approaches in cancer therapy [ [157](#B157-molecules-21-00331)]. [158](#B158-molecules-21-00331)]. [152](#B152-molecules-21-00331)]. Further, Tee et al., elucidated the mode of action of F16 (a plant-derived pharmacologically active fraction) and observed that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was invoked, with the reduction of Bcl-2 protein. It was concluded that the F16 from E. longifolia exerts anti-proliferative action and growth inhibition on MCF-7 cells through apoptosis induction, and that hydroalcoholic extract of E. longifolia Jack for its antioxidant and in vitro anti-inflammatory properties. The antioxidant activity (free radical scavenging) was evaluated to determine the total antioxidant capacity of extract E. longifolia. The DPHH assay showed significant antioxidant activity in all concentrations used (i.e., 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250 \u00b5g/mL). The human RBC (HRBC) stabilization method was utilized to evaluate the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of the extract, and it was found that this anti-inflammatory activity increased in a concentration dependent manner [ [82](#B82-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.6. Anti-Anxiolytic Effect [166](#B166-molecules-21-00331)]. [167](#B167-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.7. Antidiabetic Effect [168](#B168-molecules-21-00331)]. [169](#B169-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.8. Osteoporosis Preventive Effect [170](#B170-molecules-21-00331)]. Worldwide, 1 in 3 women over 50 will experience osteoporotic fractures, as will 1 in 5 men [ [171](#B171-molecules-21-00331), [172](#B172-molecules-21-00331), [173](#B173-molecules-21-00331)]. According to Tambi and concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), an antioxidant that plays an important role in counteracting oxidative stress [ [120](#B120-molecules-21-00331)]. Other components of E. longifolia, such as alkaloids and triterpenes, can also act as antioxidants that may reduce bone loss and maintain the bone formation rate [ [123](#B123-molecules-21-00331)]. [174](#B174-molecules-21-00331)]. The bioactive complex polypeptides from the E. longifolia root extract, labelled as eurypeptides, can exert and enhance their effects on the biosynthesis of various androgens [ [175](#B175-molecules-21-00331)]. Eurypeptides work by stimulating dihydroepiandosterone (DHEA). DHEA in turn will act on androgen receptors to initiate the conversion of androstenedione and androstenediol to testosterone and estrogen, respectively [ [125](#B125-molecules-21-00331)]. These eurypeptides may also alleviate SHBG and subsequently increase the free testosterone level [ [176](#B176-molecules-21-00331)]. Due to these proandrogen properties of E. longifolia, it is able to stimulate osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, resulting in increased bone formation rate. High levels of testosterone and estrogen may also exert proapoptotic effects on osteoclasts, reducing the bone resorptive activity. As testosterone levels decrease with age, it has been suggested that men can consume E. longifolia (at suitable dosages) as a supplement [ [177](#B177-molecules-21-00331)]. Other than its proandrogenic properties, E. longifolia contains high levels of nitric oxide (NO) [ [178](#B178-molecules-21-00331)] that have effects on bone. [179](#B179-molecules-21-00331)]. Orchidectomy (a model of androgen-deficient osteoporosis), can promote up-regulation of ROS which leads to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays a role in osteoblast apoptosis and osteoclast differentiation [ [180](#B180-molecules-21-00331)]. There are several mechanisms proposed for its antiosteoporotic effects. The main mechanism is via its testosterone-enhancing effects for the prevention and treatment of androgen-deficient osteoporosis. Other mechanisms involved are through its nitric oxide generation and antioxidative properties. Due to E. longifolia's safety profile and potential as an alternative antiosteoporotic agent, further studies are warranted to document a better and conclusive mechanism for its therapeutic action [ [123](#B123-molecules-21-00331)]. [181](#B181-molecules-21-00331)]. The combination therapy of E. longifolia and low-dose testosterone has potential for treatment of androgen-deficient osteoporosis. The lower testosterone dose is beneficial in reducing the side effects of testosterone therapy [ [181](#B181-molecules-21-00331)]. E. longifolia exerts proandrogenic effects that enhance testosterone levels, as well as stimulate osteoblast proliferation and osteoclast apoptosis [ [123](#B123-molecules-21-00331)]. E. longifolia has been shown recently to protect against bone calcium loss in orchidectomised rats, the model for androgen-deficient osteoporosis. Supplementation with it extract elevated the testosterone levels, reduced the bone resorption marker and upregulated OPG gene expression of the orchidectomised rats. These actions may be responsible for the protective effects of E. longifolia extract against bone resorption due to androgen deficiency [ [182](#B182-molecules-21-00331)]. Further studies on the regulation of OPG production by E. longifolia may provide insight into this novel mechanism. E. longifolia exerts proandrogenic effects that enhance the testosterone level, as well as stimulate osteoblast proliferation and osteoclast apoptosis. This will maintain bone remodelling activity and reduce bone loss. Phytochemical components of E. longifolia may also prevent osteoporosis via its antioxidative property. Hence, E. longifolia has the potential as a complementary treatment for male osteoporosis [ [123](#B123-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.9. Miscellaneous Effects 5.9.1. Hormonal Effects [86](#B86-molecules-21-00331)]. Another study showed that the E. longifolia plant extract normalized irregular estrous cycles and reduced the follicular morphological damage caused by chronic testosterone administration in the female rats. The reversal effect derived from the anti-estrogenic properties of the plant quassinoids. Further work is required to identify the exact mechanism behind the ameliorative effects of E. longifolia [ [183](#B183-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.9.2. Ergogenic Effects [184](#B184-molecules-21-00331)]. The authors reviewed its medicinal properties and studies investigating physiological responses and endurance exercise performance. Increased testosterone, as shown in animal models [ [115](#B115-molecules-21-00331)], has been suggested in anecdotal reports as being responsible for E. longifolia-induced increases in muscle mass and strength in humans. According to secondary sources, E. longifolia enhances testosterone production by the Leydig cells and frees bound testosterone for use by muscles [ [185](#B185-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.9.3. Insecticidal Effects [186](#B186-molecules-21-00331)]. One study showed that E. longifolia exhibits the highest anti-protozoal activity at 1.0 mg/mL. The ethyl acetate fraction exhibited a slightly higher percentage of anti-protozoal activity and demonstrated the highest anti-protozoal activity against Blastocystis sp. isolates and showed a sizeable reduction in the cell count in comparison to the allopathic drugs [ [187](#B187-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.9.4. Muscular Effects [188](#B188-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.9.5. Antiulcer Effect [50](#B50-molecules-21-00331)]. In one other study, Qodriyah et al., investigation showed that E. longifolia in Radix is as effective as ranitidine in the treatment of ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats [ [189](#B189-molecules-21-00331)]. 5.9.6. Anti-Rheumatism Effect 6. Pharmacokinetics 6.1. Absorption [65](#B65-molecules-21-00331)]. Following intravenous injection, eurycomanone was detected in the plasma, declining to zero within 8 h. Following oral administration, Cmax and Tmax values were 0.33 \u00b1 0.03 mcg/mL and 4.40 \u00b1 0.98 h, respectively. The plasma concentration was lower following oral administration vs. intravenous administration, even at a much higher oral dose (five times the dose). The authors concluded that eurycomanone is poorly bioavailable orally (10.5%). [100](#B100-molecules-21-00331)]. [62](#B62-molecules-21-00331), [86](#B86-molecules-21-00331), [191](#B191-molecules-21-00331)]. The absolute bioavailability was also higher due to increased membrane permeability (higher log Kow value of 0.43 vs. 1.46 at pH 1). Following oral administration of a standardized extract (Fr 2) of E. longifolia, eurycomanol and 13,21-dihydroeurycomanone were not detected in plasma [ half-life (t1/2) of eurycomanone to be 1.00 \u00b1 0.26 h [ [65](#B65-molecules-21-00331)]. 7. Evidence-Based Toxicology 7.1. Safety and Toxicity [194](#B194-molecules-21-00331)]. However, at concentrations higher than 100 \u00b5g\u00b7mL1, cytotoxic effects might occur [ [36](#B36-molecules-21-00331), [160](#B160-molecules-21-00331)] supporting in vivo data by Tambi and Kadir, that the extract is not toxic [ [9](#B9-molecules-21-00331)]. In animal studies, no negative effect on the offspring could be found, either in terms of malformations or of any effect on body weight or the number of the offspring [ [124](#B124-molecules-21-00331)]; yet an acute toxicity study done by Satayavivad et al. has found that the oral Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) of the alcoholic extract of E. longifolia in mice is between 1500-2000 mg/kg, while the oral LD50 of the aqueous extract form is more than 3000 mg/kg [ [194](#B194-molecules-21-00331)]. These authors further showed that dosages of 200 mg\u00b7kg1 body weight of the ethanolic extract and 300 mg\u00b7kg1 of the aqueous extract daily were not toxic. Only at dosages above 1200 mg\u00b7kg1 body weight, were significant hepatotoxic effects shown in the rat [ [195](#B195-molecules-21-00331)]. The acute toxicity studies in mice found that the n-butanol fraction of E. longifolia was the most toxic, mainly due to eurycomanone [ [191](#B191-molecules-21-00331)]. [196](#B196-molecules-21-00331)]. [197](#B197-molecules-21-00331)]. Considering that E. longifolia extract increases the serum testosterone concentrations, there might be a potential risk from its treatment in elderly men, which might cause prostatic problems. On other hands, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Ismail et al., revealed no difference between the placebo and the verum group for serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels [ [114](#B114-molecules-21-00331)]. Li et al. showed that neither mutagenicity nor clastogenicity was noted, and the acute oral LD50 was more than 6 g/kg b.w for E. longifolia extract. After 4-week subacute and 13-week subchronic exposure paradigms (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 2 g/kg b.w. per day), adverse effects attributable to test compound was not observed with respect to body weight, hematology, serum biochemistry, urinalysis, macropathology, or histopathology. However, the treatment significantly reduced prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, blood creatine phosphate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and cholesterol levels, especially in males (p < 0.05). Calculated acceptable daily intake (ADI) for E. longifolia extract, was up to 1.2 g/adult/day. The investigated intension of E. longifolia extract intake by Li et al. was to calculate its safety profile in health supplements. This information is useful for product development and safety management [ [198](#B198-molecules-21-00331)]. [199](#B199-molecules-21-00331)]. [200](#B200-molecules-21-00331)]. [117](#B117-molecules-21-00331)]. [201](#B201-molecules-21-00331)]. [195](#B195-molecules-21-00331)]. 7.2. Precautions/Contraindications [168](#B168-molecules-21-00331)] and unpublished studies in humans suggesting the possibility for increased blood glucose, it should be used cautiously in patients using hypoglycemic agents. Also use with in individuals using propranolol, as in healthy males, a water-based extract of E. longifolia decreased the bioavailability of propranolol [ [202](#B202-molecules-21-00331)]. [185](#B185-molecules-21-00331)]. Use is to be avoided in individuals with diseases like breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, or sleep apnea, according to secondary sources [ [185](#B185-molecules-21-00331), [203](#B203-molecules-21-00331)]. [185](#B185-molecules-21-00331), [203](#B203-molecules-21-00331)]. Use during pregnancy and lactation and in children is not suggested due to a lack of sufficient data [ [185](#B185-molecules-21-00331)]. Information on E. longifolia's effects on lactation is lacking in the National Institute of Health's Lactation and Toxicology Database (LactMed) [ [203](#B203-molecules-21-00331)]. [195](#B195-molecules-21-00331)]. Low et al., investigated reproductive toxicity, up-&-down acute toxicity, and two generations of fetus teratology in orally TAF273 (quassinoid-rich E. longifolia extract)-treated rats. The results showed that the lethal dose (LD50) of TAF273 for male and female rats was >2000 and 1293 mg/kg, respectively. Fertility index and litter size of the treated rats were significantly increased, compared to non-treated rats [ [200](#B200-molecules-21-00331)]. 8. Conclusions [204](#B204-molecules-21-00331)], and less than 5% of known plants have been screened for one or more biological activities [ [205](#B205-molecules-21-00331)]. [206](#B206-molecules-21-00331)]. MS-guided isolation has taken great progress in drug discovery. Rapid processes are required for post-HTS \"hit\" characterization, at which point milligram or more quantities of the compound of interest must typically be isolated for further biological evaluation, as well as complete structure elucidation that illustrates the complementary nature of NMR and MS data for phytochemical analysis. Several in vitro tests that illuminate the property of interest are available for screening plants and their constituents in order to find the most effective materials and components for further investigations [ [207](#B207-molecules-21-00331)].
