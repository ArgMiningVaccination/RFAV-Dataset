Following the successful introduction of Foot &Mouth Disease Vaccine-Raksha, IIL launched the tissue culture vaccine \"Raksharab\" in 1989. This was the first Indian tissue culture vaccine in the market. Subsequently IIL has developed many biologicals through its own R&D efforts and launched several vaccines in the Indian market at affordable prices. IIL is today the third largest animal health player in the Indian market and the market leader in veterinary biologicals in India. It operates one of the largest plants in the world for veterinary vaccines which is WHO-GMP and ISO-9001 certified. IIL exports its products to several countries and export contributes substantially to the company's turnover. IIL pursues not only the mandate of NDDB to provide products and services to enhance the quality of livestock in the country but also use its technological capabilities to the benefit of the people of India. IIL strongly believes that its mission of \"immunity made affordable and accessible\" can be actively pursued only with a sound technology base in modern biotechnology. IIL operates a facility in Ooty to manufacture the Vero cell culture rabies vaccine for use in human beings. This plant was set up in 1998 at the specific request of the Government of India so that our country can phase out use of the older and unsafe sheep brain vaccine (also termed nerve tissue vaccine - NTV)) with the modern tissue culture vaccine. IIL sells the product under the brand name \"Abhayrab\" through its network of \"Abhayclinics, Abhayshoppee and Abhaymart \". IIL is the second company in the world and first in India to launch the purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV). IIL has set new benchmarks in animal bite treatment by making Abhayrab affordable and widely available through its unique franchisee network of doctors-Abhayclinics. A new vaccine facility in Hyderabad has been setup to manufacture human vaccines such as Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Recombinant Hepatitis-B as well as Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG). 44, - 25 Crore Approx.| 2010-11 Rs. 10 - 25 Crore Approx. 2011-12 Rs. 10 - 25 Crore Approx.
