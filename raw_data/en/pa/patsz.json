Thank you to Goddess Garden for sponsoring this post! What is your relationship with the sun? Do you worship it or hide from it? Cover up or let it all hang out? Bask in its warmth or basically ignore it? Even if you're somewhere in between like me (love the warmth but afraid of the burn), you're probably getting more sun exposure than you think. And along with that exposure comes sun damage to your skin. Why It Matters You may think those wrinkles and dark spots are the normal signs of aging - but UVA rays from the sun are a more likely culprit, since they cause premature aging of the skin. Little known fact - the sun is responsible for 90-percent of the visible signs of skin aging - that's a lot more than I would have guessed! Most sun related skin damage comes from non-deliberate exposure. Think driving to work, walking the dog, running errands around town - you don't need to be sitting on a beach to be catching some serious rays. Here are some of the ways the sun can catch you unaware, and age your skin in the process: - Windows - 50 -60% of UVA rays can get through windows, including car windows - Clouds - over 90% of UV rays can penetrate light clouds - Snow - clean snow reflects up to 80% of sun's rays - Water - UV rays are still 40% as intense half a meter under water - Winter - just because it's cold outside, doesn't mean those UV rays are not reaching you How to Repair Sun Damage Naturally So you know you're skin is sun damaged. But before you go running to the dermatologist asking for a prescription for retinol (a synthetic form of Vitamin A, also known as retinoids), keep in mind that [retinol has some nasty side effects](http://www.goddessgarden.com/blog/side-effects-of-retinol/), like burning and flaking skin. Plus retinol products (both prescription and OTC), typically contain other harsh ingredients and artificial fragrances that can cause irritation and allergies. A natural approach to repairing sun damage is a much better idea. Look for plant based ingredients that contain nourishing vitamins, antioxidants and carotenoids. Carotenoids are especially helpful because our bodies naturally convert them to usable retinoids, which stimulate the production of new skin cells. Ingredients like mango butter, seaweed extract, sunflower seed oil and chicory root are loaded with beta-carotene - or carotenoids. The fatty acids in rosehip seed oil and evening primrose oil also help to heal damaged skin. A diet containing foods high in Vitamin A, like sweet potatoes, spinach, kale, carrots, bell peppers, mango and cantaloupe, may also help.
