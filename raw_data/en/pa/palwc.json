In fact, for the fifth year in a row, the U.S. News & World Report's annual ranking revealed that the Mediterranean diet continues to be named [the best overall diet](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/mediterranean-diet), concluding that it may offer a host of health benefits, including weight loss, heart and brain health, cancer prevention, and diabetes prevention and control. Advertisement But how exactly do you follow a Mediterranean diet, and what makes it so adored by nutrition experts? Here, learn the basics of this tried-and-true diet, the numerous health benefits associated with it, and how to get started today. What is the Mediterranean diet? The Mediterranean diet as we know it today is based broadly on the diet of the countries lining the Mediterranean Sea. It became a phenomenon around the world when, in the 1950s and '60s, Ancel Keys and his colleagues [studied](https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19841460563) the diets and overall health of seven countries (United States, the Netherlands, Finland, Yugoslavia, Italy, Greece, and Japan) in relation to coronary heart disease risk. They found that people in Italy and Greece had the lowest risk of developing coronary heart disease, partially due to their diet. So what exactly does the Mediterranean diet look like? Unlike diets like [paleo](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/paleo-diet-101-the-definitive-guide-to-the-paleolithic-diet) and [keto](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-is-the-keto-diet-how-do-you-do-it), it does not limit macros or calories or cut out any particular food groups (such as grains). Instead, it focuses more on a healthy pattern of eating real, whole foods within every food group\u2014possibly making you less likely to feel restricted and more likely to stick to it. A typical, balanced Mediterranean diet includes antioxidant-rich fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, herbs, and spices. It also promotes regular consumption of [omega-3-rich](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/omega-3-fatty-acids-guide) fish and seafood and weekly consumption of poultry, eggs, cheese, and yogurt. The diet limits red meat, sweets, and other processed foods. [Red wine](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/healthiest-alcohol) is encouraged in moderation, but it's not a must. Coffee and tea are also allowed, but focus on drinking lots and [lots of water](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/benefits-of-drinking-water). \"It's usually the diet I recommend for my diabetic, heart disease, and autoimmune patients who do not have any food allergies or intolerances,\" [Bindiya Gandhi, M.D.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/dr-bindiya-gandhi), an American Board Family Medicine-certified physician, [told mbg](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/health-benefits-of-the-mediterranean-diet). The Mediterranean diet is also more than just a diet\u2014it emphasizes physical activity and social relationships. So exercising (even just walking) and dining with friends regularly is also encouraged. Summary Advertisement 5 biggest health benefits of the Mediterranean diet The Mediterranean diet has long been praised for its wide-ranging health benefits, from improved heart health to a reduced risk of cancer. It's also one of the most studied diets. Here are some of the most exciting science-backed benefits of the Mediterranean diet to date: It promotes heart health and increased life span. The Mediterranean diet is widely promoted due to its positive impact on heart health. The landmark [2013 PREDIMED study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMx140004) [1](#citations), which followed over 7,000 people, found that people eating a Mediterranean style diet rich in [olive oil](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-health-benefits-of-olive-oil) and nuts had significantly lower risk of experiencing a major cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke. These people also had fewer cardiovascular disease risk factors such as central obesity. Healthy fats\u2014like those found in nuts, olive oil, and fatty fish\u2014are likely a key element of the Mediterranean diet's heart-health benefits. [Omega-3 fats](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-much-omega-3s-per-day-to-support-health), for instance, lower \"bad\" LDL cholesterol, raise \"good\" HDL cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and improve [insulin resistance](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-lower-blood-sugar). High levels of fiber and antioxidants from a variety of vegetables, fruits, and red wine have [cardioprotective effects](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030387?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed) as well. Largely due to these improvements in heart health, the Mediterranean is also [associated with an increased life span](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5902736/) [2](#citations). Advertisement It promotes healthy weight and metabolism. The Mediterranean diet's focus on real, whole foods\u2014particularly those that are [high in fiber](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/your-definitive-guide-to-fiber)\u2014makes it a great choice for anyone looking to improve their overall [metabolic health](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/markers-of-metabolic-health). \"A high-fiber diet improves diabetes and glucose intolerance, keeps you full, and makes you less likely to gain weight,\" says Gandhi. In fact, the Mediterranean diet has been shown to be [more effective for weight loss than a low-fat diet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8017325/) [3](#citations); and it's been linked to a reduction in risk of chronic diseases such as [type 2 diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011042/) [4](#citations) and [metabolic syndrome](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/199488) [5](#citations). It's been shown to reduce cancer risk. The Mediterranean diet contains naturally high levels of [antioxidants](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-is-antioxidant-skin-care-benefits) from a variety of colorful plant foods. Antioxidants are compounds that help stop or slow oxidative damage and reduce inflammation throughout the body\u2014which is why they're often associated with a [reduced risk of cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15523104/) [6](#citations) and [neurodegenerative diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724665/) [7](#citations). In fact, studies show that the Mediterranean diet has a protective effect against various types of cancers. In one [research review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5691680/) [8](#citations) (encompassing 83 studies and over two million people), the Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer. Researchers credited the diet's higher intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Advertisement It's good for your memory and mood. For many of the same reasons that the Mediterranean diet is great for cancer prevention (i.e., its antioxidant and [anti-inflammatory](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/anti-inflammatory-diet-meal-plan) properties), it's also great for brain health. Research has shown that the Mediterranean diet may delay or reduce the risk of [Alzheimer's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20182044) [9](#citations) disease, as well as [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29775747) [10](#citations). Higher dietary intake of carotenoid antioxidants, found in a number of fruits and vegetables eaten on a Mediterranean diet (carrots, spinach, kale, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, apricots, melons, etc.), has specifically been linked to [improved mood and optimism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539819/) [11](#citations). It's good for your gut. The high intake of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables means this diet is also high in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants\u2014all of which can benefit [gut health](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-to-eat-to-heal-leaky-gut) by feeding the beneficial [probiotic bacteria](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/probiotics-how-to-choose-the-right-one-tell-if-theyre-high-quality-and-more) that live there, as well as reducing inflammation. In [one study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2018.00028/full) [12](#citations), primates that were fed a plant-heavy Mediterranean diet had a significantly higher population of good gut bacteria than those eating a typical meat-focused Western diet. Gut health is also closely tied to mental health, which may be another reason a Mediterranean diet is associated with better mood.
