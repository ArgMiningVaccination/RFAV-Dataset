Check \"True\" or \"False\" for each of the questions below to see what you know about mental disorders. True False Bad parenting causes mental disorders. Mental disorders are rare. Only uneducated and poor people develop mental disorders. People with mental disorders are usually dangerous. Culture can influence whether a person with a mental disorder decides to seek treatment. When communicating with a person who is actively hallucinating, it is important to find out what the hallucination is about. A person with a mental disorder who is aggressive should not be physically restrained. A person with a mental disorder who is decompensating will always experience a relapse. Talking about suicide with a person who has depression increases the risk that he or she will kill themselves. Medications can cure mental disorders. Mental illness is a weakness. A person with a mental illness can change if they try hard enough. If you think a person with mental illness is hearing voices, ask the individual if they are hearing voices.

Overview Mental disorders are biologically based brain disorders that can greatly interfere with a person's thinking, feelings, mood, ability to relate to others, and capacity to cope with the demands of life. People suffering from such disorders are prone to depression, anxiety, emotional distress, difficulty interpreting reality and substance abuse creating an increased need for medical and social support to stabilize or recover from their disorders. In a given year, 43.8 million adults experience mental illness in a given year. 1 in 5 adults in America experience mental illness. Nearly 1 in 25 adults in America live with a serious mental illness. One-half of all chronic mental illness begins by the age of 14; three-quarters by the age of 24. Approximately 10.2 million adults have co-occurring mental health and addiction disorders The National Alliance on Mental Illness has additional information available on mental health in the U.S. www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the- Numbers In spite of these statistics, many people remain unaware of the significant number of adults who have a mental disorder. Many adults, who would benefit from treatment, never get it. Why? Mental disorders are challenging to diagnose. The symptoms of a mental disorder vary along a range and there is no exact line that separates health from disorder. Often, people tend to focus on the extremes, defining mental disorders only by the most severe symptoms. A mental disorder can be difficult to acknowledge. Many people wait until their symptoms are severe before they seek help. Some people will never seek treatment. Like cancer or diabetes, mental illness is a medical condition that may improve or worsen, based on care and treatment. When working with people with mental illness, remain compassionate to people as individuals and realize that people who suffer from mental illness may behave or communicate differently or in ways that may seem confusing. More information will be provided in Lesson 2, and as you continue through this lesson, keep in mind that despite symptoms, behaviors, causes and treatments, each individual is unique and should be treated as an individual rather than a disease or diagnosis. Reflect on how mental illness has touched your life - at work, at home, with friends, with strangers, or even your own mental illness. Reflect on how you currently feel about mental illness. 6 7Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Diagnosing Mental Disorders How a Mental Disorder is Diagnosed It is not a caregiver's job to diagnose a person with a mental disorder. To diagnose a mental disorder, the person has to discuss his or her symptoms with a licensed clinician. The clinician will perform a mental status exam and observe the person's behavior. The clinician studies the person's symptoms and behaviors and reviews their illness and treatment history to determine if grouped into a pattern or syndrome. If the pattern or syndrome meets the criteria for a specific diagnosis, the clinician will make a diagnosis. This diagnostic exam is generally conducted in a hospital setting (such as a psychiatric or medical hospital) or in an outpatient setting such as medical clinic, a mental health clinic or a clinician's office. A diagnosis is not always the answer to all of someone's care needs. Avoid focusing on only one diagnosis when providing care for an individual. For example, an individual diagnosed with depression may have panic attacks or other symptoms that do not always match with the diagnosis. The key is to always be flexible to how care is provided.Challenges Many factors make a mental disorder challenging to diagnose. Unlike other medical issues, there is no blood test or physical exam that can determine if a person has a mental disorder. Symptoms vary along a continuum, changes often, and are not always visible. The health care provider does not always witness symptom(s) or does not have a complete history of the person's illness. The person may not always be fully open, truthful, or aware of what is happening. Each person's tolerance of symptoms varies. There may be more than one disorder present (coexisting conditions). Self-Diagnosis With the availability of so much information on the internet, it is easy to look up symptoms and self-diagnose an illness. When you self-diagnose, you are assuming that you know the subtleties of a diagnosis. For example, people who experience mood swings might self-diagnose bipolar disorder. However, mood swings can be a symptom that can be a part of many different scenarios. Mood swings could be due to an anxiety disorder such as post-traumatic stress disorder or stem from substance abuse. A professional diagnosis may identify other disorders or even another medical condition such as hyperthyroidism or irregular heartbeat. Self-diagnosis can confuse the proper diagnosis. Know that the point of diagnosis is to make sure a person receives the proper treatment and offering or reaffirming a self-diagnosis may confuse the individual's understanding of their condition and likely interfere in receiving proper treatment. Stigma and Myths There is a long history of stigma, misunderstanding, false beliefs and confusion surrounding mental disorders. Stigma Stigma related to mental disorders can greatly influence whether a person will seek treatment. Stigma is defined as a sign of shame or disgrace. Many people feel too ashamed or embarrassed to talk to anyone about what is happening and may try to conceal symptoms. Stigma is so powerful that it can also affect relationships with family members and contribute to the disorder being viewed as a failure on the part of the entire family system. Stigma also affects how others treat a person with a mental disorder. Evidence that stigma exists can take many forms, such as: Treating the person with the disorder as the disorder. For example, thinking and talking about the person as a schizophrenic, not as a person who is living with schizophrenia and has family, hopes, dreams, and abilities. Thinking there is something essentially wrong, bad, dangerous, or weak about the person because he or she has a mental disorder. Thinking the person is personally responsible for his or her condition. Using offensive or insulting language to refer to the person as lunatic, nuts, crazy, cray-cray, or psycho. Thinking bad parenting causes mental illness. Stigma and Caregiving Stigma can prevent caregivers from providing the best care they are capable of giving. If you believe some of the misinformation about people with mental disorders, you may: Be uncomfortable assisting the person. Treat the person differently from people with other illnesses, such as cancer or heart disease. Let the fear of the person's mental disorder stop you from finding new ways to understand and relate to the person. It is important not to allow stigmas to impact your caregiving activities. The best way to help you separate yourself from the stigma is to: Learn the facts about the various mental disorders. This course is a good start. Talk and think about mental disorders in the same way you talk and think about any other illness. Challenge and question your attitude towards mental disorders. Challenge people around you who reinforce myths, stereotypes, and misunderstanding about mental disorders. Be supportive of people with a mental disorder diagnosis. You just learned about a man who will soon be in your care named Sherwood Wycoff. He is a 76-year- old man with schizophrenia. You have no other information yet on Sherwood, but you have heard that schizophrenia makes people dangerous, violent and unpredictable. What can you do to separate yourself from this stigma so that you can provide the best care possible for Sherwood? 7Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration 8 9Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Myths and Facts There are many myths around mental illness. You may hear myths about mental illness from family, friends, coworkers and even the media. It is important to stop, suspend your judgement and realize that mental illness is a medical condition. Myth Mental disorders are rare. People with mental disorders are violent, dangerous and unpredictable. Personality weakness or character flaws cause mental disorders. People with mental disorders can snap out of it if they try hard enough. Bad parenting causes mental disorders. Only uneducated and poor people develop mental disorders. Talking about suicide to a person with depression increases the risk that he or she will do it. Medications can cure mental disorders.Fact Mental disorders are very common. In a given year, 43.8 million adults experience mental illness. 1 in 5 adults in America experience mental illness. Nearly 1 in 25 adults in America live with a serious mental illness The majority of people with mental disorders are no more likely to be violent than anyone else. Individuals living with a serious mental illness account for only 3%- 5% of violent acts. People with a mental disorder are more likely to harm themselves or be harmed than they are to hurt other people. A person with schizophrenia is approximately 2,000 times more likely to commit suicide than they are to harm someone else. Mental disorders have nothing to do with being lazy or weak and many people need help to manage their illness. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including biological factors (genes, illness, injury, brain chemistry), life experiences (abuse, trauma), or family history of mental illness. Mental disorders are biologically based brain disorders. They are not the result of personal weakness, lack of character, or poor upbringing. Mental disorders are not related to a person's character, intelligence or socioeconomic status. Mental disorders can affect people of any age, race, religion, or income. Talking to someone about suicide actually decreases the risk that the person will try to take their own life. Often we are fearful of talking to someone about their desire to kill themselves because we are fearful that we will cause them to commit suicide. In reality, most suicidal people desperately want to live but are unable to see alternatives to their problems. Talking with someone helps. Mental disorders are treatable but may not be curable. Often a person with a mental disorder can take medications to help manage the condition and may even contribute to the symptoms significantly improving or even disappearing. However, the disorder is not cured, it is merely managed.9Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Mental Health Conditions The following mental disorders are outlined on the following pages. This list does not include all mental disorders and some of the disorders listed may be more common than others. For more information on these and other mental health conditions, refer to the National Institutes of Health, National Alliance on Mental Illness, National Institute of Mental Health and www.MentalHealth.gov. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Anxiety Disorders Autism Spectrum Disorder Bipolar Disorder Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Depression Dissociative Disorders Eating Disorders Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Schizophrenia Schizoaffective Disorder Related Conditions (Anosognosia, Dual Diagnosis, Psychosis, Risk of Suicide, Self-Harm, Sleep Disorders, Substance Abuse) For your quick reference, we are providing a general description of the conditions and a list of more common signs and symptoms of each condition. You will see that some conditions have similar symptoms and some symptoms such as \"mood swings\" found with various conditions such as with PTSD, borderline personality disorder and with bipolar disorder. It speaks to the complexity involved in determining a person's diagnosis. Remember, it is not your job to diagnose mental disorders. It is your job to be aware of mental health conditions so you can understand individuals and make better decisions regarding their care.Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) include being distracted, extremely active and acting on impulse. Most commonly diagnosed in young people, ADHD affects all ages. According to the National Alliance on Mental Health, an estimated four percent of adults have ADHD. Symptoms Inattention Distracted easily Bored with tasks quickly Difficulty focusing attention or completing a single task or activity Trouble completing tasks or projects Not listening or paying attention when spoken to Daydreaming or wandering with lack of motivation Difficulty processing information quickly Hyperactivity Fidgeting and squirming, trouble sitting still Non-stop talking Touching or playing with everything Difficulty doing quiet tasks or activities Impulsivity Impatience Acting without regard for consequences, blurting things out Difficulty taking turns, waiting or sharing Interrupting others Causes Genetics may cause a high risk of developing ADHD which runs in families and trends in specific brain areas that contribute to attention. Environmental factors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy or exposure to lead as a child may lead to increase likelihood of ADHD according to studies. Treatment Treatment plans are most effective when tailored to an individual's needs. Behavioral therapy Elimination diets (to determine if food allergies/ sensitivities play a role in the severity of symptoms) Medication Neruofeedback (EEG biofeedback) Nutritional supplements For more information on mental health medications, visit the National Institute of Mental Health at www.nimh.nih.gov.

How can you be supportive of people with this disorder? 10 11Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Anxiety Disorder Occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. Anxiety disorder is feeling of worry and fear of a real or perceived threat that does not go away and can get worse over time. Anxiety can interfere with functions of normal daily life and affect relationships. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorder in America. In 2015, an estimated 18 percent of adults in the U.S. had an anxiety disorder. Symptoms of anxiety disorders can become chronic and debilitating, if not treated. Symptoms Emotional symptoms Feelings of worry or dread Feeling tense and jumpy Restlessness or irritability Anticipating the worst and being watchful for signs of danger Physical symptoms Pounding or racing heart Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Upset stomach Sweating, fatigue and insomnia Upset stomach, frequent urination or diarrhea Types of Anxiety Disorders The most common anxiety disorders include: Generalized anxiety disorder Panic disorder Phobias Social anxiety disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a disorder characterized by excessive or exaggerated worry about several aspects of life, such as work, social relationships, or financial matters. Individuals with GAD often expect the worst even when there is no obvious reason for concern. GAD is typically diagnosed when an individual finds it difficult to control worry on more days than not for at least six months and has three or more symptoms. 11Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Symptoms include: Difficulty concentrating Difficulty controlling the worry Fatigue and exhaustion Irritability Muscle tension Nausea Restlessness or nervous Sleep problems Panic Disorder Panic disorder is debilitating anxiety and fear arising frequently and without known reason, but more frequently triggered by fear-producing events or thoughts. Often mistaken for a heart attack, a panic attack causes powerful, physical symptoms. Panic attacks can last for a few seconds to several minutes. Because people suffering from panic attacks experience terrible distress during such attacks, they often are worried and anxious about suffering future panic attacks. Symptoms include: Agitation Anxiousness Chest pain Dizziness Fear or avoidance of places where panic attacks have occurred in the past Fear of dying Feelings of being out of control during a panic attack Heart palpitations Hyperventilation Intense worries about when the next attack will happen Rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath Stomach upset Sudden and repeated attacks of intense fear TinglingPhobias A phobia is an extreme or irrational fear of or aversion to a situation, living creature, place or thing. Most individuals with specific phobias have several triggers. To avoid panicking, someone with specific phobias will work hard to avoid their triggers. Depending on the type and number of triggers, this fear and the attempt to control it can seem to take over a person's life. The source of the phobia may have more or less negative effects on a person's life depending on how often or rarely the trigger occurs. Symptoms include: Distress Panic attacks Stress Social Anxiety Disorder Social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of scrutiny and judgment by others in social or performance situations. Symptoms of social anxiety disorder are more than being shy and may be so extreme that it disrupts daily life. Individuals with this disorder may have few or no social or romantic relationships, making them feel powerless, alone, or even ashamed. 12 13Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Symptoms include: Being very afraid that other people will judge them Blushing, sweating, or trembling around other people Difficulty making friends and keeping friends Feeling anxious about being with other people and having a hard time talking to others Feeling nauseous or sick to their stomach when other people are around Feeling powerless against their anxiety Feeling very self-conscious in front of other people and worried about feeling humiliated, embarrassed, or rejected, or fearful of offending others Panic attack symptoms Staying away from places where there are other people Terrified they will humiliate or embarrass themselves Worrying far in advance about events or social interactions Causes Genetics might be a factor in someone developing an anxiety disorder. There is evidence that anxiety disorders run in families. A stressful or traumatic situation such as abuse, death of a loved one, violence or prolonged illness is often linked to the development of an anxiety disorder. Treatment Each anxiety disorder has a different set of symptoms and the type of treatment may vary. Common types of treat - ment include: Psychotherapy, also called \"talk therapy\" Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) teaches a person different ways of thinking, behaving and reacting to anxiety-producing and fearful situations. Stress management techniques and meditation Self-help or support groups Medications such as antidepressants, anti-anxiety medi - cation or beta blockers What is your attitude about this disorder? What are the facts about this disorder? How can you be supportive of people with this disorder?Autism Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development. Generally, ASD is characterized in varying degrees by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication and repetitive behaviors. Persons with ASD can experience significant behavioral disturbances such as emotional outburst, restless behavior and visible distress when they encounter stress. Symptoms Emotional symptoms Symptoms of ASD fall on a continuum. This means there is a range from gifted abilities to severely challenged. Symptoms may include: Delay in language development Repetitive and routine behaviors Difficulty making eye contact Sensory problems Difficulty interpreting facial expressions Problems with expressing emotions Fixation on parts of objects Difficulty interacting with peers Self-harm behavior Sleep problems 13Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Causes Scientists do not know the exact causes of ASD, but research suggests that genes and environment play important roles. (NIMH) Information is always evolving. Check www.NIMH.nih. gov for updated information. Treatment Many treatment plans exist for ASD. Each treatment should be tailored to an individual's unique needs. These can con - sist of medications, therapy or both. Often, reducing stress and keeping a consistent routine can reduce the severity of symptoms with someone with ASD. What is your attitude about this disorder? What are the facts about this disorder? How can you be supportive of people with this disorder?Depression Depression is a serious, but treatable, mood disorder that involves the body, mood, and thoughts. It affects the way the person eats and sleeps, feelings about self, and the way the person thinks about things. Depression is not the same as a passing sad mood. It involves serious symptoms that last for at least several weeks and make it difficult to function normally. Symptoms Social withdrawal Persistent sadness, irritability, or despair Feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, guilt, or helplessness Decreased interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions Changes in appetite, weight gain or loss Changes in sleep patterns\u2014either sleeping a lot or having difficulty sleeping A loss of energy, feeling tired despite little activity Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headache, chronic pain, weakness, or constipation Suicidal thinking Causes There is no single cause for the onset of depression. Scientific research has firmly established that severe de - pression is a biological brain disorder resulting from an imbalance in brain chemicals that regulate mood. Psychological, genetic, and environmental factors also contribute to the onset of depression. An episode of depression can occur spontaneously or be triggered by: A stressful life event such as a significant loss, difficult relationship, or financial problems. Physical illness such as heart disease or cancer. Alcohol or drug abuse. Some medications. 14Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration 15Treatment Depression can be a devastating disorder. For most people, treatment is highly effective with a combination of medi - cations, therapy and lifestyle changes. That is why it is critical that depression be recognized and treated as soon as possible. What is your attitude about this disorder? What are the facts about this disorder? How can you be supportive of people with this disorder?Bipolar Disorder Bipolar disorder causes unusual shifts in a person's mood, energy, and ability to function. Bipolar disorder is a chronic and generally life-long condition with recurring episodes of mania and depression that can last from days to months. Generally, these mood changes happen in cycles. The symptoms of bipolar are severe and are different from the normal ups and downs that everyone goes through. Symptoms An individual with bipolar disorder may have distinct manic or depressed states. These states can last for a day or two or last several weeks in which an individual can have a cluster of the symptoms listed below. Severe cases may also include psychotic symptoms such as hallucina - tions or delusions. Suicidal thinking and suicide attempts are almost twice as likely with bipolar disorder than those suffering from depression alone. Mania Mania is excessive and persistent elevated or irritable mood. Increased energy, activity, restlessness, pacing, and fidgeting Either an elated happy mood or an irritable, angry, unpleasant mood Decreased sleep and decreased need for sleep Poor concentration Unrealistic beliefs in his or her abilities or power Poor judgment and impaired impulse control Increased sexual and risky activities Increased talking, more rapid or louder speech than usual Racing thoughts, jumping from one idea to another Denial that anything is wrong Depression See symptoms of depression on page 13. Causes The psychological basis for bipolar disorder is better understood than other forms of depression. Contribut - ing factors include: Genetics and heredity \u2014 some research suggests that people with certain genes are more likely to develop bipolar than others. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are more likely to develop the illness compared with children who do not have a family history of the disorder. Biological factors \u2014 a disturbance in brain chemicals that regulate mood and activity. Environmental factors \u2014 stressful situations cannot cause the disorder but can trigger a manic-depressive episode in a person who is vulnerable to the disorder. Treatment A combination of medication and psychosocial treat - ment has been shown to be consistently effective. Bipolar disorder is better controlled if treatment is continuous rather than off and on. Education is crucial to helping the person, and his or her supports, learn how to manage bipolar disorder and prevent complications. Keeping a chart of daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events can help the doctor track and treat the disorder most effectively. Support groups offer help and understanding that can promote longer-term mood stability. What is your attitude about this disorder? What are the facts about this disorder? How can you be supportive of people with this disorder?Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration 15Borderline Personality Disorder Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness marked by problems regulating emotions and thoughts, moods, impulsive and reckless behaviors, and unstable relationships. This difficulty leads to severe mood swings, impulsivity and instability, poor self-image and inability to maintain strong personal relationships. Individuals with this disorder also have high rates of co-occurring disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and eating disorders, along with self-harm and suicidal behavior. Ordinary events (such as someone they care about taking a vacation or trip) may trigger symptoms. People with this condition have high death rates related to suicide. Symptoms People with BPD experience wide mood swings and can show instability and insecurity. Signs and symptoms include: Fears being abandoned by family and friends Unstable personal relationships often veering from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger (devaluation) Distorted self-image Impulsive behaviors that may have dangerous outcomes Suicidal or self-harming behavior Periods of intense depressed mood, irritability or anxiety lasting a few hours to a few days Chronic feelings of boredom or emptiness Inappropriate, intense or uncontrollable anger followed by shame and guilt Disconnecting thoughts or identity (\"out of body\" type feeling) Stress related paranoid thoughts May see anger in an emotionally neutral face and may have a strong reaction to words with negative meanings more often than people without BPD 16 17Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Dissociative Disorder Dissociative disorders are an involuntary escape from reality and a disconnection between thoughts, identity, consciousness and memory. Dissociative disorders are often triggered as a response to a traumatic event to keep the memories under control. Symptoms Symptoms and signs of dissociative disorders include: Significant memory loss of specific times, people and events Out-of-body experiences Depression, anxiety and/or thoughts of suicide A sense of detachment from your emotions or emotional numbness A lack of sense of self-identity Causes Dissociative disorders usually develop as a way of deal - ing with trauma. Dissociative disorders most often form in children exposed to long-term physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Natural disasters and combat can also cause dissociative disorders. Treatment Dissociative disorders are managed through various thera - pies including psychotherapies, eye movement desensitiza - tion and medications, including antidepressants that can treat symptoms of related conditions. What is your attitude about this disorder? What are the facts about this disorder? How can you be supportive of people with this disorder?Causes Genetics may play a part in BPD. Studies with twins indicate that the illness is five times more common among people who have a first-degree relative with the disorder. Traumatic events such as physical or sexual abuse dur - ing childhood or neglect and separation from parents are linked to an increased risk of developing BPD. Brain function is different in people with BPD and may be a basis for some of the symptoms. Treatment Individuals with BPD are often treated with a combination of psychotherapy (talk therapy), peer and family support and medications to address co-occurring symptoms.

How can you be supportive of people with this disorder?17Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Eating Disorders Eating disorders are a group of related conditions that cause serious emotional and physical problems related to extreme issues with food and weight. Without treatment, eating disorders can take over a person's life and lead to serious, potentially fatal medical complications. Examples of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Symptoms Symptoms vary by disorder and may include starvation, obsessing about weight, eating large amounts of food then forcing vomiting or abusing laxatives and eating large amounts of food in a short amount of time even when not hungry and not attempting to purge. Causes Most experts believe that eating disorders are caused by people attempting to cope with overwhelming feelings and painful emotions by controlling food intake. Factors that may be involved in developing an eating disorder include genetics, environment, peer pressure and emo - tional health. Treatment Managing an eating disorder can involve a variety of techniques. Treatments will vary depending on the type of disorder, but will generally include psychotherapy, medication, nutritional counseling and weight restoration monitoring. What is your attitude about this disorder? What are the facts about this disorder? How can you be supportive of people with this disorder?Obsessive-compulsive Disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive, unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and irrational, excessive urges to do certain actions (compulsions). Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behavior do not make sense, they are often unable to stop them. Symptoms Each person with OCD may experience symptoms differently. Obsessions may include: Thoughts about harming or having harmed someone Doubts about having done something correctly, like turning off the stove or locking a door Unpleasant sexual images Fears of saying or shouting inappropriate things in public Compulsions may include: Hand washing due to a fear of germs Counting and recounting money because a person is sure they added incorrectly Checking and rechecking to see if a door is locked or the stove is off Causes The exact cause is unknown, but researchers believe that activity in several portions of the brain is responsible. Treatment A typical treatment plan will often include both psycho - therapy and medications; combined treatment is usually optimal. What is your attitude about this disorder?

How can you be supportive of people with this disorder?18 19Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that develops in some people who experience a shocking, scary, or dangerous event. It is natural to feel afraid after a traumatic experience. Fear triggers many changes in the body to help defend against danger or avoid it. This is known as \"fight-or-flight\" response. Nearly everyone will experience a range of reactions after trauma and most people recover from the initial symptoms naturally over time. Those who continue to experience problems may be diagnosed with PTSD. People with PTSD may feel stressed or frightened and go into \"fight-or-flight\" mode even when they are no longer in danger. Symptoms Intrusive memories, including flashbacks of reliv - ing the moment of trauma, bad dreams and scary thoughts. Avoidance, including staying away from certain places or objects that are reminders of the traumatic event. A person may also feel numb, guilty, worried or de - pressed or having trouble remembering the traumatic event. Dissociation, which can include out of body experi - ences or feeling that the world is \"not real\". Hyper vigilance, including being startled very easily, feeling tense, trouble sleeping or outbursts of anger Causes Anyone can develop PTSD at any age. This includes war veterans, children, and people who have been through a physical or sexual assault, abuse, accident, disaster, or many other serious events. According to the National Center for PTSD, about eight percent of Americans will experience PTSD at some point in their lives.

Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that interferes with a person's ability to think clearly, manage emotions, make decisions and relate to others. It is a complex, long-term medical illness, affecting about one percent of Americans. Although schizophrenia can occur at any age, the average age of onset tends to be in the late teens to the early 20s for men, and the late 20s to early 30s for women. It is uncommon for schizophrenia to be diagnosed in a person younger than 12 or older than 40. Symptoms Isolation and withdrawal from others Sleep problems and irritability Hallucinations Delusions Negative symptoms o Emotionally flat or speaking in a dull, disconnected way o Unable to start or follow through with activities o Show little interest in life or sustain relationships Cognitive issues / disorganized thinking 19Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Causes Research suggests that schizophrenia may have several possible causes, including genetics, environment, brain chemistry and use of psychoactive drugs during teen years and young adulthood can increase the risk. Treatment There is no cure for schizophrenia, but it can be treated and managed in several ways. Antipsychotic medications Psychotherapy Self-management strategies and education What is your attitude about this disorder? What are the facts about this disorder? How can you be supportive of people with this disorder? Schizoaffective Disorder Schizoaffective disorder is a chronic mental health condition characterized primarily by symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations or delusions, and symptoms of a mood disorder, such as mania and depression. Symptoms Symptoms of schizoaffective disorder can be severe and needs to be closely monitored. Depending on the mood disorder diagnosed, depression or bipolar disorder, people will experience different symptoms. Causes The exact cause of schizoaffective disorder is unknown. A combination of causes may contribute to the develop - ment of schizoaffective disorder such as genetics, brain chemistry and structure, stressful events and use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD. Treatment Schizoaffective disorder is treated and managed in sev - eral ways: Medications Psychotherapy Self-managed strategies and education What is your attitude about this disorder?

How can you be supportive of people with this disorder?20 21Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Related Conditions Anosognosia (ano\u00b7sog\u00b7no\u00b7sia) Anosognosia is when someone is unaware of their own mental health condition or they cannot recognize their condition accurately. Anosognosia is a common symptom of certain mental illnesses. The brain's frontal lobe can be damaged by schizophrenia and bipolar as well as diseases like dementia. When the frontal lobe is not fully functional, a person may lose or partially lose the ability to update his or her self-image. Without an update, we are stuck with our old self-image from before the illness started. Since our perceptions feel accurate, we conclude that our loved ones are lying or making a mistake. Lack of insight typically causes a person to avoid treat - ment and the most common reason for people to stop taking their medications. Dual Diagnosis / Substance Abuse Dual diagnosis is a term for when someone experiences a mental illness and a substance abuse problem simul - taneously. Either substance abuse or mental illness can develop first. A person experiencing a mental health condition may turn to drugs and alcohol as a form of self-medication to improve the troubling mental health symptoms they experience. This is counterproductive though, -a research shows drugs and alcohol only make the symptoms of mental health conditions worse. Substance abuse can also lead to mental health prob - lems because of the effects drugs have on a person's moods, thoughts, brain chemistry and behavior. Psychosis Psychosis is characterized as disruptions to a person's thoughts and perceptions that make it difficult for them to recognize what is real and what is not. These disrup - tions are often experienced as seeing, hearing, and believing things that are not real or having strange, per - sistent thoughts, behaviors and emotions. While every - one's experience is different, most people say psychosis is frightening and confusing. Psychosis is a symptom, not an illness, and is more common that you may think. In the U.S., approximately 100,000 young people experience psychosis each year. As many as three in 100 people will have an episode at some point in their lives.Risk of Suicide The majority of people who experience a mental illness do not commit suicide. However, of those who die from suicide, more than 90 percent had a diagnosable mental disorder. For more on suicide, see lesson 5. Self-harm Self-harm or self-injury means hurting yourself on pur - pose. Hurting yourself, or thinking about hurting yourself is a sign of emotional distress. Self-harm is not a mental illness, but a behavior that indicates a lack of coping skills. Several illnesses are associated with it, including borderline personality disorder, depression, eating disor - ders, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder. Self-harm is not the same as attempting suicide. How - ever, it is a symptom of emotional pain that should be taken seriously. If someone is hurting themselves, they may be at an increased risk of feeling suicidal. It is im - portant to find treatment for the underlying emotions. Sleep Disorders Many people experience problems sleeping including not getting enough sleep, not feeling rested and not sleeping well. This problem can lead to difficulties functioning during the daytime and have unpleasant effects on work, social and family life. One of the major sleep disorders that people face is insomnia. Insomnia is an inability to get the amount of sleep needed to function efficiently during the daytime. Over one-third of Americans report difficulty sleeping. Insomnia is rarely an isolated medical or mental illness, but rather a symptom of another illness or a result of a person's lifestyle or work schedule. Dementia The DSHS Dementia Capable Caregiving course cov - ers dementia caregiving in detail. Know that persons suffering from mental conditions covered in this lesson generally have an earlier onset of dementia than those without mental illness. Hence, as a person with mental illness ages, they may exhibit early dementia character - istics before diagnosed with dementia and may exhibit behavioral and mood symptoms as well.21Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson Summary Mental disorders are biologically based brain disorders that can greatly interfere with a person's thinking, feelings, mood, ability to relate to others, and capacity to cope with the demands of life. It is not a caregiver's job to diagnose a person with a mental disorder. To diagnose a mental disorder, the person has to discuss his or her symptoms with a licensed clinician. It is your job to be aware of mental health conditions so you can understand individuals and make better decisions regarding their care. Occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. Anxiety disorder is feelings of worry and fear of a real or perceived threat that does not go away and can get worse over time. Anxiety can interfere with functions of normal daily life and affect relationships. Bipolar disorder is a chronic and generally a life- long condition with recurring episodes of mania and depression that can last from days to months. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness marked by problems regulating emotions and thoughts, moods, impulsive and reckless behaviors, and unstable relationships. This difficulty leads to severe mood swings, impulsivity and instability, poor self-image and inability to maintain strong personal relationships. Depression is not the same as a passing sad mood. It involves serious symptoms that last for at least several weeks and make it difficult to function normally. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive, unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and irrational, excessive urges to do certain actions (compulsions). Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behavior do not make sense, they are often unable to stop them. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that develops in some people who experience a shocking, scary, or dangerous event. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that interferes with a person's ability to think clearly, manage emotions, make decisions and relate to others. Checkpoint Read the definition provided.

Lesson 3: Supports for Wellness The caregiver will identify possible medication side effects, ways to respond to side effects and recognize individualized non-drug therapies to minimize or alleviate symptoms of mental illness. Lesson 4: Getting Help and Self-Care The caregiver will recognize the importance of caregiver wellness and identify strategies to prevent secondary trauma and burnout.24 25Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson 2 Compassionate and Trauma-Informed Care Objective: The caregiver will recognize that culture; generation, religion/spirituality and past trauma experiences can affect current thinking, behaviors and actions and will identify strategies to provide informed care and support resilience. Overview Many experiences can shape thinking and behaviors around mental health care. Attitudes may differ based on age, gender, disability, education level, religion/ spirituality, stigma, past experiences with mental health care and past traumas. The experiences we have growing up, the perceptions we learn from media, our families, our peers - all contribute to our thinking. These factors may also shape the thinking of the individuals you care for, their friends, family and others involved in their care. Attitudes about mental illness often come from underlying stigma, which can cause individuals with a mental disorder to deny symptoms; delay treatment; exclusion from employment, housing, or relationships; and interfere with management of the illness. Take a few minutes and consider the things that you would like others to know about you. Here are some topics to get you started. Surface level: Age, gender, physical features, food preferences, clothing... Below the surface: Spirituality, thoughts on aging, sense of self, rules for social interaction, decision-making, perceptions on mental disorders, perceptions on disability, perceptions of roles related to age, gender, class... How do you respond when others have different thoughts, views and perceptions than you? How do you feel when others assume you have similar beliefs based on your gender, age, physical features, etc?Culture and Ethnicity Culture and ethnicity play critical roles in our understanding of mental health and mental disorders. All people have the right to be understood, have their culture valued and respected and be treated with dignity. Culture is a common heritage or set of beliefs, norms and values. Ethnicity is a common heritage shared by a particular group. Heritage is a similar history, language, rituals and preferences for music and foods. Understanding the wide-ranging roles of culture and society enables caregivers and providers to offer culturally appropriate care that is responsive to the needs of the person. The challenge for caregivers is to understand the person with a mental disorder's perspective. This requires that caregivers: Develop an open style of communication. Be receptive to learning from residents whose background may be different from yours. Demonstrate a willingness to learn and consider new ideas that may or may not be familiar parts of an individual's background. One of the challenges when getting to know more about a person's cultural characteristics is the possibility of creating or reinforcing stereotypes. A stereotype is an oversimplified opinion, prejudiced attitude or critical judgment. Cultural characteristics of a given group may invite stereotyping of individuals based on their appearance or affiliation. These characteristics should not be used to reinforce stereotypes. What is seen on the surface of an individual does not make up the whole person. To provide culturally appropriate care, you need to get to know the whole person. Impact of Culture on the Care of 25Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Individuals with Mental Disorders A person's culture can influence mental health and the treatment of mental disorders. Many people from different backgrounds see mental illness as shameful and delay treatment until symptoms reach crisis proportions. Culture may affect how people with mental disorders: Describe or present symptoms One way in which culture affects mental disorders is in how the person describes or presents his or her symptoms. People in different cultures tend to selectively express or present symptoms in culturally acceptable ways. Some people may describe physical distress (headaches, stomach ache) yet are reluctant to talk about their emotional distress (depression, sadness, anxiety). This may be because in some cultures it is \"ok\" to talk about physical illness but mental distress or a mental disorder is viewed as bad. Give meaning, defines, or makes sense of a mental disorder Culture may also affect the way a person makes sense of his or her illness and of his or her distress. Mental disorders are often viewed as conditions that reflect poorly on family or as condition brought on by a bad deed committed by the individual. Deep-seated attitudes and beliefs about mental illness may affect whether the disorder is viewed as \"real\" or \"imagined.\" Cope with a mental disorder Culture will also affect how people cope with everyday problems and more extreme types of adversity like a mental disorder. Depending on their culture, some people may attempt to handle mental disorders on their own, some will rely more on spirituality to help and others rely on strong family support to help in coping with and dealing with their mental disorder. Seek treatment Culture may influence the pathway to treatment. Research indicates that individuals from some cultures are more likely to delay seeking treatment until symptoms are more severe. In addition, it is well documented that racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are less likely to seek mental health treatment. Mistrust is one of the main reasons racial and ethnic minorities might not seek help. Mistrust of treatment is often rooted in a sense of historical persecution and from present-day struggles with racism and discrimination. It also rises from documented abuses and perceived mistreatment in the present as well as the past. When seeking treatment, culture may influence where treatment is received. Culture may influence whether a person turns to informal sources of care such as clergy, traditional healers, family and friends. Some cultures do not support or buy into Westernized medicine and may seek help or remedies in different ways. For example, American Indians and Alaska Natives often rely on traditional healers, who frequently work with formal providers in tribal mental health programs. Some African Americans communities often rely on ministers, who may play various mental health roles within the spiritual context. 58 year-old Burma Zambrano has many symptoms of depression. She denies having a mental disorder. It is her belief that mental illness is actually something evil that is trying to harm or destroy her. She seeks help from reading her bible and attending church. How might you support Burma?26Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration 27Trauma-Informed Care Trauma Many people experience trauma during their lifetimes. Although many people exposed to trauma demonstrate few or no lingering symptoms, those who have experienced repeated, chronic, significant or multiple traumas are more likely to exhibit pronounced symptoms and consequences, including substance abuse, mental illness, and health problems. Subsequently, trauma can significantly affect how an individual engages in major life areas as well as treatment. Trauma refers to experiences that cause intense physical and psychological stress reactions. It can refer to \"a single event, multiple events, or a set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically and emotionally harmful or threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual's physical, social, emotional, or spiritual wellbeing\" (SAMHSA, 2012, p. 2). Although many individuals report a single specific traumatic event, others, especially those seeking mental disorder or substance abuse services, have been exposed to multiple or chronic traumatic events. Trauma survivor is anyone who has experienced trauma or has had a traumatic stress reaction. Knowing that the use of language and words can set the tone for recovery or contribute to further re-traumatization, avoid the term \"victim\" and instead use the term \"survivor\" when appropriate. Traumas can affect individuals, families, groups, communities, specific cultures, and generations. It generally overwhelms an individual's or community's resources to cope, and it often ignites the \"fight, flight, or freeze\" reaction at the time of the event(s). Trauma frequently produces a sense of fear, vulnerability, and helplessness. Often, traumatic events are unexpected. Individuals may experience the traumatic event directly, witness an event, feel threatened, or hear about an event that affects someone they know. Events may be human made, such as an explosion, crash, war, terrorism, sexual abuse, or violence, or naturally occurring (e.g., flooding, hurricanes, and tornadoes). Trauma can occur at any age or developmental stage, and often, events that occur outside expected life stages are perceived as traumatic (e.g., a child dying before a parent, cancer as a teen, personal illness, job loss before retirement). Trauma may also present itself from cultural experiences and historical traumas even if the individual did not experience the trauma directly. For example, Native and African Americans experience historical trauma that plays out daily due to the treatment of their people; even if the person is younger and may have had no direct experience with such negative treatment. People may experience and interpret the same event or series of events in vastly different ways. For most, regardless of the severity of the trauma, the immediate or enduring effects of trauma are met with resilience\u2014 the ability to rise above the circumstances or to meet the challenges with fortitude. For some people, reactions to a traumatic event are temporary, whereas others have prolonged reactions that move from acute symptoms to more severe, prolonged, or enduring mental health consequences (e.g., posttraumatic stress and other anxiety disorders, substance abuse and mood disorders) and medical problems (e.g., headaches, chronic pain). Others do not meet established criteria for posttraumatic stress or other mental disorders but encounter significant trauma- related symptoms or culturally expressed symptoms of trauma (e.g., somatization, in which psychological stress is expressed through physical concerns). For that reason, even if an individual does not meet diagnostic criteria for trauma-related disorders, it is important to recognize that trauma may still affect his or her life in significant ways. Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration 27Trauma and Mental Disorders People who are receiving treatment for severe mental disorders are more likely to have histories of trauma, including childhood physical and/or sexual abuse, serious accidents, homelessness, involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations, drug overdoses, interpersonal violence, and other forms of violence. Many individuals with severe mental disorders meet criteria for PTSD; others with serious mental illness who have histories of trauma present with psychological symptoms or mental disorders including anxiety symptoms and disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, and substance use disorders. Mental illness increases the risk of experiencing trauma, and trauma increases the risk of developing psychological symptoms and mental disorders. Although not every person you care for will have a history of trauma, people who have substance use disorders and mental disorders are more likely to have experienced trauma. Being trauma aware does not mean that you must assume everyone has a history of trauma, but rather that you anticipate the possibility from your initial contact and interactions, intake processes, and screening and assessment procedures. Once you become aware of the significance of traumatic experiences in the lives of those you care for - you can shift from defining clients strictly from a diagnostic label, implying that something is wrong with them to one of resilience - a mindset that views clients' presenting difficulties, behaviors, and emotions as responses to surviving trauma. In essence, you will come to view traumatic stress reactions as normal reactions to abnormal situations. In embracing the belief that trauma-related reactions are adaptive, you can begin relationships with clients from a hopeful, strengths- based stance that builds upon the belief that their responses to traumatic experiences reflect creativity, self- preservation, and determination.Trauma Informed Care Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a strengths-based approach \"that is grounded in an understanding of and responsiveness to the impact of trauma, that emphasizes physical, psychological, and emotional safety for both providers and survivors, and that creates opportunities for survivors to rebuild a sense of control and empowerment\" (Hopper, Bassuk, & Olivet, 2010, p. 82). It also involves awareness in anticipating and avoiding processes and individual practices that are likely to re-traumatize individuals who already have histories of trauma, and it upholds the importance of person- centered caregiving. TIC identifies events that an individual has experienced and views them not as past events, but as experiences that form the core of the person's identity. TIC stresses the importance of addressing the person individually rather than applying general treatment approaches. The five key principles of trauma-informed care are safety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration, and empowerment. TIC Principles 1. Safety 2. Trustworthiness 3. Choice 4. Collaboration 5. EmpowermentDescription Protect from danger, risk or injury. Build an environment of honesty and truth. Create opportunities of choice for personal growth. Foster collaboration and opportunity for individuals to add ideas and concerns when appropriate. Acknowledge skills and abilities of an individual and support that person to focus on abilities rather than disabilities.28 29Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Trauma-Informed Approach A trauma-informed approach to the delivery of behavioral health services includes an understanding of trauma and an awareness of the impact it can have across settings, services, and populations. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a model of a trauma-informed approach: Realizes the impact of trauma and understands potential paths for recovery; Recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, staff; Responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, and practices; and Seeks to actively resist re-traumatization Re-traumatization is the occurrence of traumatic stress reactions and symptoms after exposure to multiple events (Duckworth & Follette, 2011). This is a significant issue for trauma survivors, both because they are at increased risk for higher rates of re-traumatization, and because people who experience multiple traumas often have more serious and chronic trauma-related symptoms than those with single traumas. Your role is to understand that some routine care tasks might be perceived as threatening to someone who has experienced trauma. Re-experiencing traumatic stress may result from a current situation that mirrors or replicates in some way the prior traumatic experiences (e.g., specific smells or other sensory input; interactions with others; responses to one's surroundings or interpersonal context, such as feeling emotionally or physically trapped). Although some events are more obviously likely to cause distress than others, all standard practices should be evaluated for their potential to re-traumatize the individuals you care for. You cannot consistently predict what may or may not be upsetting or re-traumatizing. Therefore, it is important to maintain vigilance and an attitude of curiosity, questioning about the concerns that they express and/or present during care. Remember that certain behaviors or emotional expressions can reflect what has happened to them in the past.This will help build mutual and collaborative relationships, help individuals identify what has worked and has not worked in their attempts to deal with the aftermath of trauma from a nonjudgmental stance, and develop intervention and coping strategies that are more likely to fit their strengths and resources. This view of trauma prevents further re-traumatization by not defining traumatic stress reactions as pathological or as symptoms of pathology. Work with the individual to learn the cues he or she associates with past trauma: Obtain a good history. Maintain a supportive, empathetic, and collaborative relationship. Encourage ongoing communication with the individual about how they feel about your approach. This collaboration will help foster trust, safety and empowerment with the individual. Provide a clear message of availability and accessibility throughout care. Tommie Callihan, age 83, diagnosed with post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that surfaced after a long service in the military. He started experiencing outbursts of anger, survivor's guilt and extreme difficulty with opposite sex relationships and frequent overpowering flashbacks 15 years ago. Tommie tried to keep these symptoms to himself and managed them on his own. The recent move into a care setting has triggered intense flashbacks and other symptoms. How can you support Tommie? Are there activities or tasks that you perform in your job that might re-traumatize Tommie? 29Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Culture and Trauma Some populations and cultures are more likely to experience a traumatic event or a specific type of trauma. Rates of traumatic stress are high across all populations and cultures that face military action and political violence. Culture influences not only whether certain events are perceived as traumatic, but also how an individual interprets and assigns meaning to the trauma. Some traumas may have greater impact on a given culture because those traumas represent something significant for that culture or disrupt cultural practices or ways of life. Culture determines \"acceptable\" responses to trauma and shapes the expression of distress. It significantly influences how people convey traumatic stress through behavior, emotions, and thinking immediately following a trauma and well after the traumatic experience has ceased. Traumatic stress symptoms vary according to the type of trauma within the culture. Culture affects what qualifies as a legitimate health concern and which symptoms warrant help. In addition to shaping beliefs about acceptable forms of help-seeking behavior and healing practices, culture can provide a source of strength, unique coping strategies, and specific resources. Resilience Resilience is the ability to bounce back or rise above adversity as an individual, family, community, or provider. Well beyond individual characteristics of hardiness, resilience includes the process of using available resources to negotiate hardship and/or the consequences of adverse events. Resilience applies to processes of individuals across the life span. Promote resilience by encouraging individual strengths. This is a key step in prevention when working with people who have been exposed to trauma. It is also an essential intervention strategy\u2014one that builds on the individual's existing resources and views him or her as a resourceful, resilient survivor. Knowing an individual' strengths' can help you understand, redefine, and reframe the individual's problems and challenges. You can shift the focus from \"What is wrong with you?\" to \"What has worked for you?\" It moves attention away from trauma-related problems and toward a perspective that honors and uses adaptive behaviors and strengths to move individuals along in recovery.Lesson Summary Key Points: Attitudes about mental illness often come from underlying stigma, which can cause individuals with a mental disorder to deny symptoms; delay treatment; exclusion from employment, housing, or relationships; and interfere with management of the illness. Understanding the wide-ranging roles of culture and society enables caregivers and providers to offer culturally appropriate care that is responsive to the needs of the person. A person's culture can influence mental health and the treatment of mental disorders.

Name: Tammy Marland Age: 85 Disorder: Generalized anxiety disorder Scenario: Ms. Marland has had anxiety most of her life. Recently with the loss of her husband, the anxiety has gotten worse and she worries about dying herself. She has become fearful of leaving her room and will often have difficulty breathing, is extremely tired and she spends a large amount of time worried about having anxiety. What are some strategies that you can use to support Tammy Marland? Name: Stefan Ocheltree has a family history of OCD and experienced trauma when his mother committed suicide in his teen years. In Stefan's culture, suicide is forbidden and he has developed obsessive thoughts about suicide. Stefan repeats many tasks in his day, including washing his hands frequently and checks locks and windows repeatedly before going to sleep at night. What are some strategies that you can use to support Stefan Ocheltree? Name: Janeth Mcfarren Age: 70 Disorder: Bipolar Scenario: Ms. Mcfarren has had symptoms of depression since her twenties. She was prescribed antidepressants but was fearful of the stigma of being depressed, so she did not take the medications. She felt isolated and turned to self- medicating with marijuana without consulting her doctor. Her behavior became erratic and she convinced herself that her family was all imposters. She was later diagnosed with bipolar but often feels shame and like a failure for having a mental disorder. What are some strategies that you can use to support Janeth Mcfarren?31Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson 3: Supports for Wellness Objective: The caregiver will identify possible medication side effects, ways to respond to side effects and recognize individualized non-drug therapies to alleviate symptoms of mental illness. Overview Providing care for individuals with various mental disorders can be challenging as well as rewarding. There are many supports listed within this lesson and many more that you may learn from your peers, managers, families of the individuals you care for and even the individuals themselves. The goal is to provide the best possible holistic care. This means caring for the whole person, taking into account mental and social factors rather than just the physical symptoms of the disease. This may include getting to know the individual as a person and learning about what works for this specific person, getting to know what the person's \"normal\" is and what it looks like for the individual to be doing well. This may also include being aware of medications and side effects when on and off medication and non-drug therapies that might enhance the individual's quality of life. You are a new caregiver and you focus on completing a list of tasks and forget to acknowledge the individuals you care for. Your mind is focused on the tasks and not the person as an individual. Discuss how this might make you feel. How do you think it would make the person you care for feel?Baseline or is this \"Recovery?\" Baseline is the time when a person with a mental disorder is managing his or her symptoms and functioning at his or her own highest level. Your goal is to help the individual get to their baseline and to stay there. You can help by: Encouraging the person to continue treatment and take his or her medications. Helping the person set realistic goals. Encourage the person to take small steps towards the goal. Creating an atmosphere of support. Empowering the person by encouraging and assisting with problem-solving techniques to help cope with obstacles as they arise. Being respectful, supportive and kind. Tell the person what they are doing well. This is the best way to help the individual to move forward. Encouraging the person to identify what causes stress and help the person find ways to reduce it. What Mental Health Looks Like Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and through adulthood. People with mental illness can work towards and achieve positive mental health. Just like \"baseline,\" each person's level of mental health varies depending on many factors. Mental health falls on a continuum. Wellness is not necessarily the absence of disease, illness, or stress but the presence of purpose in life, active involvement in satisfying work and play, joyful relationships, a healthy body and living environment, and happiness.32 33Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration The Eight Dimensions of Wellness Learning about the Eight Dimensions of Wellness can help you choose how to make wellness a part of everyday life. Wellness strategies are practical ways to start developing healthy habits that can have a positive impact on physical and mental health. Emotional OccupationalWellnessSpiritual Environmental Social Financial Physical Intellectual The Eight Dimensions of Wellness are: 1. Emotional - Coping effectively with life and creating satisfying relationships. 2. Environmental - Pleasant, stimulating environments that support well-being. 3. Financial - Satisfaction with current and future financial situations. 4. Intellectual - Recognizing creative abilities and finding ways to expand knowledge and skills. 5. Occupational - Personal satisfaction and enrichment from one's work. 6. Physical - Recognizing and taking action on the need for physical activity, healthy foods, and sleep. 7. Social - Developing a sense of connection, belonging, and a well-developed support system. 8. Spiritual - Expanding a sense of purpose and meaning in life.Positive Mental Health Positive mental health allows people to: Realize their full potential Cope with the stresses of life Work productively Make meaningful contributions to their communities Ways to maintain positive mental health include: Seeking professional help if you need it Connecting with others Staying positive Being physically active Helping others Getting enough sleep Developing and using coping skills Person-Centered Planning In the mental health community, a history of discrimination and disempowerment led many to seek a way for individuals to reclaim their identity and their role in their own therapeutic process. Person-Centered Planning is placing the person at the center and above all other aspects of the treatment process; we consider this the best way to provide care. 33Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration It is important that people are seen first as people and not as their illness. People are not Schizophrenic, Bipolar, or Borderline. People are not cases or illnesses to be managed. When people are seen only as Schizophrenic, it often becomes too easy to focus on just reducing symptoms of psychosis. The problem with an illness- centered approach is health is more holistic than the absence of the hearing voices or other symptoms. Recovery involves increasing a person's ability to make the changes they want in their life - the power to heal, to identify goals, to develop the ability to accomplish goals and provide the supports needed to attain goals. It means focusing on the person's strengths and the choices they want for their lives - not just their symptoms. It is important to assess the way we use language and how the use of language reinforces negative biases or promotes empowerment and strengths. It is helpful to remember that people often identify by roles where they find meaning. Strengths-based roles help us to feel better and promote recovery: \"I am a father, a sister, an electrician, a friend.\" Negative language reinforces discrimination and isolation in society. Labeling someone as a schizophrenic, crazy or wacko is hurtful and detrimental to recovery or management. In the mental health field, people may self-identify as clients, consumers, peers, survivors, person in recovery. When taking a person-centered approach, identify people by the language or title they feel most comfortable with. When in doubt, call someone by name and ask how you should address him or her in the future. When planning and providing care, use a holistic approach with an attitude of respect for the individual and his or her unique experiences and needs. Medication, Treatments and Therapies In caring for individuals with mental disorders, there are many conventional medicines as well as alternative non-drug therapies available. The information provided within this section is meant to inform you of the multitude of options for treatment and it is not important for you to memorize medication names. Your main job as a caregiver is to be aware of any side effects for each individual and take appropriate action.Conventional Medicine Conventional medications can be used in treating several mental disorders and conditions. Information about medications change frequently. For up to date information on the latest warnings, medication guides, or newly approved medications, visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website. Medications used for mental disorders do not cure mental disorders, but can help the person function better or reach their baseline. The extent to which medication helps can range from little relief of symptoms to complete relief, depending on the person and the disorder and may be influenced by: Age Sex Body size Body chemistry Physical illness Diet Habits, i.e. smoking and alcohol consumption The length of time a person has to take a medication will also depend on the individual and the disorder. The following are basic rules to follow whenever a medication is prescribed: Only a licensed medical or mental health practitioner can determine and prescribe what medication to use, how often, and in what dosage. Give medications exactly as prescribed. Never stop giving a medication, or reduce the dosage of a medication without permission from the doctor. There can be side effects and drastic changes in the person's abilities because of changes. Always be aware of each medication's side effects. The person taking the medication may have an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions are unfavorable, harmful or undesired results. Report any problems with medications to the licensed health care practitioner/prescriber. 34 35Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Antidepressant Medication Antidepressants are medications commonly used to treat depression. Antidepressants are also used for other health conditions, such as anxiety, pain and insomnia. Antide - pressants are FDA-approved for the treatment of PTSD, panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder. Although antidepressants are not FDA-approved specifically to treat ADHD, antidepressants are sometimes used to treat ADHD in adults. The most popular types of antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake and include venlafaxine, mirtazapine and duloxetine. Another antidepressant that is commonly used is bupro - pion. Bupropion is a third type of antidepressant which works differently than either SSRIs or SNRIs. Bupropion is also used to treat seasonal affective disorder and to help people stop smoking. SSRIs, SNRIs and bupropion are popular because they do not cause as many side effects as older classes of antide - pressants and seem to help broader group of depressive and anxiety disorders. Older antidepressant medications include tricyclics (Nortipytline), tetracyclics (Trazodone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and are the best choice for some people. How do people respond to antidepressants? According to the National Institute of Mental Health, all antidepressant medications work about as well to improve symptoms of depression and to keep depression symptoms from coming back. For reasons not yet well understood, some people will respond better to some antidepressant medications than to others. Therefore, it is important to know that some people may not feel better with the first medicine they try and may need to try several medicines to find the one that works for them. Others may find that a medicine helped for a while, but their symptoms came back. Once a person begins taking antidepressants, it is impor - tant to not stop taking them without the help of a doctor. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and stop taking the medication too soon, and the depres - sion returns. When it is time to stop the medication, the doctor will help the person slowly and safely decrease the dose. It is important to give the body time to adjust to the change. People do not become addicted (or \"hooked\") on these medications, but stopping them abruptly may cause withdrawal symptoms. What are the possible side effects of antidepressants? Antidepressants can cause a varying degree of side effects. You may need to try several different antidepressant medi - cations before finding the one that improves your symp - toms and that causes side effects that you can manage. Side effects are generally more bothersome when first starting a medication or having an increase in dosage during the first few days. Below are some common side effects of antidepressants, according to the FDA. Antidepressants may cause other side effects not included in this list. Nausea and vomiting Weight gain Diarrhea Sleepiness Sexual problems The following symptoms require doctors' attention, espe - cially if they are new, worsening, or worrisome: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts at suicide New or worsening depression New or worsening anxiety Feeling very agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worsening irritability Acting aggressively, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood35Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Combining antidepressants with a \"triptan\" type medica - tion used to treat migraine headaches could cause a life- threatening illness called \"serotonin syndrome.\" A person with serotonin syndrome may be agitated, experience hallucinations (see or hear things that are not real), have a high temperature, or unusual blood pressure changes. Serotonin syndrome is usually associated with the older antidepressants called MAOIs, but it can happen with the newer antidepressants as well, if mixed with the wrong medications. Serotonin syndrome is a medical emergency requiring immediate action. Call 911 if you suspect some - one is experiencing serotonin syndrome. Antipsychotic Medication Antipsychotic medicines (also called psychotropic medica - tions) are primarily used to manage psychosis, but are also used to stabilize mood in bipolar disorder. \"Psychosis\" describes conditions that affect the mind, and in which there is some loss of contact with reality, often including delusions (false, fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there). It can be a symptom of a physical condition such as drug abuse or a mental disorder such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or very severe depression (psychotic depression). Antipsychotic medications are often used in combination with other medications to treat delirium, dementia, and mental disorders, including: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Bipolar Disorder Schizophrenia Severe Depression Eating Disorders Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Generalized Anxiety Disorder Antipsychotic medicines do not cure these conditions, instead they can help relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.Older or first-generation antipsychotic medications are also called conventional, typical antipsychotics or neuroleptics. Some of the a 2013 research review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, typical and atypical anti - psychotics both work to treat symptoms of schizophrenia and the manic phase of bipolar disorder. Several atypical antipsychotics have a broader spectrum of action than the older medications, and are used for treating bipolar depression or depression that has not responded to an antidepressant medication alone. To find additional antipsychotics and other medications used to manage psychoses and current warnings and advi - sories, visit the FDA website.36 37Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration How do people respond to antipsychotics? Certain symptoms, such as feeling agitated and hallucinat - ing go away or reduce in severity within days of starting an antipsychotic medication. Symptoms like delusions usually reduce within a few weeks, but the full effects of the medication could take up to six weeks. Every patient responds differently, so it may take several trials of differ - ent antipsychotic medications to find the one that works best. Some people respond better to antipsychotic medica - tion treatment than others. Even when taking medications regularly, some people will continue to have symptoms, though the severity of symptoms may lessen. Some people may have a relapse\u2014meaning their symp - toms come back or worsen. Usually relapses happen when people stop taking their medication, or when they only take it sometimes. Psychiatric symptoms can worsen even if they are taking their medications as prescribed. Some people stop taking medication because they feel better or they feel that they do not need it anymore, but no one should stop taking an antipsychotic medication without talking to his or her doctor. When a doctor gives approval to stop taking an antipsychotic, they should also provide information on how to gradually reduce the dosage. Use of antipsychotics should not stop abruptly. Many people must stay on an antipsychotic continuously for months or years in order to stay well; each individual needs personalized treatment. What are the possible side effects of antipsychotics? Antipsychotics have many side effects (or adverse events) and risks. The FDA lists the following side effects of anti - psychotic medicines: Drowsiness Dizziness Restlessness Weight gain (the risk is higher with some atypical anti - psychotic medicines) Dry mouth Constipation Nausea Vomiting Blurred vision Low blood pressure Uncontrollable movements, such as tics and tremors (the risk is higher with typical antipsychotic medicines) Seizures Lower white blood cell counts, which could lead to infectionsA person taking an atypical antipsychotic medication should have his or her weight, glucose levels, and lipid levels monitored regularly by a doctor. Typical antipsychotic medications and atypical antipsy - chotics can also cause additional side effects related to physical movement, such as: Muscle rigidity Persistent muscle spasms Tremors Restlessness These symptoms are also referred to as extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPS). Generally, reducing or stopping an an - tipsychotic will reduce the severity of the side effects. If someone suffers from EPS, cutting back the antipsychotic will reduce the severity of these muscle symptoms. However, cutting back the antipsychotic often results in worsening psychotic symptoms. There are anti-EPS medi - cations such as Benztropine (Cogentin) Amantadine (Symmetrel) Trihexyphenidy (Artane) These medications reduce the severity of EPS but have their own side effect risks such as Dry mouth Dizziness when standing Blurry vision Constipation Long-term use of typical antipsychotic medications may lead to a condition called tardive dyskinesia (TD). TD causes muscle movements, commonly around the mouth, that a person cannot control. TD can range from mild to severe, and in some people, the condition is not reversible. Sometimes people with TD recover partially or fully when they stop taking typical antipsychotic medication. People who think that they might have TD should check with their doctor before stopping their medication. TD rarely occurs while taking atypical antipsychotics. Antipsychotics may cause other side effects that are not included in this list above.37Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Mood Stabilizers Mood stabilizers primarily treat bipolar disorder, mood swings associated with other mental disorders, and in some cases augment the effect of other medications used to treat depression. Lithium, an effective mood stabilizer, is approved for the treatment of mania and the mainte - nance treatment of bipolar disorder. A number of cohort studies describe anti-suicide benefits of lithium for individ - uals on long-term maintenance. Mood stabilizers work by decreasing abnormal activity in the brain. These medications can treat: Depression (usually along with an antidepressant) Schizoaffective Disorder Disorders of impulse control Certain mental illnesses in children Anticonvulsant medications originally a seizure treat - ment, can serve as mood stabilizers. One anticonvulsant commonly used as a mood stabilizer is valproic acid (also called divalproex sodium). For some people, especially those with \"mixed\" symptoms of mania and depression or those with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, valproic acid may work better than lithium. Other anticonvulsants used possible side effects of mood stabilizers? Mood stabilizers can cause several side effects, and some of them may become serious, especially at excessively high blood levels. Side effects include: Itching, rash Excessive thirst Frequent urination Hand tremor (shakiness) Weight gain Hair loss Nausea and vomiting Slurred speech Fast, slow, irregular, or pounding heartbeat Blackouts Changes in vision Seizures Hallucinations Loss of coordination Swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, throat, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs. If a person with bipolar disorder is taking lithium as treat - ment, he or she should visit the doctor regularly to check the lithium levels his or her blood, and make sure the kidneys and the thyroid are working normally. Lithium is eliminated from the body through the kidney, so the dose may need to be lowered in older people with reduced kidney function. Also, loss of water from the body, such as through sweating or diarrhea, can cause the lithium level to rise, requiring a temporary lowering of the daily dose. Although kidney functions are checked periodically during lithium treatment, actual damage of the kidney is uncommon in people whose blood levels of lithium have stayed within the therapeutic range. Mood stabilizers may cause other side effects that are not included in this list. Some possible side effects linked anticonvulsants (such as valproic acid) include: Drowsiness Dizziness Headache Diarrhea Constipation Changes in appetite Weight changes Back pain Agitation Mood swings Abnormal thinking Uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body Loss of coordination Uncontrollable movements of the eyes Blurred or double vision Ringing in the ears Hair loss38 39Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration These medications may also: Cause damage to the liver or pancreas, so people taking it should see their doctors regularly Increase testosterone (a male hormone) levels in teenage girls and lead to a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome (a disease that can affect fertility and cause an irregular menstrual cycle) Have adverse reactions with medications for common adult health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression. A doctor can offer other medication options to manage adverse reactions. Anti-Anxiety Medication Anti-anxiety medications help reduce the symptoms of anxiety, such as panic attacks and extreme fear and worry. The most common anti-anxiety medications are benzo - diazepines. Benzodiazepines can treat anxiety symptoms associated with anxiety disorders, but in most cases, ben - zodiazepines are usually second-line treatments, behind SSRIs or other antidepressants for reasons indicated below. Benzodiazepines used beta-blockers (propranolol) are used to treat the short-term symptoms of anxiety. Beta-blockers help manage physical symptoms of anxiety, such as trembling, rapid heartbeat, and sweating that people with phobias experience in difficult situations. Taking these medications for a short period can help the person keep physical symptoms under control and can be used \"as needed\" to reduce acute anxiety. Buspirone (unrelated to benzodiazepines) is an SSRI like sertraline or citalopram and is sometimes used for the long-term treatment of chronic anxiety. In contrast to the benzodiazepines, buspirone must be taken every day for a few weeks to reach its full effect. It is not useful on an \"as-needed\" basis. A medical professional prescribing these medications will explain the proper dosage. How do people respond to anti-anxiety medications? Anti-anxiety medications such as benzodiazepines are effective in relieving anxiety and take effect more quickly than the antidepressant medications (or buspirone) often prescribed for anxiety. However, people's body can get used to benzodiazepines if taken over a long period of time and may no longer respond to the medication and may need higher and higher doses to get the same ef - fect. This means that they have developed a tolerance to the medication. It is possible to become dependent on benzodiazepines. To avoid these problems, doctors usually prescribe benzodiazepines for short periods, a practice that is especially helpful for older adults, people who have substance abuse problems and people who become de - pendent on medication easily. If people suddenly stop tak - ing benzodiazepines, they may have withdrawal symptoms or their anxiety may return. Therefore, benzodiazepines should be tapered off slowly. Because of the likelihood of tolerance and dependence with the use of benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines must be used with caution. What are the possible side effects of anti- anxiety medications? Like other medications, anti-anxiety medications may cause side effects. Some of these side effects and risks are serious. The most common side effects for benzodiaz - epines are drowsiness and dizziness. Other possible side effects include: Nausea Blurred vision Headache Confusion Tiredness Nightmares Falls 39Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Contact a doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: Drowsiness Dizziness Unsteadiness Problems with coordination Difficulty thinking or remembering Increased saliva Muscle or joint pain Frequent urination Blurred vision Changes in sex drive or ability If you experience any of the symptoms below, call a doctor immediately: Rash Hives Swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, or throat Difficulty breathing or swallowing Hoarseness Seizures Yellowing of the skin or eyes Depression Difficulty speaking Yellowing of the skin or eyes Thoughts of suicide or harming yourself Difficulty breathing Stimulants Stimulants increase alertness, attention, and energy, as well as elevate blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2014). Stimulants are with a common treatment for ADHD. Stimulants FDA approved the non-stimulant medication atomoxetine for use as a treatment for ADHD. Two other non-stimulant antihypertensive medications, clonidine and guanfacine, are also approved for treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. It is common to try non-stimulant medications first in a young person with ADHD and only use a stimulant if the non-stimulant is not successful. Stimulants are also prescribed to treat other health condi - tions, including narcolepsy, and occasionally depression (especially in older or chronically medically ill people and in those who have not responded to other treatments). How do people respond to stimulants? Prescription stimulants have a calming and \"focusing\" effect on individuals with ADHD. Stimulant medications are safe when given under a doctor's supervision. Some children taking them may feel slightly different or \"funny.\" Some parents worry that stimulant medications may lead to drug abuse or dependence, but there is little evidence of this when taking stimulants properly as prescribed. What are the possible side effects of stimulants? Most stimulant side effects are minor and disappear with a lower dose. The most common side effects include: Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep Loss of appetite Stomach pain Headache Less common side effects include: Motor tics or verbal tics (sudden, repetitive movements or sounds) Personality changes, such as appearing \"flat\" or without emotion Stimulants may cause other side effects that are not in - cluded in the list above. Dalton Countryman, an 88 year old man with Gen - eralized Anxiety Disorder just started a new anti- anxiety medication* a week ago. Today, you notice that his lips are swollen and he is having trouble breathing. What can you do? (page 38*).40 41Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Chemical Restraints The use of chemical restraints constitutes abuse in Washington state. Chemical restraints are the administration of any drug to manage a vulnerable adult's behavior in a way that reduces the safety risk to the vulnerable adult or others, has the temporary effect of restricting the vulnerable adult's freedom of movement, and is not standard treatment for the vulnerable adult's medical or psychiatric condition. Sec. 1 RCW 74.34.020(3). Medication Refusal Individuals have the right to refuse medication. It is important to report medication refusals to your supervisor and to the prescriber following the policies and procedures in your setting. Non-drug Therapies It is important to consider the benefits of non-drug therapies. Some non-drug therapies work in conjunction with or in place of conventional medications and are part of the overall care plan. You must still be aware and take note of any adverse reactions and side effects resulting from non-drug therapies. Psychotherapies (talk therapy) Psychotherapy (sometimes called talk therapy) is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behavior. Most psychotherapy takes place with a licensed and trained mental health care professional and a patient meeting one on one or with other patients in a group setting. A variety of psychotherapies and interventions are ef - fective for specific disorders. Psychotherapists may use one primary approach, or incorporate different elements depending on their training, the person's diagnosis and the needs of the person receiving treatment.Here are examples of the elements that psychotherapies can include: Helping a person become aware of ways of thinking that may be automatic and harmful. (An example might be someone who has a low opinion of his or her own abilities.) The therapist helps the person find ways to question these thoughts, understand how they affect emotions and behavior, and try ways to change self- defeating patterns. This approach is central to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Identifying ways to cope with stress. Examining in depth a person's interactions with others and offering guidance with social and communication skills, if needed. Relaxation and mindfulness techniques. Exposure therapy for people with anxiety disorders. In exposure therapy, a person spends brief periods, in a supportive environment, learning to tolerate the distress certain items, ideas, or imagined scenes cause. Over time, the associated fear dissipates. Tracking emotions and activities and the impact of each on the other. Safety planning can include helping a person recognize warning signs, and thinking about coping strategies, such as contacting friends, family, or emergency person - nel. Supportive counseling to help a person explore trou - bling issues and provide emotional support. 41Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Brain Stimulation Therapy Brain stimulation therapies can play a role in treating cer - tain mental disorders. Brain stimulation therapies involve activating or inhibiting the brain directly with electricity. The electricity can be given directly by electrodes implant - ed in the brain, or noninvasively through electrodes placed on the scalp. Electricity can also be induced by using magnetic fields applied to the head. While these types of therapies are not as common as medication and psycho - therapies, they hold promise for treating certain mental disorders that do not respond to other treatments. Alternative Therapies Alternative therapies may be an option for the individu - als you care for. For some alternative therapies, there is limited or no scientific studies showing the effectiveness in treating mental illness. There are many alternative therapies including: Acupressure Therapy that involves applying pressure to certain points around the body in order to stimulate the body's own healing processes, and bring positive health benefits. This may boost immune system, relieve stress, relieve headaches, alleviate other aches and pains and increase circulation. Acupuncture A traditional therapy and focused on stimulating certain healing points around the body called acupoints. These points stimulate the body's own healing mechanisms. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very small needles into the top layers of the skin and muscle by a registered acupuncture practitioner. Aromatherapy A method of using the scents and aromas of natural oils to alleviate a range of emotional and physical concerns, from stress and anxiety, to blocked sinuses, pain and cog - nitive function. Scents from natural oils can be smelled or applied to skin. Each oil has its own benefits and may include improving sleep, relieving stress, alleviating headaches, aiding in digestion, strengthening immune system and other benefits. Exercise Exercise takes many forms: walking, running, going to the gym, taking aerobic classes, cycling, yoga, and many other activities. Exercise may benefit mental health by reducing stress, boosting endorphins, improve self-confi - dence, prevent cognitive decline, alleviate anxiety, boost brain power, sharpen memory, help control addiction, improve relaxation. Music therapy This therapy involves the use of music-based interventions to help treat and alleviate a range of emotional, cognitive and physical concerns. This can include creating music, singing, moving to music, listening to music or a combi - nation of all of these. Potential benefits may include im - proved cognitive function, reducing blood pressure, aids with anxiety and stress and helping with mood disorders. Naturopathic medicine Naturopathic medicine encompasses natural, holistic, nutrition/diet, dietary supplements, herbal and ancient medical treatments such as acupuncture, reflexology, meditation, aromatherapy and more. Benefits may in - clude avoiding chemical or medical interventions when they are not wanted or needed. Naturopathic medicine is more common in some cultures. Nutrition healing Nutritional healing involves consuming a certain diet of natural foods, supplements and herbs in order to treat certain ailments and disorders. Nutritional healing fo - cuses on natural benefits of organic vegetables and fruits and may include avoiding foods which may increase negative symptoms of the disorder. Some benefits may include strengthened immune system, decrease in nutri - tional deficiencies and can be used in conjunction with medications and other therapies. Nutritional supplements Nutritional supplements can refer to any type of supple - ment that is ingested for nutritional benefit. This may in - clude manufactured supplements as well as pills, tablets, liquids, powders, teas or other food items. Some benefits may be improved mood and energy. Massage Massage is the rubbing and kneading of muscles and joints in the body with the hands - especially to relieve tension or pain. Benefits may include improved mood, reduced stress and anxiety and even increase feelings of caring, comfort and connection.42 43Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Reiki Reiki is a traditional Japanese therapy centered on the use and transfer of energy from the healer's body to that of the subject in order to stimulate the body's own natural healing process, relieve stress and generate over - all feelings of relaxation and wellbeing. Some benefits may include improved mental clarity and wellbeing, alleviates physical pain, aids in sleep and relaxation and reduces stress. Spiritual mind treatment Spiritual mind treatment is also known as Affirmative Prayer. It involves the individual focusing on a sequence of thoughts and prayers which aim to recognize that there is one spiritual being which guides the universe and calls on them to make changes and heal the body and mind. Benefits may include a sense of calm and spirituality, calms the mind and alleviates stress and can be performed anywhere. Support groups Support group is a group of people who come together to discuss and share stories of their common experienc - es. Common experiences that people may come together to discuss may include treatment of an illness, experi - ences with depression, drug or alcohol addiction, abuse or other problems. Benefits may include feeling less isolated and alone, allows individuals to talk through problems, encourages sharing, reduced feeling of stress and anxiety and provides a social support network. Visualization Also sometimes called guided image therapy, visualiza - tion involves the individual imagining a certain out - come to a situation, an object or an action. It has been shown to be effective in changing behavior by triggering emotional and psychological changes as though the imagined outcome is actually occurring. Visualization can be guided by listening to an audio track or the voice of a trained therapist, and can also be done without any guide. Benefits may include treating addictions, easing stress and anxiety, and may help to stop bad habits. Yoga Yoga is a thousand-year-old form of spiritual and physi - cal practice which involves various sets of postures, stretches, visualizations, and breathing exercises per - formed in a sequence. There are many different types of yoga, each with their own theories, benefits, and postures. Some benefits may include increased flexibility, strengthened muscles, calm and centered mind, allevi - ated stress and anxiety and improved sleep. Cannabis Marijuana is defined by Washington state law as all parts of the plant cannabis, whether growing or not, with a THC concentration greater than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. Although marijuana may help reduce symptoms of certain medical conditions, it also may have some harmful effects depending on how often it is used, who is using it, and whether other substances are also being consumed. There is clear evidence that regular use of marijuana increases the risk of heart, lung and mental health prob - lems. Less is known about the health issues that might be caused by casual or infrequent use. In April 2015, DSHS issued guidance for AFHs and ALFs on cannabis. \"The use of medical and recreational cannabis is still ille - gal under federal regulation. Consequently, federal funds such as Medicaid cannot be used directly or indirectly for activities or expenses related to the use of cannabis. RCS encourages providers to develop their policies on cannabis even if it is not a current issue in their home/s. Doing so will ensure current and new residents are aware 43Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration of the policy. When developing policies and procedures around cannabis use, please consider the following points: Residents who wish to use cannabis in smoked form need to be assessed in a manner similar to tobacco use. Please refer to applicable chapters of WAC regarding resident safety and smoking. Cannabis, like any other substance that can be harmful, must be kept out of reach of residents who might en - danger themselves with it. Please refer to the applicable WAC sections that address the storage of medication and chemicals. Keep in mind that a person under the influence of can - nabis may require additional supervision. If a person is using cannabis products, the details of how the person receives it, uses it, and is supervised, must be documented in their Negotiated Care Plan. RCS notes that the state and federal laws and rules sur - rounding both medical and recreational cannabis are changing rapidly; therefore, information in this document must be supplemented with consideration of current rule, law, and code. Providers and settings are responsible for keeping abreast of new developments in this area. To fol - low the latest development on cannabis laws as they apply to both medicinal and recreational use, please refer to the Department of Health Website at: www.doh.wa.gov/Youan - dYourFamily/Marijuana.\" Though some people report a reduction in anxiety when using cannabis, it may also increase anxiety, paranoia and confusion. Be familiar with your policy and expectations in your setting. Discuss other non-drug therapies that may have worked for you or others in the past. Write down up to four (4) new ideas not listed in this lesson. 1. ________________________________________ 2. ________________________________________ 3. ________________________________________ 4. ________________________________________Lesson Summary The goal is to provide the best possible holistic care. This means caring for the whole person, taking into account mental and social factors rather than just the physical symptoms of the disease. Baseline is the time when a person with a mental disorder is managing his or her symptoms and functioning at his or her own highest level. Your goal is to help the individual get to their baseline and to stay there. Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. The Eight Dimensions of Wellness are emotional, environmental, financial, intellectual, occupational, physical and social. Learning about the Eight Dimensions of Wellness can help you choose how to make wellness a part of everyday life. Wellness strategies are practical ways to start developing healthy habits that can have a positive impact on physical and mental health. Person Centered-Planning is placing the person at the center and above all other aspects of the treatment process; we consider this the best way to provide care. In caring for individuals with mental disorders, there are many conventional medicines as well as alternative non- drug therapies available. Your main job as a caregiver is to be aware of any side effects for each individual and take appropriate action. Checkpoint Read the questions below and provide your response in the space provided.

Overview Caregiving is a rewarding yet physically and emotionally challenging profession. It is critical that you take care of yourself so you are at your best for others. Most of us know that self-care is important and yet we still put ourselves last in a long line of people we care for. Making self-care a priority will help you maintain a better sense of wellness, help prevent secondary trauma and burnout. Imagine leaving your house in the morning. You have everything you need for your day. You have your keys in your hand and you get into your car. You try to start the car. The car will not start. Your car is out of gas. Can you expect to get to where you are going? Much as a car needs fuel to keep going and regular maintenance to stay in good condition - we also need to take good care of ourselves so we do not break down, deteriorate and fall apart.Caregiver Mental Wellness Find ways to nurture yourself throughout your workday and during your commute. Take regular breaks, for meals or just to step away\u2014if possible, away from your workspace, outside of your car, or otherwise apart from work responsibilities. Find ways to change pace occasionally during the day: stand and stretch occasionally if you sit at a desk; listen to music, an audio book, or an enjoyable radio program while driving for work or during your commute; take a brief walk; or simply breathe deeply and consciously for a minute. Take time away from your job to rejuvenate. Strive to maintain a regular work schedule and avoid working overtime on a routine basis. Determine\u2014if appropriate, in collaboration with your supervisor\u2014 how much, if at all, you need to be available off the job, be it overnight, when you're ill, or during vacations. Clear expectations are important if you use a \"smart phone\" or other technology to access work email remotely. Do not confuse professional responsiveness and responsibility with being accessible to your colleagues (let alone your clients) 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Devote time off the job to activities that nurture you. Spending time with family or friends, reading, watching a movie, singing, journaling, meditating, exercising, or other diversions can re-energize you to return to work. Allow time for rest, too. Be attuned to the ways in which you absorb work stresses and take steps to manage that stress. Even caregivers with excellent external boundaries (such as a regular work schedule), supportive colleagues, and manageable workload often find themselves \"taking work home\" on an emotional level. This can result in persistent worry about care situations while away from the job or unfounded fears of professional inadequacy. Work-related stress can also result in hyper-vigilance within a caregiver's personal life\u2014for example, fearing the onset of illness, despite the absence of symptoms, because of constant exposure to illness. Writing about your feelings or talking with someone you trust can help you process the impact of work on your life and maintain clear internal boundaries between your professional and personal lives. Identify ways that you currently take care of your personal wellness. Identify one (1) new routine you will add that will benefit your personal wellness. 46 47Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Secondary Trauma Secondary trauma (also known as compassion fatigue or burnout) describes trauma-related stress reactions and symptoms resulting from exposure to another individ - ual's traumatic experiences, rather than from exposure directly to a traumatic event. Secondary trauma can oc - cur among caregivers who provide services to those who have experienced trauma. What are some common symptoms of secondary trauma? Intrusive thoughts Chronic fatigue Sadness Anger Poor concentration Second guessing Detachment Emotional exhaustion Fearfulness Shame Physical illness Absenteeism Prevent secondary trauma by practicing personal well - ness techniques and establishing a diverse social support network. Strategies to Cope with Caregiver Burnout Over time, you may feel overwhelmed, exhausted, frus - trated, resentful and guilty. Do not ignore the signs of burnout in yourself or other caregivers. Remember: Caregivers strive to meet the needs of the person they are caring for at the expense of their own needs. Caregivers often experience higher stress, illness, and burnout than non-caregivers. The reality is that at one point or another you may face caregiver burnout. There are ways to minimize the burnout we may incur while caregiving. No matter how overwhelmed you feel, it is important that you make and take time for yourself. Providing care for individuals with a mental disorder may carry a steep emotional toll. One study found that as many as one in three caregivers rate their stress level as high, and half say they have less time to spend with family and friends. However, when you are caring for others, it is critical that you first take care of yourself. By not doing so, you put yourself at risk of exhaustion, health problems and even total burnout. These tips will help keep your stress in check: Put your physical needs first. Eat nutritious meals. Do not give in to stress-driven urges for sweets and junk food or overindulge in alcohol. Get enough sleep; if you have trouble sleeping at night, try napping during the day. Schedule regular medical checkups. Find time to exercise. If you experience symptoms of depres - sion - extreme sadness, trouble concentrating, apathy, hopelessness, thoughts about death - talk to a medical professional. Connect with friends. Isolation increases stress. Getting together regularly with friends and relatives can keep negative emotions at bay. Ask for help. Make a list of things you have to do and recruit others to help. Take time. Take regular breaks and meal breaks.47Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Deal with your feelings. Seek support from co-workers who are in similar situations. Make an appointment with a professional counselor or join a caregiver support group if one is available in your area. Talk about it. Do not keep your emotions inside - develop a support system. Friends, relatives or support groups can be a tremendous benefit to you and your well-being. Due to the increase in caregivers and the increase of those in need of care, there are now caregiver support groups in most communities. Contact your local Department of Health and Social Services for more information. Be proactive. Plan ahead, although it may be difficult to do so, it is important to be proactive rather than reactive. Find time to relax. Doing something you enjoy such as reading, walking or listening to music can recharge you. Some caregivers meditate or use relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or visualizing a positive place. If you are religious, you may find that prayer can be a powerful tool. Set your own goals. You should decide what you can and cannot do. Be realistic. For example, it may be impossible for you to complete every task on schedule, but it is realistic to set goals and attempt to meet those goals. Get organized. Simple tools like calendars and to- do lists can help you prioritize work and home responsibilities to help you manage your time. Just say no. Accept the fact that you cannot do everything. Resist the urge to take on more activities or shifts that you cannot handle. If someone asks you to do something that will stretch you too thin, say no and do not feel guilty. Stay positive. Do your best to avoid negativity. Instead of dwelling on what you cannot do, pat yourself on the back for how much you are doing and focus on the rewards of being a caregiver. Evaluate the situation. Ask yourself realistically how much time you can designate to specific care tasks. Understand that it is acceptable to have mixed feelings. Your emotions should be mixed. For example, allow yourself to feel angry that the care recipient is not appreciating the care you are providing and at the same time, you may feel guilty that you are angry when your client is physically or mentally ill. Understand that you cannot create or cure illness. As much as we all would like to be capable of controlling pain, it is beyond our control. As caregivers we can only make it more comfortable. Use this guided meditation: Begin by finding a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Roll your shoulders slowly forward and then slowly back. Lean your right ear into your right shoulder and then bring your head back to an upright position. Lean your left ear into your left shoulder and then bring your head back to an upright position. Relax your muscles. Breathe in a deep breath counting to 4. 1....2....3....4.... Hold your breath counting to 4. 1....2....3....4.... Exhale your breath counting to 4. 1....2....3....4.... Breathe in a deep breath counting to 4. 1....2....3....4.... Hold your breath counting to 4. 1....2....3....4.... Exhale your breath counting to 4. 1....2....3....4.... Sit quietly for a moment and wiggle your fingers and your toes. Gently open your eyes. 48 49Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Seeking Outside Help You do not have to do everything on your own. It is okay to ask for help. There are many services that can help you in assisting the person with a mental health disorder when you are in need. Other members of an individual's treatment team besides their caregiver(s) might be Adult Protective Services (APS), a crisis line or team, Washington Alliance for the Mentally Ill (WAMI). Some services are already established or need to be established such as enrollment in a community mental center, a private therapist, a psychiatric provider (psychiatrist, psychologist or psychiatric nurse practitioner and/or a medical provider). The following is a quick reference guide. Where to Get Help Adult Protective Services Evaluates reports of vulnerable adults 18 years and older. Includes physical, sexual, emotional and financial exploitation. Report any suspected abuse to your supervisor and to the proper authorities. You do not have to give your name when reporting and you do not have to prove the abuse. Community Mental Health Center Asses for mental health services, provide case management to help with behavior maintenance, independent living skills, provides therapy, monitors and prescribes medication, provides support and referral. Familiarize yourself with your local community mental health care system. Take the time to become familiar with the community resources in your area. If an individual is enrolled with a Community Mental Health Center (CMHC), then they generally have access to a case manager or therapist/counselor and a psychiatric provider who can diagnose and prescribe psychiatric medications. If an individual is enrolled with a CMHC, they have a case manager assigned to them. The case manager's job is to coordinate with everyone in the support team, which includes you. Their case manager is often the first person to call if the resident is in crisis, or if you need to know/learn more about the individual, and to also update them about how the resident is doing. Keeping ongoing communication with an individual's case manager can go a long way to preventing psychiatric crises, or can lead to needed answers for the client when called. Keep the case manager's phone number handy for questions you have about the individual's mental health. Community mental health agencies also have their own crisis number/team for their enrolled clients. Make sure you have that number handy in case there is a crisis. Crisis Line/Crisis Team Provide phone crisis intervention; refer to crisis team if needed. If you must call the crisis line, provide only the facts, as you understand them. It is not your responsibility to diagnose or determine a plan of treatment. Crisis Team Provide crisis intervention, if needed - refer Designated Mental Health Professional (DMHP). Introduce yourself to the crisis team as a member of the client's care team. You are an important source of information.49Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Where to Get Help County Designated Mental Health Professional (CDMHP) Conducts mental health evaluations and diagnosis, determines if evaluation for involuntary commitment is necessary, conducts face-to-face interview to determine if involuntary commitment is necessary. When an individual is refusing needed treatment to keep them safe and relieve their distress, they may require involuntary treatment, or being hospitalized against their will. This is determined by the CDMHP . The CDMHP evaluation can be initiated by social workers in the emergency room, by the police, or by the individual's case manager or even you if you are calling the Crisis Line. Often, the CDMHP will evaluate a client in the emergency room, but they also can visit and evaluate an individual for involuntary treatment at their residence. The CDMHP will want information on the individual's behavior and what specifically makes them in such need for hospitalization. Familiarize yourself with the client's therapist/counselor. You are an important source of information Medical Provider or Primary Care Provider An individual's medical provider can be a physician, a nurse practitioner or a physician's assistant. They often work with a team of nurses and medical assistants who can provide usual information about an individual's health. If an individual is experiencing a change in their condition physical or mental health, it may be useful to call their medical provider. If a client has mental health issues and no psychiatric provider, often their medical provider is the one to discuss their mental health care. Psychiatrist Medical doctor specializing in diagnosis and treating psychological/mental health illnesses, disorders, etc. Prescribes medications and provides consultation. Keep records of the client's psychiatrist information. Make sure the information is easily accessible. Psychologist Doctorate of Psychology (or closely related field), evaluates and diagnoses mental health disorder and disorders, provides psychological testing, provides therapy/treatment, provides consultation. Keep records of the client's psychologist's names and contact information. Make sure the information is easily accessible. WAMI - Washington Alliance for the Mentally Ill Provides support, groups and information to families and those caring for people with mental illness. Keep the number of the local WAMI available or saved in your contacts. Remember WAMI is a good resource to help with education and information for staff and family.50 51Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson Summary Making self-care a priority will help you maintain a better sense of wellness, help prevent secondary trauma and burnout.

Checkpoint Read the following scenario and respond to the questions below. You have been working long hours and taking on extra shifts on the weekends. You have not had much time for relaxation on breaks because you have been trying to finish homework for a class you are taking at the local college. You feel so exhausted when you get home you just want to sleep but the dishes are piling up in the sink and the trash is overflowing. Today you are feeling extra tired and drank an energy drink on your way to work. Since Tommie Callihan moved in to your care setting, he has been experiencing intense flashbacks and other symptoms from his time in the military. This is taking a toll on you and making you more on edge, it has even made it into your dreams at night - disrupting the little sleep you are getting. Identify what is happening in the scenario that is promoting poor self-care. Identify ways that you can practice better self-care to prevent burnout.Module 3: Suicide Lesson 5: Suicide Prevention The caregiver will identify suicide facts, recognize warning signs and communicate about suicide. 51Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration52 53Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson 5 Suicide Prevention Objective: The caregiver will identify suicide facts, recognize warning signs and communicate about suicide. Overview Suicide is a serious public health problem that causes immeasurable pain, suffering and loss to individuals, families and communities nationwide. Suicide is one of the top 10 causes of death. For every person who dies by suicide, many others attempt suicide. Every suicide attempt and death affects countless other individuals. Family members, friends, coworkers and others in the community all suffer the long-lasting consequences of suicidal behavior. Suicidal behaviors are often looked at with silence and shame. These attitudes can be challenging barriers to providing care and support to individuals in crisis and to those who have lost a loved one to suicide. Although some people may perceive suicide as the act of a troubled person, it is a complex outcome that is influenced by many factors. Individual characteristics may be important but so are relationships with family, peers and others and influences from the broader social, cultural, economic and physical environments. There is no single path that will lead to suicide. Rather throughout life, a combination of factors such as serious mental illness, alcohol abuse, a painful loss, exposure to violence or social isolation may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. A suicide attempt or a completed suicide is a tragic event that often can be prevented. Professional interventions from a mental health professional is frequently needed, but many times the professionals are unaware that the individual is suicidal. A caregiver is usually the first person to know that the individual is suicidal. Identifying a suicidal person and connecting them with needed help can successfully prevent a tragedy. Identifying a suicidal person and connecting them with needed help can successfully prevent a tragedy. Reflect on your thoughts and attitudes about suicide. How do you think these thoughts and attitudes will influence the care you provide for someone who is considering suicide?Facts about Suicide There are many myths and misconceptions about suicide and it is often a difficult topic to discuss. The following are some of the things known about suicide. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S (8th leading cause of death overall in Washington). Each year 44,193 Americans die by suicide. The rate of suicide is highest in middle-age, white men in particular. Men die by suicide 3.5x more often than women. Females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. In 2015, the highest suicide rate was among adults between 45 and 64 years of age. The second highest rate occurred in adults 85 years or older. The ratio of suicide attempts to suicide death in youth is estimated to be about 25:1, compared to about 4:1 in the elderly. Frailty of some seniors means they may be less likely to survive suicide attempts. Risk Factors and Warning Signs What leads to suicide? There is no single cause for suicide. Suicide is more common when stress is greater than an individual's ability to cope with a mental disorder. Depression is the most common condition associated with suicide and often goes undiagnosed or untreated. Untreated conditions like depression, anxiety and substance use problems may increase the risk for suicide. 53Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Warning Signs Most people who take their lives exhibit one or more warning signs through what they say, do or changes in mood. The following chart gives examples of what a person may talk about, things they might do or moods that they might display. Say Do Feel Being a burden to others Feeling trapped Experiencing unbearable pain Having no reason to live Killing themselves Increased drug or alcohol use / substance use Looking for ways to kill themselves (searching online for materials or means of acting on suicide) Acting recklessly Withdrawing from friends and/or social activities Isolating from family and friends Sleeping too much or too little Visiting or calling people to say goodbye Giving away prized possessions Aggression Depression Loss of interest Rage Irritability Humiliation Anxiety Worthless, empty, lacking purpose Trapped Alone Hopeless/helpless Anger Mood changes54 55Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Risk Factors Health Environment History Mental disorders Substance use disorder Serious or chronic health condition and/or pain Emotional instability Poor coping skills Introversion Sensory impairment Functional impairment (loss of independence or problems with activities of daily living) Stressful life events which may include a death, divorce, financial or legal difficulties, relocation stresses or job loss Prolonged stress which may include harassment, bullying, relationship problems and unemployment Access to lethal means including firearms and drugs Exposure to another person's suicide or graphic or dramatized accounts of suicide Previous suicide attempts Family history of suicide attempts, suicide ideation and mental illness Substance Use Disorders Alcohol and drug abuse are second only to depression and other mood disorders as the most frequent risk factors for suicide. According to data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), in 2008 alcohol was a factor in approximately one-third of suicides reported in 16 states. Opiates, including heroin and prescription painkillers, were present in 25.5 percent of suicide deaths, antidepressants in 20.2 percent, cocaine in 10.5 percent, and marijuana in 11.3 percent and am - phetamines in 3.4 percent. Suicide it the leading cause of death among people with substance use disorders (SUDs). Substance use may increase the risk for suicide by intensifying depressive thoughts or feelings of hopelessness while at the same time reducing inhibitions to hurting oneself. Alcohol and some drugs can cause a transient depression, heighten impulsivity and cloud judgment about long-term con - sequences of one's actions. A large number of individu - als with SUDs have co-occurring mental disorders that increase suicide risk, particularly mood disorders. Protective factors against suicidal behavior may include perceiving that there are clear reasons to live, trusting relationship with counselor, physician or other service provider, religious attendance and/or belief, connections with a social group and an optimistic or positive outlook.55Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Talking about Suicide If you think that someone is thinking about suicide, assume you are the only one who will reach out. Here is how to talk to someone who may be struggling. 1. Talk to them in private 2. Listen to their story 3. Tell them you care about them 4. Ask directly if they are thinking about suicide 5. Ask what has helped them before when they felt suicidal 6. Encourage them to seek treatment or to contact their doctor or therapist Avoid: Debating the value of life \"Life is too precious\" Minimizing their problems \"It is not so bad\" Giving advice \"If I were you, I would...\" What you can do Take any threat of suicide or wish to die seriously Be aware of the risk factors for suicide Stay with the person Notify your supervisor Notify 911 if necessary (the person is in danger of at - tempting to kill themselves) Monitor for safety Help them remove lethal means (take away their pills to overdose or remove a knife from the area) Talking about suicide DOES NOT make someone sui - cidal. Create a safe environment to talk about suicide. Be prepared. Create crisis/risk management plans before a crisis occurs o If an individual receives services with a Community Mental Health Center, they should be notified if the individual is suicidal. Keep their phone number or the crisis number for CMHC handy. Learn about available community resources and de - velop relationships in your community. Call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 Have a neighbor discussion about your role in dealing with an individual who is suicidal. Share highlights with the class.Stigma Because of the stigma that still exists concerning mental illness, many people who need help do not seek it. The individual might be afraid of what other people think and may not want to talk about it out of fear of being judged, labeled or treated differently. Suicide often has stigma attached to it. In order to make sense of a suicide, the person who has committed suicide might be labeled as selfish or crazy or that the person took the easy way out. Remain non-judgmental and question your own thoughts on suicide and any potential stigma you carry with you. Resiliency Remember in lesson 2, we learned that resilience is the ability to bounce back or rise above adversity as an individual, family, community, or provider. Promote re - silience by encouraging individual strengths. By encour - aging individual strengths, you can understand, redefine and reframe the individual's problems and challenges and moves the individuals along in recovery. Individuals may benefit from the following to encourage resiliency: Sense of meaning and purpose in life Sense of hope or optimism Religious or spiritual practice Active social networks and support from family and friends Good health care practices Positive help-seeking behaviors Engagement in activities of personal interest 57Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Suicide Attempts A previous suicide attempt is a known predictor of sui - cide death. A majority of these deaths are preventable. Recent attempt survivors can struggle with reintegrating into their homes, schools and workplaces. Feelings of shame and self-doubt and fear of biased reactions are just some of the experiences they describe. Within many communities, silence, prejudice and misunderstand - ing about the subject of suicide create barriers to open discussion. This culture of \"don't ask, don't tell\" can promote rejection, social isolation and even discrimina - tion if the suicide attempt is known. You must do your best to support the people who survive an attempt. Even simple efforts to challenge isolation and provide follow- up support after an attempt can have a powerful impact and reduce future attempts. The After an Attempt brochure, distributed by SAMHSA, provides basic information for attempt survivors, fam - ily and providers. Treatment for the Suicidal Individual A suicidal individual may require hospitalization to keep them safe. This may mean calling 911 and having them go to an emergency room or a psychiatric hospital. A suicidal person may have thoughts of wishing they were dead but not have a plan to harm themselves. Notify your supervisor and members of the individual's 'treat - ment team.' (Such as their case manager, therapist, or doctor.) They can provide direction, support and exper - tise on what may be the next step for helping the client.After Suicide Despite everyone's best efforts at helping to prevent suicide, the person may still commit suicide. This may be very difficult to deal with. Immediately After a Loss Call 911. Because suicide is considered an unnatural death, the authorities are required to investigate. As part of the investigation, the police will want to question you. You should cooperate with them. Remember that neither you nor the individual has committed a crime. You must also notify the department and notify your supervisor immediately. Contact the Complaint Resolu - tion Unit (CRU) / Residential Care Services (RCS) hotline at 1-800-562-6078. CRU/RCS Hotline: 1-800-562-6078 56Resources for Loss Survivors Find Support Talk with your manager or do a search on the internet for a survivors of suicide support group in your area. You may also want to schedule time with a suicide bereave - ment trained clinician. Talking About Suicide Give accurate information about suicide. Suicide is a complicated behavior. It is not caused by a single event. In most cases, suicide is caused by an underlying mental disorder like depression or substance abuse. Mental disorders affect the way people feel and prevent them from thinking clearly and rationally. Hav - ing a mental disorder is nothing to be ashamed of and help is available.57Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Say... \"The cause of _____'s death was suicide. Suicide is most often caused by serious mental disorders like depression, combined with other complications.\" \"_____ was likely struggling with a mental disorder like depression or anxiety, even though it may not have been obvious to other people.\" \"There are treatments to help people who are having suicidal thoughts.\" \"Since 90 percent of people who die by suicide have a mental disorder at the time of their death, it is likely that ____ suffered from a mental disorder that affected [his/ her] feelings, thoughts and ability to think clearly and solve problems in a better way.\" \"Mental disorders are not something to be ashamed of and there are very good treatments to help manage the symptoms.\" Address blaming and scapegoating It is common to try to answer the question \"why?\" after a suicide death. Sometimes this turns into blaming others for the death. Say... \"The reasons that someone dies by suicide are not simple and are related to mental disorders that get in the way of the person thinking clearly. Blaming others - or blaming the person who died does not acknowledge the reality that the person was battling a mental disorder.\" Do not focus on the method or graphic details Talking in graphic detail about the method can create images that are upsetting and can increase the risk of imitative behavior. If asked, it is ok to give basic facts about the method, but do not give graphic details or talk at length about it. The focus should be not on how someone killed themselves but rather on how to cope with feelings of sadness, loss, anger, etc. Say... \"It is tragic that he died by hanging. Let's talk about how ____'s death has affected you and ways for you to handle it.\" \"How can we figure out the best ways to deal with our loss and grief?\"Address anger Accept expressions of anger at the deceased and explain that these feelings are normal. Say... \"It is ok to feel angry. These feelings are normal and it doesn't mean that you didn't care about ____. You can be angry at someone's behavior and still care deeply about that person.\" Address feelings of responsibility Reassure those who feel responsible or think they could have done something to save the deceased. Say... \"This death is not your fault.\" \"We can't else's behavior.\" Encourage help-seeking Encourage others to seek help if they are feeling de - pressed or suicidal. Say... \"We are always here to help you through any problem, no matter what. Who are the people you would go to if you were feeling worried or depressed or had thoughts of suicide?\" \"There are effective treatments to help people who have mental disorders or substance use disorders. Suicide is never an answer.\" \"This is an important time for our community to sup - port and look out for one another. If you are concerned about someone else, you need to be sure to talk about it with me or someone you trust.\"58 59Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Medically Assisted Suicide The Washington Death with Dignity Act, Initiative 1000, codified as RCW 70.245, passed on November 4, 2008 and went into effect on March 5, 2009. This act allows terminally ill adults seeking to end their life to request lethal doses of medication from medical and osteopathic physicians. These terminally ill patients must be Wash - ington residents who have less than six months to live. Your setting should have a policy and procedure ad - dressing medically assisted suicide and the role you may or may not play in a resident's choice to carry out this process. Grief Support Grief is a universal, instinct based response to loss. Grief is emotional, physical, cognitive, behavioral, social and philosophical in presentation. Grief may be overwhelm - ing and you might experience a range of unexpected emotions. Having support of other people is vital to the healing from loss. Even if you are not comfortable talking about your feelings under normal circumstances, it is important to express them when you are grieving. Comfort can come from being around others who care about you. The key is not to isolate yourself. How Suicide Affects Others The impact of suicide can be powerful and sometimes devastating for those who are left behind. Each year, more than 13 million people in the United States report that they have known someone who died by suicide that year. Exposure to suicide carries risks for increased rates of guilt, depression and other psychiatric symptoms, complicated grief and social isolation. There is evidence that individuals bereaved by suicide may have an in - creased risk for suicide completion themselves. Helping those bereaved by suicide is a direct form of suicide prevention with a population known to be at risk.Finding ways to cope Be patient with yourself. Grief has no predictable pat - tern or timeline. Allow yourself all the time you need to grieve. Face your feelings. Unresolved grief can also lead to complications such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse and health problems. Seek out people who are willing to listen when you need to talk and who understand your experience. Turn to friends and family members. Make healthy choices in eating, exercise and get plenty of rest. Draw comfort from your faith if you follow a religious tradition. If you think it might be helpful, talk to your manager about professional help or support groups that may be available to help you deal with your grief. o To find a bereavement support group in your area on your own, contact local hospitals, hospices, funeral homes and counseling centers. o Talk to a therapist or grief counselor experienced in grief counseling. Other individuals in your setting may also need assis - tance in ways to cope. The ideas listed above may be useful for sharing. When to seek professional help for grief Contact a grief counselor or professional therapist if you: Feel like life is not worth living Wish you had died with the individual Blame yourself for the loss or for failing to prevent it Feel numb and disconnected from others for more than a few weeks Are having difficulty trusting others since the loss Are unable to perform your normal daily activities 59Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration National and State Suicide and Crisis Hotlines The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 800-273-TALK/8255 provides 24/7; free and confidential text and voice support for people in distress, prevention and crisis resources for you, your loved ones and best practices for professionals.

Lesson 7: Boundaries The caregiver will demonstrate an understanding of creating healthy professional boundaries.61Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson 6 Communication Dynamics Objective: The caregiver will demonstrate an ability to recognize communication styles and ways to communicate effectively. Overview Communication is more than a verbal exchange. Even when verbal communication is difficult for a person, the individual may still be able to use or read body language or sense your mood. By using effective communication strategies, you will maximize your connection with the individuals you care for. Communication varies for each individual and the way we communicate is influenced by our past. Our past has many influences including our experiences, family, friends, work, traumatic events, traditions, culture, religion and spirituality. Consider the impact that mental disorders might have on individuals who have one or more mental disorders. Each diagnosis can add complications to the communication process and an individual's ability to communicate with others. Learning to communicate respectfully and effectively can have a positive impact on the care that you provide for an individual and make your job more enjoyable. Think about a communication you have had recently with someone at work. Reflect on how your own past experiences, traumatic events, traditions, culture, religion and spirituality influenced your part of the conversation. From what you know about the other person, reflect on how these same topics influenced their part of the conversation.Respectful Communication Effective communication in the best of times can be difficult. Communicating with a person diagnosed with a mental disorder may at times become even more challenging. This is because the person is: Preoccupied with other issues (either real or imagined). Withdrawn or depressed to the point that talking is difficult. Experiencing hallucinations or delusions. Having trouble concentrating. A person with a mental disorder deserves to be communicated with clearly, respectfully and without judgment. When situations become difficult, it is important to share feelings and thoughts in a way that is non-confrontational to avoid negative responses. Remain open and genuine in your communication. It is okay to set limits on hostile or bizarre behavior, but make sure to always tell the person in a non-emotional, non-judgmental way that the behavior is inappropriate. Be clear and calm when telling the person about possible consequences of continuing the behavior. Effectively communicating with a person with a mental disorder requires your best skills in: Concisely presenting information Actively listening to the other person Consistently matching your non-verbal expressions with the meaning of what you are saying Doing your best to ensure your messages are understood and accepted 62 63Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Listening Be a good listener. Listening requires more than hearing words. Listening requires: A desire to understand another human being An attitude of respect A willingness to stay open to seeing things from another's point of view People want to feel heard more than they care about whether you agree with them. You do not have to accept the person's idea or point of view. Just be willing to hear what the person has to say. Have a better understanding of the person Avoid misunderstandings Show respect Diffuse anger More effectively problem-solve Improve your relationship with the person Provide more effective and compassionate care Listening Skills Make time to listen to the person. Stop what you are doing and show the person you are interested in what he or she is saying. Encourage the person to explain what he or she is thinking and feeling so you can better understand what he or she is going through. Use phrases such as \"Tell me more\", \"What happened then?\", \"When did the problem start?\", \"How can I help you?\" Listen without interrupting. Be patient if it takes the person a while to say what he or she wants to say. Allow the person to talk without showing shock, surprise, or expressing judgment. Accept the person's feelings without shaming the person. Reflect meaning - you can show you understand the person by reflecting his or her feelings. If you do this, it is important to reflect correctly the intensity of the feeling. If a person is terrified say: \"You look like you are really terrified\", not \"So, you are feeling a little scared.\" You might say \"You are feeling terrified because the voices are telling you that people are spreading lies about you.\" Do not exaggerate, as this may alarm the indi - vidual. Reflecting meaning is also a good way to clarify exactly what the person is saying. Put what you think you heard into your own words and repeat it back to the resident. Pay attention to the person's voice. Listen to the speed the person is talking. Changes in the rate of speed are important clues to a speaker's feelings. When a person is excited, angry or frustrated, they tend to talk more rapidly. When a person is reluctant to talk, speech usually slows down. A higher pitched voice may indicate stress or anxiety. A louder than normal voice often indicates emotional intensity. Pair up in groups of two. Learner #1: This individual will speak for one minute about something that happened to them recently. Learner #2: This individual will listen for one min - ute practicing the listening skills listed above. After the minute is up, switch roles for one minute. 63Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Empathy and Compassion To be compassionate means to be aware of and sympathetic to the suffering of others. To be empathetic means to be able to notice the subtle verbal and non- verbal signals people give off that let you know what they need or want. Empathetic people receive both physical and emotional benefits from their sensitivity. Compassionate, empathetic people are able to listen to and understand the experiences that other people describe. Their willingness to put their own concerns away for a while and to witness and experience others' experiences is universally appreciated as a genuine and precious gift which decreases loneliness, bonds people together (creating stronger, deeper relationships), and enhances self-esteem and self-worth for both people.Compassion and empathy are skills that can be cultivated. You can increase your ability to be compassionate and empathetic by practicing being other-focused (rather than self-focused). In order to practice empathy and compassion, make the effort to put your own cares and worries aside for a while when with the individual you are caring for. Tell yourself, \"It is okay for me to not think about myself for a while. All my worries, fears and feelings will still be here when I get back to them\", and then take the time to really listen to what the individual has to say. Listen actively. Do not be thinking about what you want to say next while the other person is talking. Instead, actively pay attention to what they have to say. More than just listening to what the individual says with words, pay attention to how the person carries him or herself and what is done. Look for disconnections between what is said and what is done. If the individual says, \"I'm fine\" but looks like he or she is in great pain while saying it, you will know the individual is probably not being completely open with you. If you notice this, you will have discovered an opportunity to ask how the person is really feeling. Eliseo Hiler, a 65 year old man with depression seems to be more withdrawn today and you see him watching others work on a project together. How might you interact with Eliseo to find out how he is really feeling? Communication Posture Gestures Facial expressions Eye contact Personal spaceTips Maintain an open and relaxed posture. Avoid exaggerated movements, such as pointing, waving your arms, or putting your hands on your hips. These may be interpreted as confrontational or aggressive. Faces express feeling. Facial expressions need to match the meaning of what you are feeling and thinking. Maintain a comfortable level of eye contact. Looking at someone in the eye can show you are listening to them and are not bored or frightened. Staring can cause the person to become uncomfortable or feel threatened. There may be cultural differences in the use of eye contact. If the person is feeling vulnerable or not well, standing too close can make the person feel uncomfortable. Do not tower over the individual and communicate at eye level.Non-verbal vs. Verbal Communication Non-verbal Communication 64 65Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Verbal Communication Be specific and concrete but avoid oversimplifying. You do not want to seem patronizing. Present one thought at a time. Presenting too much information at once may overwhelm the person. Ask constructive questions to encourage the person to talk more about what he or she is feeling. Do not rush. Speak in a calm manner. Share your feelings in a non-confrontational way. Use \"I\" statements rather than \"you\" statements. \"I\" statements show that you are taking responsibility for your feelings and are not blaming the other person. Express positive feelings. Say exactly what the person did that pleased you. Recognize the difficulty of the person's situation. Acknowledge the person's strengths and abilities. Maintain your normal tone and pitch when speaking. Your natural reaction to some situations may be to raise your voice. Try to avoid this as it can be more disturbing to the person. If you are having trouble getting a message across, come back to the issue another time. Do not argue about it, no matter how logical you feel your argument is. Do not discuss anything important when you are angry or upset. If you do not understand, do not fake it. Ask the resident to repeat. Ask what you can do to help. Do what you can to meet their needs. Let the individual know that you are concerned for him/her, not scared of him/her.Communication Tips for Specific Disorders Anxiety Disorders Anxiety is often accompanied by irrational thinking, such as fears that are not based in reality. Remain non-judgmental. Allow the person to talk about his or her fears and concerns while maintaining a calm, caring and under - standing attitude. Avoid giving advice or directing the conversation. Use \"active listening\" skills. Being actively listened to often helps an anxious person see and think more clearly and overcome his or her anxiety. If talking about anxiety-provoking concerns and fears does not alleviate the anxiety, help the person redirect attention away from anxious thoughts as much as pos - sible. o This may be as simple as changing the subject to something more pleasant or engaging the person in an activity that requires close attention such as read - ing, putting together a puzzle, playing a game, help - ing prepare dinner or a simple breathing exercise. Pair up with a partner and complete this activity: (1) Each individual will choose one of the roles below. - Caregiver - Jackie Vanderhoff - Age 55, diagnosed with anxiety panic disorder ( page 10 ). (2) Scenario: The caregiver walks into the room to see Jackie Vanderhoff starting to hyperventilate and exclaims, \"I am going to die!\" Jackie seems agitated and pacing back and forth. (3) Role-play the scenario above. The learner play - ing the \"caregiver \"will demonstrate compassion, flexibility and understanding for the individual experiencing anxiety. The learner playing \"Jackie\" will act anxious.65Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Depression A person with depression may have an overall feeling of negativity and may respond to you in that way. Try not to take this personally or feel discouraged if the person seems withdrawn. You do not have to understand what the person is going through to be helpful. It is better to admit that you cannot understand the person's experience (unless you have experienced something similar). Invite the person to share with you what it is like or what he or she is feeling. And then actively listen. Acknowledge the person's depression and do not trivialize it. For example, do not tell the person that everyone gets depressed sometimes or that he or she has it better than some people. Use a calm and reassuring tone when communicating with a person who has depression. Often a person with depression feels very alone. Remind the person that you are there to support him or her. Offer hope but do not minimize the person's experience. Be honest and genuine. The best communication can simply be to ask \"how can I help?\" Pair up with a partner and complete this activity (switch roles from last time): (1) Each individual will choose one of the roles below. - Caregiver - Devin Sollars - Age 80, diagnosed with depression ( page 15 ). (2) Scenario: The caregiver walks into the room to see Devin Sollars sitting in a chair staring blankly at the wall. The caregiver has noticed that Devin has been more and more withdrawn lately and not participating in activities. Devin is struggling to find anything positive to look forward to. (3) Role-play the scenario above. The learner playing the \"caregiver\" will demonstrate compassion, flexibility and understanding for the individual experiencing depression. The learner playing \"Devin\" will act depressed.Bipolar Reduce stimulation. Communicate ways to help the person cope with stress that may be causing a manic episode. Do your best to calm the person without \"pushing\" them to improve their behavior. Set limits and have structure. A few rules may keep things calmer. Deal with immediate issues. Do not try to reason or argue. Use direct and consistent language. Let the person know when his or her behavior becomes problematic. Watch for verbal and non-verbal signs of anger. Do not try to convince the person that his or her plans are unrealistic. At the same time, take steps to ensure his or her safety. Pair up with a new partner and complete this activity: (1) Each individual will choose one of the roles below. - Caregiver - Lawerence Ocasio - Age 66, diagnosed with bipolar disorder ( page 13 ). (2) Scenario: At lunch, Lawerence is pacing near the table and then sits down and then quickly stands back up again. Lawerence seems to have a lot of extra energy and seems to be elated/happy. The caregiver notices this and approaches Lawerence. (3) Role-play the scenario above. The learner playing the \"caregiver \"will demonstrate compassion, flexibility and understanding for the individual experiencing bipolar. The learner playing \"Lawrence\" will act bipolar. 66 67Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Schizophrenia Symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations and delusions. When communicating with a person who is actively hallucinating, it is important to find out about the nature of the hallucinatory experience in case there are safety issues to be concerned about. o For example, if the person says to you, \"Do you see those angels flying up there?\" Say to the person, \"No, I do not see them, but I believe you do.\" Change the subject to a topic that is based in reality, for example, the weather, current events, or plans for the day. If the person has paranoid ideas, do not try to argue him or her out of it. Sympathize with the person and say that it must be upsetting to feel like that. If the person is delusional, find out the content of the delusion in the event of potential danger. Do not argue with the person or focus on the delu - sional content. Keep the conversation reality-based. For example, you are preparing medications when the individual states \"I know you want to poison me with those.\" o Say to her, \"I am preparing your medication. I have no intention of hurting anyone.\" Continue prepar - ing the medications, changing the subject, and do not mention what you are doing again. Do not allow yourself to feel intimidated by the per - son's words or behaviors. Pair up with a partner and complete this activity (switch roles from last time): (1) Each individual will choose one of the roles below. - Caregiver - Kelley Pooley - Age 43, diagnosed with schizophrenia (page 66). (2) Scenario: Kelley Pooley rushes up to the caregiver and exclaims \"Help! There is a man with a knife in my room.\" Kelley laughs. (3) Role-play the scenario above. The learner playing the \"caregiver \"will demonstrate compassion, flexibility and understanding for the individual. The learner playing \"Kelley\" will demonstrate a perception of schizophrenia. Seeking Clarification Clarification is the action of making a statement or situation less confusing and more clear. Clarifying reassures the individual speaking that the listener is attempting to understand the messages they are expressing. Clarifying involves asking questions or occasionally summarizing what the individual has said. If you do not understand what the individual is saying, you can ask for clarification. Clarifying involves genuineness on your part and it shows the individual that you are interested in them and what they have to say. Some examples of clarification seeking questions: I am not quite sure I understand what you are saying. I do not feel clear about the main issue here. When you said ..... what did you mean? Can you repeat? Questions must be non-judgmental. Summarizing must be given from the speaker's frame of reference, not an interpretation from the listener's viewpoint. The aim of a summary is to review understanding, not to give explanation, to judge, to interpret or provide solutions. Triggering and Preventing Challenging Behaviors When communicating, we need to be aware of the meaning of our words and the impact of our words on others. Negative trigger words may be used without us even realizing it and may sometimes push the individual into reacting through challenging behaviors. Knowing the individual and their personal triggers is important. Documenting these triggers for others is also important. 67Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Some general communication / word triggers may include: Always, never, constantly. These words may create defensiveness in the other person. Should, must, need to. These words can appear to be ordering others around. Can't, won't, don't. These words can trigger negative responses by some when heard as a request to an individual's enquiry. Instead, reframe as a positive to move the conversation forward instead of focusing on why things will not happen. Try, maybe, perhaps. These may communicate doubt, uncertainty and lack of commitment. Instead focus on what can be accomplished rather than what cannot be done. There may be situations where these words may be appropriate such as \"Can you try to use the commu - nication skills you learned in therapy last week?\" Read the phrases below and think about how you can reframe as a positive. You constantly interrupt when I am talking. You always make mistakes like that. You can't leave. Try to do better next time. Behaviors Impacting Communication There are times that your behaviors may impact your ability to communicate with the individual you are caring for. If the individual asks you to stop a behavior because it is causing anxiety, stress or is a trigger, stop immediately. If you do not stop the behavior immediately it may increase anxieties for the individual and breaks down trust. Communicating with Others There will be times that you must communicate with others involved in the care of the individual. These others include family members, doctors, counselors, therapists, and other caregivers and staff. Good commu - nication skills will help you maintain and build relation - ships with others to help improve the care of the people you care for. Keep communication with professionals focused on what the individual is doing (or not doing) and make sure to emphasize both positive and negative changes in mental status, mood, and behavior; Describe when the behavior started and when it is most and least likely to occur; Communicate the desired outcome (what you want the individual to start or stop doing) clearly; Be aware of and respect confidentiality. What are some other ways you can communicate well with others?69Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration 68Lesson Summary By using effective communication strategies, you will maximize your connection with the individuals you care for. A person with a mental disorder deserves to be communicated with clearly, respectfully and without judgment. People want to feel heard more than they care about whether you agree with them. You do not have to accept the person's idea or point of view. Just be willing to hear what the person has to say. Compassion and empathy are skills that can be cultivated. You can increase your ability to be compassionate and empathetic by practicing being other-focused (rather than self-focused). Checkpoint Read the scenarios below. Select a communication listed that might be effective for the scenario or create your own. ___________________ 1. Name: Candra Anxiety Scenario: Candra is having an anxiety attack after starting a group activity. She is experiencing shortness of breath and is irritable towards you and others. ___________________ 2. Name: Rick Stelly | Age: 59 | Diagnosis: Depression Scenario: When you approach Rick to talk about his day, he says things like \"why bother\" and \"what is the use\". He is appears to be having a difficult time finding anything positive about his day. ___________________ 3. Name: Jason Brassfield | Age: 85 | Diagnosis: ADHD, Bipolar Scenario: Jason is currently manic and has increased energy. He is describing plans that he has that are unrealistic and jumping from one idea to the next. Communication Options: A. Remain non-judgmental. Allow the person to talk about his/her fears and concerns while maintaining a calm, caring and understanding attitude. Avoid giving advice or directing the conversation. B. A person with an overall feeling of negativity may respond to you negatively. Try not to take this personally or feel discouraged if the person seems withdrawn. You do not have to understand what the person is going through to be helpful. Remind the person that you are there to support him/her. C. Reduce stimulation. Deal with immediate issues. Do not try to reason or argue. Do not try to convince the person that his/her plans are unrealistic. At the same time, take steps to ensure his/her safety.

Overview A boundary is simply a property line. It defines where you end and the other person begins. You create boundaries with your words, actions and sometimes with the help of other people. Boundaries help you to be clear on what you will allow and not allow in your interactions with others. Boundaries exist in personal relationships as well as professional relationships. Boundaries may vary but it is important to maintain boundaries in your professional life that are ethical and consider the best interest of the individual you care for while maintaining your own well-being. Each of us needs to be responsible for our own behaviors. If a boundary is crossed or violated, that is a choice. Everyone has a choice. Choices lead to consequences. The person who crosses or violates a boundary can choose the consequence but it may be up to you to enforce it. Consequences can take on an \"if, then\" approach. For example, you might say \"if you continue to scream at me, then I will not help you with your coat.\" You each have a choice. If you set a rule based on respect for each other and it is repeatedly crossed or violated, you need to have a discussion with the individual about the problem. You can give the person a chance to help solve the problem, offer a consequence and follow through with the consequences if disrespected.You need to be your own best advocate and learn the consequences of your actions too. Often a caregiver thinks they know what is best for the individual with mental illness. The individual may have differing ideas, which need to be respected unless it is hurting themselves or others. It is best to work together and find alternate ways to solve a problem. As a caregiver, you must not only maintain healthy boundaries for yourself, you must also honor the individual's boundaries. If someone says \"no\", then a boundary is set and you should honor that. Reflect on a time when you felt like someone was intruding on your personal boundaries making you feel uncomfortable with their actions or words. Professional Boundaries Professional boundaries are an important part of having healthy relationships at work. These boundaries can apply to coworkers, managers and even the individuals you care for. Professional boundaries promote good care and protect both you and the individuals with whom you are interacting. Caregiving involves working closely with individuals over time - this may be short or long term and care may oc - cur during stressful and traumatic periods of life. You may learn personal and confidential information about the individual through discussions or through the care plan. Physical contact may occur while performing activ - ities of daily living. Good communication is important to keep the individual informed while performing activities of daily living to minimize misunderstandings resulting in complaints that your actions are inappropriate. Boundary Crossing Boundary crossings are temporary departures from usual professional practice that are not exploitative. On oc - casion, a boundary may be consciously crossed with the intention of assisting an individual. This may include disclosing to an individual who has been diagnosed with depression that you know others who have also been diagnosed with depression. However, at other times boundary crossings may shift to inappropriate or harm - ful to the individual. 70 71Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Boundary Violations Boundary violations are transgressions (an act that goes against a law, rule or code of conduct), which harm the individual in some way. Boundary violations are unethi - cal and unprofessional because they exploit the relation - ship between the caregiver and the individual, under - mine the trust between the individual and the caregiver and can cause psychological harm to the individuals and compromise their ongoing care. It is always unethical and unprofessional for a caregiver to breach trust by entering into a sexual relationship, regardless of the individual consenting to the relation - ship. Sexual misconduct covers a range of inappropriate behaviors including sexualized behavior such as words or actions that might be interpreted as being designed or intended to arouse or gratify sexual desire, sexual exploitation or abuse, which includes sexual harassment, or entering a consensual sexual relationship, sexual as - sault that ranges from physical touching or examination without consent to rape. Risks People who have been sexually abused previously may be vulnerable to boundary violations. Individuals with borderline personality disorder may also be at higher risk. Generally, these individuals have difficulty with interpersonal relationship and maintaining consistent and appropriate boundaries with these individuals can be challenging. Caregivers who are personally or professionally iso - lated, under stress or unwell are more vulnerable to boundary violations. When some caregivers are unable to establish bound - aries, it may cause issues for other caregivers - creat - ing a good caregiver / bad caregiver perception with the individual with a mental disorder.Ask yourself Ask yourself these questions to recognize if you may be violating boundaries Is what I am doing part of my job duties? Is what I am doing solely in the interest of the indi - vidual I am caring for? Is what I am doing self-serving (having more concern for your own interests than others)? Is what I am doing exploiting the individual for my benefit? Is what I am doing gratuitous (not what the individual has asked for)? Is what I am doing secretive? Would I be happy to share my interactions with my spouse, partner or colleagues? Am I revealing too much about myself or my family? Is what I am doing causing me stress, worry or guilt? Has someone already commented on my behavior or suggested I stop? Read the questions above. Identify the questions that might indicate boundary violation if the answer is yes and discuss why.71Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Setting Boundaries If you think about a boundary as a fence or a gate - as the gatekeeper, you get to decide how close another person gets to you physically and emotionally. Providing care for individuals with mental illness may require more patience, reinforcement and consistency when setting and maintaining boundaries. 1. Decide to set boundaries. Recognizing that you need to establish boundaries or improve them is a first step. Boundaries are an extension of love and respect for yourself and others, instead of a reaction to fear or rejection. They are the path to freedom from the need to please others in order to be loved and accepted. 2. Define the boundary. Ask yourself what you hope to accomplish with a particular boundary. You will want to define each type of boundary, physical and emotional, for different settings such as at home, at work, and with friends. 3. Establish the boundary. Share your boundary with the people in your life. This way, they will understand your expectations and needs. 4. Maintain the boundary. For many people, this is the most challenging part of having boundaries. You are not only helping others to respect your limits. You are also retraining yourself. 5. Be direct. Being direct and concise is a respectful way to let others know what your boundaries are. In contrast, being indirect or using lengthy explanations will send mixed messages. 6. Take care of yourself. One of the hardest parts of establishing and maintaining boundaries is our fear of appearing rude or selfish. Put yourself first by recognizing and honoring your feelings. This does not mean that you are dismissive of others or their feelings. Your quest for boundaries hinges on your willingness to take care of yourself so that you can be there for others. Emotional Boundaries Your own health and well-being are important, and you will not be forced to neglect your own needs. You have a right to be treated with respect. You will not be manipulated or forced to do things you do not want to do, even if the other person is attempt - ing to make you feel guilty. You will not allow others to yell at you, make you feel bad about who you are or what you are doing, or call you names. You do not blame others for things that are your re - sponsibility, and you do not allow others to blame you for things that are not your responsibility. You keep your emotions separate from other people's emotions, although you empathize with the people you care about and care for. You communicate your own needs assertively, and work towards cooperation if possible. This helps main - tain mutual respect. Having a healthy sense of who you are, independent from any other person. Knowing that you have the choice in how you want to feel and your ability to act on it. Being able to monitor how much you share about yourself so that you respect yourself. Being able to say \"no\" at times when you need to be assertive and true to yourself.72Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Physical Boundaries When someone intrudes on our physical space, we feel it internally. It feels awkward and unnatural. When you are in a relationship, make sure you are comfortable with how you express yourself physically with the other person. Have a conversation about what will make you feel safe. Different cultures are known to have different under - standings of personal space distance and boundaries. You will probably find that different people are com - fortable with different physical boundaries, which may be different from your physical boundaries. It is a violation of physical boundaries to go through another person's belongings without their permission. Even if you are concerned for their safety or suspect that there is a problem, the healthy and respectful route is to approach the person and speak to them. Make sure the other person knows that this has crossed a boundary and is not respectful behavior. Identify the boundaries below as emotional or physical by placing an \"E\" next to those that are emotional and \"P\" next to those that are physical. _____ You will not be manipulated or forced to do things you don't want to do, even if the other person is attempting to make you feel guilty. _____ You keep your emotions separate from other people's emotions, although you empathize with the people you care about. _____ Knowing that you have the choice in how you want to feel and your ability to act on it. _____ When someone intrudes on our physical space, we feel it internally. It feels awkward and unnatural. _____ When someone goes through another per - son's belongings without their permission.Assertiveness There are three different ways to relate to one another. 1) Aggressive, 2) Passive or 3) Assertive. Aggressive Aggression is about dominance. A person is aggressive when they impose their will onto another person and force them to submit - invading that person's personal space and boundary. Violence may be used but it is not always a part of aggression. Passive Passivity is when a person submits to another person's dominance, putting their own wishes and desires aside to fulfill the wishes and desires of the dominant indi - vidual. 73Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Assertiveness Assertiveness is finding a middle way between aggression and passivity that best respects the personal boundar - ies of all individuals involved. Assertive people defend themselves when someone else attempts to dominate them, using any necessary method (including force) to prevent the invasion attempt. Though they can be strong people who are capable of aggressive domination attempts, they never act in an aggressive manner, how - ever, because they know to do so would cause them to disrespect the boundaries. Another way to think about it is that assertive people use aggression defensively and never offensively. Assertive behavior consists of the following steps: Realizing that you have been dominated, or taken advantage of Feeling the angry feelings (directed towards the domi - nating partner, and/or to yourself for allowing yourself to be dominated) Deciding to act to put a stop to the domination Acting on your conviction (which involves finding a way to demand your rights be respected, while also being polite and civil about it so as not to become ag - gressive yourself) Resisting the urge to submit again in the face of esca - lation. Most of the time it is healthy and useful to assert your - self. However, you should be aware that there are some situations where attempting to assert yourself can get you harmed. In order for assertion to work to change relationships, both individuals have to be reasonable people at some level, and to at least minimally respect one another.Lesson Summary A boundary is simply a property line. It defines where you end and the other person begins. You create boundaries with your words, actions and sometimes with the help of other people. Boundaries help you to be clear on what you will allow and not allow in your interactions with others. Professional boundaries are an important part of having healthy relationships at work.

Checkpoint Using a fishbowl technique, two individuals will have a discussion in the middle of the room on the topic of creating healthy professional boundaries while the rest of the class observes the discussion quietly. Once the discussion is complete, learners on the outside of the fishbowl will summarize. 7374 75Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Module 5: Creative Approaches to Challenging Behaviors Lesson 8: Approaching Behaviors The caregiver will demonstrate a sequence of steps to approach challenging behaviors. Lesson 9: Crisis Management The caregiver will identify potential stressors to prevent crisis and demonstrate steps for de-escalation.75Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson 8 Approaching Behaviors Objective: The caregiver will demonstrate a sequence of steps to approach challenging behaviors. Overview Mental illness is any psychiatric disorder that causes untypical behavior. You have learned earlier in this book about various mental disorders that may have negative symptoms and behaviors attached to them. You have learned the impact that past trauma may have on an individual's present well-being and triggers that may prompt negative reactions when resilience and healthy coping mechanisms are lacking. Remain empathetic, dependable, patient, strong, flexible and creative when interacting and approaching individuals and their behaviors. This lesson gives a general approach for approaching behaviors. As you work through each section, think about situations you have been in and how you might apply this three-step approach in future situations. Think about a time when your own behaviors were negative and how you felt at that time. Consider how others reacted or responded to your behaviors. Were there responses that made you feel better? Were there reactions that made you feel worse?Exploring Behaviors Individuals with mental illness use behaviors to com - municate a personal need, feelings and emotions. There might be many things going on with the person that may contribute to the behavior. In order to decide how to best respond to the behavior, you need to take a step back and try to figure out what the person's behavior may be telling you. There is no one size fits all solution when dealing with behaviors. Different people have dif - ferent needs. Strategy for Approaching Behaviors While there are a number of strategies to work with behaviors, your primary role is to remain and appear calm and supportive and do not take the behaviors personally. Remember that the individual with a diagnosis of mental illness does not necessarily behave in a way to get attention or to be mean. They are expressing a need. You must know the individual's history, habits, current needs and abilities. There is no right/wrong view of challenging behaviors. To approach behaviors: Stop, identify and take action. 1. Stop When you are faced with an unexpected behavior, take a moment to stop yourself and take a step back from the situation. Make sure you are not reacting. Calm yourself and focus. Most challenging behaviors have a cause or a trigger. There is a reason for the behavior. Challenging behavior is likely a reaction to something that set the behavior in motion. Having a reaction means that the individual is unconsciously, emotionally and possibly impulsively behaving without any thought to a situation or event. It is your job to respond. Responding is taking action with thought. Responding versus reacting to a challenging situation takes self-control and discipline. The best way to respond and not react is to stop before taking action unless someone is in immediate danger. Stop or pause even if only a few seconds Calm yourself76 77Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Calming techniques If you find yourself reacting instead of responding, there are many ways to get calm and focused. Find something that works for you. Take a few deep breaths. Count to ten. Detach yourself from the emotions of what is happen - ing around you. Separate the behavior from the person. Recognize it is not about you. Repeat a positive phrase or affirmation to yourself such as \"I am calm and relaxed in every situation\" \"I remain calm and positive in difficult situations\" I remain calm and in control under stress\". Get a clear picture in your mind of armor surrounding and protecting you from harm. Imagine a scene, person or experience that gives you a feeling of calm. Janeth Mcfarren recently started telling you about having conversations with her family in Califor - nia. She does not have a phone and there is no record of these conversations. After talking with the family, you discover that she has hallucinated in the past when there is a change in her environ - ment. You have just had several staff change their schedule and some of Janeth's favorite activities have changed. Discuss how you can accomplish step one. If you are still unable to get yourself calm and focused, give yourself a brief time-out (if possible in your situa - tion) or ask for help. It is better to walk away for a few minutes and collect yourself than to risk reacting and making the situation worse.2. Identify After you take a moment, it is time to use your detective skills and figure out what is happening. Identify what caused or triggered the behavior. You should know the individual's routines, preferences and daily rhythms related to care and life history. When you see a change that concerns you, remain emotionally available to the individual. Show genuine interest and concern. Realize that your own personal feelings of stress, personal worries, and time pressures can add to any emotional tension the individual is experiencing. Listen to what the person is communicating through body language, words and the emotions behind their actions. The individual might be expressing a need or desire or there might be a trigger that is physical, environmental and/or emotional. Expressing a need or desire There are many reasons an individual may not be able to communicate with words what they need or want. The person with mental illness may not be able to: Speak. Process things quickly enough to explain what is hap - pening or needed in the moment. Understand themselves due to the disease. Have strength to speak words. For example, he or she may be in too much physical and/or emotional pain. Sometimes what you may see as a challenging behavior may be the only way the individual can tell you that they need or want something. Physical, environmental and emotion - al triggers The following are some common triggers to look for that may be causing the behavior. Physical triggers such as Symptoms of his or her disease(s) or condition(s) Infection, such as urinary tract infection (UTI) Pain Medication side effects or drug interactions. This is especially important when medications are added or stopped.77Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Dehydration Hunger or thirst Fatigue Recent injury Incontinence Constipation Unmet physical care needs such as needing to go to the bathroom Uncomfortable clothing Reaction to care being given Environmental triggers such as Too much noise or people Intrusion into personal space Temperature (too hot or too cold) Something unfamiliar being added in the environment Something familiar being removed or moved Lack of privacy New environment or people Too bright or too dark Smells Full moon or sun setting Shift change Emotional triggers such as Change in routine (especially if the individual feels no control over the change) Recent big changes or losses Difficulty with family, friends other care members Need to regain a sense of control Depression Boredom Past or current events, including holidays Anxiety Fear Loneliness Lack of intimacy Emotional state of other peopleThe perspective of the individual you are caring for is what is important when looking for possible triggers. What has triggered the individual's behavior can be very different from what would trigger you. Janeth Mcfarren recently started telling you about having conversations with her family in Califor - nia. She does not have a phone and there is no record of these conversations. After talking with the family, you discover that she has hallucinated in the past when there is a change in her environ - ment. You have just had several staff change their schedule and some of Janeth's favorite activities have changed. Discuss how you can accomplish step two. Other things to look for: What happened just before the behavior started? Were there other people involved when the behav - ior occurred? Where did it occur? What is happening in the person's living space? Is this a new behavior? Are there certain actions that make it worse? Is the individual trying to communicate a need or desire? Are there any patterns you can see? For example, is there a certain time of day, events such as shift changes, a particular caregiver or visitor, substances like drugs, alcohol, sugar or caffeine, or after taking a certain medication that sets it off? 3. Action Because there is no \"one size fits all\" formula to handle challenging behaviors, what works in one situation may not work in another and may not work in the same situation. What works with one individual may have the opposite result with another. The best way to deal with challenging behaviors is to adapt as you go to each unique individual and situation. This means that you must be: Constantly aware of signals the individual is giving off. Ready to adapt, walk away, soothe, distract, or respectfully steer the individual away from what triggered the behavior. Willing to do something different if what you tried does not seem to be working.78 79Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Minimize or eliminate the trigger If you have an idea what is causing the behavior, try to stop or minimize the trigger. If meeting an individual's need or request can minimize or eliminate the behavior, ask yourself the following questions: Does it hurt anyone to do it? Are you bothered because it o Makes you change or adjust YOUR schedule? o Might look odd or unusual to others? o Requires you to \"think outside the box?\" o Would be easier to do it the \"regular\" way or at a less busy or unusual time? o Is the individual experiencing pain? Adapt Look for ways to adapt to the individual and their rou - tine. This can include: Changing when or how the individual receives care. Breaking tasks down into smaller steps. Taking frequent breaks to allow the individual more time to do each step. Not doing certain tasks as frequently or doing them at a different time. Doing more prompting or cuing. Encouraging independence and choice in even the smallest ways. Using assistive devices to their fullest extent. Common Pitfalls Common pitfalls in taking action on challenging behav - iors might include Correcting behavior. Ignoring the behavior. Arguing with the person. Attempting to use reasoning to change the behavior.Be aware and observant of subtle details. The answer for successfully navigating through challenging behaviors is often in the subtle details of who the individual is as a person. How do you know when the individual likes or does not like something? What types of things, situations, or people seem to make the individual frustrated, anxious or nervous, angry, etc? What pace of activity is comfortable for that individual? How do you know when it is too fast or too slow? How does the individual communicate (both verbally and with body language) what he/she wants? Is there anything you can learn about the individual's general personality that gives you an overall sense of the best way to work with them? Is there anything unique to the individual's culture that could be contributing to the challenging behavior? When you get to know some of these more subtle things about an individual, you can watch for early warning signs of possible problems. Take action immediately to help the individual feel more calm and reassured (reduce or minimize the trigger, give space, calm, distract, reassure, etc.) Give space Ask yourself if giving the individual some space would be best. If it is safe, come back in five or ten minutes. This may give the individual time to calm down. Some quiet time may be all it takes to resolve the situation. Giving space can also mean staying with the individual and respecting his or her need for personal space. How much space does the individual appear to need around their physical body? Is the individual hypersensitive to touch? Movement? Claustrophobic? Is there a particular way you can approach the individual that seems less unsettling to them? Knowing the answers to these questions can help guide you in how to approach the individual any time, but especially when the individual is highly reactive.79Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Tips when approaching Pay special attention how you approach individuals with mental disorders. A sense that you are invading per - sonal space is a common trigger of challenging behavior. Remember to: Knock. Ask permission to enter a personal space. Smile genuinely. Try to get the person's attention before you talk. Move slowly. Avoid sudden movements. Identify yourself and why you are there. Address the individual by the preferred name. Spend a few minutes talking with the individual before providing care. This gives you time to see how the individual is doing and gauge if it is safe to proceed with care. Explain what you are doing. Soothe and comfort Slow down your own movements and energy. Try not to show any anxiety or other intense emo - tions. They will likely increase the reactions from the individual. Validate the person's feelings. Speak slowly, softly with a low pitch, and in a reassur - ing tone. Make sure the individual can hear you if he or she has trouble hearing. Offer things you know comfort that individual (warm blanket, rocking chair, quiet music, a cup of tea, turn - ing on a favorite show, a favorite object, holding a pet). Reduce distractions or loud background noises as much as possible. Examples might be turning down the TV, asking others in the room to step out, or turn - ing down the lights. Ask the individuals permission before doing any of these things. Play relaxation or anti-anxiety music or meditations. If touching might be comforting, offer physical comfort such as lightly stroking the individuals hand, giving a hug or a back rub. The appropriateness of comforting touch depends on the individual and poli - cies where you work. If offering comforting touch is allowed, ask the individual's permission first. Make sure you know preferences when it comes to touch and back off immediately if it further upsets the person.As a general rule, remember that your body language is your best communication tool. This means that it is critical that: Your posture, facial expressions and stance are relaxed and open. Your tone is respectful and calm. You move slowly. You stop what you are doing and focus on the indi - vidual. Your body language matches the words you say to the individual. Reassure Listen! Let the individual talk about their feelings. Do not ask a lot of questions at first. Let the individual get some of the excess emotions out. Listening helps make sure the individual knows that he/she has been \"heard\" by you. (Remember listen to both words and body language). Be understanding and sympathetic. The individual will be more likely to respond favorably if you sound sympathetic rather than insincere, annoyed, frustrated or angry. Maintain clear boundaries if you are treated with disrespect or threatened. This is not the time to have a talk about the behavior. Wait until later when the situation is calmer to work through any boundary issues or concerns. Distract or redirect Distract the individual by offering choices such as a calming or favorite activity such as a walk, snack or beverage. Change the conversation to something positive that may redirect the person. Encourage the person to take several deep breaths. Reinforce positive behaviors. Encourage Listen. Use praise liberally while remaining mindful that the individual is an adult. (Be careful that the praise does not become child-like) Reinforce positive behavior no matter how small. Encourage keeping happy reminders, such as family pictures or treasured keepsakes in plain view. Encourage the individuals to engage in healthy behav - iors in diet, exercise and socializing with others.Protect and support others being impacted by the behavior It can be upsetting for others to see or be part of the challenging behavior. Remember to stay aware of others in the area. Take action to support and protect others if they are impacted. Get help If you need help, get it. Especially when medical or other emergency help is needed. Know what your policy is on involving other individuals such as medical person - nel, other team members, family, friends or guardians. Speak up immediately if you ever feel you are at your own breaking point or limit when dealing with an indi - vidual who is exhibiting challenging behavior. Self-care As a caregiver, you need to replenish your emotional reserves after handling stressful behaviors. This requires good self-care. Take time to manage your feelings. Janeth Mcfarren recently started telling you about having conversations with her family in Califor - nia. She does not have a phone and there is no record of these conversations. After talking with the family, you discover that she has hallucinated in the past when there is a change in her environ - ment. You have just had several staff change their schedule and some of Janeth's favorite activities have changed. Discuss how you can accomplish step three. 80 81Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Prevent or minimize challenging behaviors Once the heat of the moment has passed, you may have more time to reflect on what triggered the challenging behavior. This information helps you take steps to avoid these situations from happening again. With more time to reflect, you may see additional patterns or concerns. Document and report You may have important information to share with other team members. Others on your team need to under - stand and learn from what you observed, what actions you took and what did and did not work. There will be policies and procedures for documenting and reporting challenging situations that you must follow. Objectively writing down what happened and what actions you took gives everyone a record. This record will help make sure you do not forget even small details, that when reviewed again, might reveal important information. Behaviors and Mental Illness Depression Gently encourage engagement in activities. Allow the individual to set the pace - even if it is not as fast as you would like. Respect the individual's emotional and physical limitations. He/she may need the rest to get well again. Getting outside and doing physical activity of any form often gives a sense of accomplishment and can boost self-confidence. Be sure to give positive feedback for all accomplishments. Hallucinations When someone seems to be hearing voices or sees things that you do not see, stay calm. Try to distract by asking the person to do something or by engaging in conversation. If the person is hearing voices more and more, this may be a sign of relapse. Encourage the individual to speak with their health professional(s). Do not pretend to see or hear what the person hears, but acknowledge what they are hearing, e.g., \"I believe you hear another voice even though I don't.\"81Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Behaviors and Mental Illness (Cont.) Delusions A delusion is a fixed false idea, sometimes based on a misinterpretation of a situation. It is pointless to argue with her/him. Acknowledge that you appreciate that the person truly believes what they are saying, but do not agree with it. It is better to help with the distressing emotions she is feeling rather than to dismiss the beliefs. The nature of some delusions may lead you to be concerned about the individual's safety or well-being. It may be difficult to know what is true and what is not. As you work this through, it is usually helpful to verify \"facts\" with others. Manic behavior Manic behavior patterns include hyperactivity, heightened mood to the point of elation, and overexcitement. If an individual has manic behavior, try to be a calming influence. Try to slow things down (for example, talk more slowly, walk more slowly). Express your concerns about the actions but be prepared that the individual may not see anything wrong. Set clear limits on behavior and take action when warning signs begin to appear. Social withdrawal (withdrawal from family, friends and activities) Gently encourage the individual to participate in everyday activities (eating meals, watching television), but be prepared for the individual to refuse. It may be difficult for him/her depending on the stage of recovery. Large gatherings or busy group activities may be too overwhelming. Friends can be an important source of social enjoyment. Apathy/Lack of motivation Ask the individual to help with simple tasks or chores and be sure to thank him/her when she does. You may say something like, \"Thank you for helping me with the laundry. I enjoyed your company; it made the chore much easier.\" Regular exercise and mental activity like going for a walk and reading the newspaper can also help. It is important to move at a manageable pace. Pushing to do too much too soon can be overwhelming and may add stress to his/her life. Aggressive behavior You do not have to tolerate violent or aggressive behavior. The first thing to do is assess the level of danger. If you feel safety is at immediate risk, call 911 for help. If you feel the situation is safe, try to find out why the individual is angry. The most effective way to calm a person is to encourage them to talk about their anger. Acknowledge feelings with comments such as \"I can see you are angry\" or \"I appreciate how you feel.\" Try not to argue; it could make the situation worse. Be reassuring. If the individual makes reasonable requests that do not put anyone in danger, try to go along with them. Alcohol or other drug use Mental illness and alcohol/drug use frequently occur together. Fifty percent of people living with mental illness also experience a substance use problem. Many youth and young adults who develop mental illness begin to use alcohol and other drugs at some point in their life. They may use alcohol or drugs for a variety of reasons. Their reason may be to combat social anxiety, boredom or loneliness; block out symptoms or side effects of medication. People living with mental illness are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol and street drugs. Drugs and/or alcohol can interfere with the effectiveness of prescribed medications. They can also increase symptoms and risk of relapse. Use of drugs and/or alcohol is also linked to increased risk of violence. People who have mental illness and serious problems with substance use are said to have a concurrent disorder.82 83Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson Summary Remain empathetic, dependable, patient, strong, flexible and creative when interacting and approaching individuals and their behaviors. Individuals with mental illness use behaviors to communicate a personal need, feelings and emotions. There might be many things going on with the person that may contribute to the behavior. When you are faced with an unexpected behavior, take a moment to stop yourself and take a step back from the situation. After you take a moment, it is time to use your detective skills and figure out what is happening. Identify what caused or triggered the behavior. Because there is no \"one size fits all\" formula to handle challenging behaviors, what works in one situation may not work in another and may not work in the same situation. What works with one individual may have the opposite result with another. The best way to deal with challenging behaviors is to adapt as you go to each unique individual and situation. Checkpoint Read the following scenarios and using the three-step process described in this lesson, demonstrate how you would handle each situation. 1. Sherwood Wycoff, an individual with schizophrenia, begins pacing up and down the hallway muttering under his breath. You notice his pacing begins to get faster and his muttering continues to get louder. His gaze is very focused and he does not respond to you calling his name. STOP: IDENTIFY: TAKE ACTION: 2. You walk into a room and notice Hana Holiday, an individual who has a history of self-injury, cutting on herself with a sharp piece of plastic. How do you respond? STOP: IDENTIFY: TAKE ACTION:83Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson 9 Crisis Management Objective: The caregiver will identify potential stressors to prevent crisis and demonstrate steps for de-escalation. Overview It is often difficult to predict when a crisis will happen. There may be triggers and signs that a crisis will occur, but a crisis can occur without warning. Our main goal is to be aware of what can cause a crisis (such as triggers and traumas), warning signs, strategies and to recognize each person as an individual to be more aware when an individual may need help. Some mistakes that caregivers might make: Calling 911 before working through the process Ignoring behaviors thinking they will go away Engaging or aggravating the behaviors and not moving on Reacting emotionally Saying to the individual \"you are acting like a child\" Thinking or saying that what the person is experiencing is not real Arguing with the way the individual is feeling Invalidating what the individual is saying A mental health crisis is as important to address as any health crisis. It may be difficult to predict when a crisis will occur. It is important to recognize what a mental health crisis is, how to prevent a crisis and what to do if a crisis occurs. Consider what you know about trauma informed care, behaviors and communication so far. How do you think it influences crisis management?What is Crisis A mental health crisis is a non-life threatening situation in which an individual is exhibiting extreme emotional disturbance or behavioral distress, considering harm to self or others, disoriented or out of touch with reality, has a compromised ability to function, or is otherwise agitated and unable to be calmed. Examples of a Mental Health Crisis may include: Talking about suicide threats Talking about threatening behavior Self-injury, but not needing immediate medical attention Alcohol or substance abuse that is newly formed Highly erratic or unusual behavior Eating disorders that are newly formed Not taking their prescribed psychiatric medications Emotionally distraught, very depressed, angry or anxious 84 85Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Averting Crisis There are things you can do before a situation becomes a crisis. Watch for early warning signs. Occasionally, everyone has a bad day. If you sense deterioration in the person's mental condition, try to find out what is going on. There are usually early warning signs that signal problems such as: changes in sleep or social activities, increasing hostility, suspiciousness, worsening anxiety or mood swings. Try to get the person to see a psychiatrist or social worker or case manager if they have one. The objective is to avert crisis. Critical Risk Factors Before you encounter anger or physical aggression there are certain factors that you can be aware of that may help you avert or deal with risk of violence: Has the person made a direct threat or been violent recently? Has the person made any destructive or threatening statements? Has the person intentionally frightened someone? Has the person been stalking or following people? Is the person preoccupied or dwelling on injustices or unrealistic fears? Does the person have a history of anger problems bordering on violent behavior? Has the person been increasingly angry, aggressive or violent over time? Has the behavior or any threats become increasingly lethal? Has the person made statements or implied they might have a plan? Has the person made statements or implied they might have a weapon?When there is No Immediate Danger When there is no immediate danger, there are three steps that will help you deal with the risk of interper - sonal violence. 1. Identify the risk factors and discuss these with people who can be supportive and offer constructive advice. 2. Report and document any information regarding vio - lent or threatening behavior. 3. Prevent violence by paying attention to warning signs, seeking advice from a qualified mental health profes - sional or supervisor. Kip Lehmann, an 85-year-old man with border - line personality disorder experiences wide mood swings and shows instability and insecurity. He has chronic feelings of boredom and emptiness. When he feels stressed, he often becomes angry and impulsive. Occasionally, Kip has self-harming behaviors. Discuss any warning signs that you might watch for to avert a crisis. Decompensation Decompensation is when symptoms of the mental health disorder begin to be more prominent and the person is unable to manage or cope with his or her symptoms. Think of decompensation as the downward slide from the person's baseline. This downward slide leads to a decline in the person's ability to think and carry on with daily activities. Baseline RelapseDecompensation 85Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Causes of Decompensation Stress is the number one cause of decompensation Changes in a person's daily activities that might cause stress, including changes in the person's physical health, finances, relationships, or living environment Fatigue Illness Not taking prescribed medications Life events such as holidays, vacations, moving or the death of someone close Symptoms of Decompensation Early identification that the person is decompensating is vitally important to get the person appropriate treat - ment. Without intervention, decompensation can lead to a relapse. It is critical that you stay alert to symptoms that the person is decompensating. Symptoms of decompensation are unique to each person. It is important to find out what symptoms the individual has experienced in the past so that you can watch for them. Some general symptoms include: Sensory changes - in what the person tastes, smells, hears and sees Perceptual changes - the person may misinterpret or distort what is going on around him or her and may experience more frequent hallucinations or delusions or become more paranoid. Emotional changes - the person's feelings may appear extreme, opposite of what you might expect or flat, showing little emotions Changes in speech - the person may sound different and may be difficult to understand. The person may string phrases together that make little sense or don't seem to fit Changes in socialization - the person may withdraw and stop talking to others Cognitive changes - the person may have difficulty thinking and seem confused When the person is doing well, talk to him or her about techniques that have worked in the past so you can be prepared to use them when needed. Some typical techniques people with mental health disorder use to prevent a relapse include: Calling the mental health case manager or other mental health professional for support. Calling family or friends. Using positive self-suggestions to overpower unwanted thoughts. Doing an activity the person enjoys, such as reading or playing a game. Taking time to go for a walk, meditate or pray. Getting adequate rest and sleep. Some people may also use drugs or alcohol. This is not a good technique as it makes symptoms worse and can be dangerous. Some things you can do to help Talking to the person about what he or she is feeling Encouraging the person to try some of the techniques that have helped in the past Involving the person in an activity Helping the person to stay focused when doing tasks Being consistent and non-judgemental Calling for assistance when needed Eula Griffiths, age 57, has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and has a history of self-harm and substance abuse. Over the last year, she has been managing her PTSD with a combination of medica - tion and her service dog that has been soothing for her. Eula moved into a new care setting six months ago and there have been many recent changes in caregivers. She has become withdrawn and her symptoms of PTSD are increasing with more flash - backs, bad dreams and outbursts of anger. What are some ways you can help Eula?86 87Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Relapse A relapse is said to occur when the symptoms of the ill - ness worsen or when previous symptoms return and are severe enough to require professional intervention. Baseline RelapseDecompensation Even with the best treatments and support, relapse can still occur. Sometimes, these symptoms come and go in cycles. Relapse may also occur without an apparent cause. Since prevention is not always possible, it is imperative that you prepare ahead of time and develop a plan with the person on what to do in the event of a relapse. Make a detailed written plan, then follow it if relapse occurs. This will make a difficult situation less stressful.Relapse Plan A relapse plan is a prearranged plan for what to do when a person experiences a relapse. It is often called a \"crisis plan\". Most often this plan is included as part of the Negotiated Service Agreement/Plan. There is no requirement for what needs to be part of a relapse plan. A relapse plan should include: Events or situations that have triggered a relapse in the past Early warning signs the person experienced in the past What has helped the person in the past when the person experienced those early warning signs Who the person wants contacted What each person's role is in the plan For people with a long-standing mental disorder and who have mental health professionals as part of the care team, a relapse plan is developed by the individual's case manager and the client earlier on and may be more comprehensive and include information about the person's preferences regarding: Useful tips on what can help this individual in crisis Treatment and facilities Physicians, mental health professionals and other providers Hospitalization and alternative interventions Medication preferences and instructions Eula Griffith's PTSD has relapsed and she is abusing substances and self-harming in addition to her increased symptoms of PTSD. She has a relapse plan in place. How can you help her? Relapse Plan Resident Name: Eula Griffiths Events or situations that triggered relapse in the past: Stressors that include change of environment, inconsistency in supports, the month of December, holidays, fireworks and other loud noises. Early warning signs that I have experienced in the past: Increased irritability, sleeplessness, avoiding social gatherings, feeling depressed, outbursts of anger.What would help me if I experienced early warning signs? Medications, talking with my therapist, my service dog, going for walks, support from family and friends, creating / art. Who I would like to assist me / what I would like them to do My sister - talk with me about carefree memories from our childhood. My therapist - let me talk about my feelings and help me reframe my thoughts. My pastor - pray with me.87Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration When a Crisis Occurs If the person with a mental health disorder is in danger of physical injury, out of control, talking about suicide, posing a threat to the safety of other persons, you need to know what steps to take. Have the person's medical information on hand. If you should need to phone for help, have with you written information about the person's diagnosis, medications and the specific event or behavior that caused you concern. It may be useful to have several copies to give to the police and to mental health professionals. Remember, no one is at fault in a mental health crisis. The person with a mental health disorder may be at a loss as to how to react when someone is in crisis. Remember that the illness is no one's fault, nor is it the fault of the person who is in crisis. If you feel there is a danger to any person, either call the Crisis Center for help in assessing the seriousness of the situation or seek assistance from local law enforcement officers. If the person with a mental health disorder is seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not real, do not argue, deny or reason with the person at this time. Instead, assure the person that you care about him or her, understand that what he or she is experiencing is real to him or her and that you want to help. Crisis De-escalation Remember the steps you learned in lesson 8 on approaching behaviors. Stop, identify and take action. You can use this same strategy for crisis de-escalation while keeping in mind some additional information. As long as there is no immediate danger to self or others, there is time to stop and assess the situation and identify what is happening. You can talk with the person and evaluate the responses. Listen to what the person is saying - not only with words, but also with body language and tone of voice. Listening with empathy is important so you can try to understand where the person is coming from. Give the person your undivided attention. Look at the person, make eye contact if appropriate and demonstrate through your body language that you are listening. Be nonjudgmental. Pay attention to what you say with your words and body language and tone to remain nonjudgmental toward the person and the situation. Focus on feelings. You might say things such as \"that must be scary\" or \"tell me what that feels like.\" Allow silence. If the individual is not responding, you may need to repeat the question and allow for time to respond. Clarify messages. Instead of assuming that you know what the person is saying, you can restate what you understand and allow the person to clarify their meaning. Develop a plan. Develop a plan before one is needed. Think about practicing dealing with potential issues ahead of time. Use a team approach. It is easier to maintain professionalism when assistance is nearby. Use positive self-talk. Instead of thinking to yourself that you cannot deal with this situation, try saying to yourself \"I am trained and I know what to do\" or \"I can do this until help arrives\". Recognize personal limits. Know what your limits are. Know sometimes it is not easy to leave problems alone and sometimes you need to let someone else take over if that is an option. Debrief. Be sure to talk with coworkers, team members or manager after an incident. Talking about it can relieve some stress and it is a good time to start planning for next time. Talk about what was done well, what could have been handled better and how could the response be improved next time in a similar situation. 88 89Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Aggression and Violence The possibility that the person with a mental health disorder may become violent should not be ignored or minimized. Violent behavior for the person with a mental health disorder is the result of impaired thinking and judgment or strange and bizarre beliefs that are caused by illness, disease, drugs, toxic chemicals or a severe medical problem. When there is Violence When there is violence, it is important to determine if there is immediate danger, because this will determine how you react and respond to the situation. In situations where there is immediate danger of violence, it is always appropriate to contact the police, sheriff's department or call 911 for immediate help. Follow the instructions given to you by law enforcement, particularly when there is a life threatening danger. If you are unable to call 911, ask somebody to call for you. Avoid being alone or in areas in which you could be surprised and could not easily escape. Eula Griffiths elevated to crisis when she started threatening to kill herself and others around her. What can you do to help de-escalate the situation?Crisis Resources If you need to call a mental health professional or the crisis team, remember to stay calm and: Give clear, objective examples of how the person's behavior or train of thought is seriously impacting his or her own safety or that of others. Give the person's diagnosis and a brief history of the build up to the crisis situation. Make sure to give a total picture of the person's mental health relapse. If the person has been hospitalized before and appears to need that level of care again, be certain to share this information. Example of a telephone call for the person who is having a dangerous train of thought: Unclear presentation I cannot get Jim to come into the house. He wants to be left alone. Jim likes sitting on the roof to scare me. I have tried to tell him to come into the house but he just yells at me to leave him alone. Clear presentation Jim is sitting on the roof and threatening to jump. Jim believes he can jump off the roof and not get hurt. Jim has been diagnosed with bipolar and his thoughts have been racing. When I try to speak to him, he becomes more agitated. I do not feel Jim is safe. Alice has schizophrenia. Alice is experiencing visual hallucinations. She tells you that she sees men entering her windows and she thinks they are going to hurt her. Alice appears frightened. You are afraid for her safety as she is so distraught. You decide that it is time to call the mental health crisis team. What will you say? 89Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Service Agency Location/Website Phone NumberCreate a crisis contact information and local resources chart for your area.90 91Washington State Department of Social & Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration Lesson Summary It is often difficult to predict when a crisis will happen. There may be triggers and signs that a crisis will occur, but a crisis can occur without warning. Our main goal is to be aware of what can cause a crisis (such as triggers, traumas), warning signs, strategies and each person as an individual and be aware of any indication that an individual may need help. A mental health crisis is a non-life threatening situation in which an individual is exhibiting extreme emotional disturbance or behavioral distress, considering harm to self or others, disoriented or out of touch with reality, has a compromised ability to function, or is otherwise agitated and unable to be calmed. There are things you can do before a situation becomes a crisis. Watch for early warning signs. Early identification that the person is decompensating is vitally important to get the person appropriate treatment. Without intervention, decompensation can lead to a relapse. Even with the best treatments and support, relapse can still occur. Sometimes, these symptoms come and go in cycles. Relapse may also occur without an apparent cause. When there is violence, it is important to determine if there is immediate danger, because this will determine how you react and respond to the situation. In situations where there is immediate danger of violence, it is always appropriate to contact the police, sheriff's department or call 911 for immediate help.
