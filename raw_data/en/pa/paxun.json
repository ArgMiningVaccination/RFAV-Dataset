INTRODUCTION The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act) is a consumer protection law that aims to foster campus safety by providing transparency in relation to campus crime policy and statistics. Michigan State University (MSU) has worked carefully to ensure its Annual Security & Fire Safety Report is comprehensive and accurate. As the global pandemic associated with the novel coronavirus continues to evolve internationally and domestically, MSU continues to strive to provide great services to its community members, though there may be some adjustments to the delivery method of resources on campus. Please review resource- specific websites for virtual service options and also explore our Together We Will website for additional details and updated information at https://msu.edu/together- we-will/. MSU continues its efforts to provide a safe environment where all community members feel protected, empowered, and aware of their rights and knowledgeable about available resources. Institutions should have adequate policies and programs to prevent crimes and to respond to crime reports and emergencies. MSU is committed to doing just that and works to enhance safety in part by thoroughly tracking crimes. This report meets required data compliance and disclosure obligations and discusses how MSU is creating a safer and healthier campus. The Clery Act requires colleges and universities participating in federal financial aid programs to maintain and disclose cri me and security information. The Clery Act requires institutions to count crimes in the calendar year in which they were reported\u2014regardless of the year in which the incident occurred. For that reason, MSU's 2018 sexual assault statistics show a dramatic increase because they capture incidents associated with Larry Nassar's crimes that occurred over many years. Prevention and Education MSU recognizes all of its community members play an important part in preventing and reporting sexual assault and relationshi p viole nce. To accomplish that goal, MSU has intensified its training of students and employees in the prevention, detection and reporting of crime. In addition to online training, MSU conducts mandatory, in- person RVSM prevention programming for all first-year a nd transfer students, and in-person bystander intervention training for all second-year students. In 2018, MSU created the Prevention, Outreach, and Education Department (POE) , which promotes campus safety by educating students and employees on sexual assault and relationship violence, eliminating violence on campus, empowering community members to become advocates for a non- violent community, and positively affecting cultural change. POE includes several full -time preve ntion specialists, a director, associate director, and over 100 peer educators who partner with units on campus to deliver educational programming and training. POE has expanded the availability and variety of training programs, allowing POE to tailor training content to address the specific needs of particular groups. Through training and prevention programs, MSU is committed to building a safer campus. To learn more about how MSU is cultivating a campus community that effectively fights discrimination, se xual harassment and assault, visit www.civilrights.msu.edu and https://msu.edu/ourcommitment/ . 4 | Page THE CAMPUS MSU, a pioneer land- grant institution, was founded in 1855. The East Lansing campus is part of a metropolitan area with a total population of approximately 477,000. The curriculum includes more than 200 programs of undergraduate and graduate studies in 17 degree -granting colleges taught by approximately 5,761 faculty and academic staff and 1, 267 graduate assistants. Approximately 7,273 nonacademic employees support the instructional, research and public service activities of the University. For the 2020 fall semester, 49, 695 students were enrolled: 38,491 undergraduates (19,760 women and 18,731 men), 8,107 graduate students, and 3,097 students in professional programs. The property holdings of MSU at East Lansing total approximately 5,200 acres. Of this total, 2,100 acres are in existing or planned campus development; the remaining acres are devoted to experimental farms, outlying research facilities, and more than 700 ac res of protected natural areas. There are 566 structures on the contiguous campus, 27 miles of University -owned two- lane equivalent roadways, and 114 miles of sidewalks. MSU also maintains academic programs in Grand Rapids, Detroit, Macomb, and Troy, Michi gan. Compliance with the Clery Act requires that the University consider these locations separate campuses from the main campus in East Lansing for reporting purposes 1. At the Grand Rapids campus, the MSU College of Human Medi cine maintains academic, research, and administrative facilities, including headquarters at the Secchia Center, leased space the Cook -DeVos Center for Health Sciences, and the Grand Rapids Research Center. The Secchia Center is an eight-story, 180,000-squa re-foot facility that includes clinical teaching examination rooms, simulation suites, classrooms, offices, and student areas. It is located in downtown Grand Rapids at Michigan Street and Division Avenue. The MSU Eli Broad College of Business offers an Executive MBA program at the Management Education Center in Troy, Michigan. The MSU Management Education Center is a 20 - acre site that is located on the corner of Crooks Road and Square Lake Road in Troy. The 30,000-square- foot building operates as a full -service conference center and educational facility with classrooms, offices, amphitheaters, and auditorium. This location offers business professionals the opportunity to earn a MBA in an intense, compressed 19-month accredited program that is nationally recognized. The MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine has two campuses separate from the East Lansing campus \u2014one in Macomb Township and the other in Detroit. The Detroit campus is located on the campus of the Detroit Medical Center (DMC) in \"Midtown\" Detroit and is surrounded by several tertiary care hospitals and The Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Center. The DMC has over 900 graduate medical education positions, of which 118 are oste opathic. In partnership with the College of Osteopathic Medicine, the College of Nursing also offers its Accelerated Second Degree BSN program to student cohorts enrolled at the DMC site. The Macomb campus is located on the campus of Macomb Community Colle ge, 44575 Garfield Road, Clinton Township. The campus consists of classroom, laboratory, and office facilities in the Macomb Community College University Center, which are leased by MSU. While the educational program of the MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine is geared primarily to the training of primary medicine physicians, the curriculum and educational programs are also designed to meet the continuing need for medical specialists and teacher-investigators. The policies and procedures presented in this annual report are applicable to all MSU locations. To the extent any differences exist in the manner the policies and procedures are implemented at the Grand Rapids, Troy, Detroit, or Macomb, campuses, they are noted accordingly in this report. 1 The 2020 U.S. Department of Education Clery Act Appendix for Federal Student Aid Handbook states , \"if an additional location, branch campus, school within the institution, or an administrative location is not within a reasonably contiguous area, such location would be considered a separate campus for reporting purposes \". 5 | Page CRIM E INFORMATION AND STATISTICS At Michigan State University (MSU), we take safety very seriously. Each member of the campus community\u2014students, faculty, and staff \u2014should take an active role in preventing and reporting incidents that jeopardize safety on and around campus. Please review this information carefully. MSU, in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy & Campus Crime Statistics Act and the Higher Education Opportunity Act (Clery Act), publishes this document annually to provide its current students and employees and prospective students and employees with an overview of the University's security and safety resources, policies, and procedures. A hard copy of this document may be obtained by contacting Maja Myszkowski, Cler y Act Compliance Coordinator, at (517) 353- 2620 or email at clery@msu.edu. The University also reports the annual crime and fire statistics contained in this report to the U.S. Department of Education. A searchable database containing those statistics can be found at http://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/ . This report contains general information about the campus, police and public safety resources, reporting crimes, coordination between law enforcement agencies, fire and medical emergencies, crime and fire prevention, victim support services, the law and University policies, campus facilities, residence hall security, crime statistics, fire statistics, the crime and fire log, the University's Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX Policy, and the MSU Drug and Alcohol Policy. It also contains information about alcohol and other drug health risks, drug and alcohol laws and penalties, and campus alcohol and other drug education and counseling resources. Campus crime statistics included in this report are gathered from a variety of sources, including campus and local law enforcement agencies and other individuals referred to as Campus Security Authorities (CSA s) 2. The MSU Clery Act Compliance Coordinator prepares the report. Their contact information is: Maja Myszkowski Clery Act Compliance Coordinator Office of Audit, Risk and Compliance Hannah Administration Building 426 Auditorium Road, Suite 10 East Lansing, MI 48824 (517) 353-2620 clery@msu.edu The University established a Clery Compliance Committee in 2015, chaired by the Clery Act Compliance Coordinator, to enhance efficiency and coordin ation to provide an effective response to Clery Act obligations, including the drafting of this report. This committee is made up of representatives from: Student Affairs & Services, Dean of Students Office, Office for Civil Rights and Title IX Education a nd Compliance, Office of Institutional Equity, Office of the General Counsel, Athletics, International Studies and Programs, Residence Education and Housing Services, MSU Police and Public Safety , Student Health Services, Provost's Office, Human Resources, Land Management, New Student Orientation, Risk Management, Continuing Education, University Advancement, Sports Medicine, Youth Programs, Infrastructure Planning and Facilities, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Health Care, and Office of Audit, Risk and Compliance. The committee receives annual training and meets to ensure compliance is cohesive and coordinated. Specifically, the committee reviews policies and procedures related to the Clery Act, the Annual Security and Fire Safety report drafts, and discusses ways to improve these various components of Clery Act compliance. A steering committee comprising representatives from Residential Education and Housing Services, Dean of Students Office, MSU Police and Public Safety, and Office of General Counsel mee ts monthly with the Clery Act Compliance Coordinator to discuss specific Clery -related issues. The Land Management Office and the Clery Act Compliance Coordinator also meet monthly as a part of the Clery geography sub- committee. Criminal statistics are reported by MSU Police and Public Safety to the Michigan State Police for transmittal to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The information is published in the annual publications Crime in Michigan and Crime in the United States, available at all public libraries and most law enforcement agencies in the United States. Information may also be obtained at the following web sites: FBI Uniform Crime Reporting ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/ ) Michigan State Police Incident Crime Reporting (https://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,4643,7-123- 72297_24055-556722--,00.html ), and U.S. Department of Education Campus Safety and Security Analysis ( https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/ ). Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act The Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act (CSCPA) is a federal law that provides for the tracking of convicted, registered sex offenders enrolled as students at institutions of higher education or working or volunteering on campus. 2 Campus Security Authorities (CSAs) are: (1) A campus police department or a campus security department of an institution. (2) Any individual or individuals who have responsibility for campus security but who do not constitute a campus police department or a campus security department (e.g., an individual who is responsible for monitoring the entrance into institutional property). (3) Any individual or organization specified in an institution's statement of campus security policy as an individual or organization to which st udents and employees should report criminal offenses. (4) An official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings. 6 | Page The CSCPA amends the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act to require sex offenders already required to register in a state to provide notice, as required under state law, to each institution of higher education in that state at which the person is employed, carries on a vocation, or is a student. It also mandates t hat state procedures ensure that this registration information is promptly made available to law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction where the institutions of higher education are located and that it is entered into appropriate state records or data sys tems. The Michigan State Police maintain a listing of all registered sex offenders in Michigan. This information is available online at: https://mspsor.com/ or through MSU Police and Public Safety . 7 | Page CHARTS OF CRIME STAT ISTICS This section includes five charts of crime statistics. The charts show the number of crimes reported to have occurred at MSU locations and reported in calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020. For purposes of complying with the Clery Act reporting requirements, the University must consider the following as separate campuses from the East Lansing campus: its College of Human Medicine location in Grand Rapids, its College of Osteopathic Medicine locations in Detroit and Macomb, and the MSU E li Broad College of Business location in Troy. Accordingly, each campus' statistics are reported separately in the charts that follow. This Report includes statistics on the following crimes: murder, non- negligent manslaughter, manslaughter by negligence, rape, fondling, incest, statutory rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, arson, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, arrests and disciplinary referrals for liquor law violations, drug law violations, and illegal weapons possession. This report also includes statistics on hate crimes. The list of crimes that must be reported as hate crimes include the aforementioned offenses, as well as crimes of larceny -theft, simple assault, intimidation, destruction, damage, or vandalism of property that was motivated by the offender's bias against race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, or disability. Liquor, Drug, and Weapons Reporting The charts provide statistics for all Clery -reportab le crimes separated by campus. This includes the number of arrests for liquor, drug, and weapons law violations at each campus. The charts also show the number of students and employees referred for campus disciplinary action for conduct that would constit ute both a liquor, drug, and/ or weapons law violation. Not all individuals referred for campus disciplinary action were found to have committed the rules violation with which they were charged. Per Department of Education guidance, if a person is arrested or referred for discipline for multiple violations during a single incident ( e.g., both drug and liquor), security officers should apply discretion regarding which arrest/referral to count. In effort of transparency and to discourage such violations, MSU chooses to count all relevant liquor, drug, and weapons arrests/referrals within the same incident. However, in accordance with the guidance, the only exception to this is that if an arrest is counted for a single event, disciplinary referrals are deduplicated and not counted. Statistics Gathering The information provided includes incidents reported to the MS U Police and Public Safety , other Campus Security Authorities ( CSAs ), and local law enforcement authorities with jurisdiction over each location. Not a ll local law enforcement agencies responded to the request for statistics. The statistics in each chart include all reported crimes, not just those crimes determined to have actually occurred. The reported crimes may have involved individuals not associate d with the University. Campus Security Authorities include, but are not limited to : faculty advisors to registered student organizations, resident assistants, coaches of Intercollegiate Athletics, Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Teams, Residence E ducation and Housing Services, Dean of Students Office, Assistant Director of Student Life - Greek Affairs, Assistant Director of Student Life - Student Government Advising, Assistant Director of Student Life - Student Activities, Director of Office for Education Abroad, Education Abroad Program Directors, Vice President for Student Affairs and Services, Secchia Center Security Manager, Associate Director of the Broad School Executive MBA Program at the MSU Management Education Center, Associate Dean, College of Osteopathic Medicine- Detroit, and Assistant Dean, College of Osteopathic Medicine- Macomb. Clery Geography Each chart provides information about the Clery Geography location where the alleged crime, arrest, or incident resulting in disciplinary action occurred. For purposes of all below charts, the following definitions apply as defined by the Clery Act and its implementing regulations: \"Total on Campus\" refers to all statistics compiled for the University campus. \"Campus Residential Facilities\" refers to all on campus University housing. This is a subset of \"Total on Campus.\" MSU provides student housing on the East Lansing campus. No on- campus student housing facilities are provided at any of its other separate campuses (in Grand R apids, Detroit, Macomb, or Troy). \"Non -campus Building or Property\" is defined as (1) any building or property owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the University; or (2) any building or property owned or controlled by the University that is used in direct support of or in relation to the University's educational purposes, is frequently used by students, and is not within the reasonably contiguous geographic area of the University. \"Public Property\" includes all public property (i.e., property owned or operated by a governmental entity other than MSU), including thoroughfares, streets, sidewalks, and parking facilities, that are within the campus or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. 8 | Page Michigan State University - East Lansing Crimes Reported - East Lansing3 Total On Campus (Includes CRF) Campus Residential Facilities (CRF) Non-campus Building or Property Public Property4 Year 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 Murder/Non -Negligent Manslaughter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Manslaughter by Negligence 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rape 43*\u00b1 29* 13* 24 14 1 146* 2* 1* 0 1 0 Incest 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Statutory rape 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Robbery 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 Aggravated Assault 23 9 7 6 3 1 1 1 2 0 2 1 Burglary 48 63 19 37 46 11 3 6 8 0 0 0 Motor Vehicle Theft5 47 35 21 0 0 0 10 11 7 0 2 0 Arson 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Domestic Violence 1 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 Dating Violence 18 19 9 9 14 7 0 0 0 1 0 1 Stalking 38 33 19 9 12 7 1 1 0 0 0 0 Liquor, Drug, and Weapons Law Violations - East Lansing Total On Campus (Includes CRF) Campus Residential Facilities (CRF) Non-campus Building or Property Public Property Year 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 Liquor Law Arrests 11 9 2 0 2 0 0 1 0 5 0 1 Liquor Law Disciplinary Referrals 836 739 151 836 734 151 2 2 0 0 0 0 Drug Law Arrests 35\u00b1 5 3 20\u00b1 2 0 3 0 0 24 12 4 Drug Law Disciplinary Referrals 459\u00b1 298 116 459\u00b1 278 116 0 0 0 0 0 0 Weapons Law Arrests 13 6 5 2 1 0 0 0 0 5 3 2 Weapons Law Disciplinary Referrals 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hate Crimes - East Lansing 2018: O ne on- campus incident of aggravated assault characterized by racial bias and one on -campus incident of intimidation characterized by racial bias. 2019: No hate crimes reported. 2020: No hate crimes reported. \u00b1 In conducting a reassessment of our crime statistics, we identified certain human errors and revis ed our crime statistics above accordingly. On October 7, 2020, the following adjustments were made: 2018: o On Campus Rape - one statistic removed. o On Campus and On Campus Residential Facilities Drug Law Arrest - two statistics added. o On Campus and On Campus Residential Facilities Drug Law Disciplinary Referral - two statistics added. *The University employed an individual as a physician who pled guilty to sexual assault of individuals based, in large part, on conduct that occurred under the guise of medical treatment. The individual, Larry Nassar, was terminated from his position at 3 The MSU Police and Public Safety unfounded seven crimes in 2020. These crimes were: two reported incidents of burglary, one reported incident of rape, and four reported incidents of motor vehicle theft. For each of the incidents, a law enforcement investigation de termined that the crime never occurred. The MSU Police and Public Safety unfounded five crimes in 2019. These crimes were: three reported incidents of burglary and two reported incidents of motor vehicle theft. MSU Police and Public Safety unfounded six crimes in 2018. These crimes were: three reported incidents of burglary and three reported incidents of motor vehicle theft. A crime is considered unfounded for Clery Act purposes only if sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel make a formal determination that the report is false or baseless and only if the evidence from a complete and thorough investigation establishes that the crime reported was not completed or attempted in any manner. 4 The East Lansing Police Department (ELPD) has informed MSU that it is unable to generate a report which fully disaggregates the Clery- defined public property surrounding MSU's East Lansing campus from other areas within the ELPD's patrol jurisdiction, specifically the sidewalks . Accordingly, MSU's East Lansing campus public property charts do not include Clery crime statistics from the ELPD for such crimes that occurred on sidewalks in front of private businesses immediately adjacent to campus unless such crimes were reported to have occurred on roadways. 5 Most of the motor vehicle thefts are thefts of moped vehicles. 9 | Page the University in 2016, sentenced in 2017 and 2018, and is serving a pri son sentence for his crimes. For more information, please see: https://msu.edu/ourcommitment/news/nassar -information.html . In 2020, 2 individuals made reports against Nassar of at least one incident of sexual assault that occurred on the University's on campus property or non-campus property (i.e., Nassar's medical office). It is challenging to identify the exact number of sexual assaults for Clery purposes, however, because some of these individuals treated with Nassar on numerous occasions (in some cases, many years ago) and could not recall with precision the number of appointments they attended or the type of conduct during any particular appointment. Because the University does not have any way to provide the total number of unique incidents reported related to Nassar, we have reported as follows. In 2020 , the numbers in the chart for rape and fondling in the on campus and non- campus property columns represent: 1. reports unrelated to Nassar: a. On campus: 12 reports of rape and 3 reports of fondling b. Non-campus: 0 reports of rape and 1 report of fondling 2. report s relating to Nassar in which the individual reporting could recall the number of incidents6: a. On campus: 1 report of rape and 0 reports of fondling b. Non-campus: 91 reports of rape and 0 reports of fondling 3. reports relating to N assar in which the individual reporting could not recall the number of incidents; therefore, the count is by number of individuals reporting, not number of incidents: a. On campus: 0 individuals reporting rape and 0 individuals reporting fondling b. Non-campus: 0 individuals reporting rape and 0 individuals reporting fondling Thus, the total number of on- campus reports of crimes related to Nassar are: 1 count of rape and 0 counts of fondling. The total number of non-campus property reports of crimes r elated to Nassar are: 91 counts of rape and 0 counts of fondling. Note that the Clery Act requires counting incidents of crime in the year reported, not the year in which the incident occurred. 6 When an individual provided an estimated number of incidents, the University counted based on a reasonable interpretation of the individual's report. For example, (a) if an individual reported \"a couple\" instances of rape, the University counted 2; (b) if an individual reported \"a few\" instances, the University counted 3; (c) if an individual reported \"a handful\" of instances, the University counted 5; (d) if an individual provided a range (i.e., 3 -5 instances), the University counted the higher end of the range ( i.e., the University counted 5); and (e) if an individual reported an instance of rape occurred \"once a week for a year,\" the University counted 52. 10 | Page MSU College of Human Medicine - Grand Rapids Crimes Reported - Grand Rapids7 Total On Campus (Includes CRF)8 Campus Residential Facilities (CRF)9 Non-campus Building or Property10 Public Property Year 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 Murder/Non -Negligent Manslaughter 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Manslaughter by Negligence 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rape 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fondling 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Incest 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Statutory rape 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Robbery 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Aggravated Assault 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Burglary 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Motor Vehicle Theft 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Arson 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Domestic Violence 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dating Violence 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Stalking 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 1 0 0 0 0 L iquor, Drug, and Weapons Law Violations - Grand Rapids Total On Campus (Includes CRF) Campus Residential Facilities (CRF) Non-campus Building or Property Public Property Year 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 2018 2019 2020 Liquor Law Arrests 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Liquor Law Disciplinary Referrals 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Drug Law Arrests 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Drug Law Disciplinary Referrals 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Weapons Law Arrests 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Weapons Law Disciplinary Referrals 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hate Crimes - Grand Rapids 2018: No hate crimes reported. 2019: No hate crimes reported. 2020: No hate crimes reported. 7 Law enforcement agencies did not report any unfounded crimes in 2018, 2019, or 2020. 8 The \"on-campus\" category consists of the MSU College of Human Medicine location at the Secchia Center, 15 Michigan Street NE.

It currently has 114 full -time employees; 75 are positions for police officers. Pursuant to Michigan Public Act 120 of 1990 and MSU Ordinances 4.0 and 5.0, the MSU Police and Public Safety has law enforcement aut hority and jurisdiction over all property owned and governed by the MSU Board of Trustees. The duties of MSU Police and Public Safety employees include providing law enforcement and public safety services, which include patrol, criminal investigations, special victim investigations and support, community outreach and engagement, emergency management, fire safety, parking services, special event management, and access control. MSU Police and Public Safety maintains a cooperative relationship with other local, county, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. This cooperation includes multi - jurisdictional investigations of alleged crimes, special events coordination, shared disaster exercises, and joint training programs. An Ingham County Mutual Police Assi stance Agreement among MSU, the County of Ingham, the Cities of Lansing, East Lansing, Williamston, Leslie, and Mason, the Village of Stockbridge, Lansing Charter Township, and the Charter Township of Meridian permits the respective parties' police officer s to provide supplemental police protection to each other in the event of an emergent or special police need of a magnitude beyond the capabilities of a single police department. Described below are a few of the MSU Police and Public Safety bureaus and the ir associated divisions. Police Services Bureau The Police Services Bureau includes Patrol Division officers who are available to respond to emergency and non- emergency incidents 24- hours a day, every day of the year. Police officers are highly trained and receive ongoing education and development to respond to any situation they may encounter by focusing on the quality of the interaction to achieve the best outcome possible. Detectives with the Investigative Division investigate all crimes that occur on campus and attend numerous training sessions to remain current with best practices for law enforcement investigation. Specialized detectives are assigned to the Digital Forensics and Cyber Crime Unit and conduct digital forensic investigations and examinations involving computers, mobile devices, digital media, servers, networks, internet service providers, and cyber enabled crimes. The Special Operations Division has the responsibility for planning and coordinating safety and security for all events that occur on campus. A team of dual -purpose explosive canines and vapor wake canines and their handlers assist with this effort of providing enhanced security for events. The Emergency Management Division provides the MSU community with emergency management and fire code inspection services. In 2017, MSU became the fifth higher education institution in the nation to become accredited in emergency management planning. Within the Emergency Management Division, the MSU Police Fire Safety Unit oversees regulations intended to protect life and property from a fire through fire safety inspections, code compliance , and training. Emergency Management is responsible for all of the University's plans for disaster response, including the Emergency Operations Plan. That plan provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for directing resources before, during, and after campus emergencies and disasters. The Division is very proactive in training and exercising all police officers and the community for emergency prevention, mitigat ion, preparedness, response, and recovery. Training and exercising include preparing first responders, University units, and coordinating with units of the local, state, and federal government. Community Engagement Bureau The Community Engagement Bureau focuses on quality interactions and building trust with the MSU community. This proactive approach allows the Community Engagement Bureau to collaborate with the MSU community to focus on outreach and crime reduction. Furthermore, officers assigned to the Community Engagement Bureau strive to reduce crime in their areas by conducting sexual assault and personal safety presentations aimed at risk avoidance and crime prevention. Members are also responsible for coordinating programming for the University community on the topic of recognizing and preventing violence in the community and active violence incident response. Programming may be requested at any time by filling out the form located here:http://police.msu.edu/contact/requests/ . Officers from the Community Engagement Bureau also speak at every New Student and Parent Orientation Program, where information about personal and property safety, crime awareness, emergency alert procedures, and public safety resources are discussed. This safety information is also available to students via the MSU Police and Public Safety's web page at http://www.police.msu.edu/ . Community Support Bureau The Community Support Bureau includes the Special Victims Unit (SVU), Center for Trauma -Informed Investigative Excellence, and the Community Care Unit, and provides trauma -informed, inclusive , and accessible service to MSU students, staff, faculty, and visitors. 15 | Page The Special Victims Unit (SVU) is committed to ensuring that all survivors are treated with courtesy, sensitivity, dignity, understanding, and professionalism. The SVU investigates sex crimes, relationship violence, stalking and harassment, child abuse, vulnerable adult abuse, and missing persons. The detectives and officers assigned to the Special Victims Unit have received specialized training to investigate cases using trauma -informed, victim -centered , and offender -focused practices while recognizing intersectional identities within RVSM incidents to provide support and resources that are inclusive and accessible. SVU detectives and officers collaborate with campus and community partners to minimize additional trauma to survivors. The Center for Trauma- Informed Inve stigative Excellence (Center) was established in 2018 to provide training to law enforcement and other professionals on trauma -informed investigations to assist survivors of sexual misconduct, relationship violence, stalking, harassment and child abuse. The Center uses a multi -disciplinary approach to teach first responders, clinicians, support agencies, prosecutors and others to understand the impact of trauma. Professionals can provide an experience that supports healing and recovery with less chance of r e-traumatizing the survivor. The Community Care Unit is comprised of detectives and officers who respond to reports of students, employees, or others on campus who have engaged in behavior indicating a possible threat of harm to self or other members of the community, or who need personal mental health or behavioral health resources. Members of the Community Care Unit also serve on the MSU Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) and the MSU Behavioral Threat Assessment Team (BTAT). Emergencies on Campus Emergency Response and Evacuation Procedures The University is dedicated to providing a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff, visitors, and guests. The MSU Police and Public Safety maintains comprehensive information about the Unive rsity's emergency management resources, including active violence situations, on its website at http://www.police.msu.edu/ . All members of the MSU community are notified on an annual basis that they are encouraged to report to MSU Police and Public Safety any situation or incident on campus that involves a significant emergency or dangerous situation that may pose an immediate or ongoing threat to the health or safety of students and/or employees on campus. MSU Pol ice and Public Safety is responsible for responding to, and summoning the necessary resources to notify the community, mitigate, investigate, and document any event that may cause a significant emergency or dangerous situation. Individuals at all MSU campuses are advised to report emergency or dangerous situations to the local police department. MSU Police and Public Safety has established the Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) , which describes the University's emergency management organization, policies, and response guidelines for the campus. The EOP is based on the National Incident Management System and National Response Framework. The plan sets forth a systematic approach for managing emergencies or dangerous situations that threaten the health and safety of the campus community or disrupt its programs or activities. In addition, MSU Police and Public Safety have established other plans to support managing emergencies that in clude: a Disaster Recovery Plan, Continuity of Government Plan and various Continuity of Operations plans for key units that perform an emergency support function. The MSU Vice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police , or designee, serves as the University's Emergency Management Coordinator and is responsible for directing the emergency management efforts. The EOP identifies other departments, units, and individuals responsible for providing emergency response or critical support services and describes their respective roles and responsibilities. The EOP and associated plans describe the process MSU Police and Public Safety uses to confirm that there is a significant emergency or dangerous situation. The Emergency Management Coordinator assesses the d anger and potential threat the event may pose to the safety of the campus community and determines the appropriate course of action in light of the specific circumstances. The University has Emergency Action Teams and plans for each building on campus. Each team receives extensive training on how to implement protective measures \u2014including evacuation, seeking shelter, and/or securing- in-place plans \u2014 for its building. Evacuation, seeking shelter, and securing- in- place plans and procedures are available at www.police.msu.edu . Testing of Emergency and Evacuation Procedures Evacuation and seeking shelter drills and exercises are conducted annually in academic buildings. Secure- in-place plans are demonstrated and discuss ed in all training sessions for Emergency Action Teams and drills to test those plans are offered to building occupants. Beginning in 2017, MSU Police and Public Safety Emergency Management Division personnel developed and deliver a specialized drill instr ucting persons how to properly secure -in-place for an active violence incident. The residence halls conduct a minimum of two evacuation and sheltering drills between the months of August and April each academic year and conduct a minimum of one during the summer semester. Drills can be either announced or unannounced. The purpose of evacuation, seeking shelter, and securing- in- place drills is to prepare building occupants for an organized response in case of an emergency. During each drill, 16 | Page occupants practice drill procedures and familiarize themselves with the location of emergency exits, safe space to secure within , and the sound of alarms. This process also provides the University an opportunity to test the operation of fire and life safety system components in the buildings. The MSU Police and Public Safety Emergency Management Division conducts follow- through activities designed for assessment and evaluation of emergency evacuation, seeking shelter, and securing -in-place plans and capabilities. The MSU Police and Public Safety Emergency Management Division maintains records of drills, documenting the date, time, and description of the exercise, as well as whether it was announced or unannounced. These records are availab le by request. The mass notification system, Everbridge, is tested three times per year: at the beginning of Fall Semester, at the beginning of Spring Semester, and again during National Severe Weather Awareness Week in March. The messaging includes a \"blast\" e -mail and a text message with links to additional information. Evacuation alarms are tested in all non - residential facilities annually. All buildings that have not had an actual evacuation occur in the previous year are tested. In addition, all reside ntial facilities are required to test evacuation procedures for those facilities annually. That occurs within the first week of the fall semester and again during the spring semester. Missing Student Notification Policy In compliance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act, the University has established a Missing Student Notification Policy that describes the formal notification procedures to be followed when a student residing in on- campus housing has been reported missing for more than 24 hours. The Missing Student Notification Policy is available at https://reg.msu.edu/read/pdf/MissingStudentPolicy.pdf . At the time of registration, all students are requested to provide the Office of the Registrar with the name and contact information of a personal emergency contact person(s). This information is maintained in a Personal Emergency Contact System and is designated as confidential. Only authorized campus officials, including designees of the Director of Residence Education and Housing Services and officers in MSU Police and Public Safety , are provided this information in furtherance of the missing student investigation. The University encourages all students to provide personal emergen cy contact information. Incidents of missing students at the University should be reported immediately to MSU Police and Public Safety at (517) 355-2221. Upon receipt of a report of a missing student who resides in on- campus housing, MSU Police and Public Safety contact the Director of Residence Education and Housing Services (or designee) and initiate an investigation. If MSU Police and Public Safety determine s that a student has been missing for more than 24 hours and has not returned to campus, MSU Polic e and Public Safety will contact, within 24 hours of the official determination, the person(s) the student designated in the Personal Emergency Contact System. If the missing student is under 18 years of age and not emancipated, the student's custodial parent or legal guardian is also contacted. Information that a student has been determined to be missing will be forwarded to other local law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction in the area. MSU Police and Public Safety actively investigates all reports of students missing from campus. The investigation is conducted pursuant to existing law and established policies and procedures of MSU Police and Public Safety . Behavioral Threat Assessment And Intervention Teams The Un iversity has a collaborative multi- disciplinary team that provides a coordinated response to reports of students, employees, or others on campus who have engaged in behavior indicating a possible threat of harm to self or other members of the community. The Behavioral Threat Assessment Team (BTAT) meets regularly to assess the likelihood of risk and identify action that can be taken to potentially mitigate the risk. It is composed of representatives of the following offices: MSU Police and Public Safety , Counseling and Psychiatric Services, University Physician, Student Health Services, Student Affairs and Services, Residence Education and Housing Services, ADA Coordinator, Dean of Students Office, Dean of Graduate School / Dean of Undergraduate Education, and Human Resources. BTAT's website, http://btat.msu.edu includes an online referral form by which any member of the MSU community can refer an issue of concern to the team for review. Behaviors that do not rise to the le vel of threat are referred to the Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT ). BIT is a multidisciplinary team whose purpose is to identify students in distress and to provide them with coordinated early interventions, resources and wrap- around care. Reporting Crimes, Fires, Medical or Other Emergencies If you are a victim of a crime , a witness to a crime, or need to report a fire, medical, or other emergency, on or off - campus at any of MSU s campuses, DIAL 911. MSU community members who become aware of criminal activity that represents a threat to students, employees, or campus visitors should report the criminal activity to the MSU Police and Public Safety immediately so that the University may issue a warning to the campus community. MSU encourages individuals to report all crimes in an accurate and timely manner to both MSU Police and Public Safety and local law enforcement agencies when the victim of a crime elects to, or is unable to, make a report. In a non- emergency situation, you should report suspicious people or activities, traffic accidents, or potential violations of 17 | Page law to the police agency serving the location where the activity occurs.

Crimes committed by MSU students may also be violations of University regulations governing student conduct and may be reported to the Dean of Students Office at (517) 884-0789. To make it as convenient as possible for students, employees, and guests to report criminal incidents or other emergencies, the University has an enhanced 911 system for all campus telephones. This system displays the caller's number a nd location to the police dispatcher. In addition, over 170 \"Green Light\" emergency telephones are located throughout the East Lansing campus as well as over 400 emergency phones within the residence hall wings. These telephones ring directly to the Ingham County 911 dispatch center. In addition to providing voice contact, these devices pinpoint the location of the call. The University does not have a voluntary, confidential reporting system specifically for reporting crimes for inclusion in the annual security report. Therefore, there is no formal procedure for pastoral and professional counselors to inform the persons they are counseling of procedures to report crimes on a voluntary, confidential basis for inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics. Nonetheless, individuals can report known or suspected misconduct 24/7 on MSU's Misconduct Hotline at https://misconduct.msu.edu/ or by calling (800) 763-0764. Off-Campus Crime and Coordination with Other Law Enforcement Agencies The University does not formally monitor or record criminal activity by students at off-campus locations. MSU Police and Public Safety has Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with neighboring police departments. The MOUs accomplish a number of things including building on the previous collaborations to provide services to, in particular, victims of sexual assault and relationship violence. The MOUs memorialize the ongoing practice of agreeing to share information with MSU Po lice and Public Safety about crimes that may pose a serious threat to the health and safety of the MSU campus community in order to facilitate the issuance of timely warnings and emergency notifications. MSU Police and Public Safety monitors local, state, national, and international concerns that may affect the campus. MSU Police and Public Safety has a detective assigned to work with the FBI as a member of the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and they work closely with the Michigan Intelligence Operations (Fusi on) Center in obtaining timely intelligence. MSU Police and Public Safety also ha s one detective assigned to the FBI Cyber Crime Task Force who also works on intelligence related to cyber and technology threats. In cases of misconduct and criminal acts in East Lansing, victims are urged to contact the East Lansing Police or other community agencies to help resolve disputes. 18 | Page Communication about Campus Crimes and Safety In the event of an emergency that poses an immediate threat to the safety of the MSU campus, MSU Police and Public Safety is responsible for developing and distributing emergency messages to alert the community. Distributed through the MSU Alert system, em ergency messages inform individuals about incidents and provide direction and information to prevent similar crimes and promote safety. To add additional communication methods to your MSU Alert preferences, visit http://alert.msu.edu . The University has a variety of ways of disseminating emergency information to the community if a threat or emergency occurs. The notification systems include public media, the MSU website, desktop alerting software, building evacuation alarms, CodeBlue speaker systems, police vehicle public address, and mass calling and notification through the MSU Alert system (utilizing phone, email, text, social media, RSS feed, desktop, and outdoor speaker/siren messaging). Employees and students autom atically receive the messages through their university email and cell phone information on file. Visitors may receive MSU Alert notifications by subscribing to the MSU Police and Public Safety NIXLE Channel by texting MSUALERT to 888777 (message and data rates may apply ). Timely Warnings The MSU Vice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police or designee is responsible for determining whether criminal activity reported to MSU Police and Public Safety or other campus security authorities warrants the issuance of a timely warning to the campus community. When MSU Police and Publi c Safety determines that there may be a serious or continuing threat to the health or safety of on- campus students, employees, or visitors, based on a Clery -reportable crime it will provide a timely warning campus -wide in a manner that is intended to enable campus community members to protect themselves and aid in the prevention of similar crimes. Timely warnings are issued only in the event that a Clery- reportable crime occurs on the University's \"Clery geography.\" The particular method of communication by which the timely warning is provided may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the crime and the potential threat to safety. Timely warnings can be issued by e -mail, phone, or text message sent to students, faculty, and staff informing them of the crime. Alerts may also be posted to Facebook or Twitter. An announcement of the crime may be posted on the MSU Police and Public Safety website at www.police.msu.edu . The University may also make formal press releases to various media outlets in the surrounding area. Depending on the incident, particularly in situations that pose an immediate threat to the community, MSU Police and Public Safety will coordinate with the University Communications Office to post a notice on the MSU website at www.msu.edu. Emergency Notifications Emergency Notifications are issued when the Vice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police or designee has confirmed a significant emergency or dangerous situation (e.g., tornado/severe weather warning, chemical spill, fire, active violence, natural gas leak, or terrorist incident) is currently occurring on or imminently threatening the campus. MSU will, without delay, and taking into account the safety of the community , determine the content of the notification and initiate an alert via the notification system, unless issuing a notification will, in the professional judgment of responsible authorities, compromise efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency. The MSU Vice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police or designee evaluates information available on a case-by- case basis and determines whether an emergency notification is necessary. The Chief or designee determines who will receive the notification based on the location and type of emergency. The entire campus community may be notified where there is the potential that a large segment of the community will be affected. M SU Police and Public Safety determine s the content of the notification based on what information is available and relevant to ensure the safety of the campus community. MSU Police and Public Safety will continue to assess the situation and notify additional segments of the community, if necessary. MSU Police and Public Safety initiate the emergency notification system using text message, email, social media, MSU websi te, desktop alerting, sirens/speakers, and/or telephone. MSU Police Sergeants, Lieutenants, Captains, Deputy Chiefs, Assistant Chief, the Chief of Police, and the trained Professional Emergency Managers are responsible for carrying out these procedures. This warning is different from a Timely Warning because it is not limited to Clery crimes or Clery geography and it may target certain segments of campus. Public Safety Notices Public Safety Notices are issued when neither a Timely Warning nor an Emergency Notification is warranted, but MSU Police and Public Safety nevertheless believes that it has important public safety information that should be made available to the campus community. Examples of instances when a Public Safety Notice could be issued include providing general crime prevention information, a request for public assistance in solving a crime, or distributing specific safety information in a situation that does not reach the threshold for a Timely Warning or an Emergency Notification. Clery Crime and Fire Log MSU Police and Public Safety maintains a daily log of crimes and fires that occur on campus. The log is accessible to the public and can be accessed at: http://police.msu.e du/resources/clery -crime -fire-log/ . It contains the most recent 60 days' worth of reports of crimes and fires. Each incident is posted within two business days of the report. Each entry in the log contains the nature, date, time, 19 | Page and general location of each crime and the disposition of the complaint, if known. Any portion of the log that is older than 60 days can be made available within two business days of a request for public inspection. Programming Programs regarding security procedures and practi ces are provided at least 24 times a year at student orientation in order to reach all new students before classes begin. These programs also encourage the campus community to look out for themselves and one another. The program provides students with instructions on the Spartan ID card used to enter residence halls and other secured areas, locking their door when they leave their rooms, using \"Green Light\" emergency phones located around campus, and calling 911 for emergencies. A 1-2-hour training session is conducted annually with facility representatives, known as Emergency Action Team Leaders, who assist faculty, staff, students, and patrons in the event of a campus security emergency, such as a person actively shooting, suspicious persons, securing a building from theft, etc. Each session has between 50- 75 representatives in attendance and the sessions are conducted 8-10 times during the summer months. MSU Police and Public Safety conducts direct delivery \"Active Violence Training\" programs with faculty, staff and students upon request. These programs are offered to departments as needed throughout the academic year and during summer break. Crime Prevention programs are provided for both students and employees through MSU Police and Public Safety's Commun ity Policing initiative. Community Police Officers, with offices located strategically throughout campus, provide tailored programming as needed. These trainings are conducted in- person and include information on securing belongings and personal property, locking doors, reporting suspicious persons or activity, the \"See Something, Say Something\" campaign, MSU Police and Public Safety 's anonymous texting tip line, personal safety for moving around campus, and instruction on reviewing online crime logs. A va riety of community programs are aimed at bringing awareness of issues to the community and offering training. These programs include information on active violence incidents, alcohol and drug issues, car seat inspections and installations, canine demonstra tions, and safety and security surveys of campus work areas. MSU Police and Public Safety partners with the Michigan Office of Highway Safety and Planning to promote seatbelt usage and to reduce and eliminate incidents of driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs. MSU Police and Public Safety has also conducted responsible awareness campaigns regarding safety and alcohol and drug use during holidays and celebrations. Safety and Security: Campus Facilities University facilities are well maintained, and their security is given regular attention. Many cultural and athletic events held in University facilities are open to the public. Other facilities, such as the bookstore, library, and residence hall convenience stores, are also open to the public. Access to academic and administrative facilities on campus is generally limited to students, employees, and visitors who are present to conduct University business. Administrative buildings are generally open from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and academic buildings are generally open from 7:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m. Academic buildings are scheduled to be open on weekends only as needed. Building access hours are posted on each facility. Access to individual classrooms, laboratories, and program s is limited to those enrolled. Access to University residence hall and apartment living areas is limited to residents and their invited guests. Landscaping and outside lighting on campus is designed for pedestrian safety and security. Sidewalks are designed to provide well -traveled, lighted routes from parking areas to buildings and from building to building. Landscape personnel trim shrubs from sidewalks, walkways, and building entrances to enhance lighting and visibility. Campus walkways are inspected regularly to ensure adequate lighting and replacement of burned- out lights. The \"Green Light\" Emergency Telephone System follows major walkways. Maps showing the walkways and emergency telephones are available at https://maps.msu.edu/ or by contacting MSU Police and Public Safety at 1120 Red Cedar Road, East Lansing, Michigan 48824 or by calling (517) 355-2221. Safety and Security: Residence Halls All living areas in the residence halls are locked and can only be accessed by residents using their MSU identification card. Public spaces in residence halls and university apartments are locked by midnight each night. Residents entering after midnight must scan their MSU ID at designated doors through the us e of electronic key access. Guests must be escorted and must always be accompanied by a resident of the building. Each resident is limited to three guests per visit . Access protocols , including restrictions related to the COVID -19 pandemic, are outlined in the On - Campus Housing Handbook with which students agree to comply. At the start of each semester, a Safety Awareness Campaign titled Live On Live Safe is launched by Residence Education and Housing Services (REHS) Communications. Materials are posted in each lobby of the residence halls and apartments to remind students and guests of important safety reminders including but not limited to alcohol safety, being mindful of friends' behavior, remaining in groups when possible, locking their door, securing belongings, being aware of surroundings and reminders of whom to contact if help is needed. 20 | Page RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT MSU prohibits the crimes of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Under Michigan law, these crimes are defined as follows: Stalking is a willful course of conduct involving repeated or continuing harassment of another individual that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested and that actually causes the victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested. Domestic violence is defined as an assault or assault and battery of 1) a current or former spouse, 2) an individual with whom the assaila nt has or has had a dating relationship, 3) an individual with whom the assailant has had a child in common, or 4) a resident or former resident of the assailant's household. o \"Dating relationship\" means frequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affectional involvement. This term does not include a casual relationship or an ordinary fraternization between two individuals in a business or social context. o Dating Violence is a form of domestic violence under Michigan law. Michigan criminal laws regarding sexual assault are separated into four degrees of criminal sexual conduct. For each of those criminal offenses, the following definitions apply: o \"Sexual contact\" includes the intentional touching of the victim's or actor's intimate parts or the intentional touching of the clothing covering the immediate area of the victim's or actor's intimate parts, if that intentional touching can reasonably be construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, done for a sexual purpose, or in a sexual manner for: (i) revenge, (ii) to inflict humiliation, or (iii) out of anger. o \"Sexual penetration\" means sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or any other intrusion, however slight, of any part of a pe rson's body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of another person's body, but emission of semen is not required. Consent is not defined by Michigan law. MSU's Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX Policy defines consent as the \"voluntary, willful, and unambiguous agreement to engage in a specific sexual activity during a sexual encounter.\" The University encourages all witnesses of relationship violence or sexual misconduct to intervene when it is safe to do so. B ecoming an active bystander is to intervene , which may interrupt a situation that could violate someone's autonomy or safety. Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX Policy The MSU Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX (RVSM) Policy, which can be found at https://civilrights.msu.edu/policies/relationship -violence - and-sexual -misconduct- and-title-ix-policy.html , applies to all members of the University community \u2014faculty, staff, and students\u2014and applies to all types of relationship violence, sexual misconduct, and stalking.. The policy defines prohibited behavior and outlines procedures for submitting a complaint about sexual misconduct and relationship violence, including with whom to file a complaint. Specifically, the policy defines domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalk ing, sexual harassment, retaliation, and consent. The policy also covers privacy and confidentiality, complaint procedures, and provides resources. Offices providing information regarding relationship violence and sexual misconduct are listed in the policy . The MSU Office for Civil Rights and Title IX Education and Compliance, inclusive of the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) and the Resolution Office (RO), has primary responsibility for the enforcement of the RVSM Policy at MSU. More information regarding the Office for Civil Rights and Title IX , including prevention, support, response, investigations, and hearings may be found a t www.civilrights.msu.edu .

Survivors can contact MSU Center for Survivors, which provides advocacy, counseling, support groups, saf ety planning, referrals, and other information to survivors of adult sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, childhood sexual abuse and non-offending co-survivors. Services are available to students, faculty, staff and to non- affiliated members of surrounding communities. All services are free and confidential. MSU Center for Survivors notifies survivors of options to report to MSU OIE and MSU Police and Public Safety . Call MSU Center for Survivors at (517) 355-3551 during business hours, 24/7 crisis hotline is available at (517) 372-6666 or visit centerforsurvivors.msu.edu/ to use our crisis chat (7 days a week 10AM t o 10PM). Survivors are encouraged to consider getting immediate medical care for their health needs (such as possible injuries, pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or HIV) and evidence collection, even if they are unsure at the time whether to press charges. Evidence collection can be important for proof in a criminal or university investigation and may assist survivors in obtaining a protection order. If survivors wish to have 21 | Page evidence collected, it is suggested that they not shower, douche, urinate, brush their teeth, or change/discard their clothes until evidence can be collected by the by the MSU Sexual Assault Healthcare Program (SAHP) program , other Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner (SAFE/SANE) programs, and/or the police. Evidence can be collected up to 5 days post assault regardless of whether the survivor has showered, ate, or voided and can be stored for 10 years at SAHP. SAHP is a program that provides survivors with medical care by a registered nurse who is specially trained to c are for sexual assault patients. The se specially trained nurse s can conduct medical forensic examinations and can serve as expert witnesses in a court of law. If survivors wish to bring in evidence from the assault to SAHP, it is best to store it in a paper bag. Survivors can call SAHP to speak with a sexual assault nurse at (517) 353-2700. SAHP is staffed and open 24/7. Survivors are encouraged to consider contacting the police. Even if a survivor does not know whether they want to make a criminal co mplaint, the police can still document the information and collect evidence. MSU Police and Public Safety encourages all survivors to file a report. University personnel can assist the survivor in notifying the authorities. For suspected drug-induced assaults, survivors who wish to document this should consider seeking medical attention at SAHP that includes urine drug testing as soon as possible. The presence of drugs in blood or urine is short-lived, sometimes as short as six hours.

MSU Police and Public Safety encourages all survivors to file a report. University personnel can assist a survivor to notify the authorities. Reporting Pursuant to the RVSM Policy, University employees (unless they are exempt from reporting) are required to make a report of relationship violence and/or sexual misconduct to the Office of Institutional Equity and to MSU Police and Public Safety . All individuals are encouraged to promptly report conduct to the University that may violate the RVSM Policy. In addition, all individuals are encouraged to report conduct that may also vi olate criminal law both to the University and to local law enforcement. These processes are not mutually exclusive, however. The reporting mechanisms for University students, employees, or third -party community members who seek to make a complaint or report of sexual misconduct or relationship violence are: Make a report to OIE 23; Contact MSU Police and Public Safety for assistance in filing a criminal complaint and preserving physical evidence; and/or Contact local law enforcement to file a criminal complaint if the conduct occurs off campus. Claimants 24 may pursue some or all of these s teps at the same time (e.g., one may simultaneously pursue an internal complaint and a criminal complaint). When talking to one of these offices, Claimants do not need to know whether they wish to request any particular course of action. Claimants do not need to know how to label what happened. Choosing to make a complaint and deciding how to proceed after making 23 OIE includes the Director of Intake and RVSM/Title IX Response and Investigations & Sr. Deputy Title IX Coordinator , Director of ADP Response and Investigations & Title VI Coordinator, and its investigators. The Associate Vice President & Title IX Coordinator, Office for Civil Rights and Title IX Education and Compliance, oversees OIE. 24 An individual who may have been subjected to prohibited conduct regardless of whether that person makes a report is referred to as a \"Claimant\" and an individual against whom a complaint is filed is referred as a \"Respondent.\" 22 | Page the complaint can be a process that unfolds over time. Before or during this decision- making process, Claimants are encouraged to seek support and information from a confidential resource. Persons who have experienced (or are currently experiencing) relationship violence, stalking, or sexual misconduct may choose not to engage in a formal process . The MSU Center for Survivors and MSU Safe Place provide an array of confidential services specifically for survivors. In addition, the University Ombudsperson, MSU Counseling and Psychiatric Services, and the MSU Employee Assistance Program offices are also confidential spaces where any University community members may explore options and additional resources . Campus authorities can provide resources to survivors or notify law enforcement if the survivor so chooses. Reporting Contact Information Anyone may make a report using any method (online, phone, email, in -person, etc.) .

Interim and supportive measures are those services,accommodations, and other forms of assistance the University puts in place after receiving notice of alleged relationship violence or sexual misconduct, but before any final outcomes (investigatory, disciplinary, or remedial) have been determined. Supportive Measures 25: The University offers non- disciplinary, non- punitive individualized services as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to a Claimant or a Respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been filed, and regardless of whether the Claimant chooses to speak with MSU Police and Public Safety or other law enforcement. Supportive measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to MSU's education programs or activities, including but not limited to protecting the safety of all parties or the University's educational or employment environment or to deter conduct prohibited under this policy. Supportive measures will not unreasonably burden the other party. Supportive measures may include referrals to resources ; extensions of deadlines or other course -related adjustments; modifications of work or class schedule s; mutual no contact directives; ASMSU Safe Ride services; changes in work or housing locations; leaves of absence; increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus; and other similar measures. To the extent possible, the University will not disclose the provision of supportive measures to a Claimant or Respondent unless necessary to provide the supportive measures. Emergency Removal of Students: The University may remove any student from its program or activity on an emergency basis if there is an immediate threat to the physical safety of any students or other individuals arising from allegations under the RVSM Policy. Prior to removal, the University must undertake an individualized safety and risk analysis, and, where such analysis determines a credible safety risk exists, provide the party with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal. Administrati ve Leave of Employees: The University may place non -student employees on administrative leave prior to or following the filing of formal complaint and through final resolution of the formal grievance process. More information regarding administrative leave of faculty and academic staff may be found at https://hr.msu.edu/policies- procedures/faculty -academic- staff/faculty -handbook/tenure_discipline_dismissal.html . For information regarding staff, please contact the MSU Office of Employee Relations. Other Interim Measures: Other interim measures may be available on a case-by- case basis. Any interim employment action will be taken consi stent with the University's rights as an employer. Orders of Protection and No -Contact The University may decide to issue a mutual, non-disciplinary \"no-contact directive\" as a supportive measure. For example, a no -contact directive may prohibit the Claimant and Respondent from having contact with one another. No-contact directives are issued on a case -by-case basis and are enforced at the University level. A Personal Protection Order (PPO) is different than a no- contact directive or another order issued by the University. A 25 Supportive measures may include requests regarding academic situations, living situations, transportation situations, working situations, and protective measures. 23 | Page PPO is issued by the state court system - not by the University. A PPO is an order that forbids an individual from doing something or requires an individual to do something. A PPO is enforced by the police. The Center for Survivors and Safe Place offer advocacy services, including assistance in obtaining a PPO.

The process will be prompt, fair, and impartial to the final result. The University has an obligation to determine what occurred and then to take appropriate steps to resolve the situation. In fulfilling these obligations, the University will respond to complaints, reports, or information about incidents of sexual misconduct and relationship violence to stop the prohibited conduct, eliminate any hostile environment, take steps to prevent the recurrence of the prohibited conduct, and address any effects on campus or at University -sponsored programs and activities off - campus. Trained professionals26 conduct investigations under the oversight of the Title IX Coordinator or their designee. Upon receipt of a report (verbal, in-person, electronic, in writing, or other means), OIE will conduct an initial as sessment to determine coverage under the policy. If after the submission of a report, a formal complaint is signed by a claimant or the Title IX Coordinator and the information in the formal complaint meets either the University RVSM coverage criteria and/or the Title IX coverage criteria, the University will follow the formal grievance process. A formal complaint may be dismissed for various reasons outlined in the policy, including if coverage requirements are not met, the claimant requests withdrawal, lack of affiliation with the university, or specific circumstances prevent gathering sufficient evidence. If a formal complaint meets both the University RVSM coverage and the Title IX coverage, Title IX regulations require that the formal grievance process include all of the procedural requirements specific to the Title IX regulations, as set forth in the Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX Policy. If jurisdiction under the policy is established, investigations typically include intervie ws of the Claimant, Respondent, and any witnesses. A review of evidence, such as electronic and written material, will be conducted if any such evidence is available. The University utilizes a preponderance of the evidence standard during the investigat ion process, as well as in all related proceedings, including disciplinary hearings. At the conclusion of the fact -finding portion of the investigation, both the Claimant and the Respondent will be provided with an opportunity to review all evidence that directly relates to the allegations and provide feedback to the information gathered. A hearing may take place, if the reported conduct falls within Title IX or if credibility is at issue and material to 26 Annual training is provided by the University and outside organizations that covers MSU's policies and grievance procedures; issues related to dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking; how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that protects the safety of the victims and promotes accountability; the role and duti es of the OIE office and the Title IX Coordinator; how to recognize and appropriately address incidents and complaints under Title IX, including where and with whom to report such inc idents; how to identify sex discrimination, sexual and gender -based haras sment, assault and violence; the University's responsibilities under Title IX to address such allegations; confidentiality requirements; information on the relevant resources available to victims; and trauma -informed investigation practices. 24 | Page the outcome, to allow for cross -examination of the ot her party and requested witnesses. The Resolution Officer conducts the hearing and will issue a written decision determining whether University policy was violated. If a hearing does not occur, the investigator will issue a final investigation report and make a determination whether University policy was violated. The University will use its best efforts to complete the fact -finding portion of investigations of relationship violence, stalking, or sexual misconduct within 90 calendar days, although this tim eframe may be extended for good cause. Throughout the process, Claimants and Respondents may have an advisor or support person of their choice present at any meeting related to Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX Policy. Appeals If a formal complaint is dismissed, claimant and respondent shall receive notice of the dismissal, including notation as to the reason for the dismissal and an explanation of their rights to appeal to the University Equity Review Officer or designee , within five (5) calendar days of the notice of dismissal. Claimants and Respondents may file a written appeal regarding the determination of responsibility with the University's Equity Review Officer within ten (10) calendar days from the date that a writ ten decision is issued on any of the following bases: 1. Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter; 2. New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could a ffect the outcome of the matter; 3. The Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision- maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against claimants or respondents generally or the individual claimant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; and/or 4. The written decision was arbitrary and capricious. If an appeal is filed regarding the determination of responsibility, the other part(ies) will have ten (10) calendar days to respond to the appeal in writing. The response may include a wr itten statement in support of, or challenging, the decision. The Equity Review Officer 27 will review the appeal and any response(s) and issue a written decision within eighteen (18) calendar days of receiving the appealdocuments, including any responses. The appeal decision will be issued simultaneously to all parties. Disciplinary Proceedi ngs Student If a student is found responsible for an RVSM Policy violation, the Director of the Resolution Office or designee will determine the appropriate sanction(s) after consultation with the decision -maker and consideration of the sanctioning factors. If either party (Claimant or Respondent) wishes to challenge the sanction(s), they may do so by submitting a written challenge to the Dean of Students Office within ten (10) calendar days after the determination of responsibility becomes final. The D ean of Students Office may modify a sanction if it determines that the sanction is clearly inappropriate or incommensurate with the seriousness of the conduct. MSU will, upon written request, disclose to the alleged victim of a crime of violence or a no n-forcible sex offense, the report on the results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by MSU against a student who is the alleged perpetrator of such crime or offense. If the alleged victim is deceased as a result of such crime or offense, the next of kin of such victim shall be treated as the alleged victim for this purpose. For more information about appeals and the student disciplinary system with respect to sexual misconduct and relationship violence at MSU, visit https://civilrights.msu.edu/policies/relationship -violence - and-sexual -misconduct- and-title-ix-policy.html . Employee If an employee is found responsible for violating the RVSM Policy, the sanction will be referred to the appropriate process for discipline or corrective action facilitated by the Office of Employee Relations, Academic Human Resources and/or unit leadership to determine the appropriate personnel action or other corrective measure. Remedies, sanctions, and discipline as to faculty, staff, and academic staff will be determined and implemented consistent with the University's rights as an employer and applicable collective bargaining agreements. Institutional discipline for a finding of responsibility may be informed by the nature and the gravity of the misconduct. Staff, academic staff, and faculty may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The following policies set forth options avai lable to employees at MSU to challenge sanctions imposed because of a finding of violation of the RVSM Policy. The policies include descriptions of the parties' right to advisors, right to information, timeframes, notifications, and other matters . Faculty and Academic Staff Grievance System For employees, appeals of the OIE or Resolution Officer decision are governed by the Appeal Procedures under the RVSM Policy. Appeals of sanctions are governed by the Faculty Grievance Policy for faculty and academic staff. A faculty member or an academic staff member who is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement may file a formal grievance against an administrator that alleges a violation of University, college, department, school, or unit policy or an establis hed practice. Thus, if a faculty or 27 The Equity R eview Officer is a neutral individual appointed by the Title IX Coordinator to adjudicate appeals under this process. 25 | Page academic staff member is disciplined under the RVSM Policy, they may file a grievance with the Faculty Grievance Officer claiming the disciplinary action violated a University, college, department, school or unit policy or established practice. For more information on the Faculty Grievance Policy and process (including appeal procedures), see: https://www.hr.msu.edu/policies- procedures/faculty MSU is a party to a number of collective bargaining agreements with unions covering MSU employees. Each collective bargaining agreement will govern how the employees subject to that agreement may challenge a disciplinary action: https://hr.msu.edu/contracts/index.html . Other MSU has a grievance system for non- union support staff. The policy specifics are contained in the Non- Union Regular Support Staff Grievance Procedure: https://hr.msu.edu/ua/discipline/support- staff/ . Possible Sanctions Student The MSU Student Rights and Responsibilities, Article 5, Section H, sets forth sanctions that may be issued in a non- academic disciplinary proceeding. These include: 1. Warning: An official written statement expressing disapproval of the behavior and notifying the student it must not occur again. 2. Probation: An official writ ten statement establishing a period of time for observing and evaluating a student's conduct and indicating that any additional violations may result in more severe disciplinary action. This period may be accompanied by stipulations, including but not limi ted to restitution, participation in an educational program, or loss of specified University privileges. 3. Restitution: A requirement that a student pay for property damages or losses resulting from acts committed by the student, with the date by which the restitution must be completed. 4. Change of residence: A requirement that a student move from his or her current on- campus residence, either to an off-campus location or to another location within the University housing system. 5.

Confidentiality/Privacy Investigations /Hearings /Supportive Measures - Confidentiality Reports and information gathered during the fact gathering and determination processes are kept private to the extent permitted by law, except insofar as information needs to be disclosed so that the University may effectively resolve the matter or take corrective action. To the extent possible, the University will not disclose the provision of supportive measures to a claimant or respondent unless necessary to provide the supportive measures. Public Reporting - Confidentiality The University has a number of public reporting obligations. Nevertheless, the University endeavors to protectconfidentiality to the extent permitted by law. For example, public reports and the Crime Log do not include any personally identifying information about a survivor. Additionally, MSU Police and Public Safety 's timely warnings and emergency notifications do not contain personally identifiable informatio n about the survivor. The Office for Civil Rights and Title IX (including OIE and RO), and MSU Police and Public Safety work with the University's FOIA Coordinator to appropriately identify and redact documents subject to public records requests in order t o remove personally identifying information not required to be shared pursuant to law or University policy. Interim and Supportive Measures - Confidentiality The University will maintain the privacy of any interim and supportive measures provided under this policy to the extent practicable and will promptly address any violation of the interim measures.

Awareness and Prevention MSU Police and Public Safety pursues crime reduction by conducting sexual assault and personal safety seminars aimed at risk avoidance and crime prevention. These seminars are regularly scheduled in the residence halls and may be requested by groups at any time by contacting MSU Police and Public Safety . MSU Police and Public Safety also publish and distribute personal safety awareness brochures that may be obtained by contacting the MSU Police and Public Safety , 1120 Red Cedar Road, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, or by calling (517) 355-2221. MSU Police and Public Safety officers speak at every Family Orientation Program. Information about personal and property safety, crime awareness, emergency procedures , and police resources is distributed to students through Spartan Life OnLine ; on bulletin boards in every residence hall in orientation newsletters, housing newsletters, and the campus newspaper, The Stat e News ; and on MSU Police and Public Safety 's web page at http://www.police.msu.edu/ , as well as by communications to Facebook and Twitter accounts. Educational Programs The University has several methods of providing education about RVSM to campus, including online and in-person 27 | Page training, educational and awareness campaigns , and other educational opportunities throughout the academic year. These are described further herein. The University's RVSM educational programs make clear that RVSM is prohibited at MSU. For more information on MSU's education and awareness programs visit the Prevention, Outreach and Education department (POE) website at http://poe.msu.edu/ . All employe es are required to complete an online training program within 30 days of hire and biennially thereafter. Failure to complete the required online training will result in notification to Human Resources or Academic Human Resources, which may result in disciplinary action. The online RVSM training programs for employees is designed to provide information on the following: Information to identify sex discrimination and sexual harassment, including relationship violence, stalking, and sexual misconduct; Raise a wareness of the impact of these issues on the campus community and encourage community members to engage in efforts to end these types of violence; Advise members of the MSU community about their rights and reporting options; Communicate behavioral expect ations for all members of the MSU community as outlined in the policy; Connect community members with support, resources, and information on how to support others who have experienced violence; Provide safe and effective strategies for bystander interven tion; Share strategies for risk reduction; and Train employees on their role in administering the policy and their obligations as mandatory reporters. Teach employees how to support survivors and provide resources in an empathetic manner. In addition to the online education session, many departments request individualized trainings for their faculty and staff. These trainings include advanced topics such as sexual harassment, supporting survivor s in the classroom, traum a- informed practices, bystander intervention. These trainings are written and delivered to be specific to various departments around the university and are available year -around on demand. For more information on POE's RVSM training programs or to request a training, visit the POE website at http://poe.msu.edu/ . All students are required to complete prevention education sessions at MSU. Students will not be able to access important academic inform ation in the student information system, including grades, until they complete this training. For more information on student programming, visit the POE website at http://poe.msu.edu/ . First year and transfer students attend the Sexual Assault and Relatio nship Violence (SARV) Prevention Workshop. This workshop is an education- based learning experienc e that is required for undergraduate students in their first year (freshmen and new transfer students) at MSU, The SARV Prevention workshop defines gender- based violence, explains university policies, and resources available on campus and in the community. This workshop defines the terms and discuss es ways to intervene and begin changing the culture to help create a violence -free community. There are also workshops that provide more expanded support and information to LBGTQ+ and international student communities. The Bystander Network is the in- person workshop required for all second -year students and explores the ways that all students can be active bystanders and delves deeper into what bystander intervention entails. Ways to support survivors and hold each other accountable are also explored in-depth during this workshop. Third year and above students (including graduate and professional students) are required to complete an online session that highlights strategies for intervention and supporting survivors, identifying and understanding harassment, understanding the Title IX Amendment and consent. Additionally, students in fraternities and sororities participate in a prevention program titled \"Greeks Take the Lead. \" The focus of this program, which was developed collaboratively with the Greek community, is to raise aware ness about issues of relationship violence and sexual misconduct, recognize ways to intervene, understand the intersection of alcohol and sexual violence, discuss ways to support survivors, and tips for making their environment safer. This program serves to support and empower the fraternity and sorority students by providing further education on how they can intervene and end gender- based violence in their chapters and greater community. POE also facilitates the \"Spartans Against Violence Program\" which focuses on educating and empowering Spartan student - athletes and athletics department staff to prevent sexual misconduct, relationship violence, and stalking. All coaches, administrators, staff, athletic trainers, strength and conditioning staff, and student -athlete mentors/tutors receive training about MSU's RVSM Policy, including informa tion about how to identify and report violations of MSU's RVSM Policy, relevant resources, navigating disclosures/mandatory reporting, and how to support survivors. Student- athletes have two, 90- minute training sessions over the course of the academic yea r. The two sessions are attended in teams and held at different points in the academic year to provide a multi-dose approach. For all teams, the first session discusse s (among other topics) the MSU RVSM Policy as well as education and information on how to identify and report critical issues such as relationship and sexual violence. The 28 | Page first session also begins critical dialog about bystander intervention and supporting survivors. Second sessions are developed based on feedback and input from students during session one. During the 2020- 2021 calendar year, t he second women's session examined rape culture, including discussions about factors that affect perceptio ns of safety and dismantling survivor blaming and shaming. The second men's session focused specifically on cultivating healthy relationships. MSU teaches bystander intervention in a multitude of programs. Bystander intervention education teaches people to intervene or interrupt a situation that could violate someone's autonomy or safety. Bystander intervention techniques may include speaking up if an individual hear s someone harassing another person, interrupting something they think might be harmful or calling 911 when they see someone in im mediate danger. Because every situation has unique circumstances, similar situations may require different methods of intervention. The trainings not only discuss various bystander intervention options, but also help participants understand when it is appropriate to intervene. Similarly, multiple programs discuss safety and risk reduction. By educating students on the dynamic and tactics of relationship violence; educating students on common misconceptions, such as strangers perpetrate most sexual assaul ts, (when, in fact, most are actually from people that an individual knows/trusts); teaching how alcohol is utilized to coerce someone into having sex; \"fight, flight or freeze\" response information; and how other tactics, such as isolating a victim, are u sed to make someone more vulnerable. MSU understands reducing risk of sexual and relationship violence by educating students and staff about common tactics, misconceptions and how to both intervene when individuals witness an incident , and how to support someone impacted by sexual or relationship violence. Bystander intervention and other risk reduction education is incorporated into many campus trainings including: The Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Prevention Workshops (mandatory in- person training for incoming students) The Bystander Network Workshops (mandatory in- person training for second year students) Greeks Take the Lead program for members of the MSU fraternity and sorority communities Residential Assistant staff and leadership trainings Registered student organization advisor training Online faculty/staff training (mandatory) Online graduate and professional staff trainings (mandatory) Third year and above student online training (mandatory) Assorted community-specific trainings and workshops Resources Below are a few of the resources available on campus.

The MSU Drug and Alcohol Policy applies to all members of the University community \u2014faculty, staff, and students. The Policy defines prohibited behavior and outlines consequences for violations. Also described are educational and counseling resources. Additional regulations specifically addressing student behaviors related to alcohol and other drugs can be found in Spartan Life OnLine . As outlined more fully in the Policy, General Student Regulations 2.11- 2.14 prohibit the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students on University property or as part of any of its activities, including University -sponsored or student group- sponsored activities off campus. Alleged violations of MSU regula tions are adjudicated through the student conduct process. Consequences for violations may include, but are not limited to, some form of disciplinary probation, required attendance at educational programs, referral for assessment and treatment, relocation to a new living environment, and suspension from MSU for sale of illegal drugs or repeated violations of the regulations. In addition, students can expect to be arrested and prosecuted for unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol on campus. Consistent with Michigan and federal law, MSU maintains a workplace free from the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of controlled substances, illicit drugs, and alcohol are prohibited on any property under the control of and governed by the Board of Trustees of MSU, and at any site where work is performed by individuals on behalf of the University. Pursuant to applicable University procedures governing employee discipline, any employee involved in the unlawful use, sale, manufacturing, dispensation, or possession of controlled substances, illicit drugs, or alcohol on University premises or work sites, or working under the influence of such substances, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal and referral for prosecution. MSU enforces all local, state, and federal laws regarding the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, pos session, or use of controlled substances, illicit drugs, or alcohol, including state underage drinking laws. Michigan State University is a tobacco -free campus. For more information, please visit http://tobaccofree.msu.edu/ . Alcohol and Other Drug Resources Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, there may be some adjustments to the delivery method of resources on campus (i.e., telehealth and virtual resources). Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) Health Promotio n Program (517) 884-6598 The AOD Health Promotion program is committed to reducing the negative harms and impacts of substance use on student's lives personally, civically, and academically. The overall strategies used and promoted by the AOD program are based in sound research and are implemented through education, environmental management, harm reduction, and social norms. Programming focuses on creating an environment that is respectful, non- judgmental, self - reflective, and engaging in working to suppor t the well-being of students; that optimal and dynamic state that allows students to achieve their full potential. To that end, the AOD program coordinates a Social Norms campaign (also known as \"The Ducks\") to promote a better understanding of alcohol use by the student population and challenge the prevailing myths and misperceptions that often lead to high- risk consumption. Social Norms messages are developed using student use and perception data from NCHA's National College Health Assessment and Michigan State University's UCelebrate! survey instrument. In partnership with the B.R.A.D. (Be Responsible About Drinking) Foundation , the AOD program reaches out to all students on their 21st birthdays to wish them a happy, safe birthday, and to educate them about the risks associated with some 21st birthday celebration practices. This birthday card also contains information on specific tools and strategies for effect ively managing and reducing those risks. In conjunction with the mailed birthday cards, the Responsible Hospitality Council of East Lansing has adopted best practices to help safely manage 21st birthday celebrations that occur within local alcohol -serving establishments. The AOD program offers Spartan Smart , an interactive alcohol and drug education and risk management class. This class is for any student who has been referred from the Dean of Students Office, Residence Education and Housing Services, or Michigan courts/probation officers for a violation of university policy or Michigan law, relating to alcohol/substance use. Through didactic group process, students participate in guided discussions and activities focusing on the effects of substances neurobiologically, psychologically, and behaviorally. Risk management tools, bystander intervention, education about the disease of addiction, and values clarification are explored in the context of how substances may affect the student's academic, career, and personal goals. Additionally, students are asked to identify specific strategies and changes in behavior that they 31 | Page may take to effectively manage those risks. Spartan Smart is evalu ated annually to ensure that it consistently meets or exceeds established outcomes. In partnership with the Dean of Students Office, Residence Education and Housing Services and as part of the Tiered Intervention Protocol that has been established to respond to on-campus alcohol and other drug violations as outlined in MSU s Student Rights and Responsibilities , the AOD program provides Substance Use Assessments to students who have demonstrated the need for additional evaluation, assessment, supports, resources, and potentially a referral to a higher level of care. Assessments are completed by a Certified Advanced Alcohol and Drug Counselor, consist of three, 60-90- minute individualized one -to-one sessions and students are assess ed using the American Society of Addiction Medicine [ASAM] Criteria Multidimensional Assessment and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition. Recommendations and referrals for appropriate level of care are determined and faci litated and follow -up is provided to ensure that the student is connected to the appropriate recourses and care. The AOD program provides interactive educational sessions to between 1,500 and 4,000 students annually through classroom infusion, presentations to student groups and organizations, and engagement with Fraternity and Sorority Life. The primary emphasis of these presentations is on knowledge around the neurobiological and physiological effects of substances on the human body, harm reduction tools, and risk management strategies. The AOD program also provides two- evidence- based, online prevention and intervention tools that are free and accessible to students at any time. The e- CHECKUP TO GO for Alcohol and e -CHECKUP TO GO for marijuana , are personalized programs designed to motivate individuals to reduce their consumption using information about the student's own use, behaviors, and risk factors. Programs are individualized and specific to Michigan State University and explore student's quantity and frequency of use, physical health information, amount and percent of income spent, individualized negative consequences feedback, normative comparisons, behavioral alternatives and harm reduction strategies, and local referral information. Freshman and t ransfer students are encouraged to complete e -CHECKUP TO GO for alcohol as part of their orientation to MSU and students who complete Spartan Smart also complete e- CHECKUP TO GO programs for either alcohol or marijuana . The AOD program develops and distributes a variety of print information available to both on and off -campus students, REHS staff, and staff and faculty regarding alcohol, other drugs, and tobacco. Printed information is available in the form of informational and educational brochures, cards , and stickers highlighting how to connect with resources or support, medical amnesty, how to identify signs and symptoms of alcohol poisoning, how to arrange for a safe ride home, recovery resources and a variety of substance specific educational brochures including, but not limited to cannabis/marijuana, vaping, alcohol, stimulants, and tobacco. An AOD specialist is on staff and is available as a consultant to parents, concerned friends, mentors, and staff/faculty who may have concerns about a student's use of alcohol and other drugs. The AOD specialist is a Certified Advanced Alcohol and Drug Counselor and provides individualized educational consultations, brief intervention, referral services, and recovery support to students who are concerned about their own use of alcohol and drugs, or the use of a friend or family member. The AOD Health Promotion program coordinates the University's Collegiate Recovery Community (CRC), a program serving students in or seeking recovery from alcohol and other drug use disorders. The CRC Coordinator supports this population by engaging students in individualized and person- centered recovery planning and relapse prevention, facilitating peer support, sponsoring alcohol -free social events, provision of a designated lounge spa ce accessible 24/7, wellness workshops, and community services opportunities. The CRC Coordinator and AOD specialist also provide accountability, counseling support and referral for treatment as needed. In addition, the CRC Coordinator advises Spartans' Organization for All Recovery (SOAR), a registered student organization for students in recovery from addictive disorders and their allies. In partnership with REHS, the CRC and REHS offer on- campus Recovery Housing for students who are in recovery from a s ubstance use disorder. This housing option offers a safe and supportive living environment where students can have a college experience, without the use of alcohol or drugs. Recovery Housing offers the opportunity to form meaningful relationships based on sobriety, friendship, and academic success. Recovery Housing provides a live -in Recovery Housing Support Specialist, REHS community support, 24- hour access to the Collegiate Recovery Lounge, counseling support, academic resources, and organized activities. The AOD office is actively engaged in community coalitions focused on reducing the harms associated with substance use within the greater Lansing/East Lansing community as well as working with student groups, city officials, and campus decision -makers to advise on policies related to health and safety issues associated with alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use.

Illegal drug use includes the use of illicit drugs, as well as misuse of prescription drugs. Combining alcohol and drugs can greatly increase health risks. Major health risks of alcohol and drug use include acute and chronic illness, psychological and emotional impairment, substance- use dependency, and death. Other he alth risks include short -term memory problems, learning impairments, sleep disruption, immune compromise, and mood swings. Side effects such as impaired judgment, slowed response time, mental confusion, and decreased motor coordination can lead to accident s, motor vehicle crashes, physical altercations, loss or damage to personal belongings and injuries. Use of alcohol and illegal drugs presents significant short - term and long- term health risks and medical consequences: Marijuana [also commonly referred to as cannabis] comes with significant risks that can impact a person's life and health and includes substantial risks to an individual's brain health, mental health, athletic performance, risks during pregnancy and to the unborn fetus, and the development of an addiction. Approximately 1 in 10 people who use marijuana will become addicted and if individuals start using before the age of 18, the rate of addiction increases to 1 in 6 (SAMHSA, CDC, 2020). Marijuana directly affects the brain, specifically the ar eas responsible for memory, learning, attention, decision making, coordination, emotions and motor coordination and reaction times. These effects can make it difficult to learn and retain information, may interfere with driving skills, and increase the ris k of injuries and potentially harmful behaviors. Marijuana use in developing brains of children and adolescents can reduce attention, memory and learning functions, and affect how the brain builds connections between the areas necessary for these functions . This can result in poor educational outcomes, cognitive impairments, diminished life satisfaction and achievement. These effects can be long lasting or even permanent. Physical effects of marijuana can include breathing and respiratory complications incl uding chronic bronchitis, increased heart rate, problems with child development during and after pregnancy, sleep interference, intense nausea, and vomiting. Marijuana has been linked to mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, paranoia and suicidal thoughts as well as an 33 | Page increased risk of psychosis and psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) in persons with a genetic predisposition to those disorders. Marijuana edibles, or food and drink products infused with marijuana and eaten, have some different risks than smoking marijuana, including a greater risk of poisoning. Unlike inhaling marijuana, ingesting marijuana can take 30 minutes to 2 hours to take effect. Overconsumption can lead to poisoning and/or serious injury. The effects of edibl es may last longer than expected depending on the amount consumed, the individual's last meal, and medication, alcohol, or other substances used at the same time. The amount of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, is very difficult to measure and is of ten unknown in edible products. Many users can be unprepared for the strength and long- lasting effects of edibles. Marijuana effects children and adults differently. Marijuana products that look like candy or treats have posed significant risks to children, who have required emergency medical care as a result of consuming such products. According to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 14.4 million adults ages 18 and older and 401,000 adolescents ages 12- 17 have an Alcohol Use Disorder. An estimated 88,000 people die each year due to alcohol related causes, making alcohol the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States. In 2018, alcohol- impaired driving fatalities accounted for 29% of the overall driving fatalities (10,511 deaths). Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant and affects every organ in the body and can impair brain function and motor skills. Alcohol interferes with the brain's communication pathways, affecting how the brain looks and works. These disru ptions can change mood and behavior and make it harder to think clearly and move with coordination. Heavy use can increase the risk of certain cancers including head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Dri nking heavily over a long time, or on a single occasion can damage the heart causing problems including cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, stroke and high blood pressure. Alcohol causes the pancreas to produce toxic substances that eventually lead to pancreatiti s, a dangerous inflammation and swelling of the blood vessels in the pancreas and liver diseases include steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. Alcohol also weakens the immune system, making chronic drinker smore susceptible to diseases li ke pneumonia and tuberculosis and drinking on a single occasion slows your body's ability to fight infections up to 24 hours after use (NIAAA, 2020). Club drugs (MDMA, GHB, Rohypnol, Ketamine, and LSD (Acid)) can cause serious physical and mental health problems including long- lasting confusion, depression, increased anxiety, aggression, impulsiveness, cell and organ damage, heart and brain problems and in some cases, death. Because some club drugs are colorless, tasteless, and odorless, they can be added to beverages to sedate or intoxicate, with the intent to facilitate sexual assaults. Stimulant medication, including Amphetamines like Adderall\u00ae, methylphenidate like Ritalin/Concerta, and illicit substances like methamphetamines and cocaine, can cause irri tability, mood disorders, acute and/or chronic anxiety, elevated blood pressure, and cardiac arrest, particularly in those with preexisting heart conditions. Long- term use of some stimulants may cause permanent damage to the brain, heart, lungs, and other organs. Opioids include prescription pain relievers like oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl and heroin. When misused, opioids can lead to addiction, fatal overdose, spontaneous abortion, and infectious diseases associated with injection drug use like hepatitis and HIV. They also can cause serious health conditions including pulmonary complications, infection of the heart lining and valves, liver and kidney disease. Nearly half of the individuals who inject heroin reported using prescription opioids before starti ng to use heroin. Opioids can also greatly increase the risk of accidents and automobile crashes because they affect vision, depth perception, coordination, and other physical skills. Psychological side effects include poor concentration and impaired judgm ent. Driving under the influence of legal medication may result in a DUI violation. Long- term or heavy use of depressants like opioids, benzodiazepines and alcohol can lead to a profound physical addiction, requiring medically monitored detoxification in order to discontinue use safely. Individuals who are physically addicted to depressants can experience serious medical complications when attempting to discontinue use, including seizures, hallucinations, stroke, and death. Almost all drugs, carry the potential risk for overdose.

The Law and University Policies To provide for the safety of members of the University community and the protection of University property, MSU has set minimum standards of conduct. Detailed information may be found in University Ordinances , General Student Regulations , and other University policies. These University 34 | Page standards of conduct do not replace, or relieve, persons from the obligation to comply with the requirements of civil or criminal laws. Unlawful behavior may result in criminal prosecution as well as University disciplinary action. The use or possession of marijuana on any property owned or managed by MSU, and by MSU's faculty, staff, or students on any MSU property or during off -campus MSU business or events remains illegal and fully criminalized according to federal law. MSU is subject to the Drug -Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug- Free Schools and Com munities Act Amendment of 1989. In addition, the MSU Drug and Alcohol Policy prohibits the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and use of controlled substances, illicit drugs, and alcohol on property governed by MSU's Board of Tru stees and at any site where university work is performed. Federal and State Penalties for Drug Sale and Possession The federal government decides if and how a drug should be controlled. Psychoactive (mind- altering) chemicals are categorized according to Schedule I to V. This schedule designates if the drug must be prescribed by a physician and under what conditions. Factors considered in this categorization include a drug's known and potential medical value, its potential for physical or psychological dependence, and risk, if any, to public health. Penalties for the illegal sale or distribution of a drug are established using the designation of Schedule I to V. The State of Michigan designates controlled substances as Schedule I through V, using similar definitions to those employed by the federal government. The State of Michigan's schedule designations of individual drugs are similar, but not identical to those of the federal government. Schedule I drugs have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, and lack acceptable safety for use under medical supervision. Examples of substances listed in Schedule I include heroin, lysergic can be a Schedule I or III drug, depending on its form. Schedule II drugs have a currently accepted medical use in the United States, despite a high potential for abuse that may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. Examples include combination products with less than 15 milligrams of hydrocodone per and State of Michigan penalties for selling Schedule I and II drugs vary with the type and quantity of the drug. Additionally, if death, rape, or serious injury is associated with the use of the drug and/or if it is a second offense, penalties are more severe. Unless otherwise specified by federal law, the federal penalty for the first offense involving a Schedule I or II controlled substance, GHB, or 1 gram of flunitrazepam (Schedule IV) is imprisonment for not more than 20 years. If death or serious bodily injury results from the use of such substances, the penalty is imprisonment for not less than 20 years or more than life, a fine not to exceed $1 million for an individual, or both. The State of Michigan's penalty for other Schedule I or II controlled substances is imprisonment for not more than twenty years, a fine of not more than $25,000, or both. The State of M ichigan's penalty for unlawful manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to deliver less than 50 grams of a Schedule I or II controlled substance is imprisonment for up to 20 years, and/or a fine of up to $25,000. Use of a Schedule I or II controlle d substance is a misdemeanor that has a penalty of imprisonment for up to one year, a fine of up to $2,000, or both. Michigan law also provides for up to seven years imprisonment and/or a fine of not more than $5,000 for individuals who manufacture, delive r, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver gamma -butyrolactone (GBL), a compound related to GHB. For less than 50 kilograms of marijuana, except in the case of 50 or more marijuana plants regardless of weight, 10 kilograms of hashish, or one kilogram of hashish oil, the federal penalty is imprisonment for not more than 5 years, a fine not to exceed $250,000 for an individual, or both. In Michigan, with the exception of manufacture, possession, use, or sale consistent with the Michigan Medical Marih uana Act and Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act, the \"unlawful manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to deliver\" of less than 5 kilograms of marijuana or a mixture containing marijuana, or fewer than 20 marijuana plants, is a felony punishable by imprisonment for up to four years, a fine of up to $20,000, or both. Schedule III drugs have a potential for abuse that is less than Schedule I and II substances, and abuse may lead to moderate or lower physical dependence or high psychological dependence. Examples include products containing less than 90 milligrams of codeine per dosage unit such as Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, anabolic steroids such as oxandrolone, or testosterone. Schedule IV drugs have a low potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedule III. Examples include Schedule V drugs have a low potential for abuse relative to substances listed in Schedule IV and consist primarily of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics that are used for antitussive, antidiarrheal, and analgesic 35 | Page purposes, such as Robitussin AC\u00ae, Lomotil, Motofen, Lyrica, Parepecto lin. Except as otherwise provided by federal law, the penalty for first offense sale of a Schedule III drug is imprisonment for not more than ten years, a fine of not more than $500,000 for an individual, or both. The federal penalty for first offense sale of Schedule IV drugs is imprisonment for not more than five years, a fine of not more than $250,000 for an individual, or both. The federal penalty for first offense sale of Schedule V drugs is imprisonment for not more than one year, a fine of not more t han $100,000 for an individual, or both. The State of Michigan's penalty for unlawful manufacture, delive ry, or possession of Schedule III controlled substances is impr isonment for not more than seven years, a fine of not more than $10,000, or both. The p enalty for Schedule IV controlled substances is imprisonment for not more than four years, a fine of not more than $2,000, or both.

This training includes review of fire safety prevention rules, fire evacuation procedures specific to each residence hall, and fire alarm system operations for staff who conduct evacuation drills twice a semester. The training program is a collaborative effort among REHS, Assistant Director for Coordination and Planning, the RHS Health and Safety Coordinator, MSU Police and Public Safety Emergency Management, and Infrastructure Planning and Facilities. Upon residential students' arrival on campus in the fall, mandatory floor meetings are conducted providing residents with the following information: education around fire safety and prevention rules, information about fire drills, fire safety hazards, evacuation routes specific to their floor in the residence hall, and operational guidelines for hall evacuation. The RHS Health and Safety Office also conducts a poster campaign in each residence hall focused on fire and life safety. A series of four posters address topics such as fire alarm use, fire drill participation, and education about automatic sprinklers. Basic fire safety instruction is also offered to professional staff and faculty members. Emergency Action Teams, consisting of designated employees in each building, receive extensive training on how to implement evacuation and sheltering plans specific to their building. Almost 200 employees are trained as Emergency Action Team leaders. MSU Police and Public Safety annually trains Emergency Action Teams on how to advise first responders in emergency situations, assist with evacuation, notify building occupants, and provide information about special considerations for their building. All students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to take the time to familiarize themselves with the fire evacuation plans for each building that they work in, live in, or frequent; know their Emergency Action Team leaders and coordinators; and participate in building evacuation drills. If a fire occurs, students are instructed to leave hazardous areas by the evacuation routes and get to a predetermined location. They are to remain in that location so that Resident Assistants may confirm each student has left the building. REHS staff members are instructed to pull a fire alarm as they exit the building if they can do so without risking their safety. Fire Drills In accordance with State of Michigan fire safety regulations, the residence halls conduct a minimum of one (1) fire drill each semester of each academic year. Two drills are scheduled during fall and winter semester to ensure a make -up day i n the event of a cancellation. Drills are only conducted for buildings in use during that semester. In 2020, MSU conducted one fire drill at Gilchrist hall, two fire drills at Abbot, Armstrong, Bailey, Bryan, Butterfield, Campbell, Emmons, Hubbard, Landon, Mary Mayo, Mason, Phillips, Rather, Snyder, Williams and Yakeley halls ; three fire drills at Case, Holden, Owen/Van Hoosen, Wilson and Wonders halls ; and four fire drills at Holmes and McDonel halls. Fire drills were not conducted in University Village Apartments, 1855 Place Apartments, or Spartan Village Apartments. Mandatory supervised fire drills are also conducted annually in all academic buildings in May of each year. The evacuation drills are co nducted in cooperation with the MSU Police and Public Safety Fire Marshal's Office, MSU Police and Public Safety Emergency Management Division, REHS, Infrastructure Planning and Facilities, and the Emergency Action Teams. Following every drill, a review is conducted to assess compliance with the MSU Emergency Action Plan. The MSU Police and Public Safety Fire Marshal's Office and MSU Police and Public Safety Emergency Management Division maintains records of drills, documenting the date, time, and descripti on of the exercise, as well as whether it was announced or unannounced. These records are available for inspection upon request. State law requires that all individuals evacuate immediately when a fire alarm sounds. Students failing to vacate during a drill are subject to disciplinary action. Evacuation Procedures and Guidelines Every building/unit on campus has a written Emergency Action Plan that contains the evacuation procedures all students, employees, and visitors must follow in the event of an eme rgency. The plan identifies evacuation routes and accountability locations in the event of a fire. A short version of each plan is posted at key locations in the respective buildings. All MSU buildings also have posted notices and floor plans that include: the building's emergency exits and rally points; location of fire extinguishers and pull stations; fire rated stairwell locations; locations of emergency showers, eyewash stations, and gas shutoff; emergency phone locations; and locations of exit/entrance doors for people with disabilities. An evacuation route and destination map, specifying the location of the nearest stairwell and exits, is posted on the back of each residence hall room door. Students should become familiar with multiple evacuation route s out of their residence hall and leave immediately from the nearest safe exit in the event of a fire. The REHS staff members on duty are responsible for the supervision and coordination of the evacuation of students in their assigned residence hall until fire and public safety personnel arrive. It is the student's responsibility to remove themself from the building as quickly and safely as possible. 48 | Page Elevators are not to be used during a fire alarm evacuation of the building. If someone cannot be evacuated due to an injury or disability, students and staff are advised to notify the first emergency responder they encounter as they leave the building. Persons with disabilities who are unable to evacuate on their own should remain near a window in their unit a nd emergency personnel will evacuate them. Evacuating students are instructed to report to Residence Hall Resident Assistants who will be stationed in designated areas at least 200 feet away from the building. The Residence Education team will account for residents at the rally site. No occupant is allowed to re -enter a building until clearance is given by fire or public safety personnel. Additional information on evacuation and sheltering plans and procedures is available at police.msu.edu under the Homela nd Security tab. Fire Safety Violations and Prohibitions All University policies related to on -campus housing are located on Spartan Life OnLine and in the On-Campus Housing Handbook located at Live On - Residence Education and Housing Services . Each student must acknowledge receipt of and review all policies upon registering for on- campus housing. The fire safety g uidelines and prohibitions, as provided in the Spartan Life OnLine , University Housing Regulations (2.0 Safety of the Individual and Community), are listed below. Fundamental to the protection of the individual is the maintenance of an environment that is physically safe and predictable. As members of a group, each individual has a special responsibility to ensure that safety hazards are eliminated, fire equipment is maintained, and fire procedures are established and followed. o 2.1 No person shall create, or help to create, a safety hazard. o 2.2 No person shall throw or drop anything out of or off of a window or balcony. o 2.3 No person shall possess or use firecrackers, fireworks, firearms, or other dangerous weapons or explosives. (NOTE: Legal weapons must be stored at the Michigan State University Police Department.) o 2.4 No person shall possess or use in a universit y housing, without proper authorization, any chemical or other dangerous substance, compound, or container of such substances, which may injure, molest, or cause damage. o 2.5 No person shall set a fire in residence halls or areas immediately associated with residence halls. o 2.6 No person shall falsely report a fire, nor interfere in any way with emergency services or procedures, nor fail to conform to established safety regulations. 30 MSU is now a tobacco- free campus. Universi ty Ordinance 29.01 states that \"[n]o person shall (a) smoke, or (b) otherwise use any product derived from or containing tobacco, on any property governed by the Board.\" o 2.7 No person shall tamper with fire equipment, nor use such equipment for other than the prevention or control of fire. (Fire equipment shall include, but not be limited to thermal detectors, fire alarms, fire extinguishers, fire extinguisher boxes, fire hoses, and any other fire-fighting devices.) o 2.8 No person shall use unauthorized cooking appliances in his or her room, suite, floor study room or other unauthorized hall facilities in a residence hall - residents of University-owned apartments may use appliances as outlined in their lease. (Unauthorized cooking appliances include hot plates, toasters, toasters ovens, rice cookers, woks, crock pots and other electrical devices (excluding microwaves) intended for the preparation, heating or cooking of substantial food items.) The fire safety guidelines and prohibitions listed in the On- Campus Housing Handbook including those on smoking, open flames, and portable electrical appliances, are as follows: No Smoking 30. MSU is a tobacco - and s moke- free campus to ensure the MSU community enjoys a healthy campus. The ordinance applies to all property governed by the Board of Trustees and includes not only the main campus but also all MSU sites across the state, nation and globe. In addition to traditional tobacco products such as cigarettes and chewing tobacco, the ordinance also prohibits the use of e -cigarettes and vaporizers. All FDA - approved nicotine replacement therapy products are permitted for cessation use. For more information, visit tobaccofree.msu.edu/ . Drills . Residents are required to cooperate with staff and participate in fire, tornado and other emergency drills. Residents should tour their floor and the hall to know the location of all fire exits and alarm boxes. Fire Safety . Pulling false alarms, causing a fire, tampering with or misusing safety devices, interfering with firefighters, and tampering with or removing firefighting equipment is a violation of the Contract, student group regulations, university ordinances and state law. This includes, but is not limited to, covering or tampering with smoke detectors and sprinkler heads. Offenders will be removed from on- campus housing, prosecuted to the full extent of the law, referred through the university conduct process and face the loss of student status. Each corridor entrance is protected by a special fire door that, in the event of a fire, will help prevent the fire and smoke from spreading and are prohibited from being propped open. Fire and safety regulations require corridors be kept clear and unobstructed at all times. Candle warmers are not permitted in residence halls and apartments. Setting fires is prohibited. Lighted 49 | Page candles are prohibited: they are one of the major causes of fires. No incense of any kind may be burned in the housing unit, except in special circumstances, such as religious observances, with prior approval from the REHS staff. Room decorations are to be limited to non- flammable materials. Wooden or fake board paneling is highly combustible and is not allowed as decoration in student rooms. Residents may individualize the outside of their doors, but they must take responsibility for the safety of other residents and will be held accountable for damages that may be caused by any decorations, including damages to the finish of the door. Only two -dimensional paper materials that are covered by clear, self -adhesive plastic are allowed on the outside of room doors. Loose, flammable materials may be maliciously ignited, a nd the resulting fire may cut off the exit. Combustible items should not be attached to doors or in doorways (e.g., memo boards, cork boards, dry erase boards, chalkboards). Appliances and Electrical Items . Radios, televisions, computers, video games and music sound systems are permitted, but each resident is responsible for keeping the volume low enough to avoid disturbing others. No antennas may be installed inside or outside a residence hall. All printers must be installed according to the manufacturer' s requirements, university policies and MSU facilities recommendations. Residents may use mini -refrigerators of five cubic feet or less, compact microwaves, coffee makers and fans in their rooms. Appliances must carry the UL -listing mark. The university strongly recommends the use of appliances with the Energy Star\u00ae rating. Voltages can fluctuate within the system, so residents with stereos and personal computers should invest in a multi- rated surge suppressor. Michigan State University is not liable for da mage to electrical equipment. Cooking is permitted only in designated kitchen facilities. Use of electrical equipment (other than items listed previously), such as toasters, frying pans, George Foreman\u00ae -type grills, hot plates, waffle irons and toaster ovens , air fryers and instant pots is prohibited except in designated kitchen facilities. Space heaters are not permitted. Residents may not plug one extension cord into another. All extension cords used must be a minimum of 16-gauge. The university may remove all unauthorized or potentially dangerous electrical appliances. E-scooters may be used on campus but are not allowed to be charged or operated in any campus building. Grilling Equipment . Charcoal grills, lighters and propane gas tanks cannot be used or stored on campus, except by Michigan State University personnel. Grilling equipment provided is intended for community usage, and users are responsible for cleaning the item. Reporting Fire Safety Information All fire safety concerns and reports that a fire has occurred should be relayed immediately to MSU Police and Public Safety at (517) 355-2222. Individuals should call this non- emergency number to report fires that have already been extinguished in on- campus student housing to ensure t hat MSU Police and Public Safety have been made aware of these fires. The caller should be prepared to provide as much information as possible about the location, date, time, and cause of the fire. Plans for Future Improvements in Fire Safety The University, in collaboration with the MSU Police and Public Safety Fire Marshal's Office , monitors compliance with local, state, and federal codes through periodic building inspections. Plans have been established to make updates to life safety systems in cert ain residence halls over the coming years. These updates include the addition of 100% automatic sprinkler coverage and addressable fire alarm systems. 50 | Page and the Grand Rapids Police Department.
