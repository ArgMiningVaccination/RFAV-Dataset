Students completing this degree may qualify for employment in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries; the medical diagnostics industry; university-based biomedical research; and city, state and federal health/research laboratories. Additionally, students may wish to continue their education in graduate/professional school in: biological and/or biomedical sciences, medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, physician assistant, pathologists' assistant, forensic sciences, microbiological sciences, molecular biology, biotechnology, toxicology, neurobiology, plus many other areas. Students who excel in this program (>3.00 GPA overall and in science/math) may be eligible to participate in a research project with a faculty member or an internship in an area company sometime during their junior or senior year. This depends upon the availability of mentors and internships at the particular time. Upper-level BMS students in good academic standing (>3.00 GPA overall and in science/math) may also be permitted to take two to three graduate courses to fulfill undergraduate degree requirements. [See policy.](/university-policies/use-of-graduate-course-credits/) The technical standards for individuals working in the biomedical field may include the following abilities: to effectively communicate via oral and written expression; exhibit general fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination appropriate to performing delicate procedures; distinguish between subtle shades of color; read, comprehend and interpret scientific/medical information from professional sources. Reasonable accommodations will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Students may choose to minor in any area of study, although BMS students often choose to pursue one (or more) of these particular minors: - Medical Microbiology and Immunology - Chemistry - Psychology Students should work with their BMS major adviser and with their minor adviser to choose appropriate courses. BS in Biomedical Sciences Curriculum In addition to courses in science and mathematics, students are required to take a selection of [University Curriculum](/academics/university-curriculum/) courses (designated UC on the curriculum). The entire curriculum is designed to provide students with a strong program in basic and biomedical sciences, as well as a well-rounded educational experience through the University Curriculum. To remain in good academic standing within the program, the student must maintain a GPA of 2.50 overall, as well as in math and science. |First Year| |Fall Semester||Credits| | |[CHE 278](/search/?P=BMS%20278) [BIO 211](/search/?P=BIO%20211) & Physiology Lab I [CHE 210](/search/?P=CHE%20210) & [210L](/search/?P=CHE%20210L) and Organic Chemistry I Lab [MA 275](/search/?P=MA%20275) [BIO 212](/search/?P=BIO%20212) & [212L](/search/?P=BIO%20212L) and Human Anatomy and Physiology II Lab [CHE 211](/search/?P=CHE%20211) & [211L](/search/?P=CHE%20211L) and Organic Chemistry II Lab [BMS 370](/search/?P=BMS%20370) & [370L](/search/?P=BMS%20370L) and General Microbiology Lab [PHY 110](/search/?P=PHY%20110) & [110L](/search/?P=PHY%20110L) and General Physics I [375L](/search/?P=BMS%20375L) and Immunology Lab [PHY 111](/search/?P=PHY%20111) & [111L](/search/?P=PHY%20111L) and General Physics II Lab and Molecular Genetics Lab [BMS 318](/search/?P=BMS%20318) [CHE 315](/search/?P=CHE%20315) & [315L](/search/?P=CHE%20315L) and 1 Minimum mathematics requirement: [MA 140](/search/?P=MA%20140). For those interested in graduate or professional schools, [MA 141](/search/?P=MA%20141)is recommended. Students interested in graduate or professional school should investigate research and/or an independent study. Science Electives Take 15-18 credits from any BIO, BMS, HSC, CHE or PHY course at the 200 level or above. Three courses must be BMS. Open Electives Students may take 6 credits of 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-credit courses. BMS majors may not take 100-level \"science for non-science majors\" classes as open electives. Minors Science and open electives may be taken to complete minors from a variety of disciplines such as microbiology/immunology, chemistry and psychology. Students should discuss course selection for minors with their academic adviser.

BMS Mission Statement The mission of the Biomedical Sciences program is to provide students with a solid basic science foundation in preparation for studying the upper-level biomedical-related sciences. This is meant to provide maximum flexibility to students who are interested in pursuing one of the medical-related professions (e.g., physician, physician assistant, dentist, veterinarian, pharmacist, chiropractor, etc.), or graduate programs (MS/PhD) in the biomedical sciences (e.g., cancer biology, stem cell technology, cloning technology, molecular genetics, microbiology, immunology, etc.). Additionally, students who choose not to go on to graduate or professional school are able to apply for research and development positions in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. BMS students have the opportunity to learn valuable skills that may be applicable in a variety of biomedical fields after graduation, including effective communication via oral and written expression; exhibition of general fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination appropriate to performing delicate procedures; reading comprehension, critical thinking, visual literacy, interpretation of scientific/medical information from professional sources, etc. Admission into the Program Admission into the Biomedical Sciences program is dependent on the applicant's potential to pursue a university program and on past academic performance. The high school student applying for admission into the Biomedical Sciences program should have a strong background in the biological sciences. To remain in good standing within the program, the student must maintain a GPA of 2.50 overall, as well as in math and science. Transfer Students from within Quinnipiac University Students currently attending Quinnipiac in another program may be accepted into the Biomedical Sciences program based upon a review of qualifications by the program director. Students may apply upon completion of at least one semester at Quinnipiac. Students transferring in as a junior (i.e., 57 credits or more) must have completed both the general biology requirements, specifically, 8 credits of [BIO 101](/search/?P=BIO%20101) & [BIO 102](/search/?P=BIO%20102) or [BIO 150](/search/?P=BIO%20150) & [BIO 151](/search/?P=BIO%20151), and the chemistry requirements, 8 credits of Quinnipiac's [CHE 110](/search/?P=CHE%20110) & [CHE 111](/search/?P=CHE%20111) prior to entry into the upper-class component of the program.
