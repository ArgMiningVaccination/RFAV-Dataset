However, either part I or part II can be taken independently of the other part. This course will essentially cover the first half of topics from the Handbook of Consumer Psychology. MKT 602 Consumer Behavior II Consumer Behavior II is the second half of a two -part PhD level course on consumer behavior. However, either part I or part II can be taken independently of t he other part. This course will essentially cover the second half of topics from the Handbook of Consumer Psychology. B55 MKT 670 Seminar in Marketing Management This course is an advanced seminar of doctoral level standing. The course is aimed at student s pursuing a degree in business, economics or other disciplines interested in learning about the state of the art in analytical and empirical models in marketing. The objective of this course is to study analytical and empirical models and methods used in marketing to understand and predict the behavior of market participants, viz., consumers, and firms and to examine generalizations of such behaviors from a number of studies. The topical coverage in this seminar will vary from year to year. B55 MKT 673 An alytical Modeling in Marketing This PhD level seminar provides an overview of analytical models in marketing and economics as well as an in -depth discussion of game theory topics frequently used in economics and business literature. The seminar consists ro ughly of two parts. The objective of the first part is to achieve understanding, justification, and intuition for the commonly -used equilibrium concepts and ideas in game theory, such as Nash, Bayesian Nash, and Markov -perfect equilibria, and sub -game perfection. In this part, the course will go beyond the standard game theory treatment in Micro II to understand the usual critique and justification of the use of game theory in business applications and to better understand the equilibrium concepts used in a pplied economics and business literature. The objective of the second part is to study how these concepts have been used in the current business and economics literature. The specific areas covered in this part will vary from course to course to take into account the interests of students and to avoid overlap but complement recently offered courses. Likewise, to avoid overlap, the emphasis placed on the two parts of the course will vary from year to year. The topics and methodology covered in this seminar s hould be of interest to doctoral students in Business, Economics, and Political Science. B55 MKT 674 Judgment and Decision Making This class provides students an introductory overview of judgment and decision making (JDM, aka Behavioral Decision Making) research, with a consumer behavior slant. The field of JDM is heavily grounded by the disciplines of economics, psychology, and statistics, and now has major contributions from most business domains as well (organizational behavior, behavioral accounting, b ehavioral finance, marketing, consumer behavior, etc.). We will look at some of the classic articles and theories that started the movement and current work that has updated these theories. B55 MKT 675 Empirical Methods in Structural Modeling This course will deal with structural econometric models of consumer and firm behavior. Each lecture will discuss modeling and estimation issues pertaining to one stream of research in this area. The focus of the course will be mainly on recent, \"state -of-the-art\" pap ers although the perspective of older, \"classic\" papers will be provided as and when appropriate. B55 MKT 678 Independent Study in Marketing Internship must be arranged by the student and approved by the advising faculty member. An outline of objectives m ust be submitted to the PhD Office prior to enrollment. May be taken a maximum of five (5) times for credit. Credit, variable; fifteen (15) credits combined total. B55 MKT 679 Directed Readings in Marketing A program of readings developed by and with the approval of one or more members of the Marketing faculty. Prerequisite, approval of the Director of the PhD program. Credit, variable. May be taken up to two (2) times for credit; six (6) credits combined total. Other Courses B53 MGT 601 Doctoral Prep: University Teaching Two (2) credits are required for the Ph.D. Students must provide an Olin professor 30 hours of assistance in the teaching function; includes, but is not limited to, conducting help sessions, grading, developing lectures or exams. Maximu m of eight (8) credits allowed. Hours performed during this course do not count toward RA/TA requirements. Credits will count towards teaching requirement of the Graduate School of Arts & Science. B53 MGT 605 Research Internship Three (3) credits are requ ired for the PhD. Under the direction of a faculty member, students will work (and be graded) on their own research project. This requirement will be completed when students are at candidacy and preparing a dissertation proposal. Internship must be arrange d by the student and approved by the advising faculty member. An outline of objectives must be submitted to the PhD Office prior to enrollment. An additional nine (9) credits may be taken; maximum of twelve (12) credits allowed. B53 MGT 610 Dissertation Maximum of twelve (12) credits allowed, six (6) per semester. Prerequisite: submission of Title, Scope, and Procedure Form and successful Proposal of dissertation. B53 MGT 620 Empirical Methods in Business The objectives of this course are to train PhD stu dents in different business disciplines to understand: how to use data to address research questions, how to build econometric models that can be applied to data, and how to estimate the econometric models using some statistical packages. This course empha sizes on empirical data handling and estimation issues. Prerequisites: students are expected to have basic statistical knowledge such as random variables and distributions, tests of statistical hypothesis, basic linear regression and maximum likelihood est imation. B53 660 Seminar on Presentation Skills (Required for Third Year Students) The goal of this course is to teach students the basic principles of effective research communication sufficiently early in the program, so that they have multiple opportun ities to practice and hone their skills. The learning objectives are as follows: 1) demonstrate knowledge of how to organize thoughts and write research papers effectively. 2) demonstrate ability of how to design effective presentation decks for semin ars and conference presentations and 3) Improve the critical thinking that underlies research before, during, and after its completion. Core Foundation Courses L11 Econ 503 Microeconomics I The first of a two -semester graduate sequence in microeconomic theory. The courses cover the determination of relative prices and quantities exchanged of final products and factors of production. The first semester considers production and costs, supply of output and demand for inputs, demands for final products, mark et organization, time and capital. Fall. L11 Econ 504 Microeconomics II The second of a two -semester graduate sequence in microeconomic theory. The second semester considers the further development of individual consumer behavior, aggregated demand, gener al equilibrium analysis, Leontief models, consumer's surplus analysis, social choice, and expected utility analysis. Spring. L11 Econ 511 Quantitative Methods in Economics I Study of those topics of mathematics of special usefulness in economic research. Selection and ordering of topics will vary with level of student preparation but will usually include the following: vectors, matrices, lines mappings; their manipulation and elementary properties; elements of multidimensional calc ulus. Fall L11 Econ 512 Quantitative Methods in Economics II Introduction to mathematical statistics designed to provide a background for the study of econometrics. Selection of topics will usually include: probability, introduction to distribution theory , including limiting distributions and distributions of quadratic terms, Bayes Theorem, and hypothesis testing. 3 class hours a week. Fall. L11 Econ 513 Introduction to Econometrics Classical multiple regression analysis and an introduction to generalizations useful in empirical research in economics, including a framework for dealing with problems of multicollinearity, specification error, heteroskedasticity, serial and contemporaneo us correlation, identification and consistent estimation in simultaneous equation models. Spring, odd years. L11 Econ 516 Applied Econometrics Introduction to econometrics as it is applied in microeconomics and macroeconomics (modular). Topics related to the analysis of microeconomic data include maximum likelihood estimation and hypothesis testing; cross -section and panel data linear models and robust inference; models for discrete choice; truncation, censoring and sample selection models; and models for event counts and duration data. Topics related to the analysis of macroeconomic data include basic linear and nonlinear time series models; practical issues with likelihood -based inference; forecasting; structural identification based on timing restriction s and heteroskedasticity; and computational methods for hypothesis testing and model comparison.
