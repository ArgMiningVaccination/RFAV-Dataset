In other words, you generate memory T and [B cells](/learn/Adaptive_immune_response:_Nursing), so that if you encounter the same antigen again, they can quickly replicate and respond. Most of the time we think of immunologic memory developing after natural infection. But memory T and [B cells](/learn/Adaptive_immune_response:_Nursing) also develop after [vaccination](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity). [Vaccination](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity) is the process of generating a protective [adaptive immune responses](/learn/Adaptive_immune_response:_Nursing) against microbes by exposure to nonpathogenic forms or components of microbes. That's the key - getting long term active protection to a harmful microbe, from something that's not harmful. [Vaccination](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity) also helps up to establish [herd immunity](/learn/COVID-19_mutant_variants_and_herd_immunity). [Herd immunity](/learn/COVID-19_mutant_variants_and_herd_immunity) is the concept that if enough people in the population - or herd - are [vaccinated](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity) the entire population, even those who are [unvaccinated](/learn/Vaccinations), develop a higher resistance to that infection. The amount of people within a herd that need to be [vaccinated](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity) to maintain herd immune status differs from pathogen to pathogen. When too few people in a herd are [vaccinated](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity), there are more people in the population that are able to get the illness and spread it. [Vaccination](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity) is an active process of developing [immunity](/learn/Innate_immune_response:_Nursing). This is different from passive immunity which is where a person gets antibodies that are made by another person or animal like a horse or mouse or by cells in a lab. A common form of this is when antibodies are pooled from the community and is given [intravenously](/learn/GI/GU:_Other_ways_of_providing_fluids_and_nutrition) - it's called intravenous immunoglobulin or IV-Ig. Passive immunity last for only as long as the antibodies last - usually weeks to months. The antibodies that an infant receives from their mother in [utero](/learn/Anatomy_of_the_female_reproductive_organs_of_the_pelvis) or during [breastfeeding](/learn/Breastfeeding) are examples of passive immunity. [IgG antibodies](/learn/Hypersensitivity_reactions_-_Type_II:_Nursing) in the blood cross the placenta initially protecting the baby to some pathogens that mom has already made antibodies to. [Vaccinations](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity), also known as immunizations, are a way to protect individuals from infectious diseases. [Vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) work by stimulating the [immune system](/learn/Introduction_to_the_immune_system) to recognize and fight specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. They allow us to develop active [immunity](/learn/Innate_immune_response:_Nursing) where a protective [adaptive immune response](/learn/Adaptive_immune_response:_Nursing) is made to pathogens without causing disease in the patient. There are four main types of vaccines: Live attenuated, are whole-cell vaccines, which means that the whole virus or bacteria is used to create the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations). Subunit and toxoid vaccines are considered fractionated vaccines because only one part of the pathogen is used to create the vaccine. Vaccines are typically given through injections, nasal sprays, or oral doses, and are usually recommended for infants and young children, as well as for adults who may be at risk for certain infectious diseases. Some vaccines, such as [the flu vaccine](/learn/The_flu_vaccine:_Information_for_patients_and_families), need to be given annually, while others provide lifelong protection after a series of doses.
