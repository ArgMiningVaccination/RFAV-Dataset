The proposed amici seek to file this brief to demon- strate to the Court that the overwhelming public-health and scientific consensus supports the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's rule requiring employers to ensure that employees are either vaccinated against COVID-19, or wear masks and undergo regular testing. Through this brief, the proposed amici also seek to ex- plain that well-established evidence, buttressed by more recent, cutting-edge empirical studies during the pan-demic, shows that vaccination can effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission in workplace set-tings. The proposed amici are concerned that staying en- try of OSHA's vaccinate-or-test standard will delay measures needed to control the spread of COVID-19 and will further endanger American workers. Given the Court's expedited consideration of this mat- ter of significant national interest, the proposed amici provided notice to all parties of their intent to file by email -2- on December 28, 2021.

The virus has shut down workplaces, triggered significant workplace restrictions, infected millions of employees, and sent hundreds of thousands to the hospital or the morgue. And particular workplaces, such as meatpacking plants, have repeatedly emerged as our nation's worst hotspots, bringing illness and death to those who toil in them. Recent weeks have made clear that the pandemic is far from over. As the Sixth Circuit observed below, \"the vir us rages on, mutating into different variants, and posing new risks\" to employers and employees alike. Ohio App. for Stay, App.A-4. Still, in the past two years, we have devel- oped two critical tools \u2014vaccination and testing\u2014to effec- tively prevent the virus's spread. In light of these develop- ments, and exercising its responsibility to protect the health of America's workers and the safety of its work-places, OSHA issued an emergency temporary standard requiring covered employers to ensure that employees are either vaccinated against COVID-19, or wear masks and undergo regular testing. See COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing; Emergency Temporary Standard, 86 Fed. Reg. 61402 (Nov. 5, 2021). The Sixth Circuit correctly held that OSHA acted well within its statutory authority in issuing its vaccinate-or-test standard. See App.A-9-17. This brief, on behalf of 1 All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part and no person other than amici and their counsel made a monetary contribution to its preparation or submission. -2- many of the nation's leading public-health and healthcare scholars and professional organizations, explains how that rule also reflects the most recent scientific evidence and research. And it also directly responds to the petitioners' repeated assertions that COVID-19 is \"not an occupa-tional danger \"\u2014that, in other words, \"the COVID-19-re- lated risk presented by work is the same risk that arises from human interaction more broadly.\" Ohio App. for Stay, 12; see, e.g., id. at 9 (arguing that COVID-19 is a dan- ger \"presented by human life generally,\" not by work). Nothing could be further from the truth. The evidence is clear: The nature of both the virus and in-person work makes the workplace particularly at risk for COVID-19 transmission and infection. Because it is an airborne path-ogen primarily transmitted through the inhalation of small respiratory particles, SARS-CoV-2 spreads espe-cially well between people who must spend hours together in close quarters indoors. 2 That accurately describes the wide range of America's workplaces\u2014from food-pro-cessing plants and car factories to retail stores and offices. The science is also clear about the best way to combat COVID-19's spread\u2014vaccines. All the evidence shows that vaccination significantly reduces the likelihood that workers will transmit COVID-19 and infect other work-ers, especially when combined with regular testing and other mitigation measures. And vaccination drastically reduces the chance of hospitalization and death. For these reasons, numerous employers have already imposed 2 \"SARS -CoV- 2\" refers to the virus and \"COVID -19\" refers to the disease it causes. For the reader's convenience, however, this brief (like much of the scientific literature) will often refer to \"COVID -19\" to mean both the virus and the disease . -3- vaccine requirements, which have engendered widespread vaccination uptake and have consistently proven effectiv e. Amici curiae file this brief to explain that OSHA's vac- cinate-or-test standard reflects this overwhelming scien-tific and public-health consensus. Amici are a diverse group of scholars and professional organizations of public health and healthcare practitioners who share a deep com-mitment to the health and safety of America's workers. They include more than one hundred of the country's lead-ing educators, scholars, and public health and healthcare professionals, as well as 30 deans and associate deans of leading academic programs across the United States. The individual amici are joined by 14 of the country's leading public health and healthcare organizations, which collec- tively represent tens of thousands of public health and healthcare practitioners. ARGUMENT I. COVID-19 is a particularly severe danger in the workplace, and it poses special risks for workers. Workers, and the workplaces in which they work, are particularly at risk of COVID-19 infection. The mechanics of how the virus is transmitted should make this proposi-tion self-evident. SARS-CoV-2 is an airborne virus that spreads through an infected person's respiratory parti-cles. See 86 Fed. Reg. at 61409. 3 As OSHA explains in its rule, airborne transmission may occur \"when people are in close contact with one another in indoor spaces,\" particu-larly \"in indoor spaces without adequate ventilation where small respiratory particles are able to remain suspended in the air and accumulate.\" Id. High risk exposure and 3 All subsequent citations to the OSHA rule's preamble are la- beled \"Pmbl.\" -4- infection can occur with relatively brief exposure (less than 15 minutes), and \"employees can be exposed to the virus in almost any work setting.\" Id. at 61409, 61411-12. 4 Whether working in cubicles clustered in an office build-ing or shoulder-to-shoulder in a food-processing plant, employees \"share common areas like hallways, restrooms, lunch rooms[,] and meeting rooms.\" Id. It is little surprise, then, tha t indoor workplace environments\u2014where indi- viduals work in close contact with other employees for many hours each day\u2014are particularly susceptible to the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak as compared to other set-tings. That is precisely what the public-health evidence has shown. OSHA's vaccinate-or-test standard relies on nu-merous empirical studies that have found that workers in various occupational sectors have had COVID-19 at sub-stantially higher rates than their surrounding communi- ties. See, e.g., Pmbl.61412-14 (citing studies). State-level data confirm that the workplace environment often facili- tates and accelerates the spread of the disease\u2014in North Carolina, for example, nearly 80% of COVID-19 \"clusters\" in the state, and nearly 40% of deaths, have been work- place-related. 5 Workers in a wide range of workplaces\u2014 like grocery stores, fitness facilities, schools, corrections and detention facilities, and others\u2014experienced up to 4 See also, e.g. , Center s for Disease Control and Prevention , Sci- entific Brief: SARS -CoV- Kevin P.

Id. at 61414 (citing studies). Moreover, \"larger employers are more likely to have many employees gathered in the same location\" and therefore more likely to have \"larger,\" \"longer\" out- breaks.6 For this reason, OSHA's decision to focus on em- ployers with more than 100 employees is not just reason-able\u2014it is empirically supported. See App.A-29-30. The increased risk of viral transmission in workplaces has had a devastating effect on workers. That workers who are required to work in person experience dispropor-tionate COVID-19 mortality rates is empirically well-es- tablished. 7 Indeed, substantial evidence confirms links be- tween in-person occupational sectors and \"high excess mortality during the pandemic.\"8 Evidence from Califor- nia, for instance, shows that \"excess mortality rose sharply in several essential sectors\" where \"[i]n-person essential workers\" were \"not protected by shelter-in-place policies,\" suggesting that the rise in mortality is associ- ated wi th in -person work. 9 Data from other states 6 Id. at 61512; see, e.g. , Zuelma Contreras et al., Industry Sectors Highly Affected by Worksite Outbreaks of Coronavirus Disease, Los Angeles County, California, USA, March 19 -September 30, 2020 , 27 Emerging Infectious Diseases 1769 https://perma.cc/7RTS - KDRU (\"[F]acilities employing more on -site staff had larger and longer outbreaks.\"). 7 See, e.g. , Kristin J. Cummings et al., Disparities in COVID -19 Fatalities among W orking Californians 8 Yea-Hung Chen et al., Excess mortality associated with the COVID -19 pandemic among Californians 18 -65 years of age, by oc- cupational sector and occupation: March through November 2020 PLOS ONE at 2 (2021) , https://perma.cc/AZK2 -QZZG. 9 Id. at 8. -6- similarly finds a statistically significant higher excess mortality rate for workers who predominately work in person. 10 These empirical findings are consistent with a \"grow- ing body of literature demonstrating occupational risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\" 11 And they dovetail with OSHA's determination that workers who have no choice but to work in person\u2014and who have \"little ability to limit contact with . . . coworkers, clients, members of the public, patients, and others\"\u2014face increased risk of illness, hos-pitalization, and death as a result of COVID-19. Pmbl .614,08. In fact, public-health scholars have con- cluded that \"there would have been 57% fewer COVID-19 deaths\" if, among other factors, \"all individuals had the COVID-19 mortality associated with the safest ... occupa-tional position\"\u2014\"non-essential, telework.\" 12 The evi- dence thus decision to focus its vac-cinate-or-test standard on in-person workers, and to ex-empt employees who work alone, remotely, or exclusively outdoors. See Pmbl.61419. The meatpacking industry's experience with COVID- 19 is a particularly instructive\u2014and well -studied\u2014 10 See Oregon Health Auth. , COVID Hawkins, Letitia deaths by occupation, Mas- sachusetts, Mar ch 1- July 31, 202 0, 64 Am.

Disease spread in meatpacking plants has been so severe that, following \"multiple reports of widescale coronavirus outbreaks within and around meatpacking facilities, the [Congressional] Select Subcommittee initiated an investi- gation into coronavirus infections and deaths in meatpack-ing plants.\" 13 Data from \"five of the largest meatpacking conglomerates, which represent over 80 percent of the market for beef and over 60 percent of the market for pork in the United States,\" indicated that certain plants had nearly half of their workforce contract COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic\u2014multiples higher than the per- centage of the U.S. po pulation that had contracted the dis- ease at that time. 14 That food processing workers are particularly at risk of transmission might not come as a surprise. They endure \"long shifts in enclosed facilities\" shared \"with hundreds, if not thousands, of other workers,\" with \"collective[]\" breaks in the socially distance by vir-tue of the production line layout[].\" Id. at 4. But while the \"high-density, fast-paced environments of food production facilities pose a barrier to proper adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures, such as social distancing . . . and cleaning of shared spaces,\" \"these challenges are not unique to food production facilities.\" 15 13 Staff of H. Select Subcomm. on the Coronavirus Crisis, 117th Cong., Memorandum re: Coronavirus Infections and Deaths Among Meatpacking Workers at Top Five Companies Were Nearly Three Times Higher Than Previous Estimates at 1 (Comm. Print 2021), https://perma.cc/ZAC7 1769 . -8- Like and meatpacking, work- ers in \"other sectors\" encounter \"distinctive\" factors re- lated to in -person work, such as \"increased contact with the public\" or \"shared equipment[] and common spaces,\" that \"similarly increase the risk of COVID-19 worksite ex- posure.\"16 High COVID-19 case incidence rates have oc- curred in the workforces of many important economic sec-tors\u2014in manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, and wholesale trade. \"High-density environments,\" \"close contact in production lines, long and common spaces,\" \"shared transportation,\" \"increased contact with the public\" all contribute to \"particular[] risk for COVID-19 exposure.\" 17 The COVID-19 pandemic has also pulled back the cur- tain on the way that workplace conditions and risks can exacerbate the existing health disparities between white workers and workers of color. The early months of the pandemic sickened and killed people of color in the United States at higher rates than non-Hispanic white people. 18 This is not only a result of underlying economic and health disparities but is also because people of color occupy a dis-proportionately high number of jobs that qualify as 16 Id. at 1769, 1772. 17 Id. at 1770, 1772- 73. 18 See Tiana N.

OSHA was there-fore right to determine that the virus poses an especiall y grave danger to America's in-person workers and to act quickly and decisively to address that grave danger. II. Vaccines are the most effective tools for reducing COVID-19 transmission and infection in the workplace. There is no better way to prevent the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19 than vaccination. The scientific evidence supporting this conclusion, too, is clear. As OSHA explained, numerous large-scale studies have confirmed the \"power of vaccines to safely protect in-dividuals\" from transmission and infection of COVID-19, including from the Delta variant.

First, vaccinated employees are in the ag- gregate significantly less likely to bring the virus into the workplace. Pmbl.61418 -19; see also, e.g., even those vac- cinated workers who get infected are far less likely to spread the virus. See id. Although it is true that COVID- 19 vaccines , like other vaccines, do not completely prevent transmission of COVID-19 to others, growing evidence shows that they significantly decrease it. 24 A recent study of COVID-19 transmission and infec- tion among law enforcement officers, firefighters, and other first responders highlights the vital need for vac- cination of workers. The study found that the incidence of COVID-19 in unvaccinated firefighters was five times higher than in vaccinated firefighters\u2014and twenty times higher for unvaccinated law enforcement officers. 25 On 24 See, e.g. , Anika Singanayagam et al., Community transmission and viral load kinetics of SARS -CoV- 2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals , Lancet Infectious Dis- eases (2021) , https://perma.cc/A7K9 -WUP2 (vaccinated individuals spread Delta to the unvaccinated at twice the rate as to the vac- cinated); Po Ying Chia et al., Virological and serological of SARS- CoV- 2 Delta multi posted period for vac- cinated individuals); Ross J. Harris et al., Effect of Vaccination on Household Transmission of SARS -CoV- 2 in England, New Eng. J. of Med. (Aug. 19, 2021), https://perma.cc/MP8W -DSPM . 25 Alberto J. Caban- Martinez et al., High Burden of COVID -19 -12- average, according to the study, first responders were sick with COVID-19 for over two weeks and missed close to 40 hours of work due to their illness. These findings, the au-thors wrote, \"suggest that state and local governments with large numbers of unvaccinated first responders may face major disruptions in their workforce due to COVID- 19 illness\" absent meaningful vaccination-and -testing re- quirements. 26 Other research during the COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed the efficacy of vaccination against workplace transmission and infection. A study of frontline workers from December 2020 through August 2021 concluded that \"full vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines was 80% effec- tive in preventing\" COVID-19 infection, \" further affirm- ing the highly protective benefit of full vaccination up to and through the most recent summer U.S. COVID-19 pan- demic waves .\" 27 And studies of vaccination in health-care workers have shown that vaccinated employees are not just less likely to be infected\u2014on average, they miss fewer days of work and experience milder symptoms if they are infected. 28 among Unvaccinated Law Enforcement Officers and Firefighters , medRxiv at 6 -864Z . 26 Id. at 4. 27 Ashley Fowlkes et al., CDC, Effectiveness of COVID- 19 Vac- cines in Preventing SARS -CoV- 2 Infection Among Frontline Work- ers Before and During B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant Predominance , 70 Morbidity & Mortality 27, 2021) , https://perma.cc/Q3EW -4GYM . 28 See Earl Strum et al., Healthcare workers benefit from second dose of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine: Effects of partial and full vaccina- tion on sick leave duration and symptoms (preprint , posted Nov. 21, 2021) e.g. , Tamara Pilishvili -13- Given the compelling data, it is not surprising that many e mployers with experience dealing with widespread COVID-19 outbreaks have recognized the need to require vaccin ation. To return to the meatpacking industry, as noted above, meatpacking facilities suffered particularly extensive and severe COVID-19 outbreaks in the early days of the pandemic. Several major employers responded with vaccine requirements covering their entire work- force, which have proved highly effective at achieving ad- herence. Less than three months after Tyson Foods man-dated coronavirus vaccines for all its 120,000 U.S. work- ers, for example, more than 96 percent are vaccinated. 29 This is true across industries. As OSHA explained in its rule, \"[e]vidence shows that mandating vaccination has proven to be an effective method for increasing vaccina- tion rates\" and that \"[s]ignificant numbers of workers would get vaccinated if their employers required it.\" Pmbl .61435 (citing Kaiser Family Found., Does The Pub- lic Want To Get A COVID-19 Vaccine (Sept. 2021)). In- deed, \"many workers who were vaccinated over the last four months were motivated by their employer requiring vaccination.\" Id.; see, e.g., Shawn Hubler, 'Mandates Are Working': Employer Ultimatums Lift Vaccination Rates, So Far , N.Y. Times (Sept. 30, 2021), et al., Effectiveness of mRNA Covid- 19 Vaccine among U.S. Health Care Personnel, N. Eng. J. Med. (Sept. 22, 2021) , https://perma.cc/W7ZS- DE23 ; Annalee Yassi et al., Infection control, occupational and public health measures including mRNA- based vaccination against SARS -CoV- 2 infections to protect healthcare workers from variants of concern: a 14 -month observational study using surveillance data , 16 PLOS ONE (2021) , https://perma.cc/NJF9- QS3R. 29 Lauren Hirsch, Days away from its deadline, Tyson Foods reaches a 96 percent vaccination rate , N.Y. Times (Oct. 26, 2021), (observing that when em- ployers require workers to get vaccinated, vaccination rates increase to over 90 percent). Finally, it should not be overlooked that vaccination in the workplace reduces the opportunities for the virus to continue to mutate by reducing transmission and length of infection \u2014meaning that vaccination could prevent future, more deadly, variants of COVID-19.30 The escalating global concerns about the recently discovered Omicron variant serve as a timely reminder that vaccination is an indispensable tool that not only protects worker health and safety, but can prevent widescale social and economic disruption. III. OSHA properly determined that its vaccinate-or- test standard is essential to protect workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 allows OSHA to issue emergency temporary standards when the agency \"determines (A) that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents de- termined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards, and (B) that such emergency standard is neces- sary to protect employees from such danger.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(c)(1) . As explained above, the public-health evidence makes abundantly clear that both criteria are satisfied here. Because they work in person, employees covered by the standard are subject to severe and particularized risk of illness, hospitalization, and death as a result of COVID- 30 See Ting -Yu Yeh & Gregory P. Contreras, Full vaccination against COVID -19 suppresses SARS- CoV- 2 delta variant and spike gene frequenc ies and generates purifying selection pres- sure, medRxiv Aug. 10, 2021), https://perma.cc/JMB2- VUMF (study of 16 countries finding that \"the vaccination coverage rate is inversely correlated to the mutation frequency of the . . . SARS- CoV- 2 delta variants\"). -15- 19. And the empirical data collected since the release of COVID-19 vaccines indicates that vaccination is by far the most effective tool to prevent further transmission and in-fection. Given the evidence, OSHA reasonably decided that its vaccinate -or-test standard was necessary to address the grave danger that COVID-19 poses to American workers. This decision is not unprecedented: The agency \"has long recognized the importance of vaccinating workers against preventable illnesses to which they may be exposed on the job.\" Pmbl.61433 -34. In 1991, under President George H.W. Bush, OSHA adopted what is known as the \"blood- borne pathogens standard\" to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1030. As part of that standard, the agency required employers to make the hepatitis B vaccine available to em- ployees in any workplace with potential exposure to blood-borne pathogens. See id. \u00a7 1910.1030(b); see generally Am. Dental Ass'n v. Martin , 984 F.2d 823, 824 (7th Cir. 1993). That standard resulted in a significant increase in the number of employees accepting hepatitis B vaccination, and \" a dramatic decline in the incidence of HBV infec- tions \" among covered workers. 31 The bloodborne patho- gens standard addressed viruses whose potential trans- mission \"between workers is minimal in comparison to the SARS-CoV-2 virus; Hepatitis B and HIV are transmitted through blood and certain body fluids, whereas the SARS- CoV-2 virus spreads through respiratory droplets that can travel through the air from worker-to-worker.\" Pmbl .61436. Therefore, OSHA determined that, in the 31 See Francis J. Mahoney et al., Progress Toward the Elimina- tion of Hepatitis B Virus Transmission Among Health Care Workers in the United States , 157 Archives of Internal Med. 2601, 2604 (1997), https://perma.cc/E289- HKD9 . -16- case of COVID-19, merely offering vaccination to workers would be insufficient. To protect against workplace spread of this rapidly transmitted, airborne virus, it was neces- sary to require vaccination or regular testing and mask-ing. See id. That determination warrants deference. As Chief Jus- tice Roberts has recognized, the \"precise question\" of what restrictions should be imposed during \"the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasona- ble disagreement.\" S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, 1613 (2020) (Roberts, C.J., con- curring in denial of certiorari). Congress has entrusted OSHA with the responsibility to protect workplace safety and health, particularly when workers are faced with a grave danger\u2014which the COVID-19 pandemic indisputa- bly is. Based on an extensive administrative record replete with public-health and scientific evidence showing that vaccination is the most effective tool to prevent COVID- 19 transmission and infection in the workplace, the agency issued its vaccinate-or-test standard. Given this careful and deliberative process, OSHA's rule \"should not be sub- ject to second-guessing by an 'unelected federal judiciary,' which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health.\" Id. at 1614. Even more so when, as here, the agency adopted its rule to deal with \"changing facts on the ground.\" See id. And the facts on the ground continue to change. In the last month, countries around the world have once again closed their borders and instituted lockdowns in response to the threat of the new, more transmissible Omicron variant. Cases are once again rising, and increased hospitalizations and deaths are likely to follow. The public-health evidence has uniformly concluded that vaccines are the primary way to prevent the rise and spread of such -17- variants, thereby protecting our nation's workplaces and workers. Because OSHA's vaccinate-or-test standard appropriately reflects this overwhelming scientific consensus, this Court should uphold it. CONCLUSION The decision below should be affirmed.
