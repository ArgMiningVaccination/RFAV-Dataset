As the University's President, I travel quite often and enjoy telling people about the \"UB advantage.\" Our students embark upon a journey that will prepare them for a career and also pre-pare them to better understand the world and their place in it. Here at UB we have students from 80 different countries and 44 states. Nowhere in America will you find so many students from so many different countries and in so intimate a campus set-ting. Whether you come to UB to acquire a high quality liberal arts education, study inter - national public service, you will begin to interact with people from all corners of the world. The average class size of 16 students helps ensure that every student gets the necessary attention from the professors as well as a chance to participate in exciting, challenging discussions. The cross-fertiliza-tion of cultures and ideas is an everyday ex-perience for our students and creates what biologists call \"hybrid vigor.\" Whether you come to UB to acquire a high quality liberal arts education, a knowledge of computer science and engineering, aca-demic training in business, the arts or the healing sciences, you will certainly leave here with more than that. You will have the opportunity to gain a global perspective on world issues and cultures. We at the University of Bridgeport believe that the object of education, beyond career training, is character development. We en-courage our students to involve themselves in one of our many student clubs, a theater production, student government or commu-nity service. It is often in these extracurricu-lar activities one has the opportunity to ex-plore and develop as yet untapped aspects of our character. The hallmark of a truly educated person is one who applies their knowledge to serving their community. That is what I call the \"UB experience.\" It is our sincere hope that you will come to call UB your home. Our beautiful cam-pus, located in historic New England, has a proud 8 decade long tradition of educat-ing students who have made a difference in the world. We encourage our students to take advantage of the many opportunities afforded them here on campus and in the region. We hope they also take the time to explore nearby New York City's many cul-tural offerings. Enrollment begins a lifelong association with UB, first as students and later as loyal alumni. I always appreciate your feedback and look forward to getting to know you. Sincerely, Neil Albert Salonen ivCorrespondence Mailing Address UNIVERSITY OF BRIDGEPORT Bridgeport, Connecticut 06604 Telephone Number: 203-576-4000 Toll Free in CT: 1-800-972-9488 Toll Free in NY, NJ, PA, MA, NH, VT, RI: 1-800-243-9496 Specific inquiries should be addressed as follows: ADMISSIONS INFORMATION Office of Admissions 126 Park ADMISSIONS (888) UB-CHIRO E-mail: COLLEGE OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE ADMISSIONS (203) 576-4108 E-mail: natmed@bridgeport.edu ACUPUNCTURE INSTITUTE ADMISSIONS (203) 576-4109E-mail: acup@bridgeport.edu AND PAYMENTS Bursar (203) 576-4472Fax: (203) 576-4581E-mail: bursar@bridgeport.edu SCHOLARSHIPS AND STUDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES (203) 576-4570E-mail: finaid@bridgeport.edu STUDY ABROAD (203) 576-4699 E-mail: DEVELOPMENT Dean of Students (203) 576-4393Fax: (203) 576-4394E-mail: deanofstudents@bridgeport.eduTRANSCRIPTS AND ACADEMIC RECORDS Office of the Registrar (203) 576-4634Fax: (203) 576-4941 E-mail: registrar@bridgeport.edu For more information specific to one of he colleges or divisions, you may write or call the appropriate dean or director.

The University promotes academic excel- lence, personal responsibility, and commit- ment to service. Distinctive curricula in an international, culturally diverse supportive learning environment prepare graduates for life and leadership in an increasingly inter - connected world. The University is inde- pendent and non-sectarian. History The University of Bridgeport was founded in 1927 as the Junior College of Connecticut \u2014 the first junior college chartered by any legislature in the northeastern states. The college had as its purpose, in the words of the founders, to develop in students a point of view and a habit of mind that promotes clear thinking and sound judgment in later professional and business experience. Al- though UB has changed in many ways since then, this commitment to student prepara- tion and community service remains central to its mission. The Junior College of Connecticut became the University of Bridgeport in 1947, when the State of Connecticut chartered the insti-tution as a four-year university with author - ity to grant the baccalaureate degree. By that time, the former Barnum estate at Sea-side Park had been purchased and growth in students, faculty, programs and buildings was rapid. The College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Business were added at once, and the colleges of Nursing, Educa-tion, and Engineering soon after. The Junior College expanded its offerings through a merger with the Weylister Secretarial Ju-nior College of Milford, Connecticut, and through the addition of the Fones School of Dental Hygiene (at its inception in 1949 the only such school in Connecticut and the second in New England). By 1950, the University had moved from the original Fairfield Avenue location to the present Seaside Park campus, which has since grown from 22 to 53 acres. Enrollment was nearly 3,500 students, including a num- ber of international students, taught by a faculty of 183 men and women. In 1951 the University awarded its first Master's degree. In 1953 the University expanded its pro- grams when Arnold College, the oldest co- educational school of physical education in the United States, merged with and was in-corporated into the College of Education. In January 1979 UB inaugurated its first doc- toral degree program, Educational Leader - ship; and in 1991 the College of Chiropractic was established, representing the first affili- ation of a chiropractic school with a univer - sity in the United States. In 1992 significant financial support from the Professors World Peace Academy (PWPA), a non-profit or - ganization of academicians dedicated to world peace through education, enabled the University of Bridgeport to continue its programs in the aftermath of a major labor dispute. In 1996 the University established the College of Naturopathic Medicine. In 2005 the Ph.D. in Computer Science and En-gineering was added. University of Bridgeport Today The University today continues its commit-ment to excellence as it maintains its tradi- tion of responding to the changing needs of society through the liberal arts and its pro-fessional programs. Programs are focused so that students receive the kind of personal advising and attention usually found only at small colleges. Furthermore, the Univer - sity takes full advantage of its location in a progressive urban setting, using regional resources as \"living laboratories\" to supple- ment the traditional academic instruction of- fered on the campus. Through co-operative education programs, students can learn from experience by integrating classroom studies on campus with supervised employment in industrial, service, and government sectors. The University through its schools and colleg- es offers a variety of undergraduate and grad- uate degree programs from associate through doctoral levels. In addition, the University's College of Chiropractic awards the Doctor of Chiropractic degree; College of Naturopathic Medicine awards the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine and Acupuncture awards the Mas-ter of Science in Acupuncture. The IDEAL Program of the School of General Studies offers undergraduate courses with flexible scheduling for part-time adult stu-dents, at the main campus, at the branch cam- pus in Stamford, CT, and in Waterbury, CT. The University sees its student body as a valuable resource. Approximately 5,000 students were enrolled in 2012-2013, sixty percent of whom are full-time, coming from 45 states and 80 foreign countries and rep- resenting a rich diversity of ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds. Faculty The UB instructional staff consists of 121 full-time faculty, and nearly all hold doc- toral or terminal degrees in their fields. The regular faculty is augmented by approxi-mately 350 adjunct faculty. Faculty honors include Fulbright Scholars, National Science Foundation Fellows, Ford Fellows, National Endowment for the Hu- manities Fellows, American Council for Learned Societies Scholars, Phi Beta Kappa Scholars, Phi Kappa Phi Scholars and Sigma Xi Scholars.

Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, borders the 53- acre campus to the north. Seaside Park and the Long Island Sound, with some of the finest sandy beaches between New York and Cape Cod, mark the southern bound-ary. The unique location of the campus of- fers a variety of advantages to the University community. The Sound and the Park are settings for studies in marine biology and for the enjoyment of sun and recreation. The city and county provide opportunities for becoming involved in work-study pro- grams with schools, government and some of the country's largest Fortune 500 and multi-national corporations. The architectural diversity of UB's fifty-three buildings, from stately homes as well as new- er structures of modern design, reflects the origins and progress of the university and also embodies its twofold commitment to solidity and change. The entrance to Marina Dining Hall, was once the entrance arch to the es- tate of Phineas Taylor Barnum, who served as Mayor of Bridgeport from 1875 to 1876 and played a crucial role in the city's cultural and economic development. Bryant Hall, with its inlaid mosaic entryway and ornately carved banisters and ceilings, was built in 1895 for inventor Waldo C.Bryant. The Carstensen Hall is a facsimile of a pavilion at the 1893 Columbian Exposition. It was designed in 1899 for the chemist George Edwards, whose research led to improving the durability of sil- ver plate. Between the campus and Seaside Park is the Perry Arch, designed by Henry Ba- con, who also designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. The more modern buildings house academ-ic and student life on campus: The Arnold Bernhard Arts and Humani- ties Center is a focal point for the cultural life of the University and of the Greater Bridgeport community, as well as the cen- ter for the study and appreciation of art, music, cinema, design and drama. Facili- ties include classrooms, studios, the 950- seat Andre and Clara Mertens Theater, the small in-the-round experimental Austin W . Mather Theatre, the Littlefield Recital Hall, and the Schelfhaudt Gallery. Located on the ninth floor is the Henry B. duPont III Tower Room, used for meetings and receptions.The John J. Cox Student Center provides so- cial, recreational, and extracurricular cultural programs. It has a social hall with a seating capacity of 400; lounges and meeting rooms; a games room and bowling alley; the office of The Scribe (the campus newspaper); the studio and transmitter of WPKN (an indepen- dent non-commercial FM radio station); and offices of the Student Congress and student clubs and organizations, as well as offices of the Student Development division. The Charles A. Dana Hall of Science is de- signed for study and research in biology, chemistry, physics, health sciences, medical laboratory science and geology. There is a 285-seat lecture auditorium, and the unique Science Wall of Honor commemorating thir - ty-seven of the world's \"Immortals of Sci- ence.\" It is also the home of the School of Arts and Sciences. Eleanor Naylor Dana Hall provides facili- ties for the Physician Assistant Program and the graduate program in Human Nutrition. The UB Health Sciences Center houses the UB Clinics in Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Dental Hygiene, and Naturopathic care. Also it is the home to the Administration for the Acupunc-ture Institute, College of Naturopathic Medi- cine and the Fones School of Dental Hygiene. The Harvey Hubbell Gymnasium is the center for intercollegiate sports programs. It seats 2,500 spectators. Mandeville Hall houses the School of Busi- ness and a major computer laboratory. The College of Chiropractic Building has class and conference rooms, offices, a labo- ratory, and an auditorium seating two hun- dred people. It is equipped with the modern facilities necessary for the professional pro-grams offered by the Chiropractic faculty. The Technology Building provides the engi- neering disciplines with the special capabili- ties and equipment needed for programs in biomedical, mechanical, electrical and com-puter engineering.

DEFERMENT PAYMENT OPTION (DIRECT PAYMENT) Students eligible for an external scholarship or for whom an employer pays their tuition may qualify for the deferment/direct pay- ment option. Consult your sponsor to deter - mine if a direct billing agreement has been established with the University of Bridge- port. If one has been established, you need a letter, on company letterhead, from your sponsor that includes your name, eligible program, maximum tuition amount where the bill should be sent. The letter should be forwarded to the Office of Student Finan- cial Services, at 126 Park Avenue, Bridge-port, CT 06604 or faxed a (203) 576-4570. Students are responsible for obtaining a de- ferment payment /direct billing option letter from their sponsor for the initial registration and ensure that it is received at the Office of Student Financial Services by the tuition due date. Students who are unable to obtain a deferment payment/direct billing letter by the payment deadline must pay their tuition prior to the start of the semester. Students must pay any fees not covered by the em-ployer's deferment/ direct payment plan at time of registration. Tuition, Fees and Other Expenses13Should employment cease with sponsor or conditions of sponsorship are not met, the student is responsible for all tuitions and fees. A financial obligation continues to ex-ist when using a financial aid deferment. Therefore, a transcript hold will be applied to the student record throughout the defer - ment period. Official transcripts will not be released until all University of Bridgeport financial obligations have been satisfied. TUITION REIMBURSEMENT Students who receive tuition reimbursement may defer fifty percent (50%) of their course tuition for up to thirty (30) days after the semester ends. To facilitate reimbursement, upon request, a grade and fee report will be mailed to every student who has a company letter on file; email grade_fee@bridgeport.edu to process this request. To defer partial tuition, the following requirements must be met: 1. All prior balances must be paid. 2. A letter on company letterhead that states the company policy and verifies the stu- dent's eligibility must be submitted to the Office of Student Financial Services each semester. 3. A down payment of fifty percent (50%) percent must be paid to UB's Cashier at time of registration. 4. Payment of the deferred tuition must be received by the University Cashier within thirty (30) days of the end of the semester for which the deferment was granted. De-ferred tuition is due by the deferred due date regardless of whether the student has been reimbursed by the employer. FINANCIAL AID DEFERMENT WITHOUT FEE (DOMESTIC STUDENTS) Domestic students who receive a Financial Aid award letter may deduct each certified award amount (signified by an \"A\" rather than an \"E\" in the ACT field on the award letter) from their balance due. Lender fees (usually 1%) should be deducted from each loan award, excluding Perkins loans. When an \"E\" appears in the ACT field, this usu- ally indicates an action is required before the award will be credited to the student's AR account. In these cases, students must contact the Office of Student Financial Services at 203-576-4568 for assistance in determining which action is necessary for the financial aid to be credited to their ac-count. Please note work-study awards are not deducted from the amount due since the student will be eligible to earn up to this amount through student employment. Federal Regulations require the University to issue a paycheck directly to the student for hours worked. PERKINS LOANS: Perkins loan recipients must electronically sign for their Perkins loan advance every year within the first two weeks of the start of classes to ensure credit of this award to their account. FEDERAL DIRECT LOANS: Loan origination fees will reduce the amount of loan funds received. These fees (normally 1%) should be deducted from the amount shown in the award letter before deducting the amount of these funds from the final bill. ALTERNATIVE LOANS: Alternative loans are private loans offered through a lending institution and are not a part of federal student aid programs. Inter - est rate and repayment provisions vary from lender to lender. It is the responsibility of the student to research and understand the implications of borrowing an alternative loan.

STUDENT IDENTIFICATION CARDS A photo identification card must be ob- tained at the security department between the hours of 8 a.m. - 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.

This device must be obtained through the security department 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The PAL allows an indi- vidual to summon help immediately in the case of an emergency within the campus boundaries.

Once activated, the computer screen provides the individual's personal informa-tion, photo ID and the location from where the device was activated. The information is viewed by the dispatcher and is passed on to the patrol officers. Officers immediately respond to the call in search of the indi- vidual who activated the device.Tuition, Fees and Other Expenses14Student Financial Services Director of Student Financial Services: Christine Falzerano Wahlstrom Library, Garden Level 126 Park CT 06604 Telephone: (203) 576-4568 Fax: (203) 576-4570 Financial Aid The Office of Student Financial Services helps provide access to the educational opportunities available at the University of Bridgeport. Since students are admitted solely on the basis of their academic and personal qualities, without regard to their fi- nancial circumstances, the University offers a variety of financial aid and scholarship programs to provide financial assistance to qualified students. The University of Bridgeport subscribes to the policy that eligibility for scholarship aid should depend on the student's achieve-ment and promise, but that the amount of aid should depend on the relative financial need of the student and his or her family. The financial need of most students at the University is met in the form of scholarships, grants, loans and student employment. Funds are available to the student through the University of Bridgeport from federal and state governments, private foundations and University resources. The University of Bridgeport awards merit scholarships recognizing outstanding aca-demic achievement and student leadership. In addition, there are a number of other payment assistance programs that include non-University tuition plans. Students enrolled in tuition discounted pro- grams such as the IDEAL program are not eligible to receive institutional scholarships or grants. The Office of Student Financial Services de- termines the amount and combinations of aid for which the student is eligible. Finan- cial aid decisions are made after a student has been admitted and requests for financial assistance will not influence a candidate's consideration for admission. Financial aid is awarded on an annual basis and continuing students must apply each year for aid.Application Procedures New domestic students are encouraged to begin to apply for financial aid at the same time they are seeking admission. Applicants for financial aid need to: 1. Complete the Free Application for Feder - al Student Aid (FAFSA) by going to www. FAFSA.gov. Be sure to include the Univer - sity's school code, 001416, on the FAFSA. 2. Submit copies of the student's and par - ents' federal tax transcript upon request from the Office of Student Financial Ser - vices . 3. Upon request from the Office of Student Financial Services , submit immigration documentation certifying permanent resi- dent status, if you are a non-U.S. citizen applying for need-based financial aid.

Satisfactory Academic Progress In order to maintain eligibility for financial aid a student must maintain satisfactory aca- demic progress. Financial aid recipients are expected to make reasonable progress as a condition of receiving and continuing to receive aid. Students' academic progress is assessed according to qualitative and pace measures as they apply. The qualitative measure is (grades) is similar to the aca-demic standards applied to all UB students. The pace measure (number of credit hours completed successfully/maximum time-frame) is used to monitor progress toward degree completion. For a student to be making satisfactory academic progress the student must meet the following qualitative GPA standards and have completed, with a passing grade, at least 67% of the cumula- tive attempted credits. Undergraduate CREDITS ATTEMPTED MINIMUM C.G.P.A. (including transfer credit) 1 - 24 1.5 25 - 48 1.7 49 - 59 1.9 60 or more 2.0 Graduate Graduate students must maintain a C.G.P.A. of 3.0 and complete 68% of the cumulative at-tempted credits. FINANCIAL AID PROVISIONAL STATUS Students not meeting satisfactory academic standards for a given academic term, as out- lined above, are notified in writing and will be placed on financial aid probation for one semester for which they may receive their aid. At the end of the probationary semes-ter, satisfactory academic progress will be reviewed. If the student meets the minimum standards as outlined, the probationary sta-tus will be lifted. If minimum standards are not met, the student will forfeit his or her future eligibility for financial aid and will be notified in writing. Students who have not maintained eligibil- ity to receive financial aid due to unsatisfac- tory academic progress may appeal for one additional semester of probationary eligibil- ity. Also, the student must include an aca- demic improvement plan, signed by the stu-dent's academic advisor or Dean, outlining the steps the student will follow to improve their GPA and/or completion rate. Appeals must be submitted to the Office of Student Financial Services within 10 calendar days of receipt of notice of action taken for com-mittee review. The decision of the commit- tee is final. Late or incomplete appeals will not be accepted or reviewed. REINSTATEMENT OF AID If a student is re-admitted, the University will consider the student's application for 15financial aid. Reinstatement of aid is not au- tomatic and the student must submit a letter to the Office of Student Financial Services requesting a reinstatement. In order to re-main eligible for aid, students must meet the minimum academic progress standards as outlined or lose eligibility for the follow-ing semester. FINANCIAL AID RETURN POLICY Students withdrawing from all courses should see financial aid as it is important to discuss withdrawal and refund as it pertains to the individual student, and its implica-tions for balances owed to the University, federal student loan repayment and future eligibility for financial assistance. Return of Institutional Aid Students withdrawing within the Univer - sity's Tuition Refund Schedule (see Tuition, Fees and Other Expenses) will have the same schedule applied to their University of Bridgeport aid. Return of Federal Aid If you have been awarded federal (Title IV) aid and you withdraw before complet- ing 60 % of the semester your financial aid award will be recalculated, according to the percentage of the semester you have com- pleted. The formula for calculating this per - centage is: (Days enrolled) - (Official breaks of five days or longer) Total number of class days in the semester Financial Assistance Programs The University of Bridgeport believes that a student's achievements should be recog- nized and rewarded. Our scholarships and grants enable students who have potential and want to benefit from a high quality aca- demic program.

Student Center 244 University CT 06604 Telephone: (203) 576-4392 or 4393 E-mail: deanofstudents@bridgeport.edu The contribution of the Division of Student Affairs to the University of Bridgeport and its students arises out of the special perspec-tive which members of the student affairs staff have about students and their growth and development, their experiences, and their campus environments. This perspec- tive draws on research about teaching and learning, which emphasize the importance of community, diversity, and individual dif- ferences to the educational experience. The Student Life program is administered through the Division of Student Affairs by the Dean of Students. It includes career services, counseling and disability services, health services, interfaith center, interna- tional student affairs, residential life and student conduct, student activities and com-munity services. The Division of Student Affairs enhances and supports the mission, goals, and objec- tives of the University of Bridgeport as an international, culturally diverse supportive learning environment, preparing graduates for life and leadership in an increasingly in-terconnected world. In this role, the staff of the student affairs division has a diverse and complicated set of responsibilities: to advocate for the common good while championing the rights of the individual; to encourage intelligent risk-taking while setting limits on behavior; and to promote independent thought while teaching inter - dependent behavior. The extent to which the University is suc- cessful in creating a climate in which these contradictory ends can coexist is reflected in how well students are able to recognize and deal with such contradictions both dur - ing and after their college experience. The Division of Student Affairs is committed to assisting students and the University of Bridgeport community as they seek to meet the challenges inherent in balancing these complex and often competing goals. \u2014Adopted from A Perspective on Student Affairs, National Association of Student Per - sonnel Administrators, 1987. Students are encouraged to take an active role in the life of the campus community, where there are many opportunities to con- tribute to group decisions, practice leader - ship, sort out priorities and make personal choices. Students at the University of Bridge- port are responsible for making their own decisions and forming their own judgments concerning personal, social and academic activities. They share the responsibility for maintaining the educational climate needed for learning and for personal growth. The University retains high expectations of ap- propriate behavior, and expects that when students decide to enroll they will abide by all the rules of the University. When the University deems it necessary it reserves the right to notify the parent or guardian to whom a student is financially dependent regarding the health, academic or disciplinary status of the student. (De- pendency is defined by Section 152 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code). Services ADVISING All students are assigned a faculty advisor through their departments and colleges. It is incumbent upon the student to meet with his/her advisor on a regular basis. (See Academic Regulations). CAREER SERVICES CENTER The Career Services Center is a comprehen- sive career counseling and resource center dedicated to empowering students as active participants in their own career develop-ment. The Career Services Center is open to all students and alumni seeking assistance with career related issues. Career Services staff meets individually with students and alumni to discuss major selection, career decision making, graduate school prepa-ration, as well as job and internship plan- ning. One-on-one career counseling ap- pointments and walk-in hours (designated times where no appointment is necessary) are available to all students and alumni, as well as access to online resume/cover let-ter critiques. In addition, the center offers a variety of educational materials and on- line resources through the Career Services Virtual Career Center (through myUB portal access). UB's Career Services Center also hosts ca- reer fairs and other related career develop-ment workshops and events throughout the year.

ORIENTATION New student orientation programs are de-signed to introduce students to the Univer - sity of Bridgeport community. The orienta-tion program begins a few days prior to the start of classes. This gives incoming students the opportunity to get settled in their new environment and to become familiar with their academic program. Formal and infor - mal social and informational sessions pro-vide students with the opportunity not only to learn about the University's policies, but to meet and socialize with other students. All new students are expected to attend. STUDENT ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS Extracurricular activities are an important part of the college experience. Students plan programs and activities that are of in- terest to them.

There are many op- portunities for students to participate in the planning of these activities.

Traditional students are those enrolled in a regular program on the Bridgeport campus in the usual University manner in terms of scheduling and location. Non-traditional students are those enrolled in adult degree programs and those attending class at UB-Stamford Center or any of our other branch campuses.

Those who are living at home with par - ents, a spouse or other immediate rela-tives within a 50 mile driving distance of the University. Exceptions to this policy must be requested from the Office of Residential Life and Stu- dent Conduct in writing and approved by the Director of Residential Life and Student Conduct by the first day of classes. The Res- idential Life \"Easy Living\" package includes both room and a choice of meal plan op-tions. Meals are served three times daily, with the exception of Saturday and Sunday when two meals are served. The Dining Hall is closed during vacation periods as sched- uled in the University calendar. Kosher meals are available through the Dining Hall upon request. Winter and summer housing is available on a limited basis and under separate contract. Additional requirements may apply. The Residence Hall and Meal contracts, once signed by the student, are binding for the academic year (not the semester).Student Conduct and General Standards Students at the University of Bridgeport are expected to respect the rights of others, exercise responsible judgment and follow high standards of personal conduct. Stu-dents are expected to involve themselves in activities that promote the welfare of the University and to behave with courtesy and restraint toward fellow students and Univer - sity staff. The University fosters a multicul-tural, international environment and does not condone or tolerate discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, color, religion, age, national or ethnic ori-gin, creed, political affiliation, or handicap. The University strives to create an atmo- sphere of mutual trust between individuals, promoting self-discipline, and community standards. At the same time, the University maintains concern about the behavior of its students both on and off campus. In the maintenance of its academic, social and health standards, the University reserves the right to be the sole determiner as to whether a student should be removed from residence life, re-ceive fines or sanctions, be suspended or expelled, granted a leave of absence or dismissed. A student suspended, expelled from the University is responsible for the full payment of his/her financial charges for the semester. Students are expected to conform to all gov- erning regulations of the University as out- lined in the Key to UB (Student Handbook), the Catalog and all official notifications of policy. A student will be subject to Univer - sity disciplinary procedures if his/her on or off-campus behavior results in violations of these regulations, civil and/or criminal law. Disciplinary action, notification of charges, disciplinary procedures, appeals and a re-view of actions that may lead to disciplinary procedures are identified and described in the Key to UB (Student Handbook). It is the responsibility of the student to familiar - ize him/herself with all University and Resi-dence Hall codes, regulations and policies, which are all available on-line on the Uni- versity's website and portal. Student Affairs26Academic Regulations and Procedures GENERAL INFORMATION The Advising System The University provides academic and per - sonal services to support each student's ef- fort to gain the best possible undergradu- ate education. Selecting a course of study, choosing a major, and deciding upon a ca- reer are crucial decisions for every student. The Advising System functions to assist stu-dents in designing their programs according to their individual interests and needs. Students are assigned a faculty advisor upon acceptance to the University. Fac- ulty advisors are available for consultation throughout the student's tenure for purpos- es of academic advisement and assistance with course selection. Advisors approve registrations for traditional undergraduates and program or major changes for all stu- dents. For assistance with non-academic concerns, professional counselors are avail- able through the University's Student Affairs Division. Interruption of Studies WITHDRAWAL FROM A COURSE Undergraduate students may withdraw from any course with advisor approval. Gradu- ate students may withdraw from any course other than a Thesis, Independent Study, Research or equivalent. Course withdraw- als may be requested up to the last date to withdraw from courses as published in the course schedule book or academic calen- dar. To withdraw from a course, obtain a Schedule Adjustment Form from the Office of the Registrar and take it to your advisor. Advisor's signature is required to withdraw from any course. Return the signed with-drawal form to the Office of the Registrar for processing. If a student officially withdraws from a course during the first three weeks of a class, no grade will be reported and the course will not appear on the student's tran-script. On occasions a withdrawal is granted after the first 20 days for reasons beyond the student's control as determined by the student's advisor. In these cases, a \"W\" will be posted on the student's transcript for the course. When a student registers for a course, but ceases to attend class with- out filing an application for withdrawal a grade of \"F\" shall be posted to the student's transcript. Tuition refunds for course with- drawals will be calculated according to the University's official refund policy. Federal Financial Aid awards are subject to adjust- ment when a student withdraws from the University. Cessation of attendance, notice to instructors, or telephone calls to the Uni- versity, do not constitute official withdrawal from the University. WITHDRAWING FROM THE UNIVERSITY Students who withdraw from all courses and thus from the University, must file an Application to Withdraw at the Office of the Registrar. Students must meet with the Dean of Students prior to submitting the withdrawal form to the Registrar. No student is considered officially with- drawn and no refund of tuition will be made unless the student has contacted the Office of the Registrar. If a student fails to register for a semester without being granted a leave of absence, or the leave of absence has expired, the student will be administratively withdrawn from the University. CANCELLATION Students presently enrolled may cancel their registration or officially withdraw for the subsequent semester while completing the current one. Students must contact the Office of the Registrar to cancel classes. INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ATTEN- DANCE POLICY International students must pursue a full-time course of study to maintain status and are required by the conditions of their visa to attend scheduled classes. Failure to at-tend classes may lead to termination of SEVIS records. Before making changes to their schedules, International students must speak with an academic advisor and consult with International Student Services. ISS is located on the Garden Level of Wahlstrom Library.Readmission REGULAR READMISSION A student who officially or unofficially with - draws from the University must apply for read - mission. Readmission is necessary with any break in attendance for full-time students and after a break of more than one semester for part-time students. A student who with- draws officially, or unofficially, and subse-quently applies for readmission is required to meet the degree requirements and con- ditions current at the time of readmission. Students who have attended another ac- credited institution in the interim must pres- ent complete official transcripts with their application for readmission. Applications for readmission are available from the Registrar's Office. READMISSION IN CASES OF DISCIPLINARY EXPULSION AND SUSPENSION Disciplinary expulsion and suspension may be incurred as a result of unacceptable con- duct. See the Key to UB for rules, regulations and procedures for readmission. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students who must discontinue enrollment for less than one academic year and who have a commitment to return to the Uni- versity must submit a written request for a Leave of Absence to the Office of the Regis- trar. A copy of this request must also be sent to the Dean or Director of the student's pro-gram. Students who are in good academic standing and who have met all University requirements may return to the University at the beginning of any semester within the one-year Leave of Absence period. A leave of absence may be extended for an additional year upon approval of the pro- gram Dean or Director. A written request is required for consideration of an extended leave of absence and the leave will be not-ed on the student's permanent record. 27FIVE YEAR RULE FOR UNDER- GRADUATE STUDENTS Students who interrupt their studies for a pe- riod exceeding five years must obtain written permission from the Dean of their College or Director of the School to apply previously earned credits toward their degree. Application for Graduation Applications must be presented to your De-partment Chairperson (major area and mi- nor area) in time to be filed with the Dean of your College by the application deadline. Undergraduate students should consult with their faculty advisor a semester before their graduation date so that a Graduation Checklist can be completed. Such con- sultation enables the advisor to check the student's records for discrepancies and al-lows some time during the last semester to resolve problems if any appear. The fulfill- ment of the graduate requirements is the student's responsibility. For deadlines for graduation applications, please see the Academic Calendar Students who are required to take a course/s after the expected graduation date must re-apply for graduation and pay an additional application fee. All blanks on the application form must be completed. Diplomas will be printed exactly as the name appears on the appli- cation form. The University of Bridgeport holds one ceremony in May of each year. A fee must be paid whether or not you participate in the ceremony. Diplomas are normally mailed within 45 days of the end of the term for which a student is graduat- ing. Release of diplomas is dependent on all graduation requirements and financial obligations to the University of Bridgeport (including Perkins Loans) being satisfied. Diplomas are mailed to the address listed on the graduation application form. If you have a change of address during the course of the graduation process, please email the Registrar at registrar@bridgeport.edu so that your records can be updated. Transcripts Students may request official transcripts to be mailed to other institutions, prospective employers, or other authorized agencies, by completing a transcript request from avail-able in the Office of the Registrar. Please allow ten (10) days for requests sent by mail to be processed. Each graduating stu- dent will receive one free, unofficial copy of his/her transcript together with his/her diploma upon graduation. Subsequent tran- script requests must be made to the Office of the Registrar in writing. Transcripts will be mailed to the address listed on the tran- script request form. UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS & PROCEDURES Classification of Undergraduate Students A student who has formally applied for ad- mission to the University and has been admit- ted to one of its Colleges as a degree candi- date is a matriculated student. An applicant admitted with permission to take courses for which he or she is qualified, but not as a de- gree candidate, is a special student. Special students may later apply for matriculation and are subject to the same academic regu- lations as matriculated students. Only matriculated students carrying at least twelve semester hours are eligible for elec- tion to class and other offices (with the ex- ception of the Part-time Student Council, and University Senate) FULL-TIME STUDENTS Normal academic progress is maintained by a student who: 1. Has been accepted into a degree pro-gram; 2. Is fulfilling the requirements of that de-gree program as described in this Cata-log; 3. Has a cumulative quality point ratio of at least 2.0 (\"C\" average), or that required by the specific degree program if it is higher than 2.0; and 4. Registers for and completes at least 12 se-mester hours of credit each term (exclud-ing co-op terms). PART-TIME STUDENTSNormal academic progress is maintained by a student who: 1. Has been accepted into a degree pro-gram; 2. Is fulfilling the requirements of that de- gree program as described in this cata- log; 3. Has a cumulative quality point ratio of at least 2.0 (\"C\" average), or that required by the specific degree program if it is higher than 2.0; and 4. Registers for and completes between 1 and 11 semester hours of credit each term. CLASS STANDING Students are classified according to the number of college hours satisfactorily com- pleted: Freshman 0-30 semester hours Sophomore 31-60 semester hours Junior 61-90 semester hours Senior 91 and above THE MAJOR Most students matriculating in programs leading to an Associate's or Bachelor's de- gree declare a major when they are admit- ted to the university. The student must earn a grade of \"C-\" or better in every major course. However, the student's overall quality point ratio in ma-jor courses must be at least 2.0. In some cases, departmental requirements may ex- ceed these minimums. If a student earns a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in a course in the major field, he or she must obtain a written state- ment from the department chair specifying the procedure necessary to remedy the de- ficiency and remain in the major. THE MINOR The University offers the option of selecting a second area of specialization. Like the ma- jor, the minor was conceived to provide a unified, coherent program in a discipline or area of knowledge. While requiring a sec- ond focus for the student's intellectual inter - ests, it enables him or her to investigate the important concepts of a specific area and to acquire a firm basis for further study. In terms of career preparation, the minor Academic Regulations and Procedures28option can complement a regular major pro- gram or it may add an entirely new dimen- sion to the traditional curriculum. A minor is a minimum of 18 credits to be defined by the School and Department. Students who wish to pursue a minor should obtain the application in the Dean's or Director's office of the College or School in which the minor is offered. Minors may be assigned in the following areas: Accounting Americas Studies Asia Pacific Studies Business AdministrationChemistry Computer Engineering Computer ScienceCriminal Justice Electrical Engineering Fashion MerchandisingFinanceGraphic Design Philosophy GerontologyHistory Human Services Industrial DesignInterior Design International Businesswith the chair of the anticipated major de- partment to formulate a curriculum plan for the completion of that degree. Registration for Courses The student must formally register for courses during the regular or early regis- tration period. All charges for the semester are payable in full before or during regis-tration unless the student has applied for the deferred payment plan. A program of fifteen or sixteen semester hours constitutes a normal load. No student will be permitted to register for more than eighteen semester hours in any one semester without the prior written approval of the appropriate College Dean or School Director. CHANGE OF REGISTRATION All changes of registration require the prior written approval of the student's faculty ad- visor. Students shall refer to the published course schedule and Key to UB to determine additional approval procedures and require- ments for all program changes. The student must submit all approved changes of reg- istration, including course withdrawals, to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadlines. CLASS ATTENDANCE Undergraduate students are expected to attend their classes regularly. The instruc- tor shall specify in the course syllabus at the beginning of the semester the extent to which the attendance factor will be taken into account when grades are calculated. Due allowance, however, will be made for such factors as illness, inclement weather, and severe personal or family problems. UNIVERSAL ENGLISH All student papers submitted to any instructor at the University must be of University stan- dard in form, spelling, punctuation and literary organization. Instructors may refuse to read or to correct papers that are not in keeping with the standards of good English usage. Grades and Quality Points A semester hour is the unit by which credits are measured. A quality point is the numeri-cal value assigned to letter grades A-F. Each grade is assigned quality points as shown below. The faculty uses the following cri- teria as bases for grades may be assigned with \"+\" and \"-\" signs. Other grades include pass-fail (earned un- der the University Pass/Fail Program): \"S\" - satisfactory completion of course require-ments; and \"U\" - has not completed course requirements. QUALITY POINTS QUALITY POINTS GRADE PER SEMESTER HOUR GRADE PER SEMESTER HOUR A 4.00 C 2.00 A- 3.67 0.67 C+ 2.33 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semester hours attempted into the number of quality points earned. Non-credit cours-es and grades of pass in pass/fail courses are exempted from the computation of the quality point ratio. Incomplete (\"I\" or \"R\") grades are not included in this computation until converted to a letter grade. REPEATED COURSES Students may repeat any course at any grade level below \"A\". The grade from the first re- peat of a given course will replace the first- time grade for the computation of the QPR, the original grade however, will remain on the transcript. The grade for a course re- peated more than twice will be the average of all of the grades earned each time the course was taken. All repeated courses will be so indicated on the transcript. PASS/FAIL OPTION (FREE ELECTIVES ONLY) Undergraduate students may elect to take up to 6 courses in an academic degree pro- gram on the pass/fail basis. Only free elec- tives may be chosen for the pass/fail op-tion, and no more than two courses may be on that basis in a given semester. Request to take a course on the pass/fail basis must be Academic Regulations and Procedures Accounting Americas StudiesAsia Pacific Studies Business Administration Chemistry Computer EngineeringComputer Science Criminal Justice Electrical EngineeringFashion MerchandisingFinanceGraphic Design Philosophy GerontologyHistoryHuman ServicesIndustrial Design Interior Design International BusinessInternational Political Economy & Diplomacy Literature & Civilization Management & Industrial Relations MarketingMartial ArtsMass CommunicationsMathematics Middle East Studies Music New Media StudiesPeace and Development Studies Political Science PsychologyReligion and PoliticsSociology Social Science World ReligionsInternational Political Economy & Diplomacy Literature & Civilization Management & Industrial Relations Marketing Martial ArtsMass Communications Mathematics Middle East StudiesMusic New Media Studies Peace and Development Studies Political SciencePsychology Religion and Politics SociologySocial Science World Religions UNSPECIFIED STATUS Unspecified status is designed primarily for those students who have not yet chosen a specific field of concentration within their College. The courses which they take under these circumstances will fulfill the majority of general college requirements during the first and second year of study. Students who have been admitted to un- specified status must follow the procedure for change of major in order to become ad-mitted to a specific major and must declare a major by the end of the sophomore year. CHANGE OF MAJOR If after matriculation a student wishes to change a major, it must be initiated by the student through the office of the senior administrator of the College or School. In some cases, change of program may require a reevaluation of semester hours earned at UB or transferred from another institution. It is the student's responsibility to consult 29made in writing on the appropriate form af- ter registration in the course, but absolutely no later than the tenth day of scheduled classes in a regular semester, the fifth day for a ten-week course, or the third day for a five-week course. Students should review the complete regulations with their advi-sors before requesting the pass/fail option through the Registrar's Office. INCOMPLETE WORK Incomplete grades (\"I\" or \"R\") must be re- corded by the date stipulated by the Regis- trar at the end of the semester. No incom- plete will be so recorded by the Registrar unless it is accompanied by a clear indica- tion from the course instructor of the nature of the work to be made up. The Registrar will provide appropriate forms with grade sheets. This information will be placed in the student files. a. An \"I\" (incomplete) grade designates in-complete work in a course at the time of grading for reasons beyond the student's control and determined to be bona fide by the instructor. These would include absence from a final examination or in- ability to complete terminal assignments due to illness, employment conflicts, etc. In such cases where the \"I\" grade is awarded the incomplete will revert to a failing grade if the unfinished work is not satisfactorily completed by the end of the semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted, exclusive of the summer ses - sions. This time can be extended by the instructor for legitimate reasons. b. A grade of \"R\" indicates incomplete work in thesis, research, or undergradu- ate or graduate student project courses. The \"R\" grade must be removed within a period of time specified by the instruc- tor/mentor/project advisor or director. It must be within the maximum time allowable for degree completion in the academic program where the degree is being sought. \"W\" GRADE No student may withdraw from a course without the knowledge of his/her academic advisor, as indicated by that advisor's signa- ture on the change of schedule form. With-drawal \"W\" grades are assigned based on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change of registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. This includes withdrawals initiated by the stu- dent and those initiated by the University (e.g., cancellation of course sections). 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the official change of reg- istration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period in a given semester or summer session, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with the grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR but do count toward \"hours at- tempted.\" 3. The names of students who have official-ly withdrawn from a course and received the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, including \"late\" withdrawals, must be individually approved by the appropriate Dean or Director and the Provost before they be- come official and are recorded. CARNEGIE UNIT OF CREDIT Note: The application of the Carnegie unit of credit has implications for graduation re- quirements, transfer credit policy, faculty load and for measuring program hours/in-come. The Carnegie Unit of Credit provides a guideline on the amount of time that an undergraduate is expected to dedicate to a one semester hour course in order to re- ceive one semester hour of academic credit. The University of Bridgeport calibration of the Carnegie Unit of Credit is as follows: Onsite Lecture Classes: To receive one se- mester hour of academic credit, the student is expected to attend a 50 minute lecture class per week and spend approximately two hours on assignments and study out- side of the classroom throughout a fifteen week semester. Online or Blended Learning Classes: Through Blackboard, Wimba or other online tools and blended learning, students would be expected to complete 2.5 hours of activi-ties per week over fifteen weeks to receive one semester hour of academic credit. This would include activities such as reading and responding to posted course materials, discussion board postings, and Skype or Wimba discussions. Onsite Activity-based Classes: One hour and forty minutes of engagement in discipline- based activity and fifty minutes of study per week throughout fifteen weeks. Clinics, Studios and Laboratory-Based Class: 2.5 hours of laboratory, clinical or studio activity per week for 15 weeks. Independent Study: 2.5 Semester hours of Study per week over a 15 week Semester.Other Forms of Learning: Academic credit based on a demonstration of competency in defined academic outcomes will be the exception and will be based on accepted instruments approved by the Deans and Program Chairs. These can include CLWEP, CLEP tests, or examination of a portfolio by trained academics in the discipline in which the student seeks credit. In all of these learning formats, contact hours and/or study/assignment hours would be increased each week in a summer or concentrated session to assure compli- ance with unit of credit guidelines. Approved by University of Bridgeport Sen- ate, November 30, 2010 Off-Campus Study Matriculated students are expected to take the courses for their degrees at the Universi- ty of Bridgeport. Permission to take courses at other institutions for transfer credit will be given only for good and valid reasons and must be approved in advance and in writing by the student's advisor. Permission will not be granted for courses currently offered by the University or courses within the last thir - ty semester hours before graduation, or for courses previously failed at the University. Matriculated students may not take courses at junior or community colleges for transfer credit at the junior or senior level toward their degrees. CREDIT FOR LIFE WORK EXPERIENCE (CLWEP) Some students acquire mastery over course subject matter through prior work or train-Academic Regulations and Procedures30ing experience. Many departments have de- veloped examination and other assessment procedures to provide the possibility of credit for those experiences which correlate to specific course offerings in the University Catalog. CLWEP credit may not be used to satisfy the minimum University 30-hour residency re- quirement. CLWEP credit is included in the student's semester hours earned at the Uni- versity and also in the total number of UB hours used to determine eligibility for grad-uation honors. However, such credit is not computed in the student's quality point ra-tio at the University. Information on subject matter and evaluation procedures is avail- able in the office of the Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. COLLEGE LEVEL Eq UIVALENT PROFICIENCY EXAM (CLEP) The University of Bridgeport participates in the Educational Testing Service's College Level Equivalent Proficiency Exam pro- gram. The basic purpose of this program is to give the student and non-traditional learner a means for assessing their levels of achievement and for requesting college credit for such achievement. Undergraduate students may earn up to 30 semester hours of credit (one year's studies) by demonstrating subject area competence through testing. CLEP credit may not be used to satisfy the minimum University 30-hour residency requirement. CLEP credit is not in- cluded in the student's credit hours earned at the University of Bridgeport and is not com- puted in the student's quality point ratio at the University. CLEP credit is not considered in the total number of UB hours used to de- termine eligibility for graduation honors. Information on subject matter and testing procedure is available in the office of the Dean of the School of Continuing and Pro- fessional Studies. ADVANCED PLACEMENT A student may enter the University of Bridge-port as a freshman, but with advanced stand- ing toward a degree. Advanced standing may be achieved by taking the Advanced Placement examinations administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. A score of three or above allows the student to earn up to eight credits in one subject area. Well qualified students may also earn advanced placement by taking courses for college credit while in secondary school. Information regarding Advanced Placement is available in the Office of Admissions. Academic Status of Students The following policies and standards define the minimum requirements for maintain- ing academic status in the undergraduate degree programs of the University. Higher requirements may be established by the faculty for specific programs, subject to ap- proval by appropriate College committees, the appropriate senior administrator of the College or School and the Provost. Such re- quirements are described in the appropriate section of this catalog. NORMAL ACADEMIC PROGRESS Normal academic progress refers to a stu-dent's scholastic status in a degree program. The student who is not maintaining normal academic progress will be permitted to re- main in a degree program while attempting to reestablish normal academic progress, unless and until the student is subject to academic separation as described below. A student may be awarded a degree only when all degree requirements have been satis- fied. In particular, a student who has failed to maintain normal academic progress at some point, must have reestablished normal aca- demic progress before a degree is awarded. Academic Separation The following policies and procedures apply to all students, both matriculated and spe- cial. FULL-TIME STUDENTS In order to maintain satisfactory progress as a full-time student, it is necessary to attempt a minimum of 12 credits per semester. A full-time student whose quality point ratio is below 2.0 for a given semester is sent a let- ter of warning at the end of that semester. A full-time student, who has attempted fewer than 19 semester hours and whose quality point ratio is below .75 is automati-cally separated at the conclusion of a spring semester. A student is automatically separated from the University at the conclusion of a spring semester when the cumulative quality point ratio and UB semester hours attempted are as follows: UB SEMESTER HOURS ATTEMPTED* QPR 24 Below 1.5 48 Below 1.7 72 Below 1.9 96 or more Below 2.0 * Retaking a course does not count toward this total. Maintaining satisfactory academic progress is essential in order to remain eligible for financial aid. Please refer to the financial aid section for further information on main - taining eligibility for financial aid. PART-TIME STUDENTS A student is automatically separated from the University when the cumulative quality point ratio and UB semester hours attempt- ed are as follows: UB SEMESTER HOURS ATTEMPTED* QPR 24 Below 1.5 48 Below 1.7 72 Below 1.9 96 or more Below 2.0 READMISSION A student who has been separated from the University under the above provisions may apply for readmission to the University no sooner than one full semester after separa-tion. A readmission form is available from the Office of the Registrar. No course work at the University of Bridgeport is permitted during the period of separation. NOTIFICATION A student will be notified of his/her sepa-ration before the beginning of the follow- ing semester. It is, however, the student's responsibility to be aware of his or her aca-demic status at all times. APPEALS Actions taken under the regulations pertain-ing to Academic Separation may have an immediate impact on a student's eligibility Academic Regulations and Procedures31for financial aid. Students may appeal ac- tions taken pursuant to these regulations. Appeals must be made in writing directly to the Academic Separation Appeals Commit-tee within ten calendar days of receipt of notice of the action taken. The decision of the Dean will be made within twenty-one calendar days of the date of the receipt of the appeal. An appeal of separation from the University that is granted places the student in a pro- bationary status. The conditions of this sta-tus, including its maximum duration, will be specified in the Committee decision grant-ing the appeal. Change of Status FROM FULL-TIME TO PART-TIME Students wishing to transfer from full-time to part-time status must secure the neces- sary forms from the Registrar's Office. FROM PART-TIME TO FULL-TIME Students wishing to transfer from part-time to full-time status must secure the necessary forms from the Registrar's Office. Academic Honors PRESIDENT'S LIST A full-time student who, in a given semes- ter, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.7 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the President's List at the end of that semes- ter. A part-time student who is matriculated and who, during a regular academic year, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.7 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the Presi-dent's List at the end of the academic year. DEAN'S LIST A full-time student who, in a given semester, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.2 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the Dean's List at the end of that semester. A part-time student who is matriculated and who, dur - ing a regular academic year, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ra- tio of 3.2 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the Dean's List at the end of that academic year.

Requirements for Undergraduate Degrees The stipulations in the list immediately be- low are only those which are common to the awarding of the Bachelor's degree. Howev- er, requirements specific to each College or School and to individual curricula and dis- ciplines within each College or School also exist. The student must be especially careful to note all of these, since fulfillment of gradu- ation requirements is the individual student's responsibility. No permission for deviation from published requirements is official un- less it is made in writing and signed by the senior administrator of the College or School from which the degree is sought. It is rec- ognized that the requirements for graduation in individual Schools may change. A student must meet the requirements for graduation which are current at the time of graduation, and consistent to the greatest extent possible with the degree requirements in existence at the time of the student's entry into the major. However, whenever a program is altered it is the University's responsibility to translate the student's previously completed work into the new program requirements so that the con-tinuously enrolled student is not penalized for the adaptation. The only exception would be when the state or other licensing agency imposes a new requirement. The common requirements for awarding the Bachelor's de- gree follow. A student must: 1. Have been admitted as, or have achieved the status of, a matriculated student in the College, and must have attained upper - class or major status. 2. Have completed the last thirty semester hours of work toward his or her degree under the direct auspices of the Univer - sity. Under exceptional circumstances, the senior academic administrator may slightly modify this requirement. 3. Present an overall cumulative quality point ratio of at least 2.0 and, in addi-tion, must have a quality point ratio of 2.0 or better in those courses taken for credit in the major. Each individual course in the major must be passed with a grade of \"C-\" or better. The student must have earned the number of semester hours of credit required by the College or School and must not deviate from the curricu- lum as displayed in this catalog without the written approval of the appropriate senior academic administrator or his/her designate. GRADUATION HONORS Candidates for graduation who have com-pleted at least sixty semester hours of ac- ademic course work at the University of Bridgeport in their junior and senior years are eligible for honors upon recommenda- tion of the appropriate College faculty. The following standards are used: 1. The Bachelor's degree cum laude may be awarded to a student whose cumulative quality point ratio is at least 3.40. 2. The Bachelor's degree magna cum laude may be awarded to a student whose cumulative quality point ratio is at least 3.60. 3. The Bachelor's degree summa cum laude may be awarded to a student whose cumulative quality point ratio is at least 3.80. The Associate's degree may be awarded cum laude to a candidate with a minimum quality point ratio of 3.2 and magna cum laude to those with 3.5. A minimum of 45 semester hours must have been earned at Academic Regulations and Procedures32the University of Bridgeport. GRADUATE REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES *For the Regulations and Procedures pertain- ing to the Graduate Professional Programs in Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Naturopathic Med- icine and Human Nutrition, please see the ap-propriate program sections of this catalog. General Regulations 1. The mere completion of courses and re-quirements does not guarantee continua- tion in the graduate program or advance- ment to degree candidacy. 2. Every student must consult with his/her assigned advisor to ensure a carefully planned program of studies. 3. A graduate student is expected to com- plete his/her degree program within sev- en years of admission. A student may, for sound and valid reasons, request his/her Dean for an extension of this time limit. Such a request must have the approval of the student's advisor, and Department. 4. The amount of graduate work transfer - able to a graduate degree is limited to two graduate courses. Courses applied to one degree or diploma normally are not trans- ferable to a second degree or diploma. Courses presented for transfer credit must be graduate level study completed with a grade of \"B\" or above at an accredited institution. The transferred courses should have been completed within the past sev- en years. The approval of additional transfer credit and waivers of the course time limit may be granted based on the approval of the Department Chair, School Director, and College Dean. 5. The requirements for a master's degree shall include at least one of the following: a comprehensive examination, a written thesis based on independent research, or completion of an appropriate special project. 6. Graduate programs require that all grades applied toward the degree be \"C\" or bet-ter. The grade of \"C- \" cannot be used to satisfy degree requirements.Probation and Separation Policy 1. The minimum cumulative grade point average necessary to continue graduate studies is 3.0 and the minimum semester grade point average to continue graduate studies is 2.0. 2. A student who does not meet either the semester or cumulative grade point aver - age will automatically be placed on pro-bation for the next semester of study. 3. A student placed on probation must meet the standard for continuation at the end of the probationary semester. Failure to meet the standard will result in automatic sepa- ration. 4. Separation from the Program of Study may be appealed to the Academic Ap-peals Committee of the Graduate Council. The appeal must be in writing and must be submitted within 15 days of notifica-tion of separation. 5. A student separated from a Program of Study may apply for re-admission to the Program 1 year from the date of separa- tion from the Program. 6. A student may not be placed on proba-tion more than twice. Failure to maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade point average or a semester grade point average of 2.0 a third time will result in automatic, non- appealable separation. Application for re-admission cannot be made sooner than 1 year after the date of separation. Classification of Students DEGREE STUDENTS All students who have formally declared their intent to pursue a program leading to a specified graduate degree are classified as Graduate Degree students and may fall into one of the following categories: REGULAR A student who has completed all the admis-sion requirements and who has presented a background of scholarship and performance that indicates his/her capacity to profit from and complete a degree program is admitted as a regular degree student. PROVISIONAL A student who has met the general require-ments for admission, but not those for full standing because the promise of achievement in the area of intended study cannot be ac-curately appraised at the time of admission, is admitted provisionally subject to conditions stated on the Certificate of Admission. DEGREE CANDIDATE A regular degree student who has success-fully completed the first 12 hours of graduate study under the direction of assigned advisors and is, in the opinion of the faculty, worthy of continuing the pursuit of an advanced degree at the University, is a degree candidate. Ap- plication for degree candidacy must be filed with the major department after completion of 12 semester hours. MATRICULATION MAINTENANCE All regular and provisional graduate stu- dents must maintain matriculation continu- ously until all degree requirements have been met. Students may maintain matricula-tion in the following ways: 1. By registering for degree required course work. 2. By registering for continuous matricula-tion. 3. Ed.D. candidates must register for \"Con- tinuing Dissertation research.\"* Students who fail to register for each se- mester through one of the options above will automatically be separated from their program. * See Insert for current year's Tuition, Fees, and Other Expenses. NON-DEGREE GRADUATE STUDENTS SPECIAL STUDENT A college graduate from an accredited insti-tution, who elects to take courses for which he/she is qualified but who has not been admitted to a degree program, is classified as a special student on the graduate level. If subsequently admitted to a degree program, there is no guarantee that courses taken as a special student will be counted towards the degree requirements; in any case, only twelve semester hours may be applied to a degree. Those graduate students classified as special graduate students are, therefore, urged to indicate to the Office of Admis-Academic Regulations and Procedures33Academic Regulations and Procedures sions and the Registrar whether they wish to change their status to regular degree stu- dent prior to or immediately upon comple- tion of twelve semester hours. In order to register for graduate courses as a special student, a completed Application for Graduate Studies must be on file in the Office of Admissions. Evaluation and Grading of Course Work \"A\" indicates distinction; for work of excep- tional quality. \"B\" indicates above-average achievement; quality expected of a graduate student. \"C\" indicates minimal achievement; not up to standards of graduate work. \"D\" indicates below average achievement; no graduate credit possible. \"I\" and \"R\" indicate incomplete graduate course work. (a) An \"I\" (incomplete) grade designates incomplete work in a course at the time of grading for reasons beyond the con- trol of the student and determined to be legitimate by the instructor. These would include absence from a final examina- tion or inability to complete terminal assignments due to illness, employment conflicts, etc. In such cases where the \"I\" grade is awarded the incomplete will re-vert to a failing grade if the unfinished work is not satisfactorily completed by the end of the semester immediately fol-lowing the one in which the incomplete was granted, exclusive of the summer sessions. This time can be extended by the instructor for legitimate reasons. (b) A grade of \"R\" indicates incomplete work in thesis, research, or undergraduate or graduate student project courses. The \"R\" grade must be removed within a pe-riod of time specified by the instructor/ mentor/project advisor or director. It must be within the maximum time allowable for degree completion in the academic pro-gram where the degree is being sought. \"W\" indicates approved student withdrawal. In addition to the above, the grades of \"A-\", \"B+', \"B-', \"C+', \"C-\" and \"D+\" may be as-signed for graduate courses.Semester Hours Carried per Semester Nine semester hours of credit per term nor - mally is considered a maximum full-time pro- gram for graduate students. A student desiring to take more than 12 semester hours must re-ceive written permission from his/her advisor and the Dean or Director of the appropriate college or school.34The Core Curriculum The University holds that professional and applied studies, and later success in careers, require a sophisticated and learned grasp of the artistic, communicative, cultural, so-cial, historical and scientific achievements of the world; and that all learners and pro- fessionals should be able to interpret these domains and to communicate about them clearly and persuasively. All colleges and universities in the State of Connecticut are required by the Department of Higher Edu- cation to mandate that General Education courses compose \"33 percent of the mini-mum requirements for the baccalaureate degree.\" The University of Bridgeport fully supports the educational philosophy be-hind this mandate. The University of Bridgeport also believes that General Education should reflect the University's educational mission. The Core Curriculum draws upon the best traditions of American education and seeks to stimu-late creativity, intellectual growth, and de- velopment of analytical thinking; but it also advances UB's distinctive educational out-look, which is international in character and commitment. Thus the University requires that thirty-three of the forty hours of Gen-eral Education be distributed within its Core Curriculum and allows the remaining seven hours to be taken as Liberal Arts electives. The Core Curriculum is comprised of a co- herent set of courses that reflect the mission of the University of Bridgeport. In particu-lar, Core courses are chosen by the Core Commission because they encourage reflec- tion upon the interdependent nature of the world, contribute to global awareness, and require interdisciplinary modes of instruc- tion and integrative learning. All classes in this curriculum are reading-and writing- intensive and thus contribute to academic development and lay the groundwork for success in graduate schools or students' chosen professions. The Core Curriculum represents what is best and distinctive about the University of Bridgeport.THE UNIVERSITY'S CORE HAS THREE DIMENSIONS: 1. Skills 2. Heritage 3. Seminars I. THE SKILLS SECTION (6 HOURS) Skills classes help students learn how to think clearly, write effectively, and commu- nicate accurately and persuasively. These courses, normally taken in the first semes-ter, lay the foundation for all further study. The University of Bridgeport requires two such courses: one in composition, the other in mathematics. English: English C101 Math: Math 105 or higher. II. THE HERITAGE SECTION (21 HOURS) Heritage classes introduce students to the artistic, communicative, cultural, social, his- torical and scientific achievements of the world. The courses below have been se-lected for inclusion in the Core Curriculum because they contribute to forming an in- ternational perspective about these achieve-ments. The Core Curriculum aims to help students see the world in a distinctive way: as a plural but increasingly interdependent reality. Upper-level courses, are suggested to students who are completing Core re- quirements as upperclassmen, or who have focused academic interests in a particular area of enquiry. Enrolling in these upper- level courses requires the instructor's per - mission. Full course descriptions can be found in Undergraduate Courses of Instruc- tion section of the Catalog. Three Hours of Fine Arts: C101 or one of the following approved electives ADSN 117, 118 MUSC 121, 122, 203, 204, 205 THA 103 Six Hours of Humanities: Humanities C201 and one of the following courses ENGL 180, 197, 207, 208, 209, 210, 212, 213, 215, 216, 223, 233, 252, 305, 325, 330, 332, 352, 357, 362 HIST 100 (three 1-credit sections must be taken during the same semester), 222, 223, 233, 317, 336 HUM 300 PHIL 101, 103, 104, 203, 205, 216 WREL 204, 205, 207, 208, 216, 221, 301, 321 Six Hours of Natural Science: six hours of C-designated courses (SCI C101, SCI C102, SCI C201), or six hours met by any com- bination of C-designated courses and/or upper-level lab science courses for which students meet the prerequisites.

SEMINARS (6 HOURS): FIRST YEAR SEMINAR AND CAPSTONE 390 The thematically focused First Year Seminar, taught from a common syllabus to all fresh- men, is taken during the first semester of study. This seminar introduces students to the academic values of the Core Curriculum while inculcating habits of learning that will serve them throughout their undergraduate education and beyond. Through this semi- nar experience, students establish a founda- tion upon which the rest of the Core Cur - riculum stands. The Capstone Seminars provide an academ- ic context in which the skills and content of the previous thirty hours of the Core Cur - riculum can be synthesized and integrated. The Capstone is the \"crowning achieve-ment\" of the Core Curriculum. As such, the seminars are limited to juniors and seniors who have completed at least 75 semester credit hours and all thirty hours in the Skills and Heritage sections of the core. No ex- ceptions will be granted to this policy. The Capstone Seminars consist of two parts, one internal, the other external. In the in- ternal part, juniors and seniors register for a three-credit seminar which is limited to sixteen students. Each seminar takes a par -35ticular approach to a general theme\u2014which in the past has included topics such as \"Civilization\" and \"Frontiers.\" Each seminar also assigns a common reading in addition to particular reading assignments for each section. On the basis of this reading, and collateral research, students are required to plan, present, and defend a point of view which forms the basis of a significant re- search paper. In the external part, all Cap-stone students are convened in a Plenary session. One student from each section is selected to present his or her research find-ings to the Capstone faculty, all currently registered Capstone students, and the in- vited University public. The Capstone Writing Prize is awarded each semester by the Capstone faculty, in con- sultation with external readers, to the paper which best meets the standards of the cap- stone Seminar in research, analysis, content and presentation. The winning papers are bound and shelved in the Wahlstrom Li- brary and the award is announced at the Honors Convocation. NOTE ON COURSE TRANSFER POLICY: The Core Commission allows twenty-seven hours of the Core to be transferred from other universities. The Capstone Seminar and at least one additional C-designated course must be taken at the University of Bridgeport. The Core Curriculum36Cooperative Education and Internships Cooperative Education The University of Bridgeport offers an ex- tensive voluntary cooperative education pro- gram, allowing students to combine class- room study with work experience in their chosen profession. Cooperative Education provides a practical application of academic studies plus opportunities to learn material that cannot be taught in the classroom. Cooperative Education offers the additional bonus of providing paid work experience that can contribute to paying educational expenses and give the student the sense of being self-supporting. Theory and practice are more closely re-lated. Motivation is increased as studies become meaningful. Work experience helps develop maturity and a sense of responsibility. Work experience helps to develop skills in human relations. Professional contacts may be made that can lead to permanent employment. Job opportunities help to test career ob- jectives. Work experience gives students a distinct advantage in a very competitive job mar - ket. Co-Op graduates often start at a higher level job and with higher pay than stu- dents without experience. CO-OP WORK ASSIGNMENTS Work assignments are located by the Uni- versity Co-Op Director and faculty in the schools. Assignments are related as closely as possible to the student course of study and career goals. The large majority of Co-Op jobs are located within 40 miles of the University. Some students locate their jobs near their homes outside of the normal Co-Op place- ment area, thus enabling them to increase their net earnings from Co-Op salaries. Most undergraduate Co-Op students work part-time during the academic year and full- time during vacations. Graduate students have the option to work full-time or part- time during the academic year. STUDENT SALARIES Students are placed in regular jobs and nor -mally are paid for their services by the coop- erating employer. They perform under actu-al working conditions and are advanced on the basis of merit. Guarantees concerning job placement and pay cannot be offered. However, between the end of the Freshmen year and graduation, the typical Co-Op sal- ary can represent a substantial portion of the total cost of a student's education. ACADEMIC CREDITS Academic credit for Co-Op work experience is authorized by the dean and the faculty of the individual schools having Co-Op pro- grams. Students must register and pay the 1-3 credit Co-Op fee for each work term. ELIGIBILITY The Co-Op program is open to all full-time students demonstrating their academic ability. DOMESTIC UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS must complete two full terms at the Universi- ty with a minimum 2.5 grade point average. INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS must complete one academic year at the Uni- versity with a minimum 2.5 grade point aver - age, have been in F-1 or J-1 visa status for a minimum of one academic year and have a thorough command of oral and written Eng- lish. DOMESTIC GRADUATE STUDENTS must complete a minimum of four courses in their graduate program with a minimum 3.0 grade point average. INTERNATIONAL GRADUATE STUDENTS must complete one academic year in their graduate program with a minimum 3.0 grade point average, have been in F-1 visa status for a minimum of one academic year and have a thorough command of oral and written English. In addition to the general requirements stated before, Ph.D. students in Computer Science and Engineering are allowed to start their CPT only after they pass their Oral Examina-tion (excluding CPT summer session).INTERNSHIPS Internships provide work experience in the student's major field of study. Internships may or may not be paid accord- ing to the practice of the employment field. Internships increase motivation as studies become meaningful. Internship work experience develops ma-turity and a greater understanding of the demands of the student's career field. Internships provide the professional ex-perience that can lead to permanent em- ployment. Internships provide the student with the opportunity to network in their field be-fore graduation. Students with Internship experience be-fore graduation often start at higher level jobs and with higher pay than graduates without experience. STUDENT SALARIES Many students are able to combine a non-paid Internship position with a paid Co-Op work experience in a related field to earn not only a salary but exposure to more than one employment opportunity. ACADEMIC CREDITS Academic credit for Internship is awarded by the dean and faculty of the school offering the Internships. Most Internships earn 3 academic credits per term. ELIGIBILITY Students are eligible to participate in In-ternships according to the course sequence described by their academic program of study. International students taking paid Intern- ship positions must also have been in F-1 or J-1 visa status for a minimum of one aca-demic year and have a thorough command of oral and written English. INTERNSHIP ASSIGNMENTS Arrangements for Internships may be made with the University Internship Director, the student's faculty advisor, or the Dean of the school.37University Library University Librarian: Deborah Dulepski Magnus Wahlstrom Library, Second Floor, Library of the University's Information Services, is cen- trally located on campus, occupying floor 1-4 of the Magnus Wahlstrom building.

In addition, the School is responsible for those courses in composition, humanities, fine arts and natural sciences, mandated by the University's core curriculum. The School is committed to an interdisciplin- ary approach that it believes best prepares students for the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century, and for graduate school. The Biology Program is designed to pre- pare students for further study in graduate or professional schools, or for employment in education, industry, or governmental service. Students may follow a general biology cur - riculum or elect an option in pre-chiropractic, pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, pre-naturopathy, pre-veterinary, marine biology, or zoology. The General Studies Program gives adult learners, as well as traditional undergradu- ates, greater flexibility in completing their studies by offering broad areas of disciplin-ary concentration in place of more traditional majors. Students use this option to pursue ca- reers in business and social science and as a pre-professional degree. The First Year Studies Program develops, pro- motes, and administers programs and servic- es for non-traditional student. This includes under prepared freshmen, who are given the opportunity to demonstrate their true ability. Students remain in the program for one to four semesters depending on their level of achievement. They use the record they have compiled to transfer into their major of choice at the University. The Health Sciences Program prepares stu- dents for entry level positions in exercise and fitness, and in nutrition, as well as for advanced study in pharmacy, physician as-sistant, nursing, and other professional pro- grams in the health sciences. The curriculum in this program includes basic foundation courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics as well as in required courses in philosophy and psychology. The Human Services Program combines theoretical coursework with fireld work ex-43perience to prepare students for careers in human service agencies and community or - ganizations. The program requires students to supplement their course work in the hu-man services and gerontology with courses in psychology, sociology, and related fields. The Literature and Civilization Program gives students a general foundation in the liberal arts while, at the same time, examining the connections within and between them. With-in this major, students may opt for a concen- tration in Creative Writing, English, History, Philosophy. The Mathematics Program is designed to pre- pare the student for graduate work in math-ematics and allied areas, industrial employ- ment, secondary school teaching, and careers in quantitative areas of biological and social sciences. The Medical Laboratory Science program pre- pares students for careers in a hospital labora- tory with opportunities for growth in research or molecular diagnostics. The MLS Program may also serve as a pre-med or pre-physician assistant training program.

For information concerning admission pro- cedures, please refer to the section on Uni-versity Admissions. General Criteria for Degrees from the School of Arts and Sciences Degree in English, Literature and Civiliation, and General Studies require a minimum of 120 semester hours of acceptable work. De- pending on the degree and program, thirty to forty-eight semester hours may be devot- ed to the major, and at least half of these must be completed at the University unless this requirement is waived by the School Dean. The exact number of semester hours required for each major is listed in the sec-School of Arts and Sciences44tion of the catalog entitled \"Undergraduate Degree Programs.\" In Music, the Bachelor of Music degree re- quires a minimum of 126 semester hours. At the end of each semester, music majors must take an examination in their applied area before a jury of the faculty. At the close of the fourth semester, each music major is given a sophomore review. This review is a comprehensive critique of academic and applied work completed to date and deter - mines whether the candidate continues as a music major. In Biology and Mathematics majors the Bachelor's degree is awarded to the student who fulfills the following minimum require- ments, in addition to those listed in the chapter on Academic Regulations. 1. Participation in such departmental semi- nars as the faculty prescribes. 2. Earning the total semester hours required for the individual curriculum as listed in the following pages. 3. Earning a \"C-\" or better in every course in the major and with a cumulative aver - age of 2.0 in the major courses. Each department designates the courses to be included in the major and decides the procedure necessary to remove each deficiency, including any \"D\" in a major course. When a course is a prerequisite to another, a \"C-\" or better in the prereq-uisite course may also be a requirement. Both B.S. and B.A. degrees are available in Biology and Mathematics.First Year Studies Program The First Year Studies Program (FYSP) is an academic unit which, utilizing a variety of support services, facilitates the transition of first-year students from high school to uni-versity life. Program advisors assist the stu- dents in the selection of appropriate courses while preparing them for admission into the major of their choice. The FYSP team attempts to foster within their students a spirit of intellectual curios- ity, personal responsibility, and commitment to academic excellence. The FYSP is housed in the School of Arts and Sciences but is designed to prepare the under prepared student for majors in any of the Schools at the University of Bridgeport. The Program emphasizes strengthening study skills and awareness of college cul- ture and protocol. Because these factors are essential for successful completion of a col- lege degree, students in the FYSP must ad- here to stringent academic and attendance guidelines. Support is provided in the form of intense advising, communication with the professors, and use, in some cases manda-tory, of the Academic Resource Center. It is the goal of the First Year Studies Program to prepare its students for acceptance into the desired majors by the time they successfully complete their first thirty credits.

Students an- ticipating graduate study in the School of Business are advised to take Calculus as a free elective. Upper division coursework provides stu- dents with a common body of managerial knowledge, multinational business studies, study in a major field, and an internship or business development project. For Bach- elor of Science students the concentration of professional courses in the last two years builds upon the broad-based analytical tools and liberal arts foundation of the first two years. GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) The M.B.A. degree is offered for full time or part time study in a traditional or Executive M.B.A. format. Specific course requirements for the degree will provide students with a strong educational background. Students with a recent Bachelor's degree and a good academic average at an accredited business college may be able to complete the M.B.A. with 30 semester hours of advanced study. Students with a Bachelor's degree in a non business field generally require 54 semester hours to complete the M.B.A. Mission Statement The Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) in General Administration at the University of Bridgeport develops effective and responsible leaders for business, indus-try, and government. Because the University of Bridgeport is located near the center of one of the nation's major concentrations of corporate headquarters, our faculty and stu- dents will be a significant regional resource. Because businesses in this region are truly multinational, the M.B.A. curriculum en- courages a global perspective. To this end, the M.B.A. program at UB not only emphasizes traditional management skills but also stresses the technical and cul- tural preparation necessary to understand the increasingly complex international envi-ronment. In accomplishing this goal, teach- ing methods will include a mix of lecture, case study, experiential learning, and analy-sis of international sociopolitical issues. Graduates of the University's M.B.A. pro- gram will have the analytic and interper - sonal skills to be effective leaders: they will be responsible leaders because they will have learned how to employ these skills to improve their communities as well as their companies.46Prerequisites, Criteria and Procedures The applicant must present an appropriate baccalaureate degree from an accredited in- stitution of higher education. Official tran- scripts of all previous work must be sent to the Office of Graduate Admissions. No specific undergraduate curriculum is ex- pected or preferred before entry to M.B.A. study. As a professional program the M.B.A. is designed to build upon undergraduate study in the arts, humanities, science, en- gineering or other curricula. Students with little experience with computers will be re-quired to register for appropriate additional coursework in their first year of study. New classes are admitted each fall and spring for full time or part time study. Sum- mer course offerings also allow new admis- sions for part time study. Full time students may begin in summer for any remediation study, to ease their course load during the regular semesters, and in some cases to ac-celerate their study program. Applications and supporting credentials for full time students should normally be sub- mitted at least two months before the de-sired starting time, and for part time students at least one month.

Accumulation of thesis se- mester hours and work done during a thesis investigation must be continuous up to the time of its completion. Only those students designated as regular graduate students who have satisfied the following require- ments will be permitted to accumulate thesis credits. During the semester prior to that in which the student desires to initiate his/her thesis investigation, he/she must have: 1. Included a thesis investigation in his/her approved program of study; 2. Sought and obtained a member of the graduate faculty who agrees to act as his/her thesis advisor; 3. Submitted a completed thesis investiga-tion form to the department in which the degree is to be awarded; 4. Obtained a Thesis Committee, appoint-ed by the department chair, consisting of three members of the graduate fac- ulty (including the advisor as committee chair). Students should obtain a copy of \"Specifi- cations for Master's Thesis\" from the office of the department chair which describes re-quirements in detail. All theses in Engineering must be presented at a faculty-graduate seminar. It is the stu-dent's responsibility to ensure that this re- quirement is fulfilled, and that written no- tice of the presentation is distributed to all interested persons at least one week before the event. Students who are in the process of complet- ing a thesis are required to register for at least two semester hours of thesis in each semester, including summer, that they ac-tively engage in that activity under faculty School of Engineering52guidance. Semester hours thus accumulated that total more than the approved program of-study requirement are not counted to- ward the degree. This procedure does not apply to Electri- cal Engineering, where students have up to 3 semesters (not counting the summer semester) to start and finish their project/thesis. For every semester they are not reg- istered for any credits, they must take ELEG 596 (seminar) for 1 credit. They do not take ELEG 596 in the summer semester, unless it is their last semester. Upon successful completion of the thesis, and acceptance by the Thesis Committee, provided all other requirements in the pro- gram of study are completed, the student becomes eligible for the degree. COMPLETION OF MASTER'S DEGREE The Master of Science degree will be award-ed only to those students successfully com- pleting the following requirements: 1. A minimum of 31 semester hours, 34 hours for Technology Management with a QPR of \"B\" or better in an approved program of study. The number of semes-ter hours which may be transferred from another institution is an individual matter that will be reviewed by the major de-partment, but is normally no more than 6 semester hours (8 semester hours in the case of laboratory courses). 2. Satisfactory completion of the state licen- sure requirements as prescribed by the faculty of the major department, and a fa-vorable recommendation from the facul- ty upon review of the student's program and performance, after the student has made formal application for a Master's diploma. When the degree is completed with a thesis, a minimum of eight courses of three semes- ter hours each are required for the Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering. For the Master of Science in Computer Science or Computer Engineering, nine courses of three semester hours each plus six semester hours (mini- mum) of thesis are required. For the Master of Science degree in Technology Manage- ment, nine courses of three semester hours each plus six semester hours (minimum) of thesis are required; for students holding the Bachelor of Science in Manufacturing Engi- neering or Industrial Engineering from an approved program, this requirement may be reduced to eight courses of three semester hours each, plus six semester hours (mini- mum) of thesis. COOPERATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM The School of Engineering offers an option-al cooperative education program. See the Cooperative Education section of this Cata- log for further information. The faculty of the School of Engineering en- courages both undergraduate and graduate students to participate in the Co-Op pro- gram and acquire work experience in in-dustry while studying here at the University of Bridgeport. Requirements for the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering TIME LIMITATION AND PROGRAM CONTINUITY All requirements for the Ph.D. degree must be completed within seven years (fourteen consecutive semesters) of the effective start of an approved graduate program of study. Once a program is initiated, the student must maintain continuous enrollment until completion. COMPLETION OF PH.D. DEGREE The Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering will be awarded only to those students successfully completing the follow- ing requirements: 1. Completion of the formal requirements for an MS degree in computer science or computer engineering, including a the-sis. 2.

It serves a quarter of the world's population and has increased in pub-lic acceptance in the United States and Europe as the fastest growing complementary health care field. AOM has gained this respect by be-ing the most ancient written form of medical therapy known. For more information, call Dr. Jennifer Brett: (203) 576-4122 or 1-800-EXCEL-UB (1-800-392-3582), ext. 4122 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which encompasses acupuncture, manual therapy, diet counseling, herbal therapies, exercise and breathing techniques, has been in use for thousands of years. Over the millennia, the Asian community has continuously refined this ancient healing art. During the last cen- tury, this refinement has included integration of Western medical sciences within the para- digm of TCM. MS-AC The development of the Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program integrates the medical concepts of both the East and West. The student will learn classical acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medical theory as well as up-to-date western bio-medical sciences. The Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program's goal is to provide acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medical training consistent with the developing traditions in Asia and the growing modern health care system in the United States. Having an opportunity to work alone and in conjunction with other health care practitioners in the Health Sciences Center, the students will be able to integrate the care of patients with other health care providers. Thus, the student gains a \"real world\" advantage before entering private practice. MS-TCM The MS-TCM is a 4-year program during which the students are instructed in Chinese Herbol- ogy during three (3) of the four (4) years of training, after a first year of basic sciences, theory and diagnosis classes lay the founda- tion for understanding the art and science of a full range of TCM modalities. All foundational courses and clinical rotations from the MS-AC program are included in the MS-TCM. The nearly 3400-hours of training in Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine modalities, including excellent training in acupuncture, moxibus- tion, tui na as well as Chinese herbal studies is designed to produce graduates with exem- plary clinical skills. The clinical focus of this program is evident from the very first classes and permeates all the training in the MS-TCM program. The MS-TCM program is a residential pro- gram with students completing over 80% of their course work and 100% of their clinical rotations in residence. The ASIAN/CHINESE HERBOLOGY (ACH) courses will be offered in a blended format with 50% of the didac- tic program offered online and 50% during 4 weekends each semester, and an additional 3 weekends each summer for a total of 11 week- ends a year. Students will participate in an on-line environment to complete their ASIAN/ CHINESE HERBOLOGY studies. MS-CH The MS-CH program is a stand-alone program that will allow licensed health care profes- sionals to better understand Chinese Herbol- ogy and be able to safely utilize these herbal products. Currently, many healthcare professionals are able to prescribe herbal therapies (MDs, NDs, DCs, L.Acs) or work with herbal thera-pies (PharmDs). UB MS-CH program is the only clinically-oriented systematic masters- level program for health professionals in these therapies. By focusing on the clinical appli- cation and uses of these herbs and formulae from the start of the program health profes-sionals will be able to have advanced clinical skills by the time of graduation. The focus of this program is on not only clinical usage of Chinese herbal therapies but also on safety in the clinical setting while framing the clinical use of these herbs in the TCM tradition. The potential for issues associated with integrated care and drug-herb and nutrient-herb interac- tions are covered in detail within the MS-CH courses. The nearly 900-hours of training in Chinese herbal studies will produce graduates with exemplary clinical skills. The clinical focus of this program is evident from the very first classes and permeates all the training in the MS-CH program. Degrees Master of Science in Acupuncture (M.S.Ac.)

Curriculum MS-AC The Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program is three years in length (34 months) and is scheduled on a semester basis. The curriculum of this major consists of seven (7) distinct areas: 1. Acupuncture Practice and Techniques: The nine (9) acupuncture courses intro- duce students to the theoretical and prac-tical information of acupuncture therapy. The student becomes proficient in the clin- ical applications of acupuncture, moxabus-tion, cupping, electrical stimulation, and bleeding techniques. The student learns to identify acupuncture points by anatomical Acupuncture Institute59location, palpation, and proportional mea- surement. The classification, function and indications for each acupuncture point are discussed and demonstrated. In addition to the twelve bilateral channels, two mid- line vessels and six other extra meridians, forbidden and contraindication of points are discussed. In addition, extra points, auricular points and other categories of acupuncture points are demonstrated and treatment techniques based on these ex- tra meridians and points are discussed and practiced. 2. Asian Medicine Theory, Diagnosis and Application: The twelve (12) oriental medicine theory and diagnosis courses are designed to pro- vide the student with an understanding of the scope, philosophy, theory and concep-tual frame work of oriental medicine and how acupuncture specifically affects the body within the oriental treatment para-digms. Emphasis is placed on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnoses and effective treatment strategies. 3. Western Biomedicine: The twelve (12) western biomedical cours- es are designed to train the student fully about western medical terms, history tak- ing, physical exam and diagnostic skills. The student learns how to make the ap-propriate referral and consultation, as well as the clinical relevance of laboratory and diagnostic tests and procedures. 4. Herbal Medicine Survey: The four (4) courses in herbal medicine and dietetics give the student a basic intro-duction to western and Chinese botanical medicine and TCM treatment philosophies relevant to herbal medicine and clinical diet therapies. Training in botanical medi- cine is limited in the Acupuncture Institute to three survey courses: Botanical Medi-cine, Introduction to Chinese Herbal Rem- edies and Patent Remedies. Information is provided on indications, contraindications and drug-herb interactions. In addition, the two courses in dietetics and nutrition help the student understand the role of nutrition in patients' health. (Note that the course in western nutrition is listed under Western Biomedicine: ANT 521 Nutrition.)5. Movement and Respiration Studies: The seven (7) movement and respiration courses are designed to enhance the stu- dent's personal and energetic development. The student will be exposed to a wide va-riety of Asian movement practices that can be used to maintain their own and their patients' health care needs. In addition to the movement studies, two courses in soft tissue treatment techniques are offered. 6. Counseling, communications and practice management: The two (2) specific courses in this area enhance the students' clinical skills, both in terms of diagnosing addressing patients' psychological health and in the area of best business practices. In addition, the two second year seminars, cross referenced in the \"Oriental Theory, Diagnosis and Appli- cation\" (ATD) section help students learn the fundamental skills needed for private practice, ethical and legal considerations in health care and special considerations for practice in integrated care settings. 7. Clinical Services: The five (5) clinical services courses are designed to allow the student to develop clinical, interpersonal communication and decision-making skills. In addition, stu-dents learn professional conduct, efficien- cy and confidence in dealing with patients on a regular basis. From inception through the end of clinical training, the student has the opportunity to observe and work with advanced TCM practitioners as well as other health care professionals. This al- lows the student to understand how and when to make appropriate referrals. Clini-cal training sites are available in the UBAI on-campus clinic as well as in community and hospital outreach clinical sites. By the end of clinical training, each student will have seen a minimum of 380 patient vis- its and will have completed 830 hours of clinical training.

Of the didactic training, 747 are in the basic sciences, 1071 in Traditional Chinese Medicine Curriculum - MS-TCM The Master of Science in Traditional Chi-nese Medicine degree program is four years in length (45 months) and is scheduled on a semester basis. The curriculum of this major consists of eight (8) distinct areas: 1. Acupuncture Practice and Techniques (APT): The nine (9) acupuncture courses intro- duce students to the theoretical and prac- tical information of acupuncture therapy. The student becomes proficient in the clin- ical applications of acupuncture, moxabus- tion, cupping, electrical stimulation, and bleeding techniques. The student learns to identify acupuncture points by anatomical location, palpation, and proportional mea- surement. The classification, function and indications for each acupuncture point are discussed and demonstrated. In addition to the twelve bilateral channels, two mid-line vessels and six other extra meridians, forbidden and contraindication of points are discussed. In addition, extra points, auricular points and other categories of acupuncture points are demonstrated and treatment techniques based on these ex-tra meridians and points are discussed and practiced. 2. Asian Medicine Theory, Diagnosis and Application (ATD): The twelve (12) oriental medicine theory and diagnosis courses are designed to pro-vide the student with an understanding of the scope, philosophy, theory and con- ceptual frame work of oriental medicine and how acupuncture specifically affects the body within the Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment paradigms. Emphasis is placed on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnoses and effective treatment strategies. 3. Western Biomedicine (AWB): The twelve (12) western biomedical cours- es are designed to train the student fully about western medical terms, history tak- ing, physical exam and diagnostic skills. The student learns how to make the ap-propriate referral and consultation, as well as the clinical relevance of laboratory and diagnostic tests and procedures. 4. Herbal Medicine Survey (AHM): The five (5) courses in herbal medicine and dietetics give the student a basic intro-duction to Chinese pharmacy and dispen- sary practices, common OTC North Ameri- can botanicals, the ethical consideration of utilizing sparse resources, and TCM clinical diet therapies. Information in the western botanical and pharmacy classes provides clear information regarding indications, contraindications and drug-herb interac- tions. The ethical and ecological impacts of TCM materia medica on the health of the individual and the world are explored. In addition, the two courses in dietetics and nutrition help the student understand the role of nutrition in patients' health. (Note that the course in western nutrition Acupuncture Institute61is listed under Western Biomedicine: ANT 521 Nutrition.) 5. Asian/Chinese Herbology (ACH): The ten (10) courses in Chinese Herbology offer the student a thorough understanding of Chinese Materia Medica, Classical and Patent formulas and modifications, and the clinical application of Chinese herbs and formulae. The student becomes proficient in the theories pertinent to Chinese Herbal Medicine and the clinical applications of Chinese materia medica for a wide variety of clinical situations and patient popula-tions. At the completion of the 10 course survey, students will have learned over 300 individual herbs and over 150 differ - ent classical and patent formulae. 6. Movement and Respiration Studies: The seven (7) movement and respiration courses are designed to enhance the stu- dent's personal and energetic develop- ment. The student will be exposed to a wide variety of Asian movement practices that can be used to maintain their own and their patients' health care needs. In addition to the movement studies, three courses in soft tissue treatment techniques are offered. 7. Counseling, communications and practice management: The two (2) specific courses in this area enhance the students' clinical skills, both in terms of diagnosing addressing patients' psychological health and in the area of best business practices. In addition, the courses of AWB 621 Medical Ethics, ACS 511 Evidence informed Clinical Practices, and ATD 618 Seminar 3 (cross listed in the ATD section) help students learn the fun- damental skills needed for private practice, ethical and legal considerations in health care and special considerations for practice in integrated care settings. 8. Clinical Services: The five (5) acupuncture clinical services courses and four (4) Chinese Herbology clinical services (for a total of nine - 9 - clinical experience courses) are designed to allow the student to develop clinical, interpersonal communication and deci- sion-making skills. In addition, students learn professional conduct, efficiency and confidence in dealing with patients on a regular basis. From inception through the end of clinical training, the student has the opportunity to observe and work with ad- vanced TCM practitioners as well as other health care professionals. This allows the student to understand how and when to make appropriate referrals. Clinical rota- tions are available in the UBAI on-campus clinic as well as in community and hos- pital outreach clinical sites. By the end of clinical training, each student will have seen a minimum of 575 patient visits and will have completed 1190 hours of clini- cal training (830 hours in the acupuncture/general clinical care; 360 in the herbology clinic).

The third digit indicates the area. E.g.: APT 524APT: Acupuncture Practice and Techniques 5 - year one 2 - second semester 4 - fourth course in the area sequence Grades Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4) point scale with a grade of \"A\" or 4 quality points being the highest grade attained. Grades with quality points are: GRADE QUALITY POINTS A 4.0 B+ 3.5 B 3.0 C+ 2.5 C 2.0 D 1.0 F 0.0 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semes- ter hours into the number of points earned. Transfer credits are not included in this com- putation. Administrative Grades In addition to the academic grades submitted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized. I: The grade of Incomplete \"I\" is used by the faculty to indicate that a student has not completed all course require- ments. A student will have one week from the first day of the next term to meet with the faculty and complete all course requirements unless other arrangements are made with either the faculty member or the program Director prior to the end of the term in which the course was taken. Upon completion of the course require-ments the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete 64the requirements in one week from the first day of the next term will re- sult in a grade of \"I\" being converted to a grade of \"F\". Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register for and re- take that course in its entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be able to register for courses for which that course is a prerequisite. R: Students may repeat a course at any grade level below an \"A\". The first re- peat will replace the first-time grade for the computation of the QPR. TCR: This indicates transfer credit granted for equivalent work completed at an- other accredited institution. W: Withdrawal grades are assigned on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of-registration period, that course does not appear on the stu- dent's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-registration period, but before the end of the official with- drawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count towards \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have officially withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, in- cluding late withdrawals, must be approved by the Director and the Provost before they become official and are recorded. Poor academic performance does not constitute a valid reason for late withdrawal. Academic Policies ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS: Each student is expected to attend all lectures, laboratories and other activities associated with the total completion of a given course. A student who is absent from class in excess of ten percent of the total class hours may have his or her grade reduced for lack of participa- tion as outlined in the course syllabus. A stu- dent absent in excess of twenty percent of the total class hours will receive a grade of \"F.\" Requirements for Graduation - MS- AC In order to be eligible for graduation from the Acupuncture Institute program, candidates must meet the following criteria: 1. Have successfully completed a minimum of 34 months of resident study in an ac- credited institution. The last 2 semesters (34 credits) must have been in residence at the University of Bridgeport Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program. 2. Have successfully completed all require- ments of the educational program and have achieved a 2.75 cumulative grade point average. 3.

No student will graduate from the pro- gram who has not resolved all financial obligations with the University of Bridge-port GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING Good academic standing is achieved when a student is maintaining good grades, has met all financial responsibilities to the Acupuncture Institute degree program, and is not guilty of any breach of standards governing ethical and clinical conduct. ACADEMIC PROBATION Academic probation occurs when the student's cumulative grade point average falls below the required grade point average of 2.50 or if a student receives one grade of \"F\" or two or more grades of \"D\" during a single semester. A student who is on academic probation is not Acupuncture Institute65in good academic standing and is not eligible to carry a full academic course load. ACADEMIC REMEDIATION A student who is on Academic Probation will be placed in a program of Academic Reme- diation and will be required to meet with the Director of the Institute. Academic Reme-diation requires a student to carry a reduced academic load. Students will be permitted to convert grades of \"D\" or \"F\" only by retaking the course the next time it is offered by the Acupuncture Institute. Successful completion of a program of aca- demic remediation requires a student to pass each repeated course with a \"C\" or better and have earned a cumulative GPA (CGPA) of 2.75 or better. A student who has not earned a CGPA of 2.75 or better upon one semester of remediation but has shown substantial improvement in his or her course work will be allowed one more semester of remediation in order to achieve the CGPA of 2.75. A student in a program of academic remediation may ask the Director for a written definition of a minimum CGPA, or range of CGPA, which would be deemed to be substantial improvement, and for a written calculation of the semester of remediation GPA which would be necessary to achieve in order to bring the student's CGPA into the range of substantial improvement. In such event the student shall countersign the written statement and deliver a copy of the signed document to the Director. A student may not graduate with a grade of \"D\" on their transcript. Grades of \"D\" may not re-main on the student's transcript for more than one year and must be remediated by repeat- ing the course and receiving a grade of \"C\" or better. This is not a limitation for the instructor, but rather a requirement to pass each course so that students have the appropriate level of proficiency to pass the NCCAOM Board Exams and become licensed acupuncturists. A stu- dent may remediate a grade only by retaking the course before graduation. If the student does not pass the course with a \"C\" or bet- ter, the student will be on Academic Probation and will be required to speak with the Director of the Acupuncture Institute before registering for any new classes. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who after one semester of remedia-tion does not show substantial improvement in his or her academic performance or after two semesters of academic remediation does not achieve a CGPA of 2.75 will be academically dismissed from the acupuncture program. Academic dismissal may also occur if a stu- dent's CGPA falls below 2.50, or if the student receives one \"F' or two grades of \"D\" in one semester on a second occasion. Upon com- pletion of the first semester, any student not achieving at least a 2.50 GPA will be academi-cally dismissed from the program. DISMISSAL FROM THE ACUPUNCTURE INSTITUTE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea- son for dismissal from the Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program. The following is a list of additional causes for dismissal: 1. Failure to meet generally accepted stan-dards of ethical and professional conduct and clinical practice. Such dismissal is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration as es- tablished by the Director of the UBAI. 2. Pleading \"Guilty\" or \"No Contest\", or be- ing found guilty of any crime involving moral turpitude; in the event of a pre- existing or new felony the Institute shall have the right to impose sanctions, in- cluding but not limited to dismissal, on a case by case basis. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration as es- tablished by the Director of the Institute. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the University of Bridge-port Acupuncture Institute. The Institute shall have the right to suspend any student from any or all privileges of a stu- dent in good standing during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to the foregoing until such time as all University procedures are terminated. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM If a student withdraws or wishes to take a leave of absence from the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute and is in good standing he or she is eligible for readmission. A student who withdraws when not in good academic standing or, who leaves without officially withdrawing seriously jeopardizes his or her chances of future readmission or admission to other acupuncture Institutes. If a student withdraws or takes a leave of ab- sence with plans to reenter at a later date, he or she should make this clear at the time of withdrawal. Please note: All requirements for the mas- ter's degree in Acupuncture (MS-AC) must be completed within five (5) years from the first matriculation to graduation. All requirements for the master's degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine (MS-TCM) must be completed within seven (7) calendar years from the first matricu- lation to graduation. If a student withdraws one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed two years. Former University of Bridgeport Naturopathic and Chiropractic students who started acu- puncture training as a combined-degree stu- dent during their professional training who then took a leave of absence or withdrew from the acupuncture institute must demon-strate competency through examination for all work completed prior to withdrawal from the program, with the exception of the basic sci-ence (\"AWB\"-designated) courses, upon read- mission to the program. All such previously completed coursework will then be treated as transfer credit and the time frame for comple- tion of the MS-Acup degree will be 4 years (48 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program; and the time frame for com- pletion of the MS-TCM degree will be 5 years (60 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program. If a student wishes to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, he or she must submit a letter to the Director stating the reason for withdrawal. The student must also complete all required paperwork from the Registrar's of-fice. In addition, the student should also note if he/she plans to re-enter the program and the term (Fall/Spring year) of such re-matric-ulation. READMISSION TO THE PROGRAM To be considered for readmission to the pro-gram after withdrawal or leave of absence, write to the Assistant Director of the Institute requesting readmission and indicate the date Acupuncture Institute66of re-entry desired. It is important to do this well in advance of the proposed date of read- mission.

Transfer credit will be assessed by the Insti- tute Director and is only awarded for courses similar in content and length, and with instruc- tors similarly qualified as those given by the Acupuncture Institute. Students requesting transfer credit must provide an official course transcript, a school catalog and, if requested, a course syllabus for any course for which trans-fer credit is requested. Documentation of the transfer of credit awarded, and the institution from which transfer credit was awarded are kept in the student files. No less than 20 clini- cal credits and 14 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acupuncture Institute for the student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the MS-Acupuncture and MS-Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine degrees. All students, including transfer students, must complete the Clinical Entrance Exam with a score of no less than 75%, the Clinical Exit Exam and all practi- cal clinical examinations with a grade of 70% or better to be eligible for graduation. An applicant's credits from another Institute may be considered for transfer only under the following conditions: 1. The applicant must meet current prereq- uisites in force at the University of Bridge- port Acupuncture Institute at the time the student originally enrolled at the health profession institution from which the transfer is being made, regardless of hav- ing been accepted to the institution from which they are transferring. In many cas- es, University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute's requirements are higher than those for other acupuncture related pro- fessional schools. 2. Be courses for a student majoring in the medical sciences, acupuncture or oriental medicine 3. The institution from which the student is transferring must be acceptable to the Admissions Committee of the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, such as another acupuncture degree-granting program, or an accredited school of post- graduate medical training.4. The credits being transferred must be equivalent in credit hours content and quality to that of the University of Bridge-port Acupuncture Institute. If the Univer - sity of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute course contains a laboratory so must the course being considered for transfer. In order to verify equivalence, students may be required to provide a course descrip-tion or course syllabus for comparison. 5. Only credits with a grade of \"C\" (2.00 on a 4.00 scale) or better are considered for transfer. Transfer credit is credit only; the transferred grade will not affect the QPR. 6. In order to obtain transfer credit the stu-dent must have graduated or have been granted an honorable withdrawal from the professional or graduate school at-tended. 7. To receive transfer credit for any courses taken 3 or more years prior to entering the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, and for any course completed during an apprenticeship or other non- traditional or non-accredited learning en-vironment, the student must demonstrate competency through examination. The passing grade for such exams is 75%. 8. Credits used to satisfy the minimum pre- requisites for admission must not be used for advanced placement credit. 9. All international transcripts and course descriptions must be evaluated by an ap- proved foreign credential evaluation ser - vice. Advanced Standing Students who are accepted as transfer students may receive advanced standing if a substantial number of semester hours have been accepted by University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Insti-tute. This may enable the student to complete either the MS-ACUP program in less than six semesters, or the MS-TCM degree in less than eight semesters. Transfer credit may be grant- ed either with or without advanced standing. If advanced standing is granted: No more than 84 credits may transfer from another institution of acupuncture or oriental medicine for the MS-ACUP degree. No more than 110 credits may transfer from another in- stitution of acupuncture or oriental medicine for the MS-TCM degree. No less than 20 clini-cal credits and 14 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acupuncture Institute for a student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the MS-Acupuncture or MS- TCM degree. All students, including transfer students, must complete the Clinical Entrance Exam with a score of no less than 75%, the Clinical Exit Exam and all practical clinical ex-aminations with a grade of 70% or better to be eligible for graduation. Advanced standing in the Acupuncture Insti- tute requires evaluation of official transcripts and course descriptions from the institution of higher learning where the student received his or her training as described in Transfer Credit above. Foreign students must have their tran- scripts evaluated by a foreign transcript evalu-ating services, such as World Educational Ser - vices (WES). A special curriculum schedule will be made up for the student based on semester hours transferred and course availability. Tuition will be calculated based on the num- ber of credits being taken per semester mul-tiplied by the single credit fee at the time of the student's attendance. If the total number of credits exceeds 13 in any one semester, the student will be responsible for paying the full time tuition rate. If advanced standing is not granted, but some semester hours are transferable, the student will be admitted to the first semester and will be exempt from courses for which transfer credit was granted. Former University of Bridgeport students in the other graduate-level health sciences programs who started acupuncture training as a com- bined-degree student during their professional training who then took a leave-of absence or withdrew from the Acupuncture Institute must demonstrate competency through examination for all work completed prior to withdrawal from the program, with the exception of the basic science (\"AWB\"-designated) courses, upon readmission to the program. All such previously completed coursework will then be treated as transfer credit and the time frame for completion of the MS-Acupuncture degree program will be four (4) years (48 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI pro- gram; and the time frame for completion of the MS-Traditional Chinese Medicine degree pro-gram will be five (5) years (60 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI programAcupuncture Institute68Evaluation of advanced standing is completed by the Director of the Acupuncture Institute. Upon request, a letter is sent to the student, with a copy available in the student file, of all coursework which is acceptable for trans- fer credit. The transfer credit grades will not appear on official transcripts from the Univer - sity of Bridgeport and the grades from those classes will not affect a student's GPA. Course prerequisites must be completed by all students, including those taking courses as auditors, before admission to a course will be granted. Exceptions may be made by permis-sion of the Director under the following spe- cial circumstances: 1. A student has skills equivalent to com- pletion of the pre-requisites from non- traditional training or experience (i.e.: in an apprenticeship). Students may re-quest a waiver from completing the pre- requisites before taking more advanced courses. Students will have to complete all such courses or demonstrate compe- tency through examination before gradu- ation from the Acupuncture Institute. 2. A University of Bridgeport Health Scienc-es graduate student requires special skills for an outreach clinic setting (e.g.: clean needle technique and auricular acupunc-ture for NADA-style detox treatments). Transfer of Credit for Foreign Health Profession Institutions To be eligible for transfer of credits, applicants from foreign acupuncture, medical, chiroprac- tic, osteopathic or dental institutions located in countries that do not have an accredita-tion system equivalent to those of the United States, must submit evidence of proficiency in all work submitted for advance standing credit. Credits from foreign Institutes and universities must have transcript evaluation performed by a reputable transcript evaluation service. To receive advanced-standing for courses taken 3 or more years prior to entering the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, and for any course completed during an ap- prenticeship or other non-traditional or non- accredited learning environment, the student must demonstrate competency through exami- nation. The passing grade for such exams is 75%.Acupuncture Institute69College of Chiropractic Dean: David Wickes Elenore Dana Hall Street Telephone: 576-4278 Fax: (203) 576-4483 E-mail: dwickes@bridgeport.edu Coordinator, Academic Affairs: Paul Chiropractic Building 75 Linden Avenue Telephone: (203) 576-4279 Fax: (203) 576-4351 Associate Dean, Clinic: Anthony Onorato Health Sciences Building 60 Street Telephone: Chiropractic is the philosophy, art, and sci- ence which concerns itself with the relation- ship between structure and function of the human body, as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health.

Accreditation & Membership \"The doctor of chiropractic degree program of the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic is accredited by the Commis- sion on Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic Education, 8049 N. 85th Way, Scottsdale, AZ 85258, 480-443-8877. The College of Chiropractic is also a member of the Association of Chiropractic Colleges. Mission Statement Provide a comprehensive, full-time educa-tion that prepares qualified candidates to become doctors of chiropractic. Present a clinically relevant and integrated curriculum that is evidenced-influenced in regard to basic sciences, chiropractic prin- ciples and related health sciences. To adhere to a curriculum that emphasizes: The body is an integrated unit; The body has intrinsic self-regulating and healing mechanisms; Structure and function are interrelated; The neuromusculoskeletal system can ef-fect the functioning of other body sys- tems and, in turn, can be affected by these systems. Produce graduates who will be competent to practice as portal of entry chiropractic phy- sicians, providing diagnostic services, health services, humanistic care and conservative methods of therapeutics to assist patients in achieving health and wellness. Advance chiropractic and its knowledge base through scholarship and research. Provide opportunities for faculty, students and staff to engage in activities which ser - vice the needs of the chiropractic profession and the public. Provide for continuous improvement and quality of our programs through assessment, and by fostering an atmosphere of knowl-edge, growth and open discussions. Curriculum A Doctor of Chiropractic is a physician whose purpose is to meet the health needs of the public as a member of the healing arts. He/she gives particular attention to the relationship of structural and neurological aspects of the body and is educated in the basic and clinical sciences as well as in relat- ed health subjects. Chiropractic science con- cerns itself with the relationship between structure (primarily the spine), and function (primarily coordinated by the nervous sys- tem) of the human body as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health.. \"The DCP of the University of Bridgeport incorporates the understanding of chiro- practic as a profession practicing primary health care, provides curricular and clinical evidence of that through outcome measures, and consists of education and training to prepare graduates to: A. Practice direct contact health care as a portal-of-entry provider for patients of all ages and genders; B. Assess the patient's general health sta- tus, complaints and problems leading to a diagnosis. Specific elements of patient assessment minimally include complete health history; review of systems; physi- cal, biomechanical and neurological ex- amination; the analysis of vertebral and extra-vertebral subluxation; and, when clinically indicated, diagnostic imaging, clinical laboratory, and/or specialized di-agnostic procedures; C. Develop a goal-oriented case manage-ment plan that addresses any sublux-ations or other neurobiomechanical problems, and that may include rehabili- tation and/or other therapeutic modali-ties; D. Develop appropriate doctor/patient re-lationships with continuity in the chiro-practic management of health problems, and coordination of care with other health-care providers; and E. Promote wellness by assessing health risk and providing problem-related, gen- eral and public health information, and lifestyle counseling. The purpose of chiropractic professional ed-ucation is to provide the student with a core of knowledge in the basic and clinical sci- ences and related health subjects sufficient 70to perform the professional obligations of a doctor of chiropractic. A doctor of chiropractic is a primary care physician whose purpose as a practitioner of the healing arts, is to help meet the health needs of individual patients and of the pub-lic, giving particular attention to the struc- tural and neurological aspects of the body. The application of science in chiropractic concerns itself with the relationship between structure, primarily the spine, and function, primarily coordinated by the nervous sys- tem of the human body, as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health. Further, this application of science in chi- ropractic focuses on the inherent ability of the body to heal without the use of drugs or surgery. As a gatekeeper for direct access to the health delivery system, the doctor of chi-ropractic's responsibilities as a primary care physician include wellness promotion, health promotion, health assessment, diag-nosis and the chiropractic management of the patient's health care needs. When in- dicated, the doctor of chiropractic consults with, co-manages, or refers to other health care providers.\" ( From the Council on Chi- ropractic Education Standards for Doctor of Chiropractic Programs, January 2007) It is the purpose of the University of Bridge- port College of Chiropractic program to of- fer as a minimum those courses and objec-tives as suggested in the CCE standards. It is also the purpose of the UBCC program to offer a broad-based educational experience. In many cases, the educational program pre- sented will go beyond the course offerings suggested by CCE and will also go beyond individual state laws and scope of practice. The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic curriculum is divided into three phases: Basic Sciences, Clinical Sciences, and Clinical Services. Basic Sciences The basic Science curriculum instructs stu- dents in Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Public Health, and Pathology. These courses are offered primarily during the first two years of a student's education. It is the purpose of this aspect of the pro-gram for students to develop an understand-ing of both normal and abnormal structure and function, homeostatic mechanisms, and to gain a foundation upon which the clinical sciences will be built. Clinical Sciences Students from their first semester onward are instructed in the Clinical Sciences. Course offerings include: Chiropractic History, Chi- ropractic Principles and Practice, Diagnosis, Radiology, Technique Procedures, Nutrition, and Physiological Therapeutics and Reha- bilitation Procedures. Students are given in-depth training in the diagnosis and treat- ment of patients. Practical hands-on training is included beginning in Semester I and con-tinuing to graduation. Information from the basic science curriculum is integrated into the clinical science course offerings and is a foundation upon which the clinical science courses build. Many of the clinical science courses have as a prerequisite successful completion of the basic science courses. Clinical Services The Clinical Services phase of the curricu-lum is the last and most important aspect of the UBCC program. Interns at the Col- lege's Chiropractic Health Center care for patients under the supervision and direction of licensed doctors of chiropractic. To be eligible for this part of the curriculum, stu-dents must be in good academic standing, successfully completed all courses in Semes- ters I thru V, and successfully completed the clinic services entrance examination. During the Clinical Services portion of the program students will continue to receive training in the clinical sciences. They will also continue to be evaluated during their internship in or - der to remain eligible for clinical services. To continue in Clinical Services, students must remain in good academic standing. Towards the completion of the Clinical Services pro-gram students will be administered a clini- cal competency examination which must be successfully completed prior to graduation. Because each course is integrated with other course offerings, students should be aware of the prerequisite and corequisite require-ments. Throughout the curriculum every effort is made to insure the relevance of information to chiropractic principles and practice. The following is a breakdown, by subject, of the time devoted to each area of study within the curriculum. Licensure Requirements and Career Opportunities LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS The Doctor of Chiropractic degree program offered by the University of Bridgeport Col- lege of Chiropractic is accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education. As in-dicated in a previous section, the college meets or exceeds the minimum educational requirements suggested by the CCE. Students who receive the Doctor of Chiropractic de-gree from UBCC are eligible for licensure in all states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Canadian Provinces and other foreign coun-tries as regulated by local laws and regula- tions without restrictions. Licensure in many states require students to complete Parts I, II, III, and Physiotherapy examination as of- fered by the National Board of Chiroprac- tic Examiners (NBCE). Additionally, states also require that students pass the Part IV Practical Examination offered by the NBCE. Students should contact the NBCE or the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards (FCLB) for additional information pertain- ing to licensure where they wish to practice. The College maintains a directory published by FCLB in the library as well as within vari- ous offices located in the College of Chiro-practic. The directory contains information pertaining to licensure and to scope of prac- tice within each state. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Approximately ninety (90%) percent of the students who have entered the UBCC have completed the requirements for graduation as outlined in this catalog. Most graduates of UBCC go directly into a private practice of their own. Other graduates work as an as- sociate with an experienced doctor or they may rent space within an existing practice.

The third digit indicates the sequence within that discipline. e.g. AN 511 AN - Anatomy 5- year one 1- semester one 1 - first course in discipline sequence Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4) point scale with an \"A\" or 4 quality points be- ing the highest grade attained. Grades with quality points are: GRADE QUALITY POINTS A 4.0 C 2.0 B+ 3.5 D 0.0 B 3.0 F 0.0 C+ 2.5 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semester hours into the number of points earned. A grade of \"D\" is not an acceptable passing grade. Transfer credits are not in- cluded in this computation. In addition to the Academic Grades submit- ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized. Administrative Grades I The grade of Incomplete \"I\", is used by the faculty to indicate that a stu- dent has not completed all course re- quirements. A student will have one week from the last day of the term to meet with the faculty and complete all course requirements. Upon comple-tion of the course requirements the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete the require- ments in one week from the last day of the term will result in the grade of \"I\" being converted to a grade of \"F.\" Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register and retake that course in it's entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a prerequi-site. R Students may repeat a course at any grade level below \"A\". The first repeat will replace the first-time grade for the computation of the QPR. TCR This indicates transfer credit granted for equivalent work completed at an- other accredited institution. W Withdrawal grades are assigned based on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of-registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-reg- istration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count toward \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have official-ly withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, including late withdrawals, must be approved by the Dean and the Provost before they be-come official and are recorded. Poor aca- demic performance does not constitute a valid reason for late withdrawal. Academic policies used to manage and di-rect the academic program are: 1. Attendance Requirements 2. Requirements for Graduation 3. Good Academic Standing 4. Academic Warning, Probation and Dismissal 5. Dismissal from the College (Non-Academic) 6. Withdrawal from the Program 7. Readmission to the Program Attendance Requirements Each student is expected to attend all lec- tures and laboratories and other activities as-sociated with the total completion of a given course. A student who is absent from class in excess of ten percent of the total class hours may have his or her grade reduced for lack of participation as outlined in the course syl- labus. A student absent in excess of twenty present of the total class hours will receive a grade of \"F.\" Requirements for Graduation In order to be eligible for graduation from the College, candidates must meet the fol- lowing criteria: 1. Have successfully completed a minimum of four academic years of resident study in an accredited institution granting a first professional degree. The last 3 semesters must have been in residence at the Uni- versity of Bridgeport College of Chiro- practic. A student must complete at least 25% of the program to qualify for a UBCC degree and have completed all require- ments within 7 years of matriculations. 2. Have successfully completed all require- ments of the educational program and have achieved a 2.50 cumulative grade point average. 3. Have successfully passed parts I and II of the National Board of Chiropractic Exam- iners. 4. Have been recommended for graduation by the College Faculty and Administra- tion. 5. Have satisfactorily met all financial obli-gations to the College, Office of Financial Aid, publication of the class yearbook and commencement exercises. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students enrolled in the UBCC Doctor of Chiropractic degree program are in good ac- ademic standing and are making satisfactory academic progress, if they have success-fully achieved the following criteria upon completion of their most recent semester of course work: 1. Did not receive a grade of \"F or D\" in any course, and 2. Maintain a cumulative grade point aver - age of 2.50 or better.College of Chiropractic74A student who has not achieved the above criteria is not making satisfactory academic progress and will be required to follow the criteria as outlined in the catalog regarding Academic Probation and Dismissal. Good Academic Standing Good academic standing is achieved when a student is maintaining good grades, has met all financial responsibilities to the College and is not guilty of any breach of the stan-dards governing ethical and clinical conduct. ACADEMIC WARNING, PROBATION AND DISMISSAL Safeguards have been built into the system to protect students who are not performing well academically from suffering academic failure. During the semester, the faculty re-ports to the Dean on a regular basis, con- cerning the grades of all students in their courses. If it is noted that particular students are doing poorly, these students will be con- tacted to set up an interview. The interview will consist of a discussion of the causes for the student's poor performance and ways in which he or she might improve a grade. ACADEMIC WARNING Academic warning will result when the fol- lowing is taking place: 1. The most recent semester quality point ratio falls below a 2.00. ACADEMIC PROBATION Academic Probation occurs when the stu- dent's QPR falls below 2.50 or if a student receives a grade of \"F or D\" in one or more courses. A student on academic probation is not eligible to carry a full academic course load. ACADEMIC REMEDIATION A student on academic probation will be placed in a program of Academic Remedia- tion. The student is required to meet with the Associate Dean of the College to deter - mine what courses will be retaken to satisfy the requirements of Remediation. In general, academic Remediation requires a student to repeat all grades of \"F or D\", carry a reduced academic load.ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who does not show substantial academic improvement after one semester of Remediation, or who is unable to achieve a QPR of 2.50 after two semester of Reme-diation will be dismissed from the College of Chiropractic. Academic dismissal may also occur if a stu- dent's QPR falls below a 2.50 on a second occasion. Any student not achieving a QPR of at least 1.75 upon completion of the first semester of study will be academically dismissed from the College of Chiropractic. DISMISSAL FROM THE COLLEGE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea-sons for dismissal from the College or Uni- versity. The following is a list of additional causes for dismissal: 1. Failure to meet the generally accepted standards of ethical conduct and clinical practice. Dismissal of this nature is sub-ject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 2. Pleading guilty or \"nolo contende,\" or being found guilty of any crime involv-ing moral turpitude or being felonious in nature. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or the demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the College or Univer - sity. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM If a student withdraws from University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic in good standing he or she is eligible for readmis- sion. A student who withdraws when not in good academic standing or, who leaves without officially withdrawing, seriously jeopardizes his or her chances of future re- admission. If a student withdraws with plans to re-enter at a later date, he or she should make this clear at the time of withdrawal.All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within seven years from the first matriculation to graduation. If a stu- dent withdraws one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed three and one half years. READMISSION TO THE PROGRAM To be readmitted to the program after with- drawal, a student must write to the Associ- ate Dean for Academic Affairs requesting re- admission and indicate the date of re-entry desired. It is important to do this well in advance of such a date. Minimum Requirements for Admission The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic does not discriminate on the basis of sex, age, color, creed, ethnic origin or handicap in the administration of its educa-tion programs or on admissions. All candidates for admission must furnish proof of having acquired three years (90 ac- ceptable semester hours or more) of study, creditable towards a baccalaureate degree, taken in accredited, degree-granting institu- tions. Pre-professional education acquired must have been completed with a minimum cumulative Quality Point Ratio of 2.50 on a 4.00 scale. A baccalaureate degree is recom-mended.

Under ex- tenuating circumstances a telephone inter - view will be granted. Applicants must understand that possession of minimum entrance requirements does not constitute a guarantee of acceptance. Each entering class is selected from a large pool of eligible candidates, a majority of whom have completed four-year degrees. Those students selected for acceptance usually have obtained grades which are substantial-ly higher than the minimum requirement. Physical Qualifications for Admissions The following physical qualifications are re- quired for participation in the doctoral de- gree program at the UB College of Chiroprac- tic. These qualifications are essential for the preparation of the Doctor of Chiropractic. Stu- dents at the College must be able to perform at a high level of competency in all phases of classroom, clinic, and laboratory activities as they will ultimately use the knowledge at- tained as Doctors of Chiropractic. The qualifications are as follows: 1. The student must possess the coordina- tion and use of both upper limbs as their use is required for, among other skills, the performance of the chiropractic ad- justment, the primary skill of a practicing Doctor of Chiropractic. 2. The student must possess manual dex- terity so that he/she may perform in the various clinical, chiropractic, and basic science laboratories without posing a threat to him/herself, patients, or his/her fellow students' safety and well-being. 3. The student must have the ability to stand not only in the performance of manipu- lative procedures but others as well. 4. The student must have hearing and visual senses, appropriately assisted if needed, acute enough to individually record pa- tient histories, to provide routine safety in- structions, and perform stethoscopic and other ausucultatory examinations, to read all forms of diagnostic imaging, and to perform microscopy examinations so that he/she can adequately interpret normal, abnormal, and pathological changes. Handicapped persons will not be summarily denied admission, nor will higher scholastic requirements be demanded of them. They, like all other students, must carry out class- room, laboratory, and clinical assignments, including microscopic work, x-ray interpreta- tion and techniques, or the equivalent; pass written, oral, and practical examinations and meet all the requirements of the College. Cancellation of Admission or Registration The college reserves the right to cancel the admission or registration of individu- als whose attendance at the college, in the opinion of the appropriate administrative of-ficers and dean, is not mutually beneficial to that person and to the institution. Individuals who have registered at other ed- ucational institutions may not disregard such records and make application on the basis of high school and selected college transcripts. Applicants who gain admission to the college on the basis of incomplete or fraudulent cre- dentials or misrepresentations in their written application for admission may have their: admission and registration canceled with-out refund of any fees; and total credits rescinded that have been earned following such admissions;and future registration at the college prohib- ited. Pre-Professional Requirements for Licensure It is most important that all candidates for admission thoroughly investigate the specif-ic requirements of each state in which they plan to practice. In some cases, pre-pro- fessional requirements must be completed prior to entrance into a chiropractic program in order to be qualified to apply for a state licensing examination. International Applicants International Applicants must complete an Application for International Students as well as an Application to the College of Chi- ropractic. Applicants who have done pre-professional study in foreign countries must submit of- ficial copies of the records of such study as well as translations if the original records are not in English. Usually, these records must be evaluated by an appropriate professional agency. Any fees charged by such an agen-cy are the responsibility of the student. Fol- lowing submission of these documents to UBCC, the Director of Admissions will make contact with the prospective student. If the applicant is a native of a foreign country, he or she must demonstrate profi-ciency in English at a level appropriate for advanced study. At a minimum proficiency can be demonstrated in one of the ways listed below: 1. A score of 550 or better on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) AND a score of 50 or better on the Test of Spoken English(TSE). Information on the TOEFL/TSE can be obtained from TOEFL, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ 08541-6151, USA or; 2. Receipt of a grade \"C\" or better in one semester of English at an accredited U.S. college or university or; 3. A letter showing successful completion of the University of Bridgeport's English Language Institute. Application Procedures Application for admission must include: 1. A properly completed Application for Admission form. 2. Application Fee. The applicant must provide the following to the Director of Admissions: College of Chiropractic761. Official transcripts of all college records. 2. Three letters of recommendation, one must be from a health care professional. Selection of Candidates The University of Bridgeport College of Chi-ropractic is coeducational and does not dis- criminate against any applicant on the basis of sex, race, creed, color or national origin. (Title VI, Civil Rights Act 1964) All eligible finalists are invited for a personal interview before any action is taken upon their application. Among the qualities typical of most success- ful candidates for admission, the following are especially important: 1. Superior communication skills, both oral and written. 2. Evidence of strong motivation to becom-ing a helping professional and, more specifically, a chiropractor. 3. Initiative and honesty as evidenced in the candidates' transactions within the application process and in all informa- tion submitted in support of the applica- tion. 4. Academic achievement which compares favorably with that of successful students at the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic. Application Deadlines Applications for admission may be submit-ted at any time. NOTIFICATION OF ACCEPTANCE Applicants will be notified in writing of the decision of the Admissions Committee as soon as a decision is made. Transfer Students Transfer Credit The University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic may grant transfer credit for courses taken in accredited professional and graduate schools. In doing so, the following requirements must be met:1. The courses taken must have content equivalent to courses given at UBCC. lf the UBCC course contains a laboratory, so must the course being considered for transfer. 2. A course being considered for transfer must have credits and hours equivalent to or greater than the same course at UBCC. 3. Any course to be transferred must have been passed with a grade of C or better. (2.0 on a 4.00 scale.) 4. A transferred course carries credit equal to the UBCC course for which credit is granted. The original grade earned is not transferred and does not affect the stu- dent's QPR at UBCC. 5. In order to obtain transfer credit the stu- dent must have been granted an honor - able withdrawal from the professional or graduate school attended. An overall Grade Point Average (GPA) of a 2.50 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher must be achieved in order to be considered for transfer sta-tus or advanced standing. It is important to note that all transfer stu-dents must meet the entry level prerequi-site requirements for first semester students regardless of having been accepted to the institution from which they are transferring. In many cases, UBCC's requirements are higher than those for other chiropractic and professional schools. Prospective transfer students should note that an admissions application to UBCC is needed in order to begin a review for trans-fer credit. Students wishing to transfer must provide the Admissions Committee with an official transcript and a catalog from the chi-ropractic, professional or graduate school/s from which they are transferring, as well as a syllabus from each course for which the student is requesting transfer credit. Advanced Standing Students who are accepted as transfer stu-dents may receive advanced standing if a substantial number of semester hours have been accepted by UBCC. This could possi-bly enable the student to complete the D.C. program in less than 8 semesters. Transfer credit may be granted either with or without College of Chiropractic advanced standing, Effective Fall 2005, The University of Bridgeport College of Chiro- practic will grant no more than a maximum of 20% of advanced standing credit/hours towards our curriculum. A transfer student is eligible to receive no more than 42 transfer credits. Potential transfer students should be aware that in most cases they would have to complete approximately, 3 to 3 1/2 years at UBCC if accepted. If advanced standing is granted: 1. A special curriculum schedule will be made up for the student based on semes-ter hours transferred and course avail- ability. 2. Tuition will be calculated based on the number of credits being taken per se-mester multiplied by the single credit fee (if less than 14 credits per semester) at the time of the student's attendance. If advanced standing is not granted, but some semester hours are transferable, the student will be admitted to the first semester and will be exempt from courses for which transfer credit was granted.77College of Naturopathic Medicine Dean: Elizabeth Wotton Pimentel, N.D.

Terfera, E. Zampieron Naturopathic medicine is a distinct profes- sion of primary health care that emphasizes prevention and treatment of disease, and promotion of optimal health and wellness through the use of natural therapies that en- hance the inherent healing wisdom of nature, the vis medicatrix naturae. Rooted in tradi-tion, naturopathic physicians utilize clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, physical medicine, and other natural modali-ties to help patients thrive. Most naturopathic physicians are in private practice, though op- portunities in group and integrative practice settings, research, and education are rapidly growing. The University of Bridgeport Col- lege of Naturopathic Medicine trains its stu-dents to a broad scope of practice, however, the actual scope of practice varies between states. Students are responsible for being in-formed of licensure requirements and scope of practice in the legal jurisdiction in which they plan to practice.The University of Bridgeport College of Natur - opathic Medicine offers a doctoral degree that prepares students for national (NPLEX), state, and provincial licensing exams, and for the general practice of naturopathic medicine. The program is an intensive four-year, full- time, academic and clinical curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the knowledge and skills essential to the practice of naturopathic medicine. There are no correspondence or distance-learning courses offered. Degree Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (N.D.) Recognition and Memberships The University of Bridgeport College of Naturopathic Medicine is approved to offer the degree of Doctor of Naturopathic Medi- cine by the Connecticut State Department of Higher Education.

The University of Bridgeport is accredited by the Council on Institutions of Higher Education (CIHE) of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). The college offers a cur - riculum that provides a strong foundation for the broad scope of naturopathic medical practice. UBCNM is an institutional member of the Association of Accredited Naturopath- ic Medical Colleges (AANMC). Mission Statement The Mission of the College of Naturopathic Medicine, an integral part of the Univer - sity of Bridgeport, is to train naturopathic physicians who practice medicine in a way that supports the inherent healing wisdom of nature and facilitates health and optimal well being, while preparing them to become leaders in natural healthcare delivery, re- search, and education. In support of this mission the College has the following Goals: The College will provide an education of the highest standards, with academic and clinical training based on the principles and philosophy of naturopathic medicine, leading to the degree of Doctor of Natur - opathic Medicine. The College will encourage and support the development of its students to become competent, compassionate, and success- ful naturopathic physicians who engage in collaboration with other healthcare prac- titioners to fully address the healthcare needs of their patients. The College will respect cultural differ - ences and will have an appreciation of traditional and conventional approaches to medicine. The College will conduct research to ad-vance the understanding and knowledge of the natural health sciences. The College will serve the public and sup- port the clinical education of its students by providing naturopathic healthcare at the College Clinic and at other locations throughout the community. The College will seek to provide healthcare to under - served and disadvantaged populations, and to provide health education for the general public. The College will maintain appropriate standards for professional conduct and accountability and encourage students to become honorable and dedicated profes-sionals, committed to serve their commu- nities and the naturopathic profession. The College will pursue the development of residency opportunities for naturopath- ic graduates as an important component of naturopathic medical training. The College will cooperate with other organizations and institutions of higher learning to promote education and re- search related to natural medicine. The College will conduct its affairs and the execution of its program with honor and integrity. The College Community will work together to create and maintain a collegial, cultur - ally diverse environment that is mutually supportive for students, staff, and faculty for personal and professional growth. The College will provide advisement and assistance for graduates to find suitable positions upon graduation.78Program Objectives Upon successful completion of this pro- gram, students will: Demonstrate a comprehensive under - 1. standing of the history, principles and philosophy of Naturopathic Medicine. Apply an understanding of medicine, 2. including naturopathic medicine, in as- sessing the current state of the health- care system. First of all, to do no harm. To act in cooperation with the Healing Power of Nature. To address the fundamental causes of disease. To heal the whole person through individualized treatment. To teach the principles of healthy living and preventative medicine. Demonstrate the ability to integrate 3. naturopathic philosophy and principles with biomedical science, diagnostic sci- ence and naturopathic medical knowl-edge to safely and effectively diagnose and treat disease and promote indi- vidual and community health and well being. Demonstrate behavior that is ethical, 4. professional and accountable. Demonstrate an understanding of the 5. principles and importance of scientific and medical research, scholarly activity and life long learning. Naturopathic Principles and Practice The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians has adopted the following official definition of Naturopathic Medicine, its prin- ciples and practice: Naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary healthcare \u2014 an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosis, treat-ment and prevention of illness. Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles upon which its practice is based. The princi-ples are continually reexamined in the light of scientific advances. The techniques of naturopathic medicine include modern and traditional, scientific and empirical methods. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medica- trix Naturae): Naturopathic medicine rec-ognizes an inherent self-healing process in the person which is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): Naturopathic physicians follow three guide- lines to avoid harming a patient: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; Avoid when possible the harmful sup- pression of symptoms; Acknowledge, respect and work with the individual's self-healing process. Doctor As Teacher (Docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and em-power them to take responsibility for their health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic physi- cians treat each patient by taking into ac-count individual physical, mental, emo- tional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians en- courage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention: Naturopathic physicians empha- size the prevention of disease \u2014 assessing risk factors. heredity and susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interven-tions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine is committed to the creation of a healthy world in which humanity may thrive. PRACTICE Naturopathic Methods: Naturopathic medi- cine is defined by its principles. Diagnostic methods, treatments and modalities are se- lected and applied based upon these princi- ples in relationship to the unique individual needs of each patient. Naturopathic Practice: Naturopathic prac- tice includes the following diagnostic and therapeutic modalities: clinical nutrition; botanical medicine; naturopathic physical medicine including naturopathic manipu- lative therapy; public measures acupuncture; naturopathic ob- stetrics (natural childbirth); and laboratory assessment, diagnostic imaging, and clinical diagnosis. Curriculum The curriculum is designed to prepare graduates of the program to be competent, caring physicians offering comprehensive healthcare using traditional and modem methods and modalities in accordance with the principles of Naturopathic Medicine. The first year of the program is devoted to biomedical sciences and naturopathic phi- losophy. The second year of training is fo- cused on clinical sciences and the beginning of coursework in therapeutic modalities. The second two years introduce courses in naturopathic case management related to organ systems, special populations (e.g., pediatrics and geriatrics), in addition to ad- vanced study of therapeutic modalities. Clinical training begins after the completion of the second year of study. Students see pa- tients at the on-campus UB Clinics and off-site community clinics in the surrounding area under the supervision and direction of naturopathic physicians as well as other li-censed physicians. To be eligible for clinical education training and credit, students must be in good academic standing, successfully complete required courses in Semesters I through IV. Successfully complete the clinic entrance exam and have CPR certification. The course of study consists of four academic years of two 18-week semesters per academ- ic year.College of Naturopathic Medicine79Semester Based Curriculum YEAR 1 ____________________________________ SEMESTER I NUMBER COURSE LECT LAB SEM.

GRADES Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4)-point scale with an \"A\" or 4 quality points be-ing the highest grade attained. Grades with quality points are: GRADE QUALITY POINTS A 4.0 B+ 3.5 B 3.0 C+ 2.5 C 2.0 D 1.0 F 0.0 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semester hours into the number of points earned. Transfer credits are not included in this computation. Clinic Grades are: Satisfac- tory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U). Please refer to the Student Handbook for policies regarding grades of \"D\" and \"F\". Administrative Grades In addition to the Academic Grades submit- ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized. I The grade of Incomplete \"I\", is used by the faculty to indicate that a student has not completed all course require- ments for approved reasons. These in- clude illness that can be documented and family or other emergencies. A stu- dent will have one week from the last day of the term to contact the instruc-tor to arrange to complete all course requirements. Upon completion of the course requirements the faculty mem-ber will submit the earned grade. Fail- ure by the student to contact the in- structor within one week from the last day of the term, or to complete the required work by the time specified by the course instructor, and no later than one week before the end of the following term, will result in the grade of \"I\" being converted to a grade of \"F\". Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a prerequisite without approval by the course instructor and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. TCR This indicates transfer credit granted for equivalent work completed at another accredited institution. W Withdrawal grades are assigned on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of-registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of- registration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count towards \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have official- ly withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, including late withdrawals, must be approved by the Associate Dean before they become official and are recorded. Poor academic performance does not constitute a valid reason for late withdrawal. Academic Policies (See the College Student Handbook for the most current and complete description poli- cies and procedures.) ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS Each student is expected to attend all lec- tures and laboratories and other activities associated with the total completion of a given course. Certain courses are offered on evenings and weekends. A detailed description of the attendance policy can be sound in the college student handbook.

A student on academic probation may be placed in a program of academic remediation. The student is required to meet with a desig- nated advisor immediately to establish a plan for successful completion of the program. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who does not show substantial academic improvement after one semester of remediation, or who is unable to achieve a QPR of 2.50 after two semesters of reme-diation may be dismissed from the College of Naturopathic Medicine. Academic dismissal may also occur if a stu- dent's QPR falls below a 2.50 on a second occasion. Any student not achieving a QPR of at least 1.75 upon completion of the first semester of study may be academically dismissed from the College of Naturopathic Medicine. Please see the College Student Handbook for a complete description of policies and procedures for probation and dismissal.

Description The Fones School of Dental Hygiene, estab-lished in 1949 at the University of Bridge- port, was named for Dr. Alfred Civilion Fones, the dentist who was instrumental in creating the profession of dental hygiene in 1913. Accredited since the American Dental Association publication of September, 1953, the Fones program is in full accord with the principles established by the Commis- sion on Dental Accreditation, a specialized accrediting body recognized by the Coun- cil on Post-Secondary Accreditation and the United States Department of Education. The graduate is eligible for National, Regional, and State examinations in each of the fifty United States, and students earning the As- sociate's degree may apply their credits to- wards a Bachelor's degree. Accreditation The A.S. and B.S. degree programs in Den-tal Hygiene are both licensed and accredited by the State of Connecticut Department of Higher Education and the New England As- sociation of Schools and Colleges. Qualifications for Admissions The following physical qualifications are re- quired for participation in the Associate de- gree program at the UB Fones School of Den- tal Hygiene. These qualifications are essential for the preparation of AS Degree in Dental Hygiene. Students at the School must be able to perform at a high level of competency in all phases of classroom, clinic, and labora- tory activities as they will ultimately use the knowledge attained as dental hygienists. Applications for admittance to the A.S. and B.S. degree programs are received on indi- vidual merit. Applicants who show potential for the dental hygiene program, but do not meet criteria may be offered entrance into pre-dental hygiene. The applicant student must process: 1. Critical thinking ability sufficient for judg- ment during clinical activities. 2. Communication abilities for effective interaction verbally and in written form with patients and other members of the health care team. 3. Coordination and use of both upper and lower limbs as required for, among other skills, the performance of dental hygiene clinical procedures and emergency skills such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 4. Manual dexterity necessary for perfor - mance in the various clinical, dental laboratory, and basic science laborato-ries without posing a threat to her/him- self patients, or her/his fellow students' safety and well-being. 5. Hearing and visual abilities, appropriately assisted, acute enough to allow the indi- vidual recordation of patient histories, to provide routine safety instructions, and perform stethoscopic and other ausculta- tory examinations, and to read all forms of diagnostic imaging so that she/he can adequately interpret normal, abnormal, and pathologic changes. 6. Freedom from communicable diseases sufficient for rending safe and effective dental hygiene care.7. Ability to obtain a dental hygiene license as some states deny licenses for certain prior felony convictions. Applicants with disabilities will neither be summarily denied admission, nor will high- er scholastic requirements be demanded of them. All persons to be eligible for ac- ceptance to the School must be capable of demonstrating upon request their ability to perform classroom, laboratory, and clinical assignments, including microscopic work, x-ray interpretation and techniques, or the equivalent, pass written, oral, and practical examinations and meet all of the require- ments of the School as they evolve. It is the responsibility of the applicant/student to assess compliance with these requirements. By submitting an application to the University of Bridgeport, Fones School of Dental Hy-giene, the applicant is confirming their abil- ity to meet qualifications for entrance into the Fones School of Dental Hygiene program. General Criteria for the A.S. and the B.S. Degree in Dental Hygiene The two year basic core curriculum of the Fones School combines courses from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Fones School of Dental Hygiene to provide a broad educational preparation. In addition to basic and dental science theory, the program pro- vides education in preventive service and dental health education. During the second year, the students re- ceive clinical education at the Fones Den-tal Health Center on campus, and through assignments to the clinical and educational facilities of school dental health programs, hospitals and community agencies. These assignments are directly supervised by Fones faculty. Students are responsible for providing their own transportation to com- munity agencies. A student who earns a grade of C- or below in a course in the major field, must obtain a written statement from the School Director specifying the procedure necessary to rem- edy the deficiency and remain in the major. Enrollment in the second year is contingent on completing all first year requirements and achieving a QPR of 2.0. 87Education at the baccalaureate level en- hances the dental hygienists' opportunities, abilities, background and values. The pro- fessional dental hygiene curriculum is com-bined with a liberal arts education. Upon satisfactory completion of 120-125 credits in the areas of study specified, the student will be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene. Students in the Bachelor of Science degree (B.S.) may integrate the Bachelor's courses with the clinical aspect of the Dental Hy- giene curriculum or pursue a Baccalaureate degree (B.S.) after completing clinical prep- aration at the Associate in Science Certificate Level. This Baccalaureate degree comple- tion approach is available to Fones' students and graduates of a Dental Hygiene program that is accredited by a specialized accred- iting agency recognized by the Council on Post Secondary Accreditation and the United States Department of Education. All courses listed in the major program sec- tion of the catalog for the Associate in Sci- ence and/or Bachelor of Science degree are required for graduation. The majority of Dental Hygiene courses may be taken dur - ing the regular academic year. Dental Hygiene Bachelor of Science Degree Online Program The online B.S. in Dental Hygiene from The Fones School of Dental Hygiene at the University of Bridgeport offers an oppor - tunity for dental hygienists to further their education beyond the A.S. degree. Dental hygienists traditionally begin their profes- sional work following completion of the A.S. degree. The University of Bridgeport's B.S. in Dental Hygiene online degree pro- gram makes it possible for dental hygienists to work toward a degree at any time, from anywhere in the world. The program is per - fectly suited to adult learners who have the discipline for part-time, self-directed study under the guidance of qualified faculty in their field. The BSDH Online Program is identical to the on-campus degree comple- tion program and is designed to be com-pleted entirely online. Students who hold an A.S. or certificate in Dental Hygiene from an institution ac-credited by the American Dental Associa-tion Commission on Dental Accreditation are eligible for admission. A maximum of 72 credits from accredited two-year col- leges and 90 credits from accredited four- year institutions. The program consists of 120 credit hours which include applicable transfer credits (60-90 credit hours), general education courses (40 credit hours), dental hygiene courses (22 credit hours), and elec- tive courses (12 credit hours). The last 30 credit hours must be completed through the University of Bridgeport. The general edu- cation courses include University Core Re- quirements in English, Math, Fine Arts, Inte-grated Studies, Humanities, Natural Science, Social Science, and Capstone Seminar. Students who are graduates of the Fones School of Dental Hygiene, need not re- apply for admission. A re-admittance form, available on the website, needs to be com- pleted and forwarded to the Office of Dis- tance Education. Students may take 2 online courses per 8-week session, which is equivalent to 12 credits per semester. As a new online stu-dent, a one-week New Student Orientation course is offered prior to the start of each 8-week session at no charge. Financial aid is available for qualified students taking at least 6 credits per semester.

Classes are held online via the interactive Canvas system or via weekend only campus classes. The program is designed to be completed in 28 consecutive months if two classes are taken per cycle. Graduation is contingent upon completing the program and passing the comprehensive exam within 5 years from program start date. Students must remain in the program they enrolled in (online or on campus). UB does require some courses to be taken online by all students. ATTENDANCE CAMPUS WEEkEND FORMAT Each class period represents 20% of a four credit course or 25% or a three-credit course. Class attendance and participation are indis- pensable parts of the educational process that are required throughout the program. Since classes only meet 4 or 5 times, de-Nutrition Institute pending on whether the course is 3 or 4 credits, it is imperative that students attend class. In the event of absence due to illness or family emergency, please notify the Assis-tant Director and the instructor immediately. If more than one class is missed during the semester for either a 3 or 4 credit course you will receive a failing grade for the class and will have to repeat it. This includes absenc- es for illness. Make-up examinations due to absence WILL NOT will not be permitted without an approved legitimate excuse with full documentation (see makeup policies) and will result in a grade of zero for that exam. Students ARE NOT PERMITTED to leave class prior to 5pm unless prior authori- zation is received from the Assistant Director and this would require the same guidelines for approval as an absence. Prior approval must be sought during normal administra- tion business hours Monday - Friday. Those who leave class early without prior approval or subsequent documentation of illness or emergency that meet the guidelines speci-fied under makeup policies below will be penalized with a 20% grade deduction on their course grade. MAkE-UP POLICIES WEEkEND CAMPUS AND ONLINE FORMAT Make-up examinations and assignments will not be permitted without a legitimate excuse or prior approval from the instructor and as- sistant director and will result in a grade of zero. An acceptable excuse for prolonged illness, or family emergency, entitling a stu- dent to a make-up examination, requires a legitimate detailed doctor's note (with diag- nosis) by a U.S. licensed physician or official documentation of family emergency, which must be submitted to the Program Assistant Director and approved. Please note that only one make-up examination is allowed per course regardless of instructor approval. Missed exams must be taken before the next scheduled examination and may be modi- fied and made more difficult by the instruc- tor. Make-ups will not be granted for reasons of personal convenience, such as traveling, weddings and vacations. GRADING POLICY Online exams are timed. Your syllabus should define for you the time limit on the 92Nutrition Institute exam as well as when you log onto Canvas to complete it. Your are permitted to log onto the exam only ONCE and complete it in the required time frame. Students cannot log in and out of exams. Once submitted, the exam cannot be accessed again. Time limits set by the professors must be adhered to. Students who exceed the time limit on the exam, (this is reported to the instructor automatically) will receive a grading penalty equal to the percentage of excess time they took. For example, if an exam was sched- uled for 60 minutes and the student took 66 minutes to complete it, they would have exceeded the exam time by 10%. Therefore their exam grade would be penalized 10% of the total possible points for the exam. If exam was 100 points, then 10% would equal a 10 point deduction. Repeated violations of exam time may result in further grading penalties and will be reported to the pro- gram assistant director for review. FRAGRANCE FREE POLICY ON CAMPUS Many individuals are sensitive to perfumes and other scents (such as scented oils, scent- ed laundry soaps, scented deodorants, etc.) and have adverse health reactions upon ex-posure. In order to maintain an environ- ment that is conducive to health and learn- ing for all students and faculty members in the classroom, the Nutrition Institute has a \"fragrance free\" policy. The use of products that produce a noticeable odor and/or cause an adverse health reaction in other individu- als is prohibited. The use of such fragrances while attending class will be considered as a Violation of the Rules of Conduct. PLAGIARISIM POLICY Plagiarism is taken very seriously in the program. The UB policy on plagiarism can be found in the student handbook, Ch 2 at: http://www.bridgeport.edu/life/services-forstudents/key.aspx Students are also highly encouraged to take the on-line tutorial in avoiding unintentional plagiarism at http://www.indiana.edu/~istd/ Please be advised that UB faculty have ac- cess to \"Turn It In\" software which scans electronically for plagiarism from any pub-lished source and your assignments and discussion board posting may be screened using this tool. Ethics Statement of Confidentiality Students enrolled in the program are ex- pected to honor confidentiality as it pertains to student disclosure. Shared information, comments, or opinions expressed by an-other student or the faculty member during the course of classroom discussion should never be used in a manner which is intended to humiliate, embarrass, harass, damage, or otherwise injure other students in their per - sonal, public, or business lives.

The courses being considered for transfer must have been completed within the past seven years, with a grade of \"B\" or better, and be comparable to the University of Bridgeport's graduate courses. Physicians (i.e.: medical, osteopathic, chiropractic, naturopathic, etc.) may request advanced standing for 560A and 560B. However, many choose to take 560B (Biochemistry) if they have not had the course in many years, as a review and prep- aration for course 560D (Clinical Biochemis-try). Advanced transfer credit for physicians will only be granted for courses where a grade of \"B\" or better was achieved. INCOMPLETE COURSEWORk An \"I\" (Incomplete) designates incomplete work at the time of grading for reasons be- yond the control of the student, fully docu- mented, and corresponding to UB makeup policies as stated above, and determined to be bona-fide by the instructor and the As- sistant Program Director. If approved by the assistant director and the instructor, in- complete coursework must be completed by the end of the semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted. If the work has not been com- pleted and no grade has been submitted as indicated, the grade automatically becomes F. STUDENTS WHO ARE FAILING A COURSE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE AN INCOM- PLETE AND REPEAT THE COURSE TO AT - TAIN A NEW GRADE. A GRADE OF \"F\" WILL BE ISSUED AND THE COURSE WILL HAVE TO BE REPEATED BY RE-REGISTERING FOR THE COURSE. GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING PROBATION AND SEPARATION Good academic standing is achieved when a student maintains a 3.0 GPA. If the GPA drops below 3.0, the student will be placed on academic probation. A student, who re- ceives a second grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in any course, or is placed on probation in two dif-ferent semesters, will be separated from the program. In cases of academic probation, the student should consult with the Program Assistant Director for advice and planning to raise the GPA. In cases of separation from the program, a student may make a writ- ten appeal to the Director within ten days of the notification of separation. If an ap- peal is granted, the student will remain on academic probation and his progress will be monitored periodically during the semester. RESEARCH IN NUTRITION - COURSE 560J The research project can be taken as an elective, and is not required, as part of the Human Nutrition Program. The project can be a literature-based study or an original re-search project. Students have one semester to complete the project before incurring a fee. If thesis completion exceeds the one semester limit, the student must maintain continuous matriculation by registering for ADMIN 600, each semester, until the thesis has been completed. Graduation Requirements The minimum number of credits required for graduation is 41; the minimum GPA re- quired is 3.0. Students are expected to com- plete class work for the degree within five years of initial enrollment in the program. Successful completion of ALL sections of the comprehensive competency examination is required for graduation. This examination and all required re-takes are given on-site on the UB campus on a Saturday (exact dates published several months prior to each ex- amination) and will not be given by proctor at other sites or on alternate days of the week (no exceptions). If you cannot take exami- nations on a Saturday for any reason please consider the above policy before entering the program. Study guides and sample ques- tions will be available to all students eligible to sit the examination by the distance learn-ing department. Any sections that are not successfully completed must be re-taken on the UB campus at assigned dates. Only two attempts will be allowed without remedia- tion, as assigned by the program director.

Solimini The University of Bridgeport Physician As-sistant Institute is committed to the develop- ment of highly qualified physician assistants who will serve as tomorrow's leaders in the delivery of patient centered health care, educational and professional service. An understanding of the importance of integrat-ed medicine and an appreciation of global health issues will be woven into all phases our curriculum Degree Master of Science: Physician Assistant Accreditation The University of Bridgeport Physician As-sistant Institute received provisional accredi- tation from the Accreditation Review Com- mittee for Physician Assistant Education. All students graduating from a provisionally ac-credited program are eligible to sit for the national certification examination. Provisional Accreditation is an accreditation status granted by ARC-PA for a limited, de- fined period of time to a new PA program that has demonstrated its preparedness to initiate a program in accordance with the Ac- creditation Standards for Physician Assistant Education. Provisional Accreditation does not ensure any subsequent accreditation status. The program will be reevaluated in 2013 for full accreditation status. Mission Statement The mission of the University of Bridgeport Physician Assistant Institute is to develop cli- nicians with: dedication to patients; commit- ment to life-long education; respect for the profession; a global perspective on health care; volunteerism as a professional core val- ue and an integrative approach to practice for the benefit of all patients. This mission to educate the physician assistant is reflected in our motto: Adiuvare, Mederi, Communiter; TO HELP, TO HEAL, TOGETHER. Curriculum The physician assistant curriculum is com-prised of a rigorous 28 month Master of Sci- ence Program. The goals and objectives of our program are guided by the criteria set forth in the Standards and Guidelines for an Accredited Educational Program for the Physician Assistant as established by the Ac-creditation Review Commission on educa- tion for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). The first four terms are made up of primarily classroom instruction. The intensity of our didactic curriculum is matched by the rigor of the clinical phase of the program and the unique relationship that we have with the St. Vincent's Medical Center and many com- munity medical practices. The didactic phase of our curriculum provides a comprehensive background in the basic and clinical sciences which includes courses in human anatomy and physiology, microbiology, genetics, pharmacology, history taking and physical examination, clinical medicine, procedural skills, medical ethics, global medicine, in- tegrative medicine and patient education and counseling. Course content is presented through traditional lecture, blended instruc-tion, case based and hands on skills labs. The curriculum is overseen by primary facul- ty and may include University of Bridgeport basic science and health professional faculty, practicing physician assistants, physicians and providers who have the expertise in their respective specialty. The clinical year expos-es the student to the areas of family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, general surgery and psychiatry. The student is also given the opportunity to choose two elec- tives in an area of interest. The didactic and clinical phases of curriculum are designed to enable the student to acquire proficiency in the competencies of the physician assistant. Program Objectives In the design of the curriculum and clinical experiences it is the goal of the Physician Assistant Institute: To develop self motivated and high quality graduates committed to self discovery and self assessment through the application and eval- uation of clinical practice obtained through critical evaluation of the medical literature. To develop highly competent Physician As- sistants evidenced by the ability to transfer knowledge from the classroom and clerk- ship experience to graduate clinical perfor - mance through: Successfully passing the National Certify- ing examination Acquisition and application of the basic and clinical sciences Understanding the diversity amongst pa- tients, ideas, perceptions of care, and cul- ture while respecting the values associated with their ethnicity, sexual orientation and background. Developing an appreciation for patient preferences and the diversity of the treat- ments and healers they seek. The ability to implement effective commu- nication skills to colleagues, patients and families they encounter to improve patient care and outcome. To develop a solid professional value sys-tem, committed to life-long learning, profes-sional development and advocacy for the profession. It is the intention of the University of Bridge- port, Faculty of Health Science and the Phy-95sician Assistant Institute to endeavor to com- municate these goals through our teaching, role modeling and clinical practice. Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession Preamble In 2003, the National Commission on Cer - tification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA) initiated an effort to define PA competen- cies in response to similar efforts being con-ducted within other health care professions and growing demand for accountability and assessment in clinical practice. The follow-ing year, representatives from three other national PA organizations, each bringing a unique perspective and valuable insights, joined NCCPA in that effort. Those organiza- tions were the Accreditation Review Com- mission for Education of the Physician As-sistant (ARC-PA), the body that accredits PA educational programs; the Association of Physician Assistant Programs (APAP), the membership association for PA educators and program directors; and the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA), the only national membership association repre-senting all PAs. The resultant document, Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession, is a foundation from which each of those four organizations, other physician assistant orga- nizations and individual physician assistants themselves can chart a course for advancing the competencies of the PA profession. Introduction The purpose of this document is to commu- nicate to the PA profession and the public a set of competencies that all physician assis- tants regardless of specialty or setting are ex-pected to acquire and maintain throughout their careers. This document serves as a map for the individual PA, the physician-PA team and organizations that are committed to pro- moting the development and maintenance of these professional competencies among physician assistants. The clinical role of PAs includes primary and specialty care in medical and surgical practice settings. Professional competencies for phy-sician assistants include the effective and ap- propriate application of medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, pa- tient care, professionalism, practice-based learning and improvement, systems-based practice, as well as an unwavering com-mitment to continual learning, professional growth and the physician-PA team, for the benefit of patients and the larger community being served. These competencies demon- strated within the scope of practice, whether medical or surgical, for each individual phy-sician assistant as that scope is defined by the supervising physician and appropriate to the practice setting. In 1999, the Accreditation Council for Gradu- ation Medical Education (ACGME) endorsed a list of general competencies for medical residents. NCCPA's Eligibility Committee, with substantial input from representatives of AAPA, APAP and ARC-PA, has modified the ACGME's list for physician assistant prac- tice, drawing from several other resources, including the work of Drs. Epstein and Hun-dert; research conducted by AAPA's EVP/ CEO, Dr. Steve Crane; and NCCPA's own ex- amination content blueprint. The PA profession defines the specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes required and provides educational experiences as needed in order for physician assistants to acquire and demonstrate these competencies. MEDICAL kNOWLEDGE Medical knowledge includes an understand-ing of pathophysiology, patient presentation, differential diagnosis, patient management, surgical principles, health promotion and disease prevention. Physician assistants must demonstrate core knowledge about estab- lished and evolving biomedical and clinical sciences and the application of this knowl- edge to patient care in their area of practice. In addition, physician assistants are expected to demonstrate an investigatory and analytic thinking approach to clinical situations. Phy- sician assistants are expected to: understand etiologies, risk factors, underlying pathologic process, and epidemiology for medical conditions identify signs and symptoms of medical conditions select and interpret appropriate diag-nostic or lab studies manage general medical and surgical conditions to include understanding the indications, contraindications, side effects, interactions and adverse reactions of pharmacologic agents and other relevant treatment modali-ties identify the appropriate site of care for presenting conditions, including cases and those requiring referral or admission identify appropriate interventions for prevention of conditions identify the appropriate methods to detect conditions in an asymptomatic individual differentiate between the normal and the abnormal in anatomic, physio- logical, laboratory findings and other diagnostic data appropriately use history and physi-cal findings and diagnostic studies to formulate a differential diagnosis provide appropriate care to patients with chronic conditions INTERPERSONAL & COMMUNICATION SkILLS Interpersonal and communication skills en- compass verbal, nonverbal and written ex- change of information. Physician assistants must demonstrate interpersonal and commu-nication skills that result in effective informa- tion exchange with patients, their patients' families, physicians, professional associates, and the health care system. Physician assis- tants are expected to: create and sustain a therapeutic and ethi- cally sound relationship with patients use effective listening, nonverbal, explana-tory, questioning, and writing skills to elicit and provide information appropriately adapt communication style and messages to the context of the indi-vidual patient interaction work effectively with physicians and other health care professionals as a member or leader of a health care team or other pro- fessional group apply an understanding of human behav-ior demonstrate emotional resilience and sta- bility, adaptability, flexibility and tolerance of ambiguity and anxiety Physician Assistant Institute96 accurately and adequately document and record information regarding the care pro- cess for medical, legal, quality and finan- cial purposes PATIENT CARE Patient care includes age-appropriate assess-ment, evaluation and management. Physi- cian assistants must demonstrate care that is effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient and equitable for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of wellness. Physician assistants are expected to: work effectively with physicians and other health care professionals to provide pa- tient-centered care demonstrate caring and respectful behav-iors when interacting with patients and their families gather essential and accurate information about their patients make informed decisions about diagnostic and therapeutic interventions based on pa- tient information and preferences, up-to- date scientific evidence, and clinical judg-ment develop and carry out patient management plans counsel and educate patients and their families competently perform medical and surgi-cal procedures considered essential in the area of practice provide health care services and education aimed at preventing health problems or maintaining health PROFESSIONALISM Professionalism is the expression of posi-tive values and ideals as care is delivered. Foremost, it involves prioritizing the inter - ests of those being served above one's own. Physician assistants must know their profes- sional and personal limitations. Professional- ism also requires that PAs practice without impairment from substance abuse, cognitive deficiency or mental illness. Physician assis- tants must demonstrate a high level of re- sponsibility, ethical practice, sensitivity to a diverse patient population and adherence to legal and regulatory requirements. Physician assistants are expected to demonstrate: understanding of legal and regulatory re- quirements, as well as the appropriate role of the physician assistant professional relationships with physician supervisors and other health care provid- ers respect, compassion, and integrity responsiveness to the needs of patients and society accountability to patients, society, and the profession commitment to excellence and on-going professional development commitment to ethical principles pertain-ing to provision or withholding of clinical care, confidentiality of patient information, informed consent, and business practices sensitivity and responsiveness to patients' culture, age, gender, and disabilities self-reflection, critical curiosity and initia- tive PRACTICE-BASED LEARNING AND IMPROVEMENT Practice-based learning and improvement includes the processes through which clini- cians engage in critical analysis of their own practice experience, medical literature and other information resources for the purpose of self-improvement. Physician assistants must be able to assess, evaluate and improve their patient care practices. Physician assis- tants are expected to: analyze practice experience and perform practice-based improvement activities us- ing a systematic methodology in concert with other members of the health care de-livery team locate, appraise, and integrate evidence from scientific studies related to their pa-tients' health problems obtain and apply information about their own population of patients and the larger population from which their patients are drawn apply knowledge of study designs and sta- tistical methods to the appraisal of clinical studies and other information on diagnos- tic and therapeutic effectiveness apply information technology to manage information, access on-line medical infor - mation, and support their own education facilitate the learning of students and/or other health care professionals recognize and appropriately address gen-der, cultural, cognitive, emotional and other biases; gaps in medical knowledge; and physical limitations in themselves and others SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE Systems-based practice encompasses the societal, organizational and economic en- vironments in which health care is deliv- ered. Physician assistants must demonstrate an awareness of and responsiveness to the larger system of health care to provide pa- tient care that is of optimal value. PAs should work to improve the larger health care sys- tem of which their practices are a part. Phy- sician assistants are expected to: use information technology to support pa- tient care decisions and patient education effectively interact with different types of medical practice and delivery systems understand the funding sources and pay-ment systems that provide coverage for patient care practice cost-effective health care and re-source allocation that does not compro-mise quality of care advocate for quality patient care and assist patients in dealing with system complexi-ties partner with supervising physicians, health care managers and other health care pro-viders to assess, coordinate, and improve the delivery of health care and patient out- comes accept responsibility for promoting a safe environment for patient care and recogniz- ing and correcting systems-based factors that negatively impact patient care apply medical information and clinical data systems to provide more effective, ef-ficient patient care use the systems responsible for the appro- priate payment of services Physician Assistant Institute97Semester Based Curriculum TERM I NUMBER COURSE CREDITS MSPA 511 Anatomy I with Lab 4 MSPA 521 Physiology/Biochemistry I 3 MSPA 531 Introduction to Clinical Lab and 3 Microbiology MSPA 556 Patient Education and Counseling 2 MSPA 551 History and Physical Exam I with Lab 3 MSPA 505 Information Literacy 3 MSPA 541 Clinical Genetics 2 Term Total 20 TERM II NUMBER COURSE CREDITS MSPA 526 Pathophysiology 3 MSPA 512 Anatomy II with Lab 4 MSPA 522 Physiology/Biochemistry II 3 MSPA 552 History and Physical Exam II with Lab 3 MSPA 571 Clinical Pharmacology I 3 MSPA 611 Clinical Medicine I with Lab 4 MSPA 632 Integrative Medicine and Practice I 1 MSPA 642 Medical Seminar 2 Term Total 23 TERM III NUMBER COURSE CREDITS MSPA 553 History and Physical Exam III with Lab 4 MSPA 612 Clinical Medicine II with Lab 8 MSPA 604 Professional Practice and Policy 2 MSPA 561 Health, Wellness and Nutrition 2 Throughout the Lifespan MSPA 603 Medical Ethics 2 MSPA 633 Integrative Medicine and Practice II 2 MSPA 643 Medical Seminar II 2 Term Total 22 TERM IV NUMBER COURSE CREDITS MSPA 613 Clinical Medicine III with Lab 8 MSPA 620 Fundamentals of Surgery 4 MSPA 602 Information Literacy and Medical 2 Writing MSPA 608 Global Health 2 MSPA 634 Integrative Medicine and Practice III 2 MSPA 644 Medical Seminar III 2 MSPA 572 Clinical Pharmacology II 3 *MSPA 651 Clinical Clerkship I 4 Term Total 27 TERM V NUMBER COURSE CREDITS *MSPA 652 Clinical Clerkship II 4 Clinical 4 *MSPA 654 Clinical Clerkship IV 4 MSPA 644 Medical Seminar 2 Term Total 22TERM VI NUMBER COURSE CREDITS *MSPA 655 Clinical Clerkship V 4 *MSPA 656 Clinical Clerkship VI 4 MSPA 645 Medical Seminar 2 MSPA 698 Capstone Project 2 Term Total 12 TERM VI NUMBER COURSE CREDITS *MSPA 657 Clinical Clerkship VII 4 *MSPA 670 Clinical Clerkship VIII 4 *MSPA 680 Clinical Clerkship IX 4 Term Total 12 *CORE SUPERVISED CLINICAL CLERKSHIPS All students are required to complete all of the seven core supervised clinical clerkships. The clinical clerkship sequence will be indi-vidually assigned to students by the Director of Clinical Education. Emergency Medicine - The Emergency Med- icine clerkship gives the physician assistant student direct involvement and experience in a hospital Emergency Department setting. This will provide the student with practical clinical experience in the diagnosis, evalu- ation, and management of a wide range of emergent medical, orthopedic, traumatic, and surgical conditions. Students will par - ticipate in the care of pediatric and adult pa- tients in all triage acuity classifications. This experience consists of a six week supervised clinical experience in an affiliated hospital emergency department designed to further develop the concepts of diagnosis and man- agement acquired during the pre-clinical course-work and to develop decision-mak- ing and cognitive skills related to patient care in an emergency room. This course will also provide the student a chance to de- velop additional clinical psychomotor skills by performing routine basic procedures in a supervised setting. By the completion of the rotation, the student will have gained an appreciation for the delivery of emergency medical care as well as an understanding of the role of the PA in the Emergency Depart- ment setting. Family Medicine - This six week clinical clerkship is designed to expose the student to a variety of common ambulatory care situations. Settings vary, but experiences are centered around primary care, general medicine, and family practice. Students are responsible for eliciting chief complaints, gathering pertinent historical data, and per - forming relevant physical examinations. Stu-dents are also expected to develop problem lists, diagnostic impressions and therapeutic plans. These are to be presented to the pre- ceptor in an organized, thoughtful manner. Students are expected to attend conferences on primary care problems when offered and participate in other assigned activities. Internal Medicine - This 6 week clerkship is designed to provide an opportunity for the student to build on previous didactic experi-ence and begin to develop competence in clinical medicine. The student is exposed to patients with a wide group of acute and chronic medical conditions. This clerkship will emphasize skills in gathering historical data, examination of patients, and provide the opportunity to perform a variety of diag- nostic and therapeutic procedures. Students will interpret laboratory, EKG, and a variety of radiology studies. Students will formu-late treatment plans; participate in discharge planning and patient education. Obstetrics and Gynecology - This six week clerkship is designed to provide the student with exposure to common prenatal and gy- necological problems. Hospital and clinic settings offer the student a wide range of out- patient and/or inpatient experience. The stu- dent will become confident with the routine gynecological evaluation and patient educa- tion. The student may have the opportunity to participate in labor and delivery. Emphasis is placed on data gathering, differential diag- nosis, patient management, maintenance of medical records, performance of diagnostic and therapeutic skills, follow up care and the provision of health education and counseling. Pediatrics - This six week clerkship is de- signed to provide the student with exposure to common pediatric problems. Emphasis is placed on assessment and management of normal and abnormal growth and develop- ment, as well as acute and chronic disease states. The student will develop skills in ob- taining historical information and examining the pediatric patient. While most of the ex-perience will occur in the office setting, the student will have the opportunity to be in- volved on the pediatric inpatient setting also. Psychiatry/Behavioral Medicine - This six week clerkship provides students experience Physician Assistant Institute98in working with patients who have psychiat- ric, behavioral or substance abuse problems. Emphasis is placed on the recognition and management of these problems. The student will learn how to do a mental status exam and medically assess the patient to screen for non psychiatric causes of the patient's clinical presentation. The student will be in- volved in treating patients with psychiatric as well as co-occurring disorders with alcohol, benzodiazepine or opiate dependence. Surgery - This is a six week clerkship on an inpatient surgical service with hospital operating room experiences. The student is exposed to the concepts and principles which characterize the practice of medicine in general surgery, while participating in the pre- and post-operative evaluation and care of surgical patients. The role of the physician assistant student on the general surgical ser - vice includes performing the admission histo-ry and physical examination, monitoring and recording patient progress on daily rounds, performing and/or assisting with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, assisting the surgeon in the operating room; participating in the post-operative care and management of patients, in addition to providing patient/ family education and support. GRADING The Physician Assistant Institute letter grade system for courses is as follows: Grade Quality Points A 4.00 B+ 3.50 B 3.00 C+ 2.50 C 2.00 D 1.00 \u2014 Considered Failing F 0.00 P/F Courses in this grading category are not calculated in the GPA I For Incomplete coursework W Withdrawal from Course Clerkship grades will use the same scale as the didactic courses. Administrative Grades I The grade of Incomplete \"I\", is used by the faculty to indicate that a student has not completed all course requirements. A student will have one week from the last day of the term to meet with the faculty and complete all course require- ments. Upon completion of the course requirements the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete the requirements in one week from the last day of the term will result in the grade of \"I\" being converted to a grade of \"F.\"Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register and retake that course in it's entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a prerequisite. W Withdrawal grades are assigned based on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change- of-registration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\"is assigned and that course remains on the student's tran-script. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count toward \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have of- ficially withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, including late withdrawals, must be approved by the Director and the Vice Provost for Health Sciences before they become of-ficial and are recorded. Poor academic performance doe s not constitute a val- id reason for late withdrawal. Since courses in the Physician Assistant Pro- gram are sequential a withdrawal would pro- hibit the student from continuing. Academic policies Academic policies used to manage and di- rect the academic program are: 1. Attendance Requirements2. Requirements for Graduation 3. Good Academic Standing 4. Academic Warning, Probation and Dismissal 5. Dismissal from the College (Non-Academic) 6. Withdrawal from the Program 7. Readmission to the Program DIDACTIC APPEALS PROCESS A student may appeal a grade, first to the instructor and then to the Director of Aca- demic Affairs and finally the Director. If after appeal to the Director, a student remains un-satisfied, then an appeal may be presented to the Progress and Promotions committee. In this latter instance, the appeal must be based on substantive academic grounds. Clinical Clerkship Appeals Process: A stu- dent may appeal a grade, first to the Director of Clinical Education and finally the Direc- tor. If after appeal to the Director, a student remains unsatisfied, then an appeal may be presented to the Progress and Promotions committee. In this latter instance, the ap- peal must be based on substantive academic grounds. ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS In the Physician Assistant Program, it is ex-pected that all students will assume respon- sibility for meeting all academic and clinical obligations with punctuality. Student atten-dance is expected in all classes and repre- sents a component of professionalism. Stu- dents remain responsible for all of the work in the courses in which they are registered. Students must arrive at all educational and clinical sessions with the necessary lab in-struments, texts, attire, and other materials as designated by the instructor, or may oth- erwise be excluded from participation in the activity. Students not properly prepared for competencies will not be evaluated. Make up competencies for lack of preparation will not be offered. Acceptance into the Physician Assistant Insti- tute at the University of Bridgeport requires a full-time commitment. It is an intense and rigorous program that is demanding. The program strongly discourages students from holding an outside job during the didactic and clinical years.Physician Assistant Institute99Academic Progress STUDENT STATUS IN GOOD STANDING To maintain full graduate status, the stu- dent must achieve a minimum GPA of 3.000 (based on 4.000) in his or her graduate study. Students whose GPA drops below a 3.000 while in the program will be placed on academic probation. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS Students enrolled in the Physician Assistant Institute Master of Science degree program are in good academic standing and are mak- ing satisfactory academic progress; if they have successfully achieved the following cri- teria upon completion of their most recent semester of course work: 1. Did not receive a grade of \"F or D\" in any course, and 2. Maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or better. A student who has not achieved the above criteria is not making satisfactory academic progress will be evaluated by the Director and the Progress and Promotion committee and will be required to follow the criteria as outlined in the catalog regarding Academic Probation and Dismissal. PROGRESS AND PROMOTIONS Each student will be presented by the fac- ulty to the progress and promotions commit- tee. The committee meets toward the end of the didactic period and once again prior to graduation. The committee is charged with the responsibility to assure that students are maintaining progress. If a student is not progressing as expected the committee may make recommendations for remediation or dismissal. ACADEMIC ADVISING Students will be assigned an academic advi-sor upon admission to the program. Students will meet with their advisor at least once per term to discuss progress and any problems they may be experiencing. REMEDIATION Student progress will be monitored with enough frequency to ensure that deficiencies in students' knowledge, skills and profes-sionalism are identified in a timely fashion. Once identified, students with deficiencies will be required to enter the program's re-mediation process. Students will meet with course directors and their faculty advisors to identify the nature and underlying causes of the problems. Opportunities for remediation will be identified and the program will work with students to their fullest ability. Reme-dial actions may include referral for tutoring, time management, study skills enhancement, test taking strategies, and/or personal coun-seling. Faculty advisors will meet regularly with students for documentation and follow- up. For further details please refer to the full policy in Appendix A of the Physician Assis- tant Institute student handbook. ACADEMIC PROBATION Graduate students must have a 3.000 cumula-tive GPA to be eligible to graduate. Graduate students whose cumulative GPA falls below a 3.000 will be placed on academic proba- tion and will receive written notification of this status. At this point it is the student's responsibility to meet with his or her advi- sor. In order to be removed from academic probation, the student will need to achieve a cumulative GPA of 3.000 within his or her next term of study. Failure to do so may sub- ject the student to immediate dismissal from the program at the discretion of the Program Director. PROGRAM WITHDRAWAL Any student wishing to withdraw from the PA program must submit this in writing to the Program Director detailing the reason for withdrawal and expected plans if any, to return. A student who withdraws in \"good standing\" academically, will be allowed to reapply to the program after an interview with the program administration without going through the full admissions process. An exit interview with the Program Director will be required. A student in this category will be required to interview once again with program administration before readmission is approved. Students who are withdrawing due to issues of an academic nature will be required to exit interview with Program Director and the Director of Academic Affairs to delineate a plan, detailing requirements for readmission. A student in this category will be required to interview once again with program adminis-tration before readmission is approved. DISMISSAL At any time a student can be dismissed from the program for academic or professional be- havioral reasons. Any student in jeopardy of dismissal from the program will be notified in writing and have the option to respond. If necessary, an AD HOC Progress and Promo- tions committee will be convened and the issue presented. All recommendations of the committee will be presented to the Program Director for final action. DISMISSAL FROM THE COLLEGE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea-sons for dismissal from the College. The fol- lowing is a list of additional causes for dis- missal: 1. Failure to meet the generally accepted standards of ethical conduct and clinical practice. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 2. Pleading guilty or \"nolo contende,\" or be-ing found guilty of any crime involving moral turpitude or being felonious in na-ture. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or the demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the College.

ELI also organizes off-campus trips and on-campus activities designed to introduce in- ternational students to the United States, its language and its people. ELI classes are offered year round, Monday through Friday. Full-time students attend class in the mornings and afternoons. Part-time students can choose to attend mornings or afternoons. For full-time students, a typical day consists of 5 hours of instruction, includ-ing classroom instruction in grammar, com- position, reading, listening, and speaking, and assigned work in the university's state-of-the-art language laboratory. ELI provides highly individualized instruction. Classes are limited to 15 students per teacher. ELI students receive a University of Bridge- port student I.D. card and are entitled to use facilities on the campus of the University of Bridgeport, such as the Wahlstrom Library, Centers for Academic Computing, Email/ Internet access, and the Wheeler Recreation Center, to name but a few. Admission ELI students must have a strong personal commitment to learning the English lan- guage. Courses in English as a Second Lan- guage are offered year-round at all levels from low-intermediate through advanced. ELI application forms and additional pro- gram information may be obtained at the above address or may be printed out di- rectly from the ELI Internet address shown above.Applicants must be at least 17 years old. Applications are accepted at any time of the year and new students may begin class throughout the year. ELI issues an official let- ter of admission to the program and an I-20 form promptly upon receiving a completed ELI application. After receiving the I-20 is- sued by ELI, the prospective student may apply for an F-1 student visa at an American embassy or consulate prior to coming to the United States. Why Students Enroll at ELI Many students wish to enrich their knowl-edge of the English language while on leave from a school or a job in their home coun- try. Most of these students return to their home country after a stay at ELI of from 7 weeks to a full year or more. Many ELI students plan to apply for admis- sion to a degree program at the University of Bridgeport. They improve their knowl- edge of English to meet the English lan- guage requirement for university admission. These students usually obtain \"conditional acceptance\" to a degree program and will receive full acceptance when they satisfy the University's English language requirement for admission. It should be noted that suc-cessful completion of ELI's advanced level satisfies the English language requirement for admission to the University of Bridge-port. ELI graduates are not required to take the TOEFL. The Curriculum The curriculum of ELI focuses on improving skills in speaking, listening comprehension, writing, and reading. At all levels of the cur - riculum, ELI instructors seek to help stu- dents improve their language skills through active use of the language both in and out of the classroom. New students complete a placement test upon arrival and are placed in the appropri- ate level of English. Successful completion of the session allows the student to move up to the next level. Student who are placed in the lower levels concentrate on basic grammar, speaking, lis- tening, and reading skills, and practice para- graph writing. As students progress through the levels, they continue to improve their speaking and listening skills while taking on more challenging tasks in reading and writing. At all levels, reading novels and watching videos specially designed for ESL students provide the basis for rich classroom discussions to improve listening and speak- ing skills and prepare for American style classroom interaction. In the advanced levels, students strive to achieve competence in language-dependent tasks similar to those that are required of native speakers of English in both academic and career-related activities. These include reading for content; note-taking from spo- ken and written materials; speaking skills needed to relate information, to persuade, to negotiate, and to inquire; and skills need- ed in essay and report writing, as well as in effective correspondence. Graduates of ELI receive a \"Certificate of Completion\" which certifies that they have met the English language requirement for admission to the University of Bridgeport. Grades reports are issued upon request. Schedule of Charges Please see insert for current academic year for tuition, fees, and other expense. ELI students should plan on spending about $200 per 8-week session to cover required books and miscellaneous personal expenses such as recreational travel, local transporta- tion, books, laundry, clothing, etc. Application Forms and Additional Information Prospective students may obtain application forms, credit card charge forms, insurance information, etc. at ELI's Internet site, by email, or by calling or faxing ELI.105Ernest C.

To this end the University has established a Pre-Law and a Pre-Health advisory program. Pre-Law Studies Advisor: William Greenspan Mandeville Hall (203) 576-4378 Fax: (203) 576-4388 E-mail: profweg@bridgeport.edu While no single curricular path is the ideal preparation for law school, a broadly based undergraduate program that includes train - ing in analytical reasoning and writing will serve you well. Law schools want students who can think, read, and write and who have some understanding of the forces that have shaped human experience. You can acquire these attributes in any number of college courses, whether in the humanities, the social sciences, or the natural sciences. English language and literature courses are virtually indispensable. At the same time, every law student should be aware of the in - stitutional processes of government through which much of the law is made and applied. You can gain this awareness through study in political science. Because the law is in - separable from our historic experience, you should have some acquaintance with Ameri - can history. The fact that many legal subjects are intimately concerned with economic relations among individuals, and with the structure and development of business en - terprises, makes a knowledge of macro and microeconomics valuable. Statistics, account - ing, and computer science are other courses that will help you to understand special legal subjects and the practice of law. Accredited law schools require that appli - cants take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). In the admissions process, law schools are primarily interested in the stu - dent's LSAT score, the student's GPA, and the intensity and depth of the student's un - dergraduate program, showing the student's capacity to perform well at an academically rigorous level.For more information on pre-law studies, check out the Law School Admission Coun - cil at www.lsac.org. Pre-Health Professional Studies Advisor to Pre-Health: Spiros Katsifis Charles Dana Hall 169 Fax: (203) 576-4262 E-mail: (203) 576-4956 Virtually all of the professional schools in these fields have the same minimum en - trance requirements: 1. Completion of 90 credit hours of college work or completion of a bachelor's de- gree, 2. Completion of laboratory science courses in the following subjects: Biology - 8 credit hours General Chemistry - 8 credit hours Organic Chemistry - 8 credit hours General Physics - 8 credit hours 3. Completion of a liberal arts core that in-cludes English composition, psychology, communications, humanities, social sci- ences, and the fine arts. Depending on the health profession and school some variation in these requirements does occur. The highest percentage of students admit - ted to health professional graduate schools major in biology with chemistry the second most common major. However, students ma -joring in any discipline, e.g. history, music, or psychology, are also viable candidates provided they satisfy the pre-requisites of the professional school to which they seek admission. The University of Bridgeport's Biology Ma - jor offers a B.A. or B.S. degree that provides a rigorous scientific and technical program for the pre-health professional student. See the Biology major for additional details. The University of Bridgeport's Bachelor of Science in General Studies (B.S.) degree program provides the student with the op - portunity to create a program, in consulta - tion with their advisor, that may fit the indi - vidual student's particular needs. The University offers a pre-Chiropractic program in the Biology major and the Gen - eral Studies major. These programs are of - fered with the cooperation of the Univer - sity of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic. In both programs the student may elect a 90-Credit Basic Option, Combined Bacca - laureate/Doctor of Chiropractic Option, or Complete Baccalaureate followed by Doctor of Chiropractic Option. See the description of the pre-chiropractic program elsewhere in the catalog. A pre-Naturopathic program is also of - fered in cooperation with the University of Bridgeport's College of Naturopathic Medi - cine. In this program a student must com - plete the bachelor's degree before entering the College of Naturopathic Medicine. See the description of this program elsewhere in the catalog. It should be noted that pre-health pro - fessional study in any of the above areas provides an excellent foundation for other careers in the health sciences, including os - teopathy, podiatry, physical therapy, optom - etry, and pharmacy. 107Pre-Professional Programs for Chiropractic The University of Bridgeport offers a pre- professional program for students prepar - ing for Chiropractic College, the Pre-Chiro - practic Program for undergraduate students.

A number of interdisciplin - ary courses have been designed for those students wishing a maximum overview of multinational issues in accounting and taxation as well as for those students who intend to pursue more advanced studies in accounting. Accounting students who ex - pect to take the Certified Public Accountant professional examinations should select elective courses with the approval of and in consultation with the Chair of the Account - ing Department. The University Core Curriculum requires passing the mathematics competency exam or taking Mathematics 105. This competen - cy is a prerequisite for CAIS 101. Students anticipating graduate study in Business are advised to take Calculus as a free elective. Upper Division coursework provides stu - dents with a common body of managerial knowledge, multinational business studies, study in a major field, and an internship or business development project. The con - centration of professional courses in the last two years builds upon the broad-based analytical tools and liberal arts foundation of the first two years. A student is admitted to the School of Business, through an evaluation of the high school transcript, class rank, and SAT scores, based on the determination that the student has demonstrated potential in analytical reasoning, comprehension and expression in words and creative power in thinking. Students transferring from under - graduate majors of other colleges should have a minimum quality point ratio of 2.5. Management 350, Business Policy and Strat - egy, is the Capstone Course of this degree program. The final examination of this course shall constitute, therefore, an out - come assessment of what the student has learned in the program. This examination, normally an extensive and comprehensive case study, will be graded by several fac - ulty members representing different and relevant disciplines. Learning Outcomes Learning Objectives Students 1) acquire the knowledge neces - sary for an understanding of business data; 2) develop the technical skills necessary to measure, analyze, and interpret economic data; 3) learn how to effectively commu - nicate economic data; and 4) acquire the accounting foundation that enables them to pursue advanced study required for the successful completion of the CPA exam. assessment Students are evaluated with exams, home - work assignments and oral presentations. Students will be evaluated and bench - marked with a standardized accounting test. This will ensure their preparation for graduate study towards the CPA exam.

It is an excellent choice for students who enjoy literature and want to develop the essential skills of reading, independent critical think-ing, and polished writing and analysis. For the Bachelor of Science degree, students may choose concentrations in either Litera-ture or Creative Writing. The BS degrees do not include the modern language require-ment, thereby permitting students more freedom to explore other areas of study and perhaps elect a minor in a related field. Literature courses require extensive writing and critical analysis of texts, as well as giv-ing students a culturally rich and historically aware perspective. Creative writing classes introduce students to the genres of writing available to them and prepare them for the competitive world of professional writing. Learning Objectives Graduates of the University of Bridgeport's English program will be able to: 1. Critically and analytically read works of literature produced in many different cul- tures and historical periods. 2. Employ a variety of methods to respond to, evaluate, analyze, and understand lit-erary and nonliterary texts. 3. Examine various literary techniques that writers use in constructing their texts, and demonstrate an understanding of these techniques. 4. Demonstrate, through discussion and writing, an understanding of significant cultural and societal issues presented in literature. 5. Apply critical and technical vocabulary to describe and analyze, and formulate an argument about, literary and other texts. 6. Distinguish between and appropriately analyze the different genres ofliterature.7. See literature in context and respond to connotative meanings in literary and cul-tural texts. 8. Identify and evaluate appropriate re- search sources, incorporating the sources into documented academic writing, and formulate original arguments in response to those sources. 9. Write clearly and effectively in a variety of forms, adapting writing and analytical skills to all situations. 10. Recognize and write in accordance with astandardized system (such as MLA) for formatting research papers and citing re- sources. 11. Adapt literary, critical, and oral skills to communicate effectively in business and graduate school environments. 12. Develop an appreciation for literature as a source of practical wisdom, aesthetic pleasure, and knowledge of the diversity of human experience.

Students are introduced to the theory and practice of mass communication and ad-vertising, and are encouraged to undertake further study in the cultural and social back-ground of modern times. The program's emphasis is placed on the four-course De-sign Studio sequence, which acquaints stu-dents with ever more sophisticated technol-ogies while applying the design processes to real-world community projects, creating a meaningful portfolio. Internships, co-operative work arrangements, and special projects are available to qualified students. Learning Outcomes 1. Demonstrate ability to identify, analyze, and solve design problems. Assessment: Portfolio projects and project research. 2. Demonstrate mastery of design tools, techniques, and concepts in design. As-sessment: Projects and portfolios that evidence craftsmanship and adherence to project parameters.3. Demonstrate an understanding of the aesthetics of form development, and of the history and current state of design. Assess-ment: Projects, papers, and presentations for art and design history courses; in studio courses, projects that appropriately refer - ence historical precedents. 4. Demonstrate proficiency in selection and use of relevant technologies in design. Abilities to use available technical and industrial processes to produce a design product, and to design and implement such a process. Assessment: Project and portfolio materials planned to be feasibly reproducible by industrial means rather than by one-off or by hand. 5. Demonstrate an understanding of the cultural and societal connections linking design trends and processes as well as a knowledge of business practices and of the market place.

The de- signer must have knowledge of construction materials, their applications and methods of installation. Interior designers must design the space in accordance with federal, state and local building codes to meet safety, health, and accessibility requirements. In-terior designers both plan the space and fur - nish the interiors of private homes, public buildings and commercial establishments such as offices, retail, restaurants, hospitals, hotels and theaters. They may plan addi-tions, renovations and be involved in his-toric preservations. With a client's needs and budget in mind, they develop space-plan-ning solutions; prepare working drawings, millwork, architectural details and specifi-cations for interior construction, furnishing and finishes. Designers use computers to generate plans and construction documents, in addition to 3D modeling views. At UB several interior projects assignments are done in collaboration with noted in-terior/architectural firms, to give students a grasp of real projects and receive addi-tional inputs from professionals in the field. In addition, this relationship helps estab-lish connections for internships. *ITDSN 398 (Internship) can be taken as an elective in addition to the required course-work. As an Interior Design major, you can spe- cialize in several areas: Residential Design (new and existing) Contract Design such as: Retail, Hospitality, Corporate Offices, Health care, Institution-al Historic Preservation Exhibit Design Furniture and Furnishings Design Learning Outcomes 1. Demonstrate ability to identify, analyze, and solve design problems. Assessment: Portfolio projects and project research. 2. Demonstrate mastery of design tools, techniques, and concepts in design.

Po- litical economy describes the nexus between politics and economics, and international political economy studies the arena where international politics and international eco-nomics meet. The subject matter of Interna-tional Political Economy is the study of the international economic system and how it produces, distributes, and uses wealth. The study of the international political system focuses a set of institutions and rules by which social and economic interactions are governed. It represents an investigation of the political basis of economic action and the economic basis of political action. An important additional consideration is the role of international law in developing uni-versal principles and norms in the conduct of international relations, and governing of relations between states and their citizens. Because diplomatic negotiations form the basis of new international law, and because diplomacy operates within the framework of extant international law, the study of di-plomacy is an important component in the study of international political economy. Learning Outcomes The B.A. in International Political Econo-my & Diplomacy has the following learn-ing outcomes: 1) students will demonstrate an ability to explain and compare different political and economic systems; 2) students will be able to reflect on the role of cul-ture, history and religion in international political economy; 3) students will be able to explain the role of diplomacy and con-flict resolution in international relations; 4) Students will demonstrate a basic working knowledge of a world language other than one's mother tongue; 5) students will dem-onstrate the ability to use critical thinking in their evaluation of issues and problems in international political economy; and 6) students will demonstrate practical skills in helping resolve global disputes through di-plomacy and conflict resolution. * Note that for all College of Public and International Affairs majors, a portfolio is collected to track progress in programmatic outcomes.

A challenging program with a Lib-eral Arts focus, it provides a theoretical and practical understanding of the Martial Arts of East Asia which have a history of 5000 years. Students may choose from practical foci in Taekwondo, Taiji, or Karate. The program is designed to explore questions such as the role of East Asian philosophy in the Martial Arts and the psychosocial effects of the practice of the Martial Arts. Through the relationships with their teachers and their peers, the student is meant to expe-rience a growing sense of community and shared responsibility. The program, offered through the Univer - sity's College of Public and International Affairs, examines four dimensions of the Martial Arts, including 1) the historical and philosophical roots of the Martial Arts, 2) the languages and cultures of the societies in which the Martial Arts originated and de-veloped, 3) in-depth study of at least one of the Martial Arts, 4) the psychosocial dimen-sions of the Martial Arts with a special fo-cus on the impact that the Martial Arts have upon the human personality and upon in-terpersonal relations. Students in the program may choose one of several career tracks: A Criminal Justice track; a Health Science track; or a Business track. Learning Outcomes Martial Arts Studies students will: 1) demon-strate critical thinking skills; 2) demonstrate basic math and science skills; 3) demon-strate strong written and oral communica-tion skills; 4) demonstrate competency in the history, theory and practice of at least one of the Martial Arts and a good working knowledge of at least one other; 5) dem-onstrate a grasp of the various Martial Arts' notion of \"self cultivation\" and be able to relate it to their own personal growth; 6) demonstrate the practical leadership skills and intercultural literacy needed to assume entry level leadership positions in business, government, and in civil society; 7) develop appreciation of diversity in the world and in intellectual areas such as but not limited to the humanities and the social sciences; and 8) show the desire and ability to pursue learning throughout life. * Note that for all College of Public and In- ternational Affairs majors, a portfolio is collected to track progress in programmatic outcomes. In martial arts practica, there is regular testing and monitoring of compe-tencies as students go through each level of a martial art.

It is innovative both in its inter - disciplinary approach to subject matter and the options it offers students to pursue their goals, whether in graduate school or government or the foreign service, in inter - national agencies or business, in the law, teaching or community service. In addition to completing the major (i.e. meeting the requirements indicated in Groups I & II), students may choose to add (i) concentra-tions or minors in Criminal Justice, History, International Studies, Pre-Law, Political Sci- ence, Psychology, Sociology, or (ii) minors in career-related areas such as International Business, Finance, Human Services, and Ed-ucation. Career opportunities traditionally available to liberal arts students are much enhanced by the flexibility the Social Sci- ence major permits. In its interdisciplinary approach, its emphasis on breadth as well as depth of learning, and its focus on practi- cal skills, the Social Science major prepares students, for leadership roles in their com- munities and the world, and for self-fulfill-ment, and for success in their careers. Learning Outcomes Students in the B.A. in Social Sciences will 1) possess a broad, liberal arts founda-tion and an understanding of how devel-opments in social and intellectual history shape and affect human values and institu-tions; 2) demonstrate an understanding of basic social science methods; 3) demon-strate that they are conversant (i.e., possess a basic grasp) in the disciplines subsumed under the \"social science\" rubric at the Uni-versity of Bridgeport, i.e., political science, economics, international studies, and so-ciology; 4) demonstrate a more advanced \"working knowledge\" of at least one social science discipline; 5) demonstrate they pos- sess the cognitive competencies and study skills to succeed in advanced/graduate stud-ies in any of the social sciences or in law or business; 6) demonstrate that they have the competencies needed to function compe-tently in an entry-level social science-relat-ed career; and 7) demonstrate competency in written and oral communication. * Note that for all College of Public and In- ternational Affairs majors, a portfolio is collected to track progress in programmatic outcomes.

In par - ticular, we study the role of religious values in fomenting conflict and promoting peace; in preparing for a life of service; and in giv-ing depth and direction to culture. Required courses from a common foun- dation prepare students to apply their knowledge in one of three concentrations. In the foundations sequence, students are acquainted with the belief systems of the world's major religions. This aspect of study involves learning religious studies methods, cultivating the capacity for critical analysis, developing cultural sensitivity, and secur - ing ability to communicate within an array of cultural idioms. In the concentrations sequence, students focus their learning on current problems and practically-oriented solutions. Three defined concentrations are possible: (1) Religion, Conflict Analysis, and Mediation; (2) Religion and Community Service; and (3) Religion and Contemporary Culture. With the consultation of an advisor, a self-planned option is also possible. In concentration 1, students learn how to analyze conflicts and train to serve as arbitra-tors or facilitators of dialogue. In concentra-tion 2, students learn how religious studies sensibilities can inform organizations dedi-cated to service. In concentration 3, students focus on the connections between religion and contemporary culture (media, literature, the internet, and politics, for example). Each concentration can be dynamically adjusted to particular interests and learning needs in the self-planned concentration. Integrative in nature, this study draws upon other disciplines. Students in World Reli-gions are encouraged to take courses in po-litical science, history, literature, economics, sociology, and mass communication. Our students prepare to serve in non-govern-mental organizations, to seek professional degrees to further lives of service, and to enroll successfully in graduate schools of the highest caliber. Since the program is personally and intellectually demanding, its admissions policy is selective.

Although students with work experience will find maximum benefit from the M.B.A., no previous work experi-ence is required. The curriculum is designed to recognize and accommodate substantial diversity in preparation and experience as well as the different goals and career expec-tations of students. Students with a recent four-year bachelor's degree and strong academic record from an accredited business college may be able to complete the M.B.A. with as few as 30 credits of advanced study - all courses suc-cessfully completed earn three credits. Stu-dents with undergraduate preparation in a non-business field may be required to com-plete up to an additional 24 credits of core business courses as a foundation for the advanced courses. The M.B.A. program is 54 credits consisting of 24 core credit hours and 30 advanced credit hours. School of Business Mission The School of Business advances the prac-tice of business through the education of students and the scholarly and professional contributions of the Faculty. Through high quality innovative teaching, the School en-hances critical thinking in its students, pro-vides discipline knowledge through theoreti-cal and applied learning and develops skills that are necessary for success in business. Students drawn from local, regional and in-ternational communities learn in a supportive environment that facilitates understanding of business in a dynamic global environment. Program Characteristics The graduate program in business adminis-tration provides early to mid-career profes-sionals with broad-based knowledge nec-essary for effective leadership in domestic and global markets. The program provides a strong foundation in accounting, eco-nomics, finance, marketing, management information systems, business statistics, management, business research, law and ethics upon which students can build a concentration in a focused area of business. Graduates are equipped with a high-level understanding of the inter-relationship of different business processes and the inter - action of the business entity in the competi- tive environment. The program is based on principles which apply to the global business environment of which the domestic market is a key element. With students from many countries in atten-dance, the University of Bridgeport provides a global education from the first day of class. Curriculum: Core, Major, and Capstone There are three central components of the Curriculum. First you will develop the Core Knowledge and Skills. These eight courses may be waived if you have a sufficient un-dergraduate business background. Second you will choose a Major in which you will immerse yourself to develop the specialized knowledge and skills needed for a specific career. Third you will engage in Capstone experiences in courses that enable you to further integrate your business knowledge and apply your business skills. The Core Courses: Acquiring the Foundation for Success The M.B.A. program provides breadth of knowledge and skills across the business disciplines through its core curriculum which consists of 24 (eight courses) of the 54 credits required for the degree. Core courses may be waived if a student has re-cently completed similar courses with high marks and successfully completing a chal-lenge examination, allowing the completion of the M.B.A. with 30 credits (10 courses). The study of economics, accounting, mar - keting, finance, management, business law and ethics, statistics, and information tech-nology enables students to understand the major types of business activities and is the foundation for the M.B.A. concentration. To complete the foundation for the concentra-tion and capstone courses a Business Re- search course is required. Learning Outcomes LEARNING OBJECTIVES The first overall learning objective for the graduate programs in the School of Busi-ness is for students to understand and apply concepts and skills across the basic business disciplines that enable them to be success- ful in a dynamic global environment. The second objective is for students to develop the competencies that facilitate student suc- cess in business. ASSESSMENT The understanding of knowledge and skills is evaluated with exams and the application of theories to applied situations presented in cases and projects. Students and the program as a whole will be evaluated and bench-marked with the use of standardized program tests across the basic business disciplines. Student knowledge and skills will be tested at the beginning and end of their MBA studies with program specific tests. These exams will enable the School to evaluate the value added by the overall program as well as within spe-cific programs. Students will work in teams on various projects and cases across their business courses. Students will be evaluated by other students and by their professors re-garding multiple competencies and will re-ceive cumulative evaluations across courses. Choosing a Major Because many careers require specialized and in-depth knowledge and skills in spe- cific business areas, the program provides students with the opportunity to complete 18 credits (six courses) of in-depth study in an area of their choice. Students may choose from twelve concentrations. Accounting Finance General Business Global Financial Services International Business Management Marketing Specialized Business180The Capstone Experience The Capstone experience provides the final integration of student learning acr oss the business disciplines and application of con- cepts learned to practical and competitive situations. The three integration and appli-cation Capstone courses include a business Strategy course, a computerized Business Simulation and Planning course and an In-ternship or applied Thesis course. The Strategy course integrates the knowl- edge and skills from previous coursework and provides additional training in strategic thinking and business planning. The com-puterized Business Simulation course pro-vides the context to run a simulated business and to compete against other student teams. The Internship course is intended for stu- dents with less than two-years of mana-gerial experience. As an alternative to the Internship and for students who have two years or more of managerial experience, an applied Thesis course is offered in which a student may pursue a topic related to their current business or to a business they would like to pursue.

If admitted, priority candidates receive pre-ferred course registration. In addition to the general admissions require- ments listed above, admission decisions for the Clinical Mental Health Counseling con- centration will give careful consideration to indicators of candidate life experience and maturity (e.g., successful work experience in a human service field). A personal interview is also required. Applicants who hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university but do not meet one or more of the above criteria may be admitted provisionally. Those without the recommended background in Psychology will be required to take additional psychol- ogy-related coursework as part of their de- gree program. Those admitted on provisional status may be fully admitted once they have completed 12 credits of coursework with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher.Although students may enter the program in any term, it is advised to begin in the fall. Students who begin in the spring or summer may have limited course options. Programs The Division of Counseling offers a Master of Science degree in Counseling with concen- trations in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, Human Services, and College Student Person- nel. In addition to the master's degree, a Cer- tificate of Advanced Study (CAS) is offered for those who wish to take specialized courses beyond the masters and/or complete licen- sure requirements. Students who apply to one program and wish to transfer to another must apply to change programs. Upon entry into a program, students plan an individualized plan of studies with their advi- sor in which graduate transfer credit of no more than six credits may be included. While students can take courses at their own pace, all of the counseling degree programs require a minimum of two years to complete. There is a set sequence of courses for each concen- tration and some courses have prerequisites. Courses are offered once a year, typically in the evening or on weekends. In addition, there is a seven year time limit for completion of all degree requirements. Typically students take two or three courses each term. Many students have full or part- time employment. Although it is possible to take all course work in the late afternoon, evening, or on weekends, some additional time during the day may be required to meet course expectations. This is especially true for internship placement. Professional Licensure Students interested in licensure should consult the state in which they wish to practice for specific requirements. The State of Connecti- cut requires 60 credit masters degree.. Spe- cific areas of coursework are also required. In addition, candidates for licensure must complete supervised clinical experiences and obtain a qualifying score on a standardized examination. Students who wish to pursue licensure should select the Clinical Mental Health Counseling concentration. Certificate of Advanced Study For individuals who hold a master's degree in Counseling or a closely related field but lack 188one or more of the requirements for licen- sure as a professional counselor, the Division of Counseling and Human Resources offers a specialized program of study leading to a Certificate of Advanced Study (CAS) in Clini- cal Mental Health Counseling. The require- ments of this program are individualized to the needs and goals of each student and con- sist of 30 credits. Practicum The practicum is designed to allow students to develop their counseling skills in a closely supervised setting. The course instructor, stu- dent's advisor, and site supervisor determine appropriate practicum activities. Activities could include observing/shadowing, attend-ing staff meetings, tutoring, advising, inter - viewing professional staff members, studying materials and procedure manuals, and other support functions. Internship Following the practicum and prerequisite courses, students will pursue an internship. The goal of the internship is to further de- velop and refine the skills established during practicum. You are eligible for the internship component of your program after completing the required coursework and approval from faculty. The internship is the heart of the mas- ter's degree training program in Counseling at the University of Bridgeport (UB). It provides a venue within which students receive the guidance necessary for development as an entry-level counselor. Program faculties pro-vide didactic and experiential training, which serves as the foundation for the development of skills necessary for independent work in clinical settings. The internship operationaliz- es this training and, in the person of the clini- cal supervisor, personifies the profession with which the intern ideally identifies. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the type of internship site that you choose and you should discuss this closely with your ad- visor. Successful internship training can only occur when program faculty and site super - visors form a close collaborative relationship with the mission of providing quality training and the development of the intern as a whole person. Internships are not guaranteed and approval to attend internship is dependent upon students' performance both interper - sonally and academically. Internships must be completed over two semesters, typically over Counseling Master of Science De gree the course of a full academic year, starting in the fall and ending in the spring.

White Arnold Bernhard Center Telephone: (203) 576-4036 Fax: (203) 576-4042 alwhite@bridgeport.edu Design is quickly moving to the center many organizations' core strategy. Such companies achieve a significant competitive advantage through the implementation of effective design thinking. New demands are being placed on designers, and new skills are needed to fully integrate into the busi-ness landscape of the 21st century. Design Management is more than the study of business and design, it is a fundamental belief within an organization that design can improve productivity, create more innovative products, lower operational costs and create a more sustainable work environment. The field of Design Management encompasses every discipline of design, including graphic and communication; industrial design and engineering; architecture and interior; and fashion and textile design. The MPS Design Management program at Shintaro Akatsu School of Design (SASD) emphasizes the following five core aspects of design and business: LEAdERSHIP Design Managers lead teams of designers, which requires a specific set of skills to de- velop the leadership style that's right for the individual and the team. Additionally, De- sign Managers are often asked to champion ideas throughout an organization. Both of these types of leadership skills are empha-sized in this program, resulting in graduates with strong leadership skills. STRATEGy Design and strategy are deeply connected. Design Managers who graduate from this program will be able to develop concepts that support and promote the core strategy of their organization, and articulate that strategy in a clear and persuasive way. MARkETING Understanding the principles of marketing is critical to effective Design Management. Promotion, product design, package de- sign, and the design of the physical plant often all fall under the responsibility of the Design Manager. Upon completing the courses in this program, students will have working knowledge of these issues. OPERATIONS Through interactive simulations and case study research, Design Management stu- dents gain a deep understanding of the operational procedures within an organiza-tion. The courses in this program help stu- dents identify, understand, and influence efficient operational practices. FINANCE Students will be able to read and compre-hend financial statements such as annual reports, cash flow statements, and balance sheets to more effectively integrate design proposals with business functions within their organization. LEGAL Design Managers are often faced with the protection of intellectual property. The MPS DM program gives students a working knowledge for dealing with design issues of trademarks, copyrights, and patents. These core skills will give Design Managers who graduate from SASD the tools they need to solve the most pressing design issues of our time, from matters of sustainability to social responsibility and profitability. Admissions Requirements Applicants must possess an undergraduate degree in graphic, industrial, interior, or fash- ion design, architecture or related design or business fields from an accredited college or university with at least a 2.7/4.0 GPA. Applicants should have a well-rounded edu- cation, as gained through general education courses. Admissions will consider writing, speaking, and analytical skills, as demonstrated through college-level coursework or professional ex- perience, although professional experience is not a prerequisite for admission. Applicants must submit a personal essay and two letters of recommendation. An interview is not required, but is recom- mended. A portfolio is not required, but is an advan-tage in the admissions process. Evidence of internship, volunteer, or prior employment in design management, mar - keting, business or a studio settings will be viewed favorably.

An additional eight (3-credit hours) courses, or 24 credit hours, in the dis-cipline, including no more than two independent studies. 3. A two-semester teaching practice re-quirement (3 credit hours each), for which students are to register with no fees. The students will be expected to teach lower undergraduate level class-es, and/or assist professors as teach-ing assistants (i.e.,perform a signifi-cant teaching role), thus giving Ph.D. graduates experience for an academic teaching career. 4. At least 15 semester hours of disserta-tion research, culminating in a disser - tation proposal defense and disserta-tion defense. 5. Comprehensive examination: written and oral (proposal defense). 6. Publication of at least two journal pa-pers, or one journal and two refereed conference papers, within the course of the Ph.D. topic research. These publications are not required to be sin-gle authored by the student and they might be co-authored with members of the dissertation committee.B. Time and Load Guidelines: Both full and part-time students are en-couraged to apply for the Ph.D. degree, which should be completed within a maximum of seven calendar years. A Ph.D. student (part-time or full-time) is expected to devote the necessary time to courses and research in order to make sat-isfactory progress toward the degree. Sat-isfactory progress includes active personal participation in the research and teaching environment of the School of Engineer - ing. The student advisor and dissertation committee should advise the student as to her/his progress in the program. Full time students are required to register for at least 9 credit hours each semester while part-time students are required to register for at least 6 credit hours per academic year (spring and fall semesters). C. Course Work: A Ph.D. candidate must complete at least 24 credit hours of course work, not including the dissertation, beyond the MSc. degree. Upper level undergraduate remedial courses cannot be used to ful-fill the course work requirement. D. Course Grade Point Average: A Ph.D. student is expected to maintain a G.P.A. of 3.0 or more. If the G.P.A. falls below 3.0, the student is automatically placed on probation. (Note: the grades in the transferred courses would not be used in the calculation of G.P.A). Contin- ued probationary status for two semes-ters may lead to dismissal of the candi-date from the program. No grade less than C is acceptable towards the course work requirement. E. Seminar Requirement: A Ph.D. student is expected to present her/his research findings in public semi-nars. S/he is also expected to interact and participate in professional discussions and meetings such as conferences and workshops. In order to fulfill these re-quirements, a Ph.D. student is expected to present one seminar after the written comprehensive examination and before the dissertation defense. The seminar of his/her research topic for the dissertation serves as the oral (proposal defense) part of the comprehensive exam. The Ph.D. 212coordinator awards a Pass/Fail grade af- ter consultation with the student's disser - tation advisor. The student is required to register for one seminar course. F. Comprehensive Examination: One of the major checkpoints in the Ph.D. program that assesses the breadth and depth of the student is the written and oral (proposal defense) comprehen-sive examination. The comprehensive examination will test the breadth and depth of knowledge in all aspects of computer science and engineering. The Ph.D. program coordinator will or - ganize this comprehensive examination. The seminar requirement represents the oral (proposal defense) section of the exam. The outcome of this examination will be of fail or pass. A student can re-take this examination no more than once. A student who does not pass the compre-hensive examination in two attempts will be dismissed from the program. G. Dissertation Committee: After passing satisfactorily the written comprehensive examination and select-ing a dissertation advisor, the student is required to define a problem of merit, carry out a literature search and prepare a course of action to solve the selected problem. The candidate is expected to produce a dissertation proposal. The Ph.D. program coordinator, in consulta-tion with the dissertation advisor, rec-ommends a dissertation committee for the student. The dissertation committee contains at least three members in addi-tion to the dissertation advisor. At least four members of the dissertation com-mittee must be from a professorial rank within the school. Additionally, an exter - nal examiner is appointed as well. The external examiner is one who has been distinguished in the field of computer science and engineering. S/he might not hold a professorial rank. Ph.D. Program Coordinator and the Dean of the School of Engineering must then approve the dissertation committee. H. Admission to Candidacy: When a student passes the comprehen- sive examination and fulfills all other requirements, s/he will be admitted to Ph.D. candidacy. This serves as another important milestone in the progress to-wards the Ph.D. degree. I. Dissertation: The student is expected to work on the accepted topic and come up with origi-nal results. S/he has to report the results in the form of a Ph.D. dissertation. The student is encouraged to document the intermediate results in the form of tech-nical reports. S/he is also encouraged to publish these results as they are discov-ered, in the international professional literature, i.e., refereed conference pro-ceedings and journals. Proof of good work is the acceptance of the results by reputed journals. Intermediate results can also be discussed in departmental semi-nars. The completed dissertation must be distributed to the dissertation committee members at least two weeks before the dissertation defense. The committee will read it and certify that the dissertation is a work of substantial merit and that it can be defended. It is the responsibility of the student that the final draft of the disserta-tion addresses all legitimate concerns of the committee members. J. Dissertation Defense Examination: After having secured approval from the dissertation committee members regard-ing the worthiness of the dissertation, a student will proceed with a request for the dissertation defense examination. The chairman of the dissertation committee will chair the examination. The student will schedule a convenient time for a pub-lic defense. It is the responsibility of the student to find a time that is suitable to all the members of the dissertation commit-tee, at least 2 weeks prior to the defense. At the end of the defense, the decision of the dissertation committee will be pass or fail. It is the responsibility of the disser - tation advisor to see that the comments and the criticism of the audience are ad-dressed adequately in the final version of the dissertation. Based on the recommen-dation of the dissertation committee, the Ph.D. coordinator, and the Departmental Chairman, the Dean of the School of En- gineering will recommend the Ph.D. de-gree subject to the satisfaction of all other formal requirements.CONCENTRATION AREAS _________________ The following is a list of Research / Concen- tration Areas under the Ph.D. Program. 1.

Emphasis is placed on the evidence of primary historical texts, including the Five Classics of pre-Qin China as well as early his-tories of Korea and Japan such as the Samguk Yusa and the Kojiki. The historical information gleaned from these sources is compared to the narratives and mythologies passed down through the written and oral traditions of the various schools. We examine the unfolding of the Shaolin Gongfu schools influenced by Chan as well as the Wudang tradition influ-enced by Daoism, the emergence of Martial Arts in the Hwarang movement of the Korean Silla kingdom and their revival after the Japa-nese occupation, and the transformation of Gongfu traditions in Japan via Okinawa. 3 semester hours MARTIAL ARTS STUDIES 213 Martial Arts and East Asian Thought This course examines the impact of East Asian philosophy and religion on the Martial Arts. The course begins by outlining the ma- jor teachings of Buddhism, Daoism, and to a lesser extent, Confucianism, focusing on key classics. Following this we will explore the ways in which these teachings came to influ-ence what was originally a martial tradition, resulting in a variety of complex systems that placed greater emphasis on mental as well as physical powers, self-cultivation and per - sonal fulfillment. 3 semester hours MARTIAL ARTS STUDIES 214 Daoism and Taiji This course will examine both the historical and conceptual relationship between Dao- ism and Taiji. It will examine ways in which key concepts of Daoism are reflected in Taiji practice. In the study of the history of the re- lationship between Daoism and Taiji, we will note the differences between the received tra-dition of this relationship (as transmitted from master to student in the pedagogical process) versus historical documentation that, through primary sources, independently confirms the longstanding ties between the two. In the review of the linkage between Daoism and Taiji we will focus on the cosmology of the Book of Changes, which informs the concep-tual framework of Taiji, as well as influential Daoist concepts such as Wu Wei (No Action), Yin and Yang and passive values as depicted in the Laozi, Zhuangzi, the Book of Changes, and the Taijiquan Treatise. 3 semester hours MARTIAL ARTS STUDIES 234 Issues in Taiji This course invites students to be partici- pants in a discussion on the challenges faced by Taiji at this stage of its one thousand year history. Through selected readings and class discussions students will consider pertinent issues such as the ongoing division among the styles of Taiji and various perceptions of Taiji in modern society (e.g., the view of Taiji as primarily an activity for seniors and the perception that Taiji is disengaged from the world). Furthermore, it will invite students to consider ways in which the study of Taiji can contribute to academic discourse, to the improvement of social well-being, and to the future direction of society. 3 semester hours MARTIAL ARTS STUDIES 235 Issues in Taekwondo This course invites students to consider the challenges faced by Taekwondo at this stage in its history.

Founded in 1931 with fewer than a dozen members, the Alumni Association has grown to include more than 35,000 mem bers. Alumni are always encouraged to visit the campus to attend events or just to indulge in nostalgia. An active and committed vol-unteer Board of Directors continues to man-age the Association's affairs, with a num-ber of activities planned each year. From athletic events to regional receptions and celebrations of alumni achievements, the calendar is always full. A university can only measure its success through the achievements of its alumni. The University of Bridgeport boasts a plethora of prominent graduates. They serve as cor - porate CEO's and university presidents, au-tomobile designers, commissioners of edu-cation, political leaders, television stars and prominent athletes. Their accomplishments reflect well on their alma mater, which in turn extends its gratitude. We would like to hear from you.

Reports, disclosures and other data are available in the University's Student Handbook, the Key to U.B., the Campus Public Safety Office and/or other official University publications. The University of Bridgeport Campus Public Safety Office keeps statistics concerning the occurrence on campus of certain criminal offenses, which were reported to them or to the local police. These statistics are pub-lished and distributed annually to the entire University of Bridgeport campus commu-nity, and to other interested parties. For further information, contact the Director of Campus Security, Dean of Students, or the University Attorney. FERPA The University of Bridgeport has designated the following types of information as direc-tory information which may be disclosed without consent: Student's full name and alias, if applicable; address; email address; telephone listings; major field study; degrees and awards received; dates of attendance; classification; participation in officially recognized sports or activities; weight and height of members of athletic teams; photographs; and enroll-ment status (undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time). Parents or eligible students have the right to refuse to permit the University of Bridge-port to designate any or all of those types of information as directory information with respect to a particular student, thereby preventing its disclosure as directory infor - mation. Forms indicating the intent of the parents or eligible students to request infor - mation be withheld can be obtained in the Office of the Registrar, and must be submit-ted within the first five class days to be ef-fective to avoid disclosure.Notification of Rights Under FERPA The FamilyEducational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. Among these rights are: 1. Among these rights are to inspect and review the educational records within 45 days of the day the University receives the request for access. Students should submit to the Registrar a written request that identifies the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University Registrar will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where records may be inspected. If the Registrar does not maintain the records requested the Registrar will advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of their educational record that he/she be-lieves is in accurate or misleading. Stu-dents should ask the University to amend the record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the Registrar, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his/her right to a hearing regarding the re-quest for amendment. Additional infor - mation regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when no-tified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information con-tained in the student's education re-cords, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational in-terests. A school official is: A person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academ-ic or research, or support staff position, including health or medical staff. A person elected to the Board of Trustees. A person or entity employed by or under contract to the University to perform a special task, such as securi-ty, building and grounds, information technology, food service, an attorney, auditor, collection agency or other outside vendor. A student serving on an official com- mittee, such as a disciplinary or griev-ance committee, or who is assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate education-al interest if the official is: Performing a task that is specified in his or her position description or contract agreement, or is customarily performed by such person at the uni-versity. Performing a task related to a stu- dent's education. Performing a task related to the disci- pline of a student. Providing a service or benefit relat- ing to the student or student's family, such as health care, counseling, job placement or financial aid. Maintaining the safety and security of the campus. Upon request, the University discloses edu-cation records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. The Dean of Students or designee has the au- thority to notify parents or guardians when dependent students under the age of 21 are found to be in violation of the University alco- hol and/or drug policies for: 1) possession of a keg or large volume, 2) dispensing alcohol to a minor, 3) possession or distribution of controlled substances, 4) under age posses- sion or open container in a public space for a second time; or in cases where a student is subject to residence hall separation, suspen- sion, expulsion or required emergency medi- cal care because the student became ill from the consumption of alcohol and/or drugs. The notification is permissive and at the discretion of the university. The notification of parents or guardians is indicated when: 1) the viola-368The Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Acts And Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) tion involved harm or threat of harm to per - sons or property, or 2) the violation involved an arrest in which the student was taken into custody. Nothing in these guidelines shall prevent university officials from notifying parents or guardians of a health or safety emergency, or when a student, under the age of 21 is found to have violated university policy with respect to the use and/or consumption of alcohol or drugs. Whenever possible, students will be informed that parental notification is planned in advance of their parents receiving the no-tice. The notification of parents is simply an act of notice and is not subject to appeal. The Dean of Students or designee may dis- close the name and a summary of the infor - mation regarding the final outcome of a hear - ing if the student is found to have committed an act of violence. Students may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and ad-dress of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office US Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, DC 20202-4605 FERPA: Notice for Directory Information The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a Federal law, requires that the University of Bridgeport with certain excep-tions, obtain your written request prior to the disclosure closure of personally identi-fiable information from a student's educa-tional records. However, the University may disclose appropriately designated \"directory information\" without written consent. Ex-amples include: The annual yearbook; News releases Honor roll or other recognition lists; Graduation programs; and Sports activities sheets, such as weight and height of team members Directory information which is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released, can also be disclosed to outside organizations. Outside organizations include, but are not limited to companies that manufacture class rings or publish yearbooks. If you do not wish the University to disclose directory information without prior written consent you must notify the University by the 10th day of class in a semester. The student must contact the Registrar's Office, located on the Garden Level of Wahlstrom Library and fill out the appropriate paperwork. If a student makes such a request, the University has the option or either (1) withholding all information of the types specified and omit-ting the student's name from any published list involving such information or (2) seeking the student's written permission to release the information. The University of Bridgeport has designated the following information as directory infor - mation: Student's name Address University electronic mail address Telephone listing Date and place of birth Hometown Citizenship Family relations Marital status Previous schools or training Academic year Dates of attendance and/or graduation Major field of study or academic spe- cialty Instructors and courses Participation in sports and other offi- cially recognized activities (including position, role, or function) Membership in officially recognized honorary, professional, academic, or social organizations Academic honors or achievements Special awards or recognitions re- ceived, scholarships, fellowships, assis- tantships Offices or honorary positions to which elected or appointed Eligibility for and performance records in athletics or other recognized forms of competition Height and weight of members of ath- letic teams Place and nature of employment Post-graduation plans Positions or achievements Hobbies, interests, and community ac- tivities Publications or papers presented Title of honors or graduate thesis For students seeking employment on job interviews, such additional informa- tion as has been furnished or cleared by the student with the understanding that it will be used in connection with applications or employment inquiries Religious affiliation, if volunteered by the students, will be revealed to the campus ministry, local churches, syna-gogues, and mosques.
