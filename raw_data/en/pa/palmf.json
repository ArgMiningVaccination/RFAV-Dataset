Rather than treating the symptoms of disease with medication, this holistic approach to health care aims to maintain your health throughout your life. Maintaining your health with natural medicine not only helps prevent disease, but it can also reduce the severity of existing symptoms. What are the principles of natural medicine? Holistic medicine practitioners believe that medication and surgery are useful tools for treating disease but only after trying natural solutions first. Common principles of natural medicine include: - A healthy diet - Lifestyle modifications - Stress reduction - Smoking cessation - Supplements - Improved sleep quality - Exercise At Applewood Chiropractic, the team strives to identify the root cause of your symptoms to determine the appropriate combination of treatments. They aim to treat the condition by replacing standard medications with herbal and natural medicine. Treating the underlying cause reduces your risk of complications and prevents your existing symptoms from worsening. What are examples of natural medicine? The team at Applewood Chiropractic offers several natural medicine services to promote health and wellness, including: Bioenergetic analysis Bioenergetic analysis evaluates your digestive, brain, heart, and bone and joint health, as well as your thyroid, kidney, and bladder function to identify nutritional deficiencies. Once the team determines the root cause of your deficiency, they can find the appropriate treatment for you. Nutritional counseling Nutritional counseling uses diet and supplements to correct imbalances in your nutrient levels. Proper nutrition not only supports weight maintenance, but it can also lower your cholesterol, regulate your blood sugar levels, and minimize uncomfortable symptoms, such as fatigue and headaches. Ergonomics Ergonomics is the practice of designing furniture and workplace equipment to protect your body and improve your spinal alignment. Proper spinal alignment offers several benefits, including preventing back pain, neck pain, muscle soreness, and joint dysfunction. Fitness and exercise programs Whether your goal is to lose weight or improve your muscle strength, the individualized exercise program the team designs for you can help you achieve optimal health.
