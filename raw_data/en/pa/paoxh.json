Vitamin D toxicity (hypervitaminosis D) happens when you have too much vitamin D in your body. It's a rare complication that most often happens from taking higher-than-prescribed amounts of prescription vitamin D or too much of a self-prescribed over-the-counter (OTC) supplement. Excess vitamin D leads to [ hypercalcemia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14597-hypercalcemia) (higher-than-normal levels of calcium in your blood), which is what causes symptoms. Vitamin D toxicity usually isn't life-threatening, but it can be quite harmful to your health. Severe cases can cause issues such as [kidney failure](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17689-kidney-failure), abnormal heart rhythm ( [arrhythmia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16749-arrhythmia)), unsteady gait ( [ataxia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17748-ataxia)) and confusion. What is vitamin D? Vitamin D is an essential vitamin \u2014 a hormone, really \u2014 that your body uses for normal bone development and maintenance. Vitamin D also plays a role in your [nervous system](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21202-nervous-system), [musculoskeletal system](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12254-musculoskeletal-system-normal-structure--function) and [immune system](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21196-immune-system). Your body converts the vitamin D that you consume into the \"active\" form of vitamin D. The active form helps your body absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D in a variety of ways, including: - Sun exposure on your skin. - Through the food and drinks you consume. - Through nutritional supplements and prescription medications. Vitamin D toxicity typically only happens from taking too much of a vitamin D supplement or prescription medication. How common is vitamin D toxicity? Vitamin D toxicity is rare. There are around 4,500 cases per year in the United States. What is a toxic level of vitamin D? The dose of vitamin D you need to take to produce toxic signs and symptoms varies greatly. It can occur with as little as 2,000 international units per day (IU/d) in susceptible people. Healthy daily requirements for vitamin D include: - People ages 19 to 50: 600 IU/d. - People ages 50 to 70: At least 600 IU/d. - People older than 70: At least 800 IU/d. The maximum suggested daily requirement is 4,000 IU/d for healthy adults. Talk to your healthcare provider if you're concerned about your vitamin D intake. They can provide guidance on whether you should take a supplement and how much. Symptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of vitamin D toxicity? The symptoms of vitamin D toxicity are mainly due to hypercalcemia. They include: [Decrease in [Frequent urination](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15533-urination--frequent-urination). - Confusion, lethargy and fatigue. - Muscle weakness and difficulty walking. [Bone pain](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24619-bone-pain). [Kidney stones](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15604-kidney-stones). What causes vitamin D toxicity? Vitamin D toxicity most often results from taking too much prescription-strength vitamin D or too much of an over-the-counter vitamin D supplement.

Consuming too much vitamin D from your diet alone very rarely leads to vitamin D toxicity. What are the risk factors for vitamin D toxicity? People who take prescription-strength vitamin D are at risk for vitamin D toxicity due to the high dose of the medication unless they check their levels periodically. Certain conditions may require high doses of vitamin D, including: - Vitamin D deficiency that doesn't respond to a lower dose. [Osteoporosis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4443-osteoporosis). cause [malabsorption](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22722-malabsorption)of vitamin D.
