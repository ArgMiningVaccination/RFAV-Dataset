Key Facts Sanofi said in a statement Friday it would be recruiting 415 participants for a Phase I/II clinical trial to assess the shot's safety, side effect profile and dosing. Sanofi, which is developing the vaccine alongside U.S.-based Translate Bio, said it expects interim results in the third quarter of 2021. The company said it was also, in parallel, evaluating \"additional mRNA candidates against emerging\" variants of the virus, as well as working on enabling the product to be stable at routine refrigerator temperatures (in order to remain stable, Moderna and Pfizer's vaccines must be kept at ultracold temperatures). Thomas Triomphe, who heads Sanofi Pasteur, the company's vaccines division, said the \"trial represents an important step forward in our goal of bringing another effective vaccine to the ongoing fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\" Key Background That Sanofi, one of the world's biggest players in the vaccine game in a country with a storied history of medical achievement, failed to bring a Covid-19 vaccine to market expediently was a source of national [embarrassment](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/26/french-self-esteem-hit-after-pasteur-institute-abandons-covid-vaccine) to France. The failure of another candidate by the prestigious Pasteur Institute, licensed to Merck, compounded this. In January, the company [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/sanofi-to-make-millions-of-biontech-pfizer-s-covid-vaccine-doses) it would help produce the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to aid Europe's sluggish vaccine drive. Tangent To induce immunity to the virus, the Sanofi candidate makes use of a piece of genetic information called mRNA. Short for messenger ribonucleic acid, mRNA carries instructions for the body to make a particular part of the virus that will effectively train the body to recognize and respond to it should it encounter the real thing. It has only been approved in two vaccines before\u2014the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines\u2014which appear to be highly effective. Sanofi, a leader in infectious diseases, is leaning heavily on Translate Bio to develop this aspect of the shot. Big Number 5%. Shares of Translate Bio were up by 5% in premarket trade Friday.
