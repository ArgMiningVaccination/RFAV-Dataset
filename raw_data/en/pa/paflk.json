If you want to contact us with any feedback, email contact@mind.org.uk . Contents What are complementary and alternative therapies? ................................ ................................ ... 2 Types of complementary and alternative 7 .................. 18 \u00a9 Mind 20 22 2 What are complementary and alternative therapies? Complementary and alternative therapies cover lots of different treatments. These include body -based therapies, meditation -based therapies and herbal remedies, among others. The NHS offers some of these. Others are based on different ideas of healing and wellbeing than those we normally hear about in the UK. See our page on types of complementary and alternative therapies for more information about some of the different types. What's the difference between a 'complementary' and an 'alternative' therapy? Whether a therapy is 'complementary' or 'alternative' will depend on how you use it as part of your treatment. In general: 'Complementary' describes treatments which you may use alongside other treatments. 'Alternative' describes app roaches that replace the treatments offered by your doctor. One person might use a certain therapy as complementary alongside things like medication, while another person might use the same therapy as an alternative to medication. There are some misconce ptions about complementary and alternative therapies. Some people think they don't work properly, are a scam, or have no evidence behind them. This is not always true, but the lack of information and clinical research on them can make it difficult to know which ones might work for you. \"As advised by my doctor, I take an SSRI antidepressant every day, in conjunction with supplementing iron, B vitamins, no alcohol before my cycle and avoiding caffeine as much as possible.\" Why might I try them? There are man y reasons you might decide to try complementary or alternative therapies. For example: \u00a9 Mind 20 22 3 You don't want the treatment your doctor has offered, such as psychiatric medication or talking therapies . You've already tried the treatments your doctor has offere d and they haven't suited you. For example, you haven't found a psychiatric medication that works, or it's caused unwanted side effects. You're on a waiting list for treatment, but you need help to manage your symptoms right away. You want more options to try in addition to the treatments your doctor has offered. You don't agree with your doctor's approach and you want to take another approach to looking after your mental health. Whatever your situation, if you have any worries about your mental health you can seek advice from your GP . \"When I could no longer take SSRI antidepressants due to side effects, I tried St John's wort as an alternative. It's definitely helped with my depression and my mood has lifted quite a lot.\" Can they treat mental health problems? Complementary and alternative therapies can be used as a tr eatment for both physical and mental health problems. Different therapies are used for different mental health problems. In general, there is more research on these therapies for sleep problems , depression and anxiety . But there has been some research on how certain treatments might help other mental health problems. Our page on types of complementary and alternative therapies has more information on what each treatment might help with. \"I noticed that a large part of my anxiety was down to the fact that I wasn't breathing properly. Yoga helped with this immensely.\" Do they work? As with all therapies, different things work for different people. There's not much clinical evidence for these therapies, so your GP isn't likely to prescribe them. But a lot of people do say they find them helpful in managing mental health symptoms, so in this sense they can work. Some research into how they work suggests this could be showing the placebo effect. This is when we feel better after taking a remedy because we expect it to make us feel better. This effect can happen with sugar pills that have no active ingredients. But it can apply to other treatments as well, including prescription or over -the-counter medicines. \u00a9 Mind 20 22 4 Whether or not a remedy has a clinical effect doesn't always matter - the outcome of feeling better can be very real and meaningful in our lives. For more on the effectiveness of different therapies see our pages on: types of complem entary and alternative therapies herbal remedies . \"Exercise became a big part of my routine to k eep anxiety at bay. Along with mindfulness techniques and medication.\" Are they safe? Most complementary and alternative therapies are considered safe when provided by a trained and experienced practitioner. However, there may be times when a certain thera py may carry higher risks for you, and would not be recommended. For example, if: you are pregnant or breastfeeding you are receiving any other treatments that could interfere with the therapy you have a physical or mental health problem that could be made worse by the therapy you are about to have surgery or another medical procedure. Before you start any new treatment it is a good idea to talk through any safety concerns with your doctor and your treatment provider. This is especially important if you're already taking any kind of medication. If you are considering taking a herbal remedy, see our information on when herbal remedies might be unsuitable for you . Remember that your local pharmacist can also give you advice about prescription and over -the-counter medications. How are they regulated? There's no compulsory regulation for most complementary healthcare practitioners in England and Wales, so it is possible to practise without regulation. However, there are several kinds of voluntary organisations that practitioners can choose to register with: The Complementary & Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) . The CNHC acts as a voluntary regulator for the sector. It publishes a list of registered therapies, and maintains a public register of practitioners who have signed up. Professional associations for particular types of therapies . These are membership organisations which provide a range of benefits and services for practitioners, and \u00a9 Mind 20 22 5 act in the interests of the profession. Most have their own codes of practice and regis ters of practitioners. It's always a good idea to choose a therapist who is registered with a regulatory body or professional association. This means they have met the standards of practice and education required by that organisation. For guidance on the r egulation of herbal medicines, see our information on how herbal remedies are licensed . What else should I consider before starting a therapy? Only you can decide whether a type of treatment feels right for you. But it might help you to think about: What do I want to get out of it - is it realistic? What does it cost - can I af ford it? How long will it take - have I got enough time? Is it open -ended or time -limited? Will I have to travel? Have I got any health problems that would affect me being able to do the therapy? Am I receiving any other treatments that would affect me bei ng able to do the therapy? Could this therapy be adapted to meet my needs? Would someone I trust be able to come along with me if I didn't feel comfortable going on my own? Finding the right therapist As with any kind of therapy, it's really important to find someone you feel confident and safe with. Whatever the kind of therapy or medicine they practise, if you don't like or trust that person you're less likely to have a positive experience. As a good starting point, your practitioner should be able to give you straightforward answers to your questions about: what qualifications they have what professional bodies they're registered with their past experience of using the therapy for your specific proble m \u00a9 Mind 20 22 6 what risks might be involved, and what you should do if you experience any negative effects what procedures they have in place for making a complaint proof of insurance any other concerns or questions you have about the therapy. If you don't feel able to ask these questions of them beforehand it might help to write them down in an email, or ask someone you trust to come along to support you. Where can I get complementary and alternative therapies? To find a registered therapist you can: use the search t ool on the Complementary & Natural Healthcare Council website (CNHC) look for a list of practitioners through an organisation who specialises in the particular therapy. You can find links to these organisations on o ur page on types of complementa ry and alternative therapies . You may also find a recommendation for a local therapist through: alternative therapy centres health spas your local Mind branch your GP practice your local community centre. Can I get them through the NHS? While there are some complementary and alternative therapies available t hrough the NHS, you can't always get them for mental health problems. This is because there is currently not enough evidence to show how effective they are for mental health, so the National Institute for He alth and Care Excellence (NICE) - the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare - cannot recommend them. However, NICE does recommend that healthcare professionals take your values, thoughts and preferences into consideration whe n they are planning your treatment. This means that, while a treatment might not always be available on the NHS, your doctor should still be able to talk to you about alternative options and how they \u00a9 Mind 20 22 7 might interact with other treatments, so that you can lo ok for them outside the NHS if you want to. To find out what the NHS is able to offer you locally, it's a good idea to make a GP appointment and ask your doctor directly. What if they don't work for me? Although some people find that complementary or alternative therapies can be helpful, not everyone does. If you've tried something an d it hasn't helped, it's important not to blame yourself. Managing a mental health problem can be really difficult, especially when you're not feeling well. It can take time and may not be straightforward. But many people find that when they find the right combination of treatments, self -care and support, it is possible to feel better. See our pages on seeking help for a mental health problem for other options you could explore. Types of complementary and alternative therapies In this section you'll find information about a wide range of different complementary and alternative ther apies. If you want to learn about a therapy that isn't listed here, ask your doctor if they have any information on that particular type of therapy and if it might be right for you. A lot of the research that has been done on these therapies suggests they are most effective when used alongside other treatments , rather than being enough on their own. Do not stop taking any medication or other treatment you have been prescribed without talking to your GP or healthcare professional first. Safety information Most complementary and alternative therapies are considered safe when done by a trained and experienced practitioner. However, there may be times that that a certain therapy carries higher risks for you. For more on safety see our information on are they safe , when a herbal remedy might be unsuitable for you and things to consider before staring a therapy . Some treatments may impact your fitness to drive . Speak to your GP or pharmacist about this if you're worried. \u00a9 Mind 20 22 8 5-HTP (5 -hydroxytryptophan) What is it? 5-hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP) is something our bodies naturally produce to help them form serotonin (a brain chemical involved in our mood). 5 -HTP can also be taken as a supplement you can b uy in health food shops and some pharmacies. What is it used for? Depression and sometimes anxiety. Are there side effects and is it safe? The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting and headaches. However, taking too much 5 -HTP or taki ng it with antidepressants can cause serotonin syndrome. If you have bipolar disorde r 5-HTP may also cause mania or hypomania . Does it work? Studies have shown that 5 -HTP can work as well as antidepressants for some people. Some people may also feel the positive effects faster than with other antidepressants. However, more research needs to be done into the long term use of 5 - HTP and not everyone finds it helpful. You should always speak to your GP or pharmacist before considering taking 5 -HTP. L-tryptophan 5-HTP is made in our bodies from the amino acid tryptophan. We can get tryptophan from the food we eat. L -Tryptophan is also available as a tablet that some people use for depression . However, L -Tryptophan has been lin ked to a very serious health condition called Eosinophilia -Myalgia Syndrome (EMS). EMS causes fatigue, muscle weakness and pain, skin changes and breathing problems. It can be fatal in some cases. L-Tryptophan is still available in the UK, but only with a prescription. There have been no reports of people getting EMS when taking 5 -HTP, but more research needs to be done. Acupuncture What is it? Acupuncture involves inserting very fine needles into specific parts of your body. This is believed to stimulate nerves and muscles which may release natural pain - relieving chemicals. It is practiced in both Western medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. What is it used for? Depression , anxiety and sleep . Acupuncture is often used to relieve chronic pain, which might be contributing to anx iety, sleep problems or low mood. \u00a9 Mind 20 22 9 Are there side effects and is it safe? Sometimes people experience pain, bleeding or bruising where the needles puncture the skin. You should speak to your doctor before getting acupuncture if you are taking medication or have a health problem that impacts blood clotting, or if you have an allergy to certain metals. Acupuncture should be done by a professional, such as a doctor or registered practitioner. Does it work? It is not clear whether acupuncture is helpful for ment al health problems on their own, but some people find it useful in managing symptoms or as part of self - care. Acupuncture is a recommended by the NHS for migraines and chronic pain, and some people with chronic pain find that acupuncture helps with their m ental health. Where can I find out more? Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ATCM) British Acupuncture Council NHS information on acupuncture Alternative medical systems What are they? There are some traditional treatments that take a different approach to healthcare than that taken by the NHS. These approaches include Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Ayu rvedic Medicine, Siddha Medicine and Unani Medicine. In some countries, these approaches are part of mainstream medical care. They often have different ideas to those found in UK healthcare about the causes of mental health problems, how to identify them a nd how to treat them. The treatments include other complementary and alternative therapies, such as herbal remedies, massage and acupuncture . What are they used for? Alternative medical systems are used to treat a range of mental health problems. Are there side effects and are they safe? These approaches involve a wide range of practices and treatments, which will have different side effects, and there can be risks in some treatments. You should speak to your practitioner or GP about thes e before deciding to have any treatment. Do they work? Treatments in alternative medical systems have different amounts of evidence behind them. A lot of research on these practices is done in other countries and there is not always a good understanding of the theories behind them in the UK. However, some people find these approaches helpful, particularly if they are from a country where these practices are more common. If your mental health problem is not getting better or is getting worse after using thes e treatments, it is important to speak to your doctor. Where can I find out more ? Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ATCM) Ayurvedic Professionals Association (APA) \u00a9 Mind 20 22 10 Aromatherapy What is it? Aromatherapy uses essential oils (oils extracted from plants) for healing. It can also be combined with other treatments, such as massage therapy . Some people use essential oils themselves, or products with essential oils such as candles. What is it used for? Different essential oils are thought to be useful for different experiences. For example, lavender oil is commonly used fo r relaxation and sleep. Other oils may be helpful for different experiences. Are there side effects and is it safe? It is possible to experience allergies or reactions to the oils, so you should speak to the aromatherapist beforehand if you have concerns. Does it work? Many people find aromatherapy helpful as part of a self -care routine or for managing symptoms alongside other treatments . It is unlikely to be able t o treat a mental health problem on its own. Where can I find out more? The Aromatherapy Council Therapy Directory \"I like calming essential oils like lavender dotted about on soft furnishings and clothes.\" Cannabis -based medicines What are they? Cannabis -based medicines cover a wide range of substances, including medical cannabis and cannabidiol oil (CBD oil). Medical cannabis must be prescribed by a qualified healthcare professional. It is only prescribed for certain conditions, mainly for people recovering from chemotherapy, some types of epilepsy, and chronic pain. CBD oil, on the o ther hand, is available to buy legally from health food shops and pharmacies. It does not contain large amounts of THC (the part of cannabis that makes you 'high'). However, most CBD oils will contain a small amount of THC, and different brands will includ e different amounts. What are they used for? Depression , anxiety and post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Are there side effects and are they safe? Medical cannabis can cause behaviour changes and hallucinations , while CBD oil may cause fatigue and changes in appetite. Neither of these are recommended for those of us who experience psychosis or \u00a9 Mind 20 22 11 have schizophrenia , because THC can make symptoms worse. Possession of non -medical cannabis is illegal in the UK. Do they work? There is evidence to support that CBD oil and medical cannabis can be helpful for anxiety , but there is still a lot we don't know about how it works. CBD products are all made differently, which means they might not all w ork for you. It's currently unlikely that you'll be able to get a prescription for medical cannabis for anxiety, unless no other treatments have worked. Where can I find out more?

Homeopathy involves using extremely diluted ( watered down) natural substances to treat physical and mental health problems. Homeopaths believe that the more a substance is diluted, the more effective it will be. What is it used for?

There are no major side effects associated wit h homeopathy, however there is a risk that if you chose this as your main or only treatment, your mental health problem might get worse. Some ingredients used in homeopathy can also interact with other medications. Does it work? There has been a lot of res earch into homeopathy and there is no evidence to suggest that homeopathy can treat any health conditions. Some people find that they feel better while having homeopathy, but there is no evidence that homeopathy was the cause of this improvement. \u00a9 Mind 20 22 12 The NHS n o longer provides any homeopathic services because of this. If you are considering homeopathy, it is recommended that you also consider other treatments, as it is very unlikely to work on its own. Where can I find out more?

Are there side effects and is it safe? Hypnotherapy might not be suitable for you if you have a diagnosis of personality disorder or psychosis (it may make your symptoms worse), or if you are due to be a witness at a trial . Does it work? Hypnotherapis ts use hypnosis to help you change unwanted thoughts and behaviours. They do this by using suggestion and by supporting you to increase your self-awareness.
