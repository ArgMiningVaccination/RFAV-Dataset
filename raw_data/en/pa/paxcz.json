Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on May 08, 2019 Kyanite opens and clears the body's communication centers. For channeling or meditation purposes it works best when it is worn near the throat chakra. Kyanite never needs to be cleaned or charged because it is self-caring, self-sustaining. It carries a very \"light\" energy that attracts light beings (angels, spirit guides, extraterresterials). Exceptional manifesting stone.

I dealt with some emotional issues while pregnant and would lay large flat stone on tummy and watch baby Rowan kick it around. My favorite stone.\" ~Amber My little blue hero! \"I was having a rough day at work. I'm a hairstylist. I was triple booked (not my fault) behind an hour, and it was Saturday, the busiest day of the week! Luckily my last client was a friend and she took one look at me and said, \"Here, I knew there was a reason I grabbed this.\" She handed me a piece of Kyanite. As soon as I touched it and held it in my hand all the tension of the day melted away instantly and for the rest of the day, everything seemed alright. I suffer from anxiety and have been looking for a stone like this for a long time and it found its way to me! I used to wear rose quartz but I now wear the Kyanite around my neck and it keeps me on an even keel and I am so grateful.\" ~Lyndsay \"I was in herb and arts store in Denver, one of the grooviest stores on the planet, and I wound up putting a piece of Kyanite in my bra because I was attracting the judgment I was receiving from elite snobs stuck on their mindset. Also had lots of pain from the projection of loved ones onto me because I was closest. I wore it in my bra and kept shopping and I tell you, my disposition changed in about ten minutes. I felt very grounded and peaceful and back to myself. This is an amazing stone.\" ~Kyinaustin Maybe Baby Kyan \"I am a singer and 33 weeks pregnant with a really rockin' band. Yesterday we had a four-hour gig and the same today, and I have to admit this really pushed me to my limits. However, my drummer's wife gave me a piece of kyanite just before we started today, which I tucked into my bra, and this amazing, loving energy filled me and surrounded me. I believe it helped me make it through despite the difficulties I was experiencing. A little side note, when I got home and looked it up in my crystal book, I discovered that in addition to love and peace, one of its attributes is endurance! My hubby and I are thinking of naming the baby Kyan. No kidding!\" ~Fairlight Uses for Kyanite \"Lower frequency entities find kyanite extremely uncomfortable to be around, so it's good for keeping \"boogies\" away as well. If kyanite is too high frequency for you to stay in contact with, try rose quartz. Since rose quartz is about self-love, they hate that energy too. As a quartz, it resonates at the upper end of the more normal human range, so it may be more comfortable for you. If you have old issues around self-love, however, and who among us does not, the rose quartz may make you cry a bit in releasing your old woundedness. Which is good for you but not necessarily fun if you have dinner plans with someone special, so I mention it.\" ~reikishamanicintuitive Strange Experience is Healing Crisis \"Kyanite radiates an extremely fast vibration - that's why it's so good at what it does. That high vibration also breaks up any lower frequency energies stored in your body. Repressed emotions, traumatic memories, pains, from this life and others, are released into consciousness so you can clear them out as part of the healing process. If you try to release too many too fast, you can experience a healing \"crisis,\" which is \"dis-ease/dis-comfort\" overload, symptoms of illness.\" ~reikishamanicintuitive Meditation Stone \"Kyanite will help you understand lessons as they appear in your life and to be better able to learn from your teachers, human, animal, mineral, bird, plant, insect, fish, or spirit. This stone can be used to help you connect to these teachers, one way is by placing it on your forehead as you meditate or putting at the head of your bead as you sleep or my favorite sticking it inside of your pillowcase on the downside as you sleep above it\". ~Whitehorse Woman Kyanite Aligns Throat Chakra \"Kyanite aids in creative expressions such as art, dance, writing, etc. It strengthens the truth in a person and makes one more reliable. It brings to one serenity. Kyanite is wonderful when used as a shield. It does not retain negative vibes and they bounce off. A good stone for aligning all of the energy centers but is particularly good for the 5th chakra or throat chakra. It is a powerful stone to access the Universal Energy during healing. Blue (color) relates to your spiritual side. It helps you to attune while searching for inner peace.\" ~stones77 Kyanite Worries \"I am a singer and am finding kyanite pendant had taken my voice over about 6 months of constant wearing. My regression therapist says the breathing issues and restrictions she feels are from my death from smoke, she wishes to use her shamanic therapy to help me. I have taken the kyanite off and put on window sill in full moon, I have not put it back on and feel much better... not sure if my body is speaking my mind in this area. My favorite healing stone is fool's gold pyrite, I can smell the earth on it and love holding this piece. I love my kyanite pendant but I am fearful of wearing it now.\" ~Lee Reference: Love is in the Earth, Melody; GEM Stones A to Z, Diane Stein Disclaimer: The information contained on this site is intended for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice, diagnosis or treatment by a licensed physician.
