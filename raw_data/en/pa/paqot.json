This overview provides summary medical and epidemiological background on selected diseases for the OECD study on cross-national differences in treatments for ageing-related diseases. This report is intended to complement the proposed disease templates. 2. A preliminary literature review was conducted to describe and summarise various etiological factors in each condition, typical diagnostic and acute medical interventions used to treat these diseases, and current epidemiological trends for the disease where data were available. The overview of medical background simply outlines the current medical practice for these conditions and at this time, only brieflydiscusses the variations in management and treatment that likely exists across and within countries. Based on this preliminary descriptive analysis of each health problem, more specific hypotheses were identified for further research and are consequently addressed and translated into the proposed disease templates. Additionally, this descriptive work assisted the Secretariat in learning of similar work being conducted on the international level. 3. The ageing-related diseases covered in this initial examination: ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hip fractures and osteoporosis, breast cancer, cataract and visual impairment were selected for several reasons. These diseases primarily contribute to most of the burden of mortality, morbidity, and associated costs. All of the six are often ranked very high on the top ten lists of highest incidence, prevalence, mortality and cost rankings across OECD countries. As a result, in recent years,countries have assigned several of these conditions to be the key health priority areas and established targets to measure progress in reducing this burden in their populations. Additionally, some of these health problems have been considered to be the most easily identified in the available national datasets due to the high likelihood of an inpatient admission for most of them. 4. The descriptive analyses for the six diseases are provided below for background purposes only, and are intended to supplement reading of the proposed disease templates.5ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE MEDICAL BACKGROUND Definitions, Symptoms, and Risk Factors 1. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is caused by an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand in the myocardial muscle. This imbalance is called myocardial ischemia and is due to the accumulation of fatty deposits lining the walls of coronary artery (referred to as atherosclerosis) and the subsequent obstruction of blood flow. The major clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease are angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction. Angina pectoris is the mild form of IHD, where temporary chest painoccurs when the heart muscle is not receiving enough oxygen. Angina can manifest in different manners, in terms of frequency and duration. Once it has become more serious with longer duration and more intensity of pain, it is termed \"unstable angina.\" In the acute form, it is myocardial infarction often referred to as \"a heart attack\". 2. There are several non-modifiable risk factors associated with development of IHD such as family history, male gender, and older age. High blood cholesterol and elevated blood pressure are considered to be the key modifiable risk factors of IHD. In addition, smoking, diabetes, physical inactivity, and obesity have also been identified as important factors leading to the development of IHD. Obesity\u2014defined as an excess of body fat measured by body mass index (BMI)-- is also associated with IHD, in particular abdominal obesity. Diagnosis and Treatment Prevention 3. Primary prevention aims to reduce risk factors directly through changes in lifestyles and behaviours. Secondary prevention aims to limit the consequences of existing risk factors, such as hypertension or cholesterol through drug treatment and to monitor more closely with diagnostic screeningsuch as exercise stress tests. Both primary and secondary prevention are aimed at decreasing the progression of artherosclerosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. 4. In past years, public health programmes have been organised to encourage populations to alter behaviour and lifestyles which negatively impact their health such as campaigns to reduce smoking, to adopt better eating habits, and to exercise more. Additionally, there has been more widespread use ofmedications to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol in the hopes of decreasing risk of heart disease. Researchers have been attempting to distinguish the relative contributions of public health interventions versus preventive medical care versus medical care treatment. There appears to be evidence supporting the important role of preventive behaviour and public health measures are playing in explaining the differences in reduced levels and trends in mortality (Tunstall-Pedoe et al., 1999).6Management and Treatment of Patients with Angina 5. When monitoring high risk patients from a preventive and diagnostic perspective, electrocardiogram (EKG) tests and exercise stress testing are often conducted. With exercise stress testing, older people cannot exercise at a level of 90 percent of predicted maximum heart rate so a thallium scan might be used. In addition, other evidence might be provided by echocardiography. 6. If patient is diagnosed with angina, the patient can be either treated generally two different ways. First, patient can be medically managed (e.g. with anti-hypertensive drugs such as beta blockers or diuretics, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors and or cholesterol-lowering agents, and or antiplatelettreatment such as aspirin). The second approach is for the patient to be routed for more invasive procedures: first, catheterisation or coronary angiography and then revascularisation procedures: percutanous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Decisions between the two revascularisation procedures tend to be related to the patient 's age, number of vessels blocked (if more, likely to have CABG), general health of the patient and availability offacilities and skilled personnel. 7. Medical management with drugs often is considered the low-tech option, meaning low fixed costs, marginal costs of use not requiring substantial input of labour, capital equipment etc., while the more invasive approach is considered the high-tech therapy, due to its high fixed costs for provision of the treatment, plus high marginal costs for each use (McClellan et al., 1998). It is important to note that thereare some drugs, such as ACE inhibitors, which can be considered high-tech therapy. Acute first line treatment 8. In the acute phase after the first AMI, there are two main strategies for the first line treatment either: immediate administration of thrombolytic therapy or a primary percutanous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In past years, there has been differing opinions and much research to determine whichfirst line treatment leads to better short-term and long-term outcomes (Every et al., 1996, Grines, et al. 1993, Zilstra et al. 1993). Thrombolytics have been shown to lead to substantially lower heart attack mortality than primary PTCA. However, preliminary evidence from the McClellan study highlighted that economic factors appear to be contributing to the medical decisions of which treatment strategy to pursue. 9. Thrombolytic therapy breaks down the blood clot responsible for the heart attack and restores blood flow to the affected heart muscle before it dies. This treatment must be given immediately to the patients, within 6 to 12 hours of the heart attack. Currently, there are several types of therapies available: streptokinase, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Streptokinase and urokinase are the traditional drug products and much less expensive than the latest product released in the drug market, tPA. Thrombolytic therapy, used with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, has tended to be targeted to younger patients rather than older patients due to possible side effects and complications, such as haemorrhaging in high blood pressure patients. Often these patients, once stabilised and depending ontheir condition, will receive follow-up treatment with either PTCA or CABG. 10. The second approach to first line treatment is primary PTCA. Primary angioplasty involves first, a coronary angiography or cardiac catheterisation to identify the location of the blockage and then, the actual angioplasty to remove the blockage. Angioplasty uses a catheter with a balloon attached to the tip. This catheter is guided to the location of the blockage and the balloon is inflated and deflated to reduce theobstruction. This procedure must also be conducted within 6 to 12 hours after the heart attack. 11. Additional techniques were developed in the later 1980s to prevent restenosis \u2014a renarrowing of the artery after the first angioplasty. Developments included the advent of laser, rotablators and coronary7stents that would be used after the angioplasty to address the increasing rates of restenosis among angina and AMI patients (ANDEM 1992, 1994). Coronary stents, the most recent advancement, are wire rims to keep the blood vessel open after undergoing angioplasty to reduce restenosis. These have been the most widely developed and adopted across countries. In addition, new drugs have been developed to facilitate stenting (Anti 2A 3B) which tend to be very expensive. 12. In terms of the first line treatment for AMI patients, there is varying trends across countries based on preliminary evidence in the McClellan study to date. The high-tech option of primary angioplasty demands much resources such as availability and access to cardiac catheteristation lab and skilledpersonnel to conduct this therapy. Therefore, countries with the tendency to adopt more high tech treatment, have been opting for this strategy such as the United States. To date, the use of primary PTCA has been rising in North America, particularly the United States at this stage, whereas thrombolytic therapy is more universally recognised and used across the other OECD countries. (McClellen, et. al., 1998) Revascularisation Procedures 13. Depending on the patient 's condition after receiving first line treatment, further treatment might be needed to reduce symptoms and pain as well as a recurrent attack. Further treatment is revascularisation to improve the blood flow. This can be done either with PTCA as described above or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). CABG is the traditional revascularisation method, but the most invasive procedure since it involves open chest surgery. The surgery involves grafting a vein or artery (from anotherpart of the body) from aorta to the coronary artery, thus bypassing the obstructed area. The bypass can involve single arteries, double or multiple depending on the number of grafts. Those likely to undergo bypass surgery are patients with severe angina where drug management has not improved their health (as described above); patients with no previous AMI and no other health problems. 14. Until the late 1980s and 1990s, CABGs and angioplasties were being performed equally across most countries. Since then, a dramatic rise in angioplasties has been witnessed, at a faster rate than CABGs (Chart 1). A steady six-fold increase in the utilisation of angioplasties across Western European countries has been documented since 1985 (Van den Brand et al, 1993). In the United States, angioplasty has become more widely used and adopted much earlier than other countries. Researchers speculate that this is primarily due to the significant diffusion of angioplasty facilities, more favourable reimbursementarrangements than less invasive therapies in the United States. Van den Brand cites that in Northern European countries, bypass operations, however, remain to be the preferred mode of revascularisation. 15. From the perspective of patterns of care for the elderly, interesting trends have been documented. In the early 1980s, less than 10 percent of elderly AMI patients underwent catheterrisation as compared with more than 45 percent 10 years later. In terms of bypass surgery, rates have increased from less than 5 in 1984 to 15 in 1990 and angioplasty has grown even more dramatically from no use to over 18 percent (McClellan et al.,1998). There has also been recent studies comparing rates of procedures and outcomes inelderly populations in Canada and United States. (Tu et al., 1997) With the increasing evidence of the significant benefits and lower than expected complication rates among the older population, frequency of these procedures among the older populations is likely to continue increasing over the years. Health Outcomes 16. For mild forms of ischemic heart disease, the main health outcomes are related to functional disability and any limitations in daily activities related to symptoms and pain. Additionally, if data is available, complications may be examined through the measure of the rate of AMI events among angina patients.817. When the mild form of IHD enters the acute phase, mortality is the main outcome measure. More specifically, in-hospital and out-hospital mortality have been analysed in order to understand the relative contributions of reduced levels of risk factors versus the medical interventions (Tunstall-Pedoe et al, 1988). Short term and long term survival defined as 28 or 30 day mortality and 3-year mortality respectively is also monitored. Though difficult to capture the information, quality of life after treatment whether angioplasty or bypass would also be important to understand the morbidity level among the older population. Plus, any complications such as allergic reactions; bleeding, hemorrhaging, arrhythmias, stroke and reinfarction can occur during and after the procedures and treatment and measuring rehospitalisationafter 30 days, for example, might highlight the needs for further revascularization due to restenosis or additional AMIs or for treatment of complications described above. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND 18. When analysing the burden of cardiovascular disease, the most easily accessible data is mortality data. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Across OECD countries,ischemic heart disease accounts for a large proportion of CVD deaths, about 20 to 30 percent. Acute myocardial infarction usually contributes to about half of these IHD deaths. Cross sectional trends in mortality due to AMI 19. Mortality rates due to AMI vary considerably across countries. In both sexes, the mortality due to AMI is particularly high in Nordic countries, Eastern European countries, United Kingdom, and Ireland;while death rates tend to be lower in Asian countries, France, and Southern European countries (Table 1). Mortality rates for males ranged from a high of 198.6 per 100 000 in Ireland to a low of 13.1 per 100 000 in Korea; while mortality rates for females are the highest in Finland at 154.5 per 100 000 to the lowest again in Korea at 8.2 per 100 000. Mortality rates due to AMI are higher for men than women. However, there tends to be high correlation between deaths in both genders, meaning that when mortality is high inmales, it is also high for women. When examining age-specific mortality rates from acute myocardial infarction, there is a exponential rise in rates according to age (Charts 2a and 2b, Tables 3a and 3b). Within countries, AMI mortality rates for males 75 years and older were twice as high as the rates for the 65-74 age group. Trends in mortality due to IHD over time 20. The burden from ischemic heart disease reached its peak in several OECD countries in the mid- 60s for males, while evidence has shown that the decline in mortality due to IHD for women started back in the 1950s. But since the 1970s, across most OECD countries, there have been remarkable declines in mortality rates due to ischemic heart disease (Charts 4a and 4b). Some of the OECD countries, however, still experienced increases in rates during 1970s and 1980s, such as Eastern European countries. Despite consistent declines in mortality rates in early 1990s across most OECD countries, Eastern European countries are documenting inverse trends, with continued increases in male mortality and stagnating levelsof mortality for females. 21. These mortality rates from IHD have been declining in all age groups. In many countries, evidence has shown that the decline in mortality due to cardiovascular disease has been more significant among older age groups and this has been a main reason in recent years ' gains in life expectancy at birth and in particular, the life expectancy at 65 and 80.922. The underlying differences for these trends in mortality are being explored; for instance, in the WHO Monitoring of Trends and Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) project for the population between 35 to 64 years of age. Countries have demonstrated declines, all with different baseline levels, different patterns of levels of risk factors, and different medical care systems. Researchers are examining whether these decreases in rates might be due to lower incidence over time where there might be better diagnostic techniques reducing the severity of disease and favourable changes in risk factor levels, or improved survival rates because of better acute treatment (e.g. use of thrombolytic therapy) and better management of complications. To begin to answer these questions, WHO Monica Project recentlyreleased some conclusions and findings, highlighting that declining incidence has been playing a more important role in the decline of CHD mortality than changes in survival (Tunstall-Pedoe, et. al. 1999). This is supported in work by Hunink et al., 1997 demonstrating that reduction of primary and secondary prevention via lifestyle modification and medication has played an instrumental role in decreasing mortality rates. Incidence and Prevalence of IHD 23. Population data on incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease and in particular, ischemic disease as well as information on risk factors across OECD countries are scarce. Incidence data in particular would be of great importance in understanding the impact of lifestyle changes and improvements in treatment. Little to date has concentrated on details for the elderly population in terms of population-based data. 24. Incidence data can be obtained from hospital records or registers. One example is the national myocardial register in Sweden where hospital discharge records and death register have been linked to determine the incidence. Evidence from the Swedish registry shows that incidence of myocardial infarction has decreased by 1.6 percent each year between 1987 to 1994 on average. Incidence increases rapidly withage with Swedish men aged between 70 and 74 having six times higher incidence than men aged 50-54 (National Board of Health and Welfare, 1998). The incidence for women of certain ages is largely comparable with those of men who are ten years younger. Incidence can also be represented by the rate of hospital discharge or separations for AMI. It can be a proxy for incidence rates though it does not include the people who did not reach the hospitals, in particular those who died prior to reaching the hospital. 25. But with mortality declining more rapidly than incidence, prevalence and morbidity is likely on the rise. Prevalence data would also be helpful to understand the number of people still suffering from ischemic heart disease in its chronic phase since their use of health services are likely to be high. This information on the amount of disease existing in a population, however, is scarce. Surveys are currently the main source of prevalence data. (However, there are some issues related with accuracy of this self-report data.) 26. In Australia, there has been an increase in prevalence of cardiovascular conditions in 1995, since the last survey which took place in 1989-1990 from 18 percent to 21 percent when standardised taking the effect of ageing population. Prevalence of cardiovascular conditions increased with age from 4 percent for 18-21 year olds to 61% percent for those aged 75 years and over. (Boyle et al, 1995) When examining more specifically heart disease, the prevalence was higher for men than women based on self reports. Countries have similar data of this type from longitudinal studies such as in Italy and national healthinterview surveys with questions on chronic conditions as presented for Australia and exist in several other OECD countries.10CONCLUSIONS 27. Based on a review of past literature and related projects, it is important to find complementary issues to focus the OECD ageing-related disease project. Continued exploration of the extent of variation of care patterns for both mild and acute forms of AMI across countries could continue some of the previous work and extend it to countries where analysis has not yet taken place. Most researchers have been seeking answers to reasons behind these care variations for AMI patients and whether they bring about better health outcomes in some countries as opposed to others. Most importantly, differences in structural and institutional features of the health care system, economic incentives and supply of healthresources could be examined to see if they provide an explanation of these variations.11STROKE MEDICAL BACKGROUND Definitions, Symptoms and Risk Factors 28. Cerebrovascular disease comprises several disorders where there is a disturbance of blood supply to the brain. Stroke has been defined as \"rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent nonvascular cause, including patients presenting with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerbral hemorrhage, or cerebral ischemic infarction \"(Thorvaldsen et al., 1995). 29. The clinical presentations of stroke are varied in terms of type and location of the disturbance. In general, there are three main types: ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage. 30. The most common type of stroke is ischemic stroke, which represents about eighty percent of all strokes. Ischemic stroke occurs when there is deficient supply of blood to the brain due to the formation of a blood clot, sometimes referred to as cerebral ischemia. There is also another type of ischemic strokewhen a clot formed in one artery of the body is carried by the blood and lodges itself in another location causing a blockage, referred to as cerebral embolism. 31. A less common type of stroke is cerebral hemorrhage where an artery leaks blood into the brain, causing compression and damage to the nerve tissue. Symptoms for this type are more significant, usually resulting in a severe headache. One other type of hemorrhagic strokes is the subarachnoid hemorrhagewhere bleeding occurs between the arachnoid membrane and the surface of the brain. Rupture of an aneurysm causes a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, which sometimes leads to intracerebral hemorrhage as well. Hemorrhagic strokes tend to have a worse prognosis than ischemic strokes. 32. Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are a \"milder\" form of stroke and may occur where there is temporary deficiency in blood supply to brain which may last only a couple of minutes. However,symptoms may also disappear completely after 24 hours. After a first TIA event, patients are considered at high risk for an acute ischemic stroke attack. It is predicted that one-third of the patients will later have a stroke, another third will have repeated TIAs, and the other third may never show further signs of cerebrovascular symptoms. 33. For the purposes of the OECD ageing-related disease study, the focus of the research will be on ischemic strokes and the more mild form, TIAs, since they comprise about 80 percent of all strokes. Carotid stenosis, the narrowing of an artery located in the neck due to clotting, represents a risk factor forTIAs and ischemic strokes, particularly when there is 70 percent stenosis. In terms of behavioural risk12factors, stroke shares similar risk factors with IHD such as high blood pressure, smoking, and physical inactivity. In fact, pre-existing IHD is a risk factor itself for the development of a stroke because of the likelihood of blood clots moving up to the arteries of the brain. Age also plays a very big role in risk of developing a stroke. Diagnosis and Treatment Prevention and Diagnosis 34. In terms of primary prevention, most of the risk factors described for stroke are modifiable by changing lifestyles and behaviour, such as reducing cigarette smoking and increasing physical activity. Interms of secondary prevention, medical intervention such as treatment for high blood pressure have demonstrated benefits for high-risk patients for stroke. Much of prevention strategies on a population level pursued for cardiovascular disease (CVD) should be applied in efforts to lower the risk of stroke as well. 35. Diagnosis before onset of stroke event is difficult, unless a patient has a high risk profile or experienced a TIA. Often for TIA, asymptomatic high risk patients, and those during their first strokeevent, CT scan and MRI are often the first diagnostic imaging tests to be conducted to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and verify ischemic origins so thrombolytic therapy can be given immediately during the limited time window allowed for administration. 36. Following this assessment, more vascular imaging tests may be needed to detect the location and to define the extent of carotid stenosis. These tests may include doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonanceangiography, and contrast angiography or arteriography. The latter is an invasive diagnostic procedure where a catheter is used to diffuse contrast products to detect the location of the abnormality causing the ischemic stroke. Though it is a very accurate assessment method, complications may arise during this diagnostic procedure by provoking another stroke. In recent years, there has been some discussion as to whether MRA will be able to effectively replace the contrast angiography, not in terms of diagnosticperformance, but also from a cost effective perspective. Medical Management for TIA and ischemic stroke patients 37. For patients with TIA and a first ischemeic stroke attack, the main aim is to prevent first or recurrent stroke events by improving arterial blood supply to the brain. There are two main strategies for primary and secondary prevention: either medical management through drug treatment ranging from anti-platelet, anti-coagulant, to thrombolytic therapies or an invasive procedure called carotid endarectomy, which is a more preventive intervention rather than curative. 38. Anti-platelet therapy \u2014such as aspirin-- is aimed at reducing the tendency for the blood to clot. Often this is the first stage of the drug therapy. The use of aspirin after TIA, mild stroke, and acute ischemic stroke has demonstrated benefits in preventing repeated strokes or attacks such as reduction of risk of recurrent events by about 25 percent. (Antiplatelet Trialists ' Collaboration, 1994). Uncertainty remains as to what is the most efficacious dose. Other antiplatelet therapy \u2014such as dipyridamole, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel \u2014appear to be as effective as aspirin, but are much more expensive relative to low-cost aspirin. While, anti-coagulants have tended to be the traditional treatment for cerebrovascular disease, it can only be given to patients who do not suffer from high blood pressure due to hemorrhaging side effects. There are several types of anti-coagulant therapies available such as low molecular weight heparin on an outpatient basis, or warfarin and heparin in intravenous doses.1339. The third type of drug management is thrombolytic agents, used to dissolve blood clots leading to acute attacks. The three drugs used extensively at this time are: tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), streptokinase, and urokinase. A major risk in taking these agents is development of intracerebral hemorrhage. TPA, the newest and most expensive drug, can be used for ischemic stroke and TIA patients who meet the strict list of indications and are currently at a hospital with a highly skilled medical team and 24-hour access to CT scan, MRI, and stroke unit or neurosurgery facilities. The therapy must also be given within 3 hours of stroke onset, which is difficult to verify due to the subtle symptoms associated with TIA and ischemic stroke. According to recent studies, TPA may play a role in minimising damage from acuteischemic infarct and preserving functional status in selected patients. (The NINDS rtPA stroke study group, 1995). Other studies have shown negative benefits with TPA administration, but it was when higher doses were given and time to treatment was longer than a 3-hour window. (ECASS, 1991). 40. The second approach is an invasive procedure to reduce the risk of first ischemic stroke attack or recurrent attacks in patients with carotid stenosis, called carotid endarectomy (CEA). However, muchcontroversy of its use exists due to uncertain benefits and possible complications. This surgical technique removes the arterial plaque which is creating the blockage of the artery and increasing the risk of ischemic stroke. 41. Tu et al. (1998) describes the evolution of adoption and use of this procedure, which was originally developed in the 1950s. Rates of carotid endarectomy increased between the date of its inceptionto the mid-1980s, when rates began to decline in response to a number of studies uncovering high rates of complications. (Tu et al, 1998). In the early 1990s, evidence was released that carotid endarectomy was effective in preventing stroke in symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis of 70 percent or more if it is performed in high-volume centers with highly skilled surgeons and low perioperative adverse event rates. (NASCET, 1991, European Carotid Surgery Trialists ' Collaborative Group, 1991, Mayberg, 1991). In patients with a carotid territory, TIA, or non-disabling ischemic stroke and have angiographic evidence of severe carotid stenosis, CEA performed within 6 months of the attack abolishes risk of ischemic stroke over the next years in that area (European Carotid Surgery Trialists ' Collaborative Group, 1991, NASCET, 1991). Since these latest studies, rising rates of this intervention have been documented in several national and US-Canadian studies (Tu et al., 1998). 42. Currently, there is much discussion of whether the procedure can be effective in reducing risk of stroke among TIA and asymptomatic carotid stenosis patients with less than 70 percent. (Executive Committee of ACAS, 1995). Some argue that the benefit is rather small and that the risk is too high for cardiac event during the procedure. Many researchers have been concerned that surgeons may be conducting these procedures inappropriately since they are not medically necessary (Winslow, 1988, Perry et al. 1997). 43. Based on research, patients with acute stroke have better outcomes in terms of shorter length of stay, discharge to nursing home, survival and functional wellbeing, if treated in acute stroke unit rather than general medical service (Langhorne et al, 1993; Jorgenson et al. 1995). In stroke units, there tends to be equipment and personnel for the diagnostic procedures ready to make rapid evaluation, plus they have dedicated rehabilitation support. In some of the previous studies conducted across European countries, there appears to be significant variation in the type and range of care services received by a stroke patient,even after adjusting for case mix (Beech et al., 1996). Health Outcomes 44. Mortality is the main outcome measure. Along with overall mortality rates due to stroke, rates of case fatality, death within 28 days of onset might be monitored if data is available. Evidence on the14declining case fatality at 28 days has raised questions as to whether it is due to presentation of lower stroke severity or differing management of the stroke. Frequency of the different types of stroke are likely to influence severity levels since cerebral hemorrhagic stroke is more fatal than ischemic stroke. 45. In terms of complications, rehospitalisation after 30 days or rates of cardiac events during care management may occur. For patients recovering after a stroke, the main health outcomes are related to function and are related to disability. Stroke is a highly disabling disease, which may have an impact in terms of limitations in daily activities related to subsequent symptoms and pain measured by ADLs or other functional rating scales for stroke. Discharge rate to patient 's own home versus nursing home and rate of institutionalisation among stroke patients might also provide some understanding of health outcomes in terms of the extent of independence and functioning among these patients. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND Cross sectional trends in stroke mortality 46. In studying epidemiology of stroke, official mortality statistics have been the main source of data. There is significant difference between levels of mortality across OECD countries, as high as a sixfold difference ranging from high rates in Portugal, Hungary, and Greece and low rates in Mexico, Canada, and Australia in general. Larger variation occurs across European countries as compared to North American, Australia, Mexico and Korea (Table 3). In Asian countries, stroke tends to be much more of a problem than heart disease as a cause of death. Unlike IHD mortality rates where men tend to have higher rates thanwomen, women tend to have higher stroke mortality rates than men across OECD countries. Females ' rates of stroke mortality range from a high of 258.0 per 100 000 in Portugal to 27.3 per 100 000 in Mexico. Mortality rates due to stroke also increase exponentially with age, with a significant increase evident between age groups 65 to 74 and 75 and older in both men and women across OECD countries. (Tables 4a and 4b). Trends in mortality over time 47. For last several decades, mortality due to stroke has been declining in most of the OECD countries, specifically in North America, Japan, and Western European countries in all ages. (Thorvaldsen et al, 1997; Bonita et al, 1995), with a significant decline occurring in the mid-1970s (Charts 5a and 5b.). In the 1970s and 1980s, there were declines in stroke mortality across countries, perhaps a consequence tobetter identification and treatment of high risk hypertensive patients. The decline in stroke mortality has paralleled, and surpassed the rate of decline in ischemic heart disease mortality in most OECD countries, particularly in terms of significant reductions of mortality among the older age groups. According to WHO, in Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States, since the 1970s, there has been a decline of over 50 percent in stroke mortality in men and women aged 65-74 years (WHO, 1995). Eastern European countries have not demonstrated the same rate of decline at all. These countries have shown either stable rates or slight increases in mortality rates. Trends in incidence by age groups and over time 48. Data on stroke incidence is available from community-based stroke studies and specific registers as well as some cohort studies, but population-based data is scarce, particularly covering older age groups. These studies have been beneficial in the comparisons within the populations under study, but comparisons across these studied population groups are difficult due to the differing study designs (McGovern et al.,1992, 1993, Kodama, 1993, Tuomilehto, J. et al, 1993, Stegmayr et al. 1994). WHO Monica study has15provided for more standardised collection of stroke events across populations. The Monica study, focusing on the 35 to 64 age groups, has demonstrated differences in stroke incidence greater than threefold among men and fivefold among women studied (Thorvaldsen et al, 1995 and 1997). A very high incidence was identified in Finnish populations studied; with even higher rates found in Eastern Europe than in other Western countries. Lowest incidence was found in Italian populations. This resembled the pattern of incidence and mortality found in the coronary heart disease component of WHO project. (Tunstall-Pedoe et al., 1994). 49. For trends over time, some declines in stroke incidence have been reported in the United States, Asia, and Europe, but in some populations there have been no significant changes in rates. These uncertain trends make it difficult to understand why in fact mortality continues to fall as described above, because if the number of the new events is not decreasing, then the decline in mortality is occurring due to improved survival. Some studies have suggested that recent improvements in stroke mortality are due to improvements in case-fatality rates rather than incidence rates, though they have improved more inyounger populations rather than older populations (Bonita et al., 1993). Case fatality rates, as defined as mortality within 28-day of onset are likely to improve due to better acute management techniques or to what some research has pointed to be decreased severity of the disease, with the event presenting in a more mild form. (Wolf et al., 1992, Bonita et al. 1993). 50. In terms of a micro-data oriented research, another source of data might be hospital admission, discharge or separation data. However, it is important to understand that such data may underestimate the true incidence of stroke because people are not always hospitalised if their condition is not serious (e.g., milder forms and TIA). Some studies have shown that 20 percent of the strokes have been managed at home or in a nursing home (Anderson et al., 1993). This study also demonstrated that admission became less likely as age increased, where 38 percent of patients aged 85 or over were managed outside of thehospital. CONCLUSIONS 51. Based on the review of the literature from a clinical and epidemiological point of view, several projects, particularly those on the European level, exist to examine the variations in care of stroke patients across OECD; however their focus often is populations under 64 years old. With a research strategy toconcentrate on the older populations, the OECD study could focus on the differences in preventive, medical and rehabilitation care models and their associated costs across participating OECD countries. As best as possible, the impact of these care patterns on outcomes in the population could be explored. To complement previous and ongoing international studies, the OECD study could direct attention to the role of economic factors and supply factors (e.g. stroke centers or number of neurosurgeons) in the provision of care, such as the use of diagnostic imaging tests and high tech interventions. Also, if data is to be collected on epidemiological trends, the study could further contribute to present work exploring the trends overtime in incidence, mortality and case fatality rates for the older population.16DIABETES MELLITUS MEDICAL BACKGROUND Definitions, Symptoms and Risk Factors 52. Diabetes mellitus is described as \"a metabolic disorder of multiple aetiology characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both \" (Alberti et al. 1998). This chronic disease, associated with deficiency in the production of insulin by the pancreas or the body 's resistance to the insulin that is produced, results in increased concentrations of glucose in the blood which in turns, damages the body 's organs. 53. There are two types of diabetes often referred to as Type I and Type II diabetes: insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) respectively. In IDDM, the pancreas fails to produce the necessary insulin due to an auto-immune disease. In general, the immune system is attacking the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. Thepancreas then produces little or no insulin. This type of diabetes tends to develop most often in children and young adults. 54. NIDDM tends to be the most common form of diabetes, affecting about 90 percent of diabetics. In NIDDM, the pancreas does produce insulin, but for some reason, the body is unable to respond properly and often resists insulin or there is an insulin secretory defect (Alberti et al. 1998). NIDDM, also referredto as adult onset diabetes, is prevalent in the older population. It usually develops in adults over age 40 and is most common in populations over 50 years of age and hence, the OECD study will focus on the Type II diabetes. 55. There is also an intermediate level of glucose intolerance which is called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). People with IGT usually are not diagnosed with diabetes, but are likely to be at high riskfor ischemic heart disease than those with normal glucose tolerance and are at risk of progressing to full- blown diabetes in the future. Patients with IGT also are high risk of macrovascular disease. 56. The symptoms of NIDDM develop gradually and not as pronounced as in IDDM. Symptoms include excessive secretion of urine (polyuria), thirst (polydipsia), constant hunger, and a feeling of lassitude. It is frequent that NIDDM may not be diagnosed until complications are present. The symptomsare less marked for NIDDM and may sometimes not be diagnosed until complications are present, such as diabetic retinopathy, renal failure, heart disease, and neuropathy or arterial disease in foot and leg. 57. The three most important risk factors for NIDDM are obesity, physical inactivity, and nutrition, primarily related to lifestyle and environment. In many ways, the high risk profile for diabetes is parallel to that of CVD. The majority of patients with this type of diabetes are obese. It has been found that obesity and also abdominal obesity itself causes or aggravates insulin resistance. (Alberti et al. 1998, Campbell et al. 1993, Bogardus et al. 1993). In some studies, age-adjusted rates of NIDDM were significantlyassociated with each increase in quartile of body mass index among women in particular (McPhillips, et al. 1990). The risk of developing Type II diabetes also increases with age and lack of physical activity (Zimmet et al, 1992, Rewers et al., 1995). Family history with diabetes is also another strong non- modifiable risk factor, and in addition, women who had gestational diabetes when pregnant.1758. Additionally, hypertension has been found to be more frequent among diabetics than non- diabetics. Elevated blood pressure is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients, in particular, coronary heart disease and stroke. It also plays a part in increasing morbidity and mortality in this population related to peripheral vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, lower extremity amputations, and end stage renal disease. Complications due to Diabetes 59. Several types of chronic complications -which are often due to macrovascular and microvascular disease\u2014emerge among NIDDM populations, leading to morbidity, mortality and high associated costs. Coronary heart disease is the main cause of disability and death of people with NIDDM in industrialised countries, in whom 50 percent to 75 percent of people of diabetes are due to ischemic heart disease; 15 percent of people of diabetes are due to stroke (IDF). (Moss et al., 1991) In some studies after adjusting for other CVD risk factors, NIDDM is an independent risk factor for CVD. (Kannel et al., 1979 and Manson et al. 1991) Also, it has been found that diabetic pre-menopausal women do not experience the protective effect of estrogen fromdevelopment of coronary heart disease. Renal failure , otherwise known medically as nephropathy, is another likely complication for diabetic patients. The first signs of renal failure often emerge after five or more years of onset of diabetes which include excessive excretion rate of albumin (microalbuminuria), hypertension, and elevated blood cholesterol. Microalbumineria in diabetic patients is predictive of persistent proteinuria and early death from cardiovascular disease and is alsoassociated with a higher prevalence of retinopathy (see below). After 17 years of diabetes, patients' kidney condition deteriorates, leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD) which must be treated with renal dialysis or transplantation. Diabetic retinopathy is one of main causes of blindness in adults in developed countries. According to WHO, 15 years after onset of diabetes, approximately 2 percent of people become blind, while about 10 percent develop a severe visual handicap. Loss of vision dueglaucoma and cataract are also common among diabetic patients. Recent studies show that proper control of blood sugar will reduce the risk of retinopathy. Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common of the complications for diabetic patients. Between a third and a half of the diabetic persons are affected to some degree by neuropathy or arterial disease, most often peripheral sensory neuropathy in the legs, feet and hands. Severe conditions may emerge that lead to ulcers, gangrene, and ultimately, amputations. Treatment Preventive and medical management of NIDDM 60. The main goal of prevention and medical management of NIDDM patients is to achieve optimal metabolic control. Other aims are to monitor repeatedly known risk factors such as hypertension and high cholesterol and to screen for potential acute and chronic complications. Prevention programmes havebegun to target these patients identified with IGT in an effort to prevent or delay the development of NIDDM. The first line of treatment are interventions related to lifestyle modification aimed at weight reduction, changing diet and increased physical activity which have been demonstrated to bring about18significant benefits. (Eriksson et al, 1991, Bourn et al, 1994, Long et al. 1994, Schneider et al. 1992). Most often NIDDM patients are encouraged first to alter their diet under the supervision of dieteticians. 61. Control of monitoring of blood glucose has shown benefits in managing patients with NIDDM. Though focus of this study was on IDDM patients, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) study demonstrated findings also applicable to the NIDDM population that lowering HbA1C by an average of 2 percent units produced significant reductions in rate of complications due to microvascular disease such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy (DCCT, 1995). If alterations in diet have not worked to lower blood glucose levels, then oral drug therapy is recommended such as metformin or sulphpnylureasseparately or together (Leese et al., 1995). In turn, if oral drugs fail, insulin can be taken in accordance with a proper diet. 62. In addition to general metabolic control, lowering blood pressure in diabetic patients with hypertension has shown reductions in the risk of developing nephropathy (Lewis, et al. 1993, Mogenson et al. 1982, Parving et al. 1987). Some research has been conducted to see which type of anti-hypertensivetreatment is most efficacious for diabetic patients. Prevention and treatment of complications 63. One of the other goals is early detection and treatment of complications described above. In terms of diabetic retinopathy, screening is recommended and if acute phase emerges, laser photcoagulation therapy has been shown to be effective. In terms of screening, fundus examination, such as directopthalmoscopy with a dilated pupil is the recommended test to examine high risk diabetic patients. (Griffith et al., 1993) Retinal photography can also be performed as an alternate, but is more expensive (in case of need to identify sight-threatening lesions). Screening has been proven to be cost-effective in some recent studies (Javitt et al., 1996). 64. Prevention of diabetic neuropathy \u2014damage to nerve supply \u2014requires strict monitoring of the level and duration of hyperglycaemia. Education of foot care for diabetic patients has proven to be effective in limiting the number of complications. Graduated tuning forks are useful for the semi- quantitative diagnostic measurement. There may also be ischemic problems different from neuropathic symptoms, due to deterioration of the nerve supply. To screen these ischemic cases, diagnostic procedures using a doppler ultrasonography and arteriography (and perhaps angioplasty or surgical arterialreconstruction) might be needed. If condition worsens, patients may suffer from foot ulcers and need for effective antibiotic and surgical management could prevent the need for further treatment, such as lower extremity amputations (Rosenblum et al. 1994; Eckman, et al. 1995). 65. As mentioned above, renal failure comes in three stages: incipient nephropathy, clinical nephropathy, and end stage renal failure. Primary prevention again focuses on the control of hyperglycaemia, control of hypertension, and restriction of dietary protein to help slow progress of renal damage. There is evidence if blood glucose is controlled well there is high likelihood of slowing theprogression of clinical proteinuria. Additionally, in terms of elevated cholesterol over 6.5 mmol/litre and triglyceride levels over 2.2 mmol/litre after not responding to dietary restrictions etc. and hypertension around systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 90-104 mmHg, drug treatment should be considered. As mentioned above, some anti-hypertensive treatment have proven effective in reducing the progression of renal failure (see above). 66. If symptoms continue and patients enter a more acute stage, continued monitoring and treatment of raised blood pressure, lower intake of protein, and elevated cholesterol, increasing risk for cardiovascular complications. At this stage, it is uncertain how much further impact controlled blood19glucose will improve the condition. When considered at end stage renal failure, mode of therapy between dialysis or transplantation will be highly dependent on condition, severity of the patient etc. Continued secondary prevention should be conducted to avoid further morbidity or mortality after renal replacement therapy. 67. One of the major problems in treatment of diabetes is patient compliance, in particular encouraging the elderly to change their lifestyles. Probably if compliance with treatment was achieved, complications would be reduced. Leese states that only 25 percent of people with NIDDM are successfully treated with diet alone, the remainder with insulin or oral drug therapy. Health outcomes 68. The main outcomes for diabetes are primarily focused on the complications and their impact on morbidity and mortality patterns such as blindness in mid-age and elderly people, limb amputations, end stage renal disease, and ischemic heart disease. Many of these outcome measures focusing on complication rates due to diabetes have proposed by the St Vincent Declaration programme under the auspices of WHOand the International Diabetes Federation. Through this programme, targets for these measures have been established. Also, an ideal measure would be a measure of the impact of their condition on their ability to function in relation to their daily activities. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND 69. Examining mortality due to diabetes mellitus only often does not demonstrate a comprehensive picture of the burden of mortality for diabetic patients as it often underestimates significantly the contribution that diabetes makes to overall mortality (Fuller, 1985). Most often diabetic patients die of complications due to diabetes as described above, in particular, from cardiovascular disease and often the complication is noted as the principal causes and diabetes is documented as an underlying cause and not the principal cause of mortality. It has been reported on average that about 40 to 50 percent of diabeticpatients die of ischemic heart disease and 15 percent die of stroke. 70. Frequency of diabetes is difficult to capture for a number of reasons. Little is known about the prevalence and incidence of diabetes due to variability in methods and diagnosis criteria used across countries. In addition, data on prevalence of NIDDM are often more available than the incidence of NIDDM due to considerable resources needed to monitor continuously the population and to conductrepeated cross-sectional surveys to gather numbers of new cases in a population each year. Therefore, below, the focus is on prevalence estimates collected from a variety of sources. Prevalence of diabetes across countries and by age groups 71. Most of prevalence data is based on smaller surveys focused on a specific subpopulation sample using a certain diagnostic criteria, often in accordance with WHO recommendation. (WHO, 1994). Most studies concentrate on diabetes mellitus as a whole and a few have examined in more detail the prevalence of NIDDM. Issues of representativeness and comparability across countries emerge when making cross-national comparisons. 72. Based on a compilation of studies of this type, WHO estimates that prevalence of diabetes in general (as defined according to the WHO recommendations) ranges from 2.0 percent to 10.0 percent in several OECD countries (Table 5). WHO also projects that between 1995 to 2005, there will be significant increase in the number of people with diabetes worldwide. Though most of the increase will take place in20developing world due in part to the ageing populations and urbanisation, developed countries will face an increase of 27 percent in the diabetes prevalence for male and female from 6.0 to 7.6 percent. (King et al., 1998). 73. In most of these studies, prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases with age, particularly between 45 and 75 years of age. Even with age-specific prevalence rates in these studies show increased rates for the older age groups. WHO estimates that populations over 65 in developed countries will face the greatest increase as compared to the younger ages. (King et al, 1998). 74. Studies of NIDDM have shown remarkable differences across countries in regards to incidence and mortality (King et al., 1998, McCarty et al., 1994). It is clear that certain ethnic groups tend to have a higher susceptibility to NIDDM, for instance, Hispanic Americans, Native American communities, and Black Americans in the United States and ethnic groups migrating into European countries. Hispanic Americans have 2.5 times higher prevalence than non-Hispanic whites in the United States (Mitchell, et al. 1992). Other reports based in the UK have cited people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean origins to have aprevalence of diabetes mellitus 5 times higher than in comparable European populations; similar variations are found in New Zealand with Maori populations (Leese et al., 1995 and Simmons et al., 1992). Similar differentials in mortality have been found between these subpopulations as well. 75. In addition, socio-economic factors, such as increased affluence and standard of living plus a trend toward more Western lifstyles are playing a significant part in the rising prevalences observed inrecent years in countries like Japan and Korea. Changing diet and increase in use of cars with a subsequent decrease in physical activity may be a contributing factor to these rising prevalences. 76. Another source of prevalence data is national health surveys which ask self-report data on chronic conditions, one of which is diabetes. Below is Table 6 which presents the prevalence of self- reported diabetes for males, females, and overall population. Intercountry comparisons with this datashould be limited due to differences in questions; and sampling methods used. Moreover, these rates are likely to be an underestimation of the true prevalence rates due to the fact is self-report data and also particularly for NIDDM, symptoms are minor and not likely to cause immediate medical consultation for diagnosis. 77. These health interview survey estimates tend to confirm what has been shown in previous literature and WHO estimates. Rates range from 2.0 in Netherlands and Norway to as high as 6.4 in Czech Republic. Variation existed across countries in terms of gender differences. Females experienced higher rates in countries like Czech Republic, Italy ,the Netherlands, Portugal while males ' prevalence rates were higher in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. Based on the age and sex specific rates of prevalence, across OECD countries, highest prevalence of diabetes are among the older age groups for males and females, starting at 45 years and older (Charts 6a and 6b). 78. WHO has been collecting information not only on prevalence of diabetes, but on impaired glucose tolerance \u2014which is an intermediate category of glucose tolerance. People with IGT have not been diagnosed yet with diabetes, but have been found to have high rates of ischaemic heart disease and have a higher risk of progressing to diabetes. In several studies, IGT prevalence also increased with age, and tended to comprise about 60 percent of the total population with glucose intolerance in general. Trends in prevalence over time 79. Studies have cited increases in prevalence in diabetes over the years (Laakso et al., 1991). Reasons behind this trend are likely an increase in incidence of diabetes coupled with a decrease in21mortality. Increases in incidence are likely to be due to better detection and screening techniques for diagnosing diabetes and reported increases in population considered to be obese and physically inactive, particularly among the older populations. Reduction in mortality rates is likely due to improved survival of diabetics and perhaps, this is a result of the better management and medical treatment of complications, in particular ischemic heart disease and stroke. CONCLUSIONS 80. Based on literature review of medical practice and epidemiological trends, research on diabetes might focus more closely on rates of complications due to diabetes and the variation of these rates acrosscountries. With information in hand, then a more qualitative assessment of different care models implemented by each country might help identify the different emphasis being placed on preventive vs. acute/curative interventions among these patients. Impact of these care patterns (e.g. coordination of care) on outcomes could then be explored. Reliance on more qualitative data might be needed since all treatment directed toward continuing management of the disease is delivered in the outpatient setting, wherequantitative data is not available. Further research might also focus on understanding barriers to access (coverage and cost sharing) and reimbursement on diabetic patients for outpatient consultations (particularly with chiropodists and dieticians) for prevention of complications as well as drug consumption (insulin therapies).22HIP FRACTURES AND OSTEOPOROSIS MEDICAL BACKGROUND Definitions, symptoms, and risk factors 81. Osteoporosis is broadly defined as \"a progressive systemic skeletal disease characterised by a low bone density mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. \" The study will focus primarily on what is called \"primary osteoporosis. \" This occurs most commonly in postmenopausal women (postmenopausal osteoporosis) or seen with no clear causal factors other than old age (senile osteoporosis). 82. The World Health Organisation has developed an operational definition for osteoporosis as well as the staging of reduced bone density for women. This initial criteria intends to target high risk women, to diagnose, and to monitor the course of confirmed and/or suspected osteoporosis by repeated measurements (Table 7). Two main thresholds have been identified: first, there is the threshold for those who are likely to develop osteoporosis and might benefit from preventive action at the time of menopause (osteopenia) andsecond, there is a definition of those who have been diagnosed with osteoporosis and are likely to experience a fracture in the future (osteoporosis). This definition applies only to women because the thresholds for men are less certain. 83. Though the underlying causes of osteoporosis are unclear, several risk factors have been identified along with reduced bone density. These factors include heredity or maternal family history of hipfracture, hormonal disturbances, weight or height reduction, sedentary life style, low body mass index, smoking and deficiencies in calcium. Osteoporosis may also be caused by other diseases such as rheumatic joint disorders or gastrointestinal disease as well as prolonged corticosteroid therapy. 84. Women experience higher incidences of hip fractures most likely as a result of a combination of lower peak bone mass at the time of maturity and the pronounced bone loss after menopause due to thelack of oestrogen production. Each year, it is estimated that women lose between 1 to 4 percent of their bone tissue during the first 10 years following menopause. Moreover, longer life expectancies among women may also be contributing to their higher risk to manifest osteoporosis. For women who are 50 years and older, the lifetime risk is estimated to be 17.5 percent for hip fracture; for men at the same age, the risk is estimated to be 6 percent (Melton, 1992). Men, on the other hand, still experience increasing bone losswith age, but just at a slower rate than women. Diagnosis and Treatment Diagnostic screening 85. Definition of osteoporosis rests on the fact that low bone density is a significant factor in predicting fracture risk. Meta-analysis studies have been conducted showing that bone mineral density (BMD) can predict fracture risk. It has been estimated that the risk of fracture approximately doubles for23each standard deviation decrease in bone mineral density (Kanis, 1997). This measurement, however, is not perfect in diagnosing osteoporosis and predicting fractures since these initial thresholds are not absolute and they cannot clearly distinguish between those who will have or will not have a fracture. People with normal values will often experience fracture, while those with high risk values may never experience one. 86. Along with the measurement of bone mineral density, a range of factors should additionally be considered in a comprehensive assessment for osteoporosis such as other abnormalities of the skeletal structure to diagnose osteoporosis. Sight, balance, and muscle strength may also be examined to determinewhether a person is prone to falling, particularly if they are older. At this time, bone mineral density tests are the only accurate and precise measurement of bone mass -- to either diagnose osteoporosis or to monitor improvements among patients already being treated for osteoporosis. 87. The measurement of bone density is conducted by densitometry using a range of technology described below (Table 8). These technologies have become more widely available in OECD countriessince the 1980s. The single energy x-ray absorptiometry (SXA) and dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) --the latter is the most adequate method for assessing bone density of the hip -- appear to be the techniques most widely used in OECD countries (Fraser, 1997, Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care, 1997). The main requirements needed for diagnosing low bone mineral content is high level of accuracy, reliability, rate of speed, and reasonable cost which single photon absorptiometry (SPA), SXA,and DXA largely meet. For screening and diagnosis, it is more important to have higher level of accuracy; while for monitoring changes due to treatment, it is more essential to have better precision. 88. At present, there is no universally accepted screening policy to examine bone density levels and to identify people at risk for complications of osteoporosis. In several reports and reviews of the effectiveness of bone density measurement conducted over recent years, consensus exists that bone densitymeasurement should not be recommended as a population screening tool. Although technical and diagnostic efficiency of densitometry have been well established, its ultimate result on therapeutic decision-making and patient outcome is still controversial. 89. At this time, the overlap in bone density measurement between normal and high risk values is so large that such a screening programme is likely to produce a high false positive rate -- in other words,sensitivity is low and the technique does not effectively exclude disease in healthy individuals. Therefore, the value and appropriateness of mass screening in terms of diagnostic strategy is left uncertain. In response, many advocate screening for a targeted older population who have experienced a previous fracture or who have high risk indications. This has been reflected in recent medical guidelines and protocols released in OECD countries. Medical Management and Drug Treatment of Patients with Osteoporosis 90. There are several recommended primary prevention interventions such as smoking cessation, exercise, well-balanced diet, and the intake of vitamin D and calcium for those who are at risk of having osteoporosis. In terms of secondary prevention, most of the medical management for osteoporosis is related to drug treatment and there are several medications available that have demonstrated favourable results in preventing bone loss. Three categories of drugs have been identified according to their purpose whether preventive or curative (Kanis, 1997). inhibitors of bone turnover which include estrogen with and without progestogens, estrogen derivatives, calcium, calcitonin, and biphosphonates;24 stimulators of bone formation which include fluoride and parathyroids; heterogeneous effects such as anabolic steroids, vitamin D, ipriflavone, and thiazide diuretics. They are all used for both secondary prevention and treatment. 91. More specifically, in terms of the inhibitors of bone turnover, women at risk of post-menopausal osteoporosis are often informed about oestrogen treatment or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Patients must weigh the risks and benefits of taking HRT. An interesting approach has been tested in the United States and Canada, and consists of offering women who are eligible for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to participate in a \"shared decision making \" program. This program uses decision analysis to model the risks and benefits for each individual contemplating taking HRT. Variation in the use of HRT for osteoporosis is likely to broad, reflecting differing patient preferences rather than derived from providers due to the lack of certainty in the evidence. 92. Treatment from 3 to 10 years has been shown to be effective in reducing the progression of bone loss and reducing the number of hip fractures by 30 to 50 percent. (Kiel, et. al., 1987; Paganini-Hill et. al., 1981; Grady et. al., 1992). Also, it has proven to have a protective effect against cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, there has been some debate that there is higher risk of breast cancer when HRT therapy is taken for prolonged periods. There are also risks of endometrial cancer, but to reduce the risks, it is suggested to take progesterone with the oestrogen therapy. 93. Alternate inhibitors of bone turnover -- such as calcium, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates-- are widely approved treatments across most countries. Calcium is used broadly as an alternate preventive treatment or in conjunction with HRT and other treatments; however, its principal effect is to decrease therate. Once osteoporosis has become a well-established diagnosis, calcitonin and bisphosphonates -- a newer class of drugs for osteoporosis -- are often used. Calcitonin prevents bone loss and has analgesic effects with some preliminary evidence demonstrating reduction in fractures (Kanis, 1992). Additionally, there are two types of bisphosphonates (ethidronate and alendronate) which are being widely used for treatment and some countries have also been using clodronate and pamidronate. This treatment is usedalong with calcium. In particular, alendronate has shown preliminary favourable results in increasing bone density over a three year period. (Kanis 1997). 94. Anabolic steroids are also used in osteoporosis in some countries to prevent bone loss and impact muscle mass among the frail elderly as well as vitamin D. They have also been reported to improve patients' general well-being. However, the anabolic steroids have not been universally approved. In countries where their use is restricted, they are commonly given in specialist centres. Drug utilisation across countries is likely to be highly variable across countries due to differences in drug registrations, physician prescribing habits and their perception of the need for a particular drug to effectively prevent or treat osteoporosis. (Reginster, 1996). 95. One other preventive intervention is the use of hip protectors for the frail elderly. Several recent studies have highlighted use of protective trochanteric padding to lower the risk for hip fracture from a fall. One Danish study reported that such padding provided a 53 percent reduction in hip fracture incidence, inspite of the low compliance rates among the study population. (Lauritzen, 1993). Continued monitoring of treatment through physical examinations and repeated bone mass measurement every couple of years should be conducted; however, there is lack of consensus of the frequency of such monitoring.25Acute Treatment 96. There are two general types of hip fractures: femoral neck and trochanteric. Trochanteric fractures tend to be more linked to osteoporosis and in OECD countries, the incidence of trochanteric fractures appears to be increasing faster than the incidence of femoral neck fractures. Hip fractures always result in hospitalisation for treatment of hip repair. For this reason, information on incidence, costs, and consequences are better documented. 97. There are two main types of procedures to repair the hip: primary prosthetic hip replacement, including unipolar, bipolar, and total hip replacement. open or closed reduction, with or without internal fixation. 98. Decisions of which procedure to use is highly dependent on whether the fractures are displaced and non-displaced. Non-displaced fractures are usually treated with open or closed reductions with or without internal fixation; while displaced fractures is the main indication for hip replacement. In the past, there has been some concern that hip replacement leads to greater mortality and morbidity. However, recently, some studies have been shown that hip replacement for displaced fractures yield lower reoperation and similar mortality rates to other less invasive procedures (Lu Yao, et. al., 1994). 99. In some reimbursement systems, there may be economic incentives to utilise the more favourably reimbursed procedure, such as hip replacement, even though this type of operation is not medically necessary. Variations may very likely highlight physician practice patterns and perhaps, uncertainty of which procedure is most effective for what indication. Health Outcomes 100. Hip fractures tend to carry significant burden in terms of morbidity and mortality because they occur in elderly patients. Short-term morbidity and mortality may occur due to complications of the surgical repair of hip fracture such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. Some countries have shown higher inpatient mortality or 30 day mortality after hip fracture rates than others and some studies have focused on the effects of waiting times on these outcomes and whether they explain any of these differences in mortality rates (Ho et. al., 1998, Roos et al. 1996) as measured by inpatient mortality, 30-day mortality and postsurgical length of stay. Ho et al. found that effect of wait time on post-surgery LOS is small in magnitude and reveals that waiting lines are not a predictor of post-surgery length of stay. 101. In terms of longer term morbidity, after suffering from a hip fracture, older people find it difficult to regain their previous functional capacity and are likely to experience poorer mobility and even becometotally dependent. As a consequence, there is a high risk of institutionalisation for further care and support. Some studies have found that about half of the previously independent elderly patients become partly dependent while, a third of these patients become totally dependent (Melton, 1996; Keene, 1993; and Kannus, 1996). 102. Along with the consequences of morbidity, there have also been indications of high mortality, as mentioned perioperatively and subsequently after a six-month or one-year period after the hip fracture. Because most patients suffering from hip fracture are older, there is also the problem of co-existingconditions and disentangling the effects of fracture from other comorbidities on the mortality rate. Various surveys demonstrate that between 12 and 40 percent of all hip fracture patients die within 6 months of the26time of the fracture and the mortality rate tends to be about 12 to 20 percent higher than similar older populations with no health problems (Sutton et. al. 1996). EPIDEMIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND Prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age in cross sectional data 103. Based on the WHO definition, the prevalence of osteoporosis varies from 16 percent to 30 percent of Caucasian women, depending on the number of sites (Kanis, 1994). Table 9 presents the estimates of proportion of women with bone density more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for women between ages 20 to 39 for the United States and Sweden. This describes the proportion ofwomen detected with osteoporosis, according to the WHO definition. Based on the data from these two countries, the prevalence of osteoporosis in women increases dramatically with age as expected. About 30 percent of the women aged 70 to 79 years in both Sweden and the United States have a value more than 2.5 SD below the mean value of women aged 20 to 39 years, meaning they are osteoporotic. In Sweden, 84% of women aged 70 to 79 were detected to have osteopenia or reduced bone mass based on the WHOdefinition, lower than 1 SD below the mean value. This information with regards to the proportion of at- risk women for osteoporosis would be beneficial in targeting for early diagnosis and management to retard its course before a fracture occurs. Cross sectional trends of the incidence of hip fractures 104. A first global overview can be offered at the world level (Charts 7a and 7b). In 1990, there were estimated to be about 1.26 million hip fractures occurring worldwide, of which 73 percent were in women. (Gullberg, 1997). Incidence of hip fractures increases exponentially with age -- particularly at age 60 -- in both sexes across these regions. Differences in incidence varied more dramatically for women than men across the regions. Northern Europe, North America and Oceania all show fairly high rates of incidence of hip fractures, while more intermediate rates exist in Western Europe and Eastern Europe. Asia and LatinAmerica as well as Southern Europe have much lower incidence of hip fractures. 105. Results from several country-specific and cross-national studies, primarily dependent upon discharge registers, parallel the regional trends described above (Table 10). The number of fractures and age-standardised incidence of hip fractures varies significantly across countries and even within countries. The highest rates of hip fractures have been found in Northern Europe, specifically the Scandinaviancountries: Sweden, Norway, Denmark as well as in North America. The observed risk for hip fractures in central Europe is less than the north, with the exception of Poland; and low in the southern European countries (Johnell et al., 1992 and Elffors et al., 1994 ). There is also a significant amount of geographical variation in incidence rates of hip fractures within countries between rural and urban areas. Rural areas tend to have significantly lower rates than the urban areas. (Maggi et al., 1991, Ray et al, 1990). In the MEDOS study, there was variation within countries, ranging from 1.7 fold in Spain, 1.3 fold in France, 1.8 fold in Italy to 1.6 fold in Turkey. 106. Women tend to experience a higher number of fractures than men at any age because of their lower bone mass at maturity and accelerated bone loss after menopause. In Table 10, the female/male ratios range from 0.87 in Korea to 2.9 in United States. Close to 60 to 80 percent of hip fracture patients are women with the exception of countries like Turkey, Poland and Korea where men and women were more or less equally affected or men were experiencing more fractures. Several cross-national studies havepresented differences varying 4-fold to 7-fold among men and as much as 11-fold among women. Differences in incidence between countries seem to be much more dramatic than between males and27females within a country. This signals that these differences may be more related to lifestyle, environment and genetic factors rather than the emphasis being placed on hormonal insufficiency in women. Variations in incidence rates of hip fracture over time 107. Comparisons over the last twenty to thirty years indicate that incidence of hip fractures has been rising in several countries. Many researchers have speculated that if these epidemiological trends persist, annual incidence of hip fractures could increase by more than 30 percent over the next 30 years and this rise will be even higher in light of the anticipated demographic changes. (Johnell et al., 1992). On the whole, between the early 1970s and the beginning of the 1990s, average annual increases in both womenand men for most countries ranges from 1 percent to as high as 7 to 10 percent in Northern Europe. With these increases in age, many studies to date have focused on trying to determine whether or not population ageing would led to a rapid rise in hip fractures. 108. For instance, Finland has found that the increases in fact are occurring more rapidly than can be accounted for by demographic changes and that the number of fractures are growing despite the decliningnumbers of elderly (Kannus, 1999; Parkkari, 1994 and 1999). Reasons for the true increases may be more related to changes in lifestyle, higher rates of tobacco and alcohol consumption, and decreased physical activity. However, the results from studies performed in the early 1970s should be examined carefully, since increases in incidence may be a result from the improvement of case ascertainment over time. 109. Though in many populations, increases in age-adjusted incidences have been documented ub 1960s to early 1980s, there have been some recent data indicating a tendency to slow or level off. Recent studies in Australia, the United Kingdom and the US, tend to show that the rates have been levelling off and in some cases, decreasing particularly for women, between the broad period of mid 1980s to more recent years (Melton, 1987, Lau, 1993, Spector, 1990, Lauritzen et. al., 1993. Naessen, et. al. 1989). But currently, there are no clear explanation for this trend and more research is needed to develop hypothesis about the factors contributing to this potential decline. Moreover, several studies have also demonstrated that relative increases over time have been much higher for men than women in recent years. In recent years, as a result of the more marked increase in men, the female: male ratio has been decreasing in many countries. Higher rates of increase among men could be attributable to their improving life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS 110. Based on the literature review conducted for this summary, two main issues have been identified that might direct a research strategy for the OECD study. First, in terms of monitoring osteoporosis, the study could examine what are the bone density screening policies across countries, and more specifically, the differences in utilisation and outcomes (e.g. bone density values and incidence of hip fractures) of such assessment across countries. This variation in diagnostic measurement across countries might also be analysed in relation to economic factors such as reimbursement and supply factors. Second, closer examination might also address utilisation patterns and costs for those patients with hip fracture, inparticular the types of surgical treatment being used, length of stay in hospital, and rate of institutionalisation, as compared to the particular incentives in different countries.28BREAST CANCER MEDICAL BACKGROUND Definitions, risk factors, and symptoms 111. Breast cancer is defined by the growth of malignant cancer cells originating in the tissue of the mammary gland. The most common type of breast cancer is invasive ductal cancer, found in the cells of the ducts, and it comprises 70 to 80 percent of all cases. 112. Age and family history of the disease, in particular having a first degree relative who developed breast cancer before the age of 50, has been identified as one of the leading risk factors of breast cancer. Inrecent years, there has been experimental work aimed at describing and identifying genes responsible for breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been found to cause the majority of genetically determined cases. (Porter et al, 1993) 1. There are several other risk factors for breast cancer which are primarily related to reproductive history: late age at first birth, nulliparity, early menarche, and late age at menopause. With recent trends in the decreasing age at menarche and the rising number of women having their first birth atolder ages in OECD populations, many have speculated that these changes have influenced the increasing incidence rates documented recently. 113. In the literature, there has been much discussion of whether oral contraceptive use among younger women and hormone replacement therapy offered to post-menopausal women can be considered factors associated with increased risk of breast cancer. One study demonstrated that long termpostmenopausal hormone replacement therapy use increases risk by approximately 2 percent per year of use (Pike et al., 1993a). Evidence has also pointed to positive associations between increased alcohol consumption, high fat diet, increased body size, a past history of benign breast disease, and exposure to ionising radiation with the risk for breast cancer. 114. Social and environmental factors, however, may be playing a more important role in increasing rates of breast cancer than genetic factors, contrary to previous thinking, based on some recent studies. Studies of Asian immigrant populations in the United States have demonstrated that breast cancer incidence rates have doubled within 10 years of arriving in the United States (Ziegler et al., 1993). Research in Japan, for instance, have also demonstrated slight increases in incidence, most likely due to the Westernised social and lifestyle influences such as more fatty diets and other dietary habits. 1. Genetic tests are available for detection of mutations in the BRCA 1 and BRCA2 genes. For those who have been identified with these mutations, there is possibility to prevent breast cancer with prohylactic mastectomy. Research is currently being conducted to assess the long term effectiveness of this procedure.(Schrag et al, 1997, Hartmann et al. 1999)29Diagnosis and Treatment Diagnostic Screening 115. There are three complementary methods available for early detection: breast self examination, clinical breast examination, mammography screening. 116. Clinical breast examination by physicians was most common in the 1970s ; while mammography screening became more utilised in the 1980s. Breast self examination at present has not been shown to be effective as a primary screening technique in reducing mortality and morbidity from breast cancer. Overthe years, mammography has demonstrated a distinct advantage over other methods of breast cancer detection because it can detect small tumours before they are detectable by women or the most highly trained clinician. This is of particular importance since the survival rates after diagnosis and treatment are much improved by the early detection of breast cancer and increased survival is directly related to the stage at diagnosis. Early detection of cancer will also offer a wider and more favourable range of treatment options for the patient. For example, in the Edinburgh trial, screened women were more likely to receive conservation therapy, as opposed to radical mastectomy, because of detection of cancer at an early stagewhen the tumour size was smaller (Roberts et al., 1989). 117. There is strong evidence that regular mammographic screening for women aged 50 to 69 years leads to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of 25 percent to 30 percent ten to 12 years later. (Austoker et al., 1994 and Nystrom et al., 1993, Kerlikowske et al., 1995). This effectiveness has not been clearly demonstrated for women between 40 to 49 years where reductions in mortality have not been significantand there has been more of a possibility of uncovering either too many false positives or missing malignant lesions. There is no confirmed evidence either for age group of 70 years and older. Key issues in terms of mammography screening are the appropriate age group and the optimal frequency of screening. 118. Based on this evidence, national breast cancer screening programmes have been organised and implemented in several OECD countries such as, Australia, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Finland,Luxembourg, and Sweden during the late 1980s and early 1990s. All of these population-based programmes generally offer mammographic screening for women over 50 years every 2 or 3 years until the age of 65 (Sancho-Garnier et al., 1993). 2 Studies have shown that rate of participation for these programmes tends to never reach 100 percent and is primarily dependent upon the age and socio-economic status of women. A problem of compliance has also been documented after the initial screening whereparticipation rates have shown a decline after several rounds of screening. There is fear that this phenonemon will adversely impact the potential benefit of screening. As a response, several countries have sought to develop means to encourage better participation through personal invitations. 119. Rates of participation in these screening programmes have been assessed for the EU countries through the Eurobarometer survey for 1995. (Table 11). Sweden has the highest participation rate for 2. Evaluation of Cancer Screening Programmes for Breast Cancer and Uterine Cervix in the EC was a study conducted in the European Community. The study 's objectives were to propose a methodological framework for the evaluation of epidemiological and economical aspects of organised screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer. (See Sancho-Garnier et al., 1993 and Fagnani, F. for discussionof economic aspects).30women between ages 50 to 59 and 60 to 69, at around 70 percent and 55 percent respectively (European Commission, 1997). The Netherlands and Denmark also have very high participation rates in both of these age groups. A strong North-South divide in Europe is present based on these estimates, with lower participation rates in the Southern European countries. In the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, levels of participation tend to be intermediate. 120. In the higher participation rate countries \u2014Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands, the upper limit for their target population is at much older ages, between 69 and 74 years of age, than many of the other EU countries, often stopping at age 64 or 65 (Sancho-Garnier et al., 1993). For the female populationover 70 years, the participation rates drop to an average of 11 percent for the EU countries studied, with Denmark having the highest rate at 45.5 percent. This decline in participation rates for the oldest age group is to be expected based on countries ' established upper age limit for screening at 65. Other diagnostic tests 121. If cancer is suspected, further testing to determine whether the lesion is malignant or not must be conducted such as aspiration cytology, core needle biopsy with a stereotactic or ultrasound technique for non-palpable lesions, or incisional or excisional biopsy. Current opinion on combined use of these diagnostic assessments varies, as well as setting of the procedures (ambulatory vs inpatient). Treatment and Management 122. Prognosis and treatment approach depends significantly on the stage of cancer, meaning whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes, other organs or to the other breast, the type, size and location of breast cancer, and the age of the patient. With increasing use of mammography screening, a type of breast cancer classified as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has been diagnosed and now constitutes 15 to 20 percent of all breast cancers. DCIS may present in mammography as a palpable mass or an symptomatic mammographic abnormality, and is usually classified as stage 0. Patients with DCIS tend to have a higherrisk for breast cancer in the future. 123. Majority of women tend to present at stage I and II which is considered early breast cancer. Stage I and II tend to be cancer confined to the breast tissue with or without spread to the lymph nodes on the same side as the tumour. At stage III and IV with more advanced breast cancer, women tend to present with more locally advanced disease with metastases to other organs. Table 12 offers an overview of thedifferent stages of breast cancer which can be diagnosed and the standard treatments by stage. 124. There are four types of traditional treatments being used for early breast cancer patients: primary treatment of the breast and lymph nodes to establish locoregional control of the disease; pathological assessment to determine need for adjuvant therapy; adjuvant therapy to prolong disease-free and overall survival; and followup. (Dey et al., 1997) 125. Treatment of breast cancer usually involves surgical treatment which consists of either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery. Mastectomy can be either: total or simple mastectomy which is removal of the whole breast, modified radical mastectomy --the most common surgery-- is the removal of the breast, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes part ofthe chest wall muscles;31 radical mastectomy--also called the Halsted radical mastectomy--is the removal of the breast, chest muscles, and all of the lymph nodes under the arm. For many years, this was the operation most used, but it is now only used when the tumor has spread to the chest muscles. 126. In recent years, with efforts to use less radical treatment in order to preserve quality of life, approaches have emerged to conserve as much breast as possible. Conservative treatment options are highly dependent upon the stage of cancer at diagnosis and usually offered for those with stage I or II. Breast conserving surgery is defined as: a lumpectomy --sometimes called excisional biopsy or wide excision-- is the removal of the lump in the breast and some tissue around it. It is usually followed by radiation therapy to thepart of the breast that remains. partial or segmental mastectomy which is the removal of the cancer as well as some of the breast tissue around the tumour and the lining over the chest muscles below the tumour. Inmost cases, radiation therapy follows this approach. 127. In recent years, breast conserving surgery with subsequent radiation therapy seems to have become the most standard treatment for the earlier stages of breast cancer. In early to mid-1980s, the frequency of breast conserving surgery rose significantly in many countries. For instance, in the UnitedStates, from 1976 to 1981, the rate of breast conserving surgery rose from 2.8 to 7.2 percent; while in the Netherlands, the rate increased more in late 1980s. (Munoz et al., 1986 and De Koning et al. 1994). United States, Canada, and France also have implemented shared decisionmaking programs to help women choose among different therapeutic options which is the one most consistent with their individual preferences based on available medical evidence. More and more evidence has demonstrated that survival is equivalentafter mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery in stage I and that breast conserving surgery with radiation improves disease-free survival. (Fisher et al., 1995). 128. Treatment of the lymph nodes has been shown to be effective either by surgery or by radiation therapy (Cabanes et al., 1992). In addition, at this management stage, pathological assessment of the tumour and lymph nodes must be conducted to determine whether hormones are affecting the growth ofcancer in the body and if so, adjuvant therapy will be part of the overall medical management. This has been shown to be effective in improving overall survival. (Early breast cancer trialists ' collaborative group, 1992). This meta-analysis demonstrated that tamoxifin 3 is effective in reducing recurrence and death in women with breast cancer over age 50; chemotherapy is effective in reducing recurrence and death for women under 50 and less effective in those over 50; a combination of chemotherapy drugs are moreeffective than one drug such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil agents. (Gelber, 1993). Additionally for older women, the analysis suggested that combining chemotherapy and tamoxifin may have greater impact on mortality reduction than just tamoxifen on its own. Follow-up for early breast cancer patients should be conducted, but optimal screening frequency is not established. 129. For the more advanced stages, there is less evidence for these patients in terms of the different therapies. First line drug therapy for patients with advanced breast cancer is hormone therapy; if hormone therapy fails, then chemotherapy is offered. Recently there has been discussion of biological therapies which use the body 's immune system to fight cancer such as bone marrow transplantation and peripheral 3. Tamoxifen is the most common therapy used today; however, alternate drugs are emerging such as raloxifene and vitamin A derivatives and these are often given to patients in the early stages of cancer. Higher risks for uterine cancer has been noted as possibly being associated with use of tamoxifen. It also has shown beneficial effects on bone density and cardiovascular disease. Most recent debate is focused onwhether tamoxifen should be given as a preventive treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer.32blood stem cell transplantation. At times, radiotherapy might be used for palliative purposes in the treatment of cancer where it has spread to other organs. 130. There appears to be much variation among OECD countries in the use of second line chemotherapy and this might be even more significant for provision among older women. While most OECD countries seem to use nearly equivalent regimens for the first line chemotherapy, the use of second line chemotherapy and possibly third line, after initial failure is highly variable due in part to supply and reimbursement factors. Health Outcomes 131. Health outcomes include two main categories: quality of life after onset of the disease and survival rates. Quality of life should be monitored and measured to assess the functional as well as psychiatric morbidity, particularly those women undergoing mastectomy. Those women who have had a mastectomy tend to have higher levels of mordidity due to mental health reasons. Less anxiety and depression seems to occur among those women who have had breast conserving therapy. Perhaps, betterwellbeing might result in the newer techniques of shared decisionmaking with the patients taking a more active role in choosing their treatment. Additionally in more advanced stages the treatment tends to be palliative to reduce symptoms and pain and at this point, a woman 's ability to do her daily activities might be more limited. Additionally, as a result of radiation and chemotherapy needed for treatment and management of breast cancer, it would be important to assess the level of any side effects based on theagents chosen to treat and the impact on functional ability and general well-being among these patients. 132. Survival rates measure the proportion of all patients still alive at a given point in time after diagnosis or after an intervention/treatment. Usually, survival time is defined as the \"elapsed time between diagnosis and death. \" (Verdecchia, 1996). Since it is linked with the diagnosis, the indicator can, in principal, more directly reflect care treatment, particularly if it is measured within a short time frame sincediagnosis or treatment. Survival rates might be the only measure amenable to international analysis, particularly with the availability of previous work conducted in the EUROCARE project and in national registries across OECD countries. The EUROCARE study presents relative survival rates 4 for breast cancer in selected European countries for the 1978-1989 period (Berrino, 1995). These results are based on 245,000 cases and 145,000 cases diagnosed during the period 1978-1985 and 1985-1989 respectively from42 cancer registries in 17 European countries. A common methodology was used and age, sex, and period- specific mortality were controlled. Breast cancer has more favorable survival rates than other cancers experienced by women: such as lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer. 133. From 1978 and 1989, most countries showed improvement in their five-year relative survival rates for breast cancer (Charts 8a and 8b). Several countries showed a steady upward trend in survival rates during this period such as Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Scotland, England, and the Netherlands with improvements of 4 to 9 percent, 14 percent for France and Italy and as high as 26 percent in Poland.(Quinn, et al., 1998) Others such as Switzerland maintained their already high level of five-year survival. Earlier detection and more effective therapies have contributed to these improvements in survival rates. Stage I tend to survive far longer on average than those who are diagnosed with tumours that have metastasized to distant organs. The rate of five-year survival is over 90 percent when the cancer is 4. Survival rates for cancer can be presented in two ways: observed rates and relative rates (Verdecchia, 1996). Observed rates are the proportion of all patients still alive at a given point in time after a certain diagnosis. Relative survival is the ratio of observed survival rate in the group of patients to the survival rate expected in a similar group from the general population. In the case of cancer, for example, relativesurvival rates may be more suitable since it accounts for the effect of non-cancer mortality.33localised within the breast (stage I), 75 percent when it has spread to adjoining areas (stage II/III), but below 20 percent when the cancer has reached other distant sites (stage IV). (Quinn et al., 1998). 134. However, survival rates did vary considerably by age. Survival rates for breast cancer patients tend to be better for women under age 50 than for older women. The EUROCARE study shows that survival was generally lower in women aged 55-64 years than under age 50, and declined further in those aged 65-74 years (Charts 9a and 9b), (Quinn et al, 1998). Women over 75 years had 6 percent lower rate of survival on average across European countries. Late diagnosis and comorbidities may explain lower rates of survival among older women, therefore, allowing only for palliative care. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND Cross-sectional variations in breast cancer incidence by country and age group 135. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, comprising 20 percent of all cancers worldwide (Parkin, 1997). Wide variation in breast cancer incidence across OECD countries exist, ranging from 87.53 per 100 000 females in the United States to 12.7 per 100 000 females in Korea in 1990(Chart 10). The highest age-standardised incidence rates of breast cancer for females are found in countries such as United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, while Korea, Mexico, and Japan have the lowest incidence rates. European countries tend to have intermediate incidence rates in the OECD context. Within Europe, rates of incidence demonstrate some variation, being much lower in the Southern European countries and higher in the Northern ones. Breast cancer incidence rates across OECD countries rise with age. After age 44, the rates begin to increase across most countries. Incidence is highest at age 65 and over for women, with rates at this age twice that of rates for those aged 44-54. The rates for women over 65 ranges from 29.1 per 100 000 females to 418.31 per 100 000 females. (Chart 11). Trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality by country over time 136. Over the past 20 years, breast cancer incidence rates have been increasing across countries, ranging from a 16 percent to 50 percent increase in selected countries where time series is available (Table 13). Increases may be due to the overall medical improvements in diagnosis and screening as well as better quality of collection of incidence statistics. Any impact of population-based mammography screening programmes will not be seen in this 1990 data since implementation occurred in late 80s and early 90s. These increases in incidence might also be due to temporal and cohort changes in the risk factorsof breast cancer outlined above. For example, the factors related to childbearing patterns such as early age of menarche, late age at first birth, and late menopause, where trends in the number of women having children at older ages has been increasing. (Fletcher et al). 137. In terms of mortality, rates have tended to increase over the past two decades in most OECD countries. In recent years, mortality has decreased or stabilised in some countries, in Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Jelfs, et al., 1996, Beral et al. 1995, Quinn et al., 1995, Gaudette et al., 1996) (see Table 13 for selected countries). However, these declines inbreast cancer mortality has impacted the younger population under 60 more than older age groups in most countries. This is likely due to the implementation of effectiveness interventions such as the use of screening and tamoxifen.34CONCLUSIONS 138. Based on the literature review on medical background and epidemiological trends in breast cancer, two main issues emerge as potential areas to be addressed in the OECD ageing-related study which are outlined in more detail in the paper. Why are older women presenting at more advanced stages? Is this due to screening policies in the countries? What are the established target ages and intervals for screening in OECD countries and is there any cost-effectiveness evidence in raising the upper age limit? Presentation at more advanced stages are likely to be contributing to lower survival rates for older females. But, is it that some countries treat older women with less aggressive or radicalcare due to presence of comorbidities or financial reasons? What are the different provisions of treatment for breast cancer for older women across countries?35CATARACT AND VISUAL IMPAIRMENT MEDICAL BACKGROUND Definitions, risk factors, and symptoms 139. Cataract is generally defined as an opacification or loss of transparency in the crystalline lens of the eye. The clinical conequences of such opacification of the lens is reduction of visual acuity. Symptomssuch as glare, intolerance of bright light, distortion of colours, and visual images might also occur, but is highly variable across patients, making diagnosis difficult. Usually it is not until visual function is significantly impaired or during retina treatment, that possibility of cataracts is recognised. 140. Several types of cataracts exist; in this study, the focus will be on those cataracts associated with ageing, also known as senile cataracts. Cataracts can be classified according to the stage of maturity:incipient being the earliest stage to hypermature being the most advanced (WHO, 1996). Classification of this type are useful for diagnosis and planning timely and adequate treatment for cataracts. If diagnosis is made during the mature and hypermature stages, delay in surgery may produce a deleterious effect and other complications such as secondary glaucoma may arise. 141. The underlying causes of the formation of cataracts is relatively unknown. Increased age appears to be the most important factor. Additionally, women appear to be more at risk for cataracts than men (Javitt et al., 1996). In terms of modifiable risk factors, there are several life style, nutrition, andenvironmental factors (e.g. sunlight exposure) which appear to be playing a role in cataract formation. Increased risk has been identified among heavy smokers and alcohol drinkers. Diabetes has also been highlighted as a significant risk factor for cataracts in people between ages of 40 to 60 years and carries a relative risk of three or four times that of the non-diabetic population (NHS, 1997). Additionally, the use of steroids are being studied regarding their possible increased risk of cataract formation. Diagnosis and Treatment Prevention and Diagnostic Testing 142. There is no established means of preventing the development of cataracts or the progression of blindness at this time. In recent years, there has been some research pointing to some primary prevention approaches such as vitamin C and E supplements and dietary carotenoids which may reduce thedevelopment of cataracts. 143. In terms of diagnosis and testing preoperatively to identify an operable cataract, no single valid and appropriate test has yet been established and recommended. In recent years, new preoperative tests have been emerging; however, the traditional and the new screening techniques have not been comprehensively evaluated for routine screening for healthy populations or for examining indications forpotential referrals to surgery. There are several types of preoperative eye examinations to test for projection of light and reaction to light, appearance of the pupil, and testing of the red reflex. Recent national and international surveys have identified a series of preoperative ophthalmic tests as presented in Table 14 (Bellan et al. 1997, Bass et al., 1995, Steinberg et al., 1994, Espallargues et al. 1997).36144. Table 14 presents the ophthalmic preoperative tests according to groups ranking whether the scientific evidence has been provided. Group A tests have been indicated and deemed appropriate; while Group B and C have inadequate or negligible evidence of their benefit. 145. In recent national studies, the most routine and frequently used tests were those in Group A such as dilated fundus examination and refraction which assist in determining the significance of the cataract on a patient's visual function, as well as A-scan ultrasonography to calculate intraocular lens (Bellan et al., 1997, Espallargues et al, 1997, Bass et al., 1997). While other tests in Group C based on Table 14. such as Color vision testing, contrast sensitivity testing, B-scan ultrasonography, etc. were rarely used most likelybecause they have not be indicated preoperatively either based on evidence or lack of consensus among the medical profession. 146. More variability is evident with the use of tests in Group B, such as potential acuity measurement, glare testing, visual field testing, and specular microscopy within Canada as well as compared to the United States and Barcelona, Spain (Bellan et al., 1997, Espallargues et al. 1997, Bass etal., 1997). This trend is understandable since it is not yet clear of the specific value and benefit of these tests in routine management of cataract patients. Some studies have shown that higher rates of utilisation of these tests in Group B tend to occur among opthalmologists performing surgery in private offices or ambulatory surgical centres rather than hospitals and among those performing higher volume of the procedures (Steinberg et al., 1994 and Bellan et al, 1997). Differences in patterns of the use of diagnostictests across countries, moreover, are likely to reflect different standards in community, reimbursement and incentives, and the type of selected surgery. Criteria and Indications for Surgery 147. Criteria for surgery are related to patient 's symptoms, level of visual acuity in the worse and better eye, rate of deterioration, and cataract morphology. However, there is much variation as to howcriteria is applied and the threshold used to approve of surgery across countries and over time. For instance, in Denmark, mean visual acuity of patients identified for cataract extraction was higher in 1992 than 1980, from 0.04 to 0.16 in the worse eye (Norregaard et al., 1996). The trend in Denmark was similar to a trend in the United States documenting that the threshold for surgery was shifting more and more towards targeting patients for surgery at an earlier stage of the disease. (Moorman et al, 1990). These dataare confirmed in results from the International Cataract Surgery Outcomes Study, where similar indications for cataract surgery were found in the US and Denmark. More restricted thresholds in terms of mean visual acuity were found in Canada and Barcelona. (Norregaard et al. 1998). 148. Reasons for the changing clinical indications and thresholds have been speculated. Some researchers believe that the shift towards the use of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and intraocular lenses and the accompanying positive benefits has spurred opthalmologists to guide patients to surgery at an earlier stage. Another factor might be better diagnostic techniques in identifying patients withcataracts. Additionally, the older population has become more active and therefore, has been demanding better visual function than before. Surgical treatment 149. The main intervention to treat cataract is surgery where the cataractous lens is actually removed to restore unimpeded light transmission to the retina. There are two components to the treatment: first,removal of the lens, and second, the correction of the ensuing refractive error. Two main types of surgical techniques have traditionally been used : intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) which involves the removal of the entire lens within its capsule, but is not generally practiced today; and extracapsular cataract37extraction (ECCE) where only the posterior capsule is left in situ and only the lens is removed intact with the remaining cortical material aspirated (WHO, 1996). 150. In OECD countries, there have been changes in the adoption of the new advanced techniques for treating cataracts. Between 1980s and 1990s, ECCE was used increasingly as the most common technique, shifting away from ICCE. In terms of further optical correction, there has been parallel movement to use intraocular lens implants behind the iris in adjunct with ECCE rather than traditionally using aphakic spectacle lenses. Studies have shown that ECCE with intraocular implants has become a treatment approach which provides for an improved post-operative visual rehabilitation (Immonen et al., 1996) andhas been reported to be used routinely in developed countries (see below). 151. In more recent years, a more advanced technique--called phacoemulsification--has emerged, which uses ultrasound to break down the nucleus and extract the nucleus and the lens through a thin cannula. Adoption of this technique varies greatly across the OECD countries. Several studies have begun to document these changes in patterns and variations in surgical techniques as well as anesthesia andpostoperative care within and across countries (Schein et al., 1994; Bass et al., 1996; Norregaard et al, 1997). 152. The International Cataract Outcomes Study is a research project examining the differences in the management of cataract across four countries: United States, Canada, Denmark and Spain (Barcelona). (Norregaard et al., 1997). The four countries under study were at very different stages of adopting the mostadvanced cataract treatment, phacoemulsification. The United States had the highest rates of use of phacoemulsification at 78.4 percent, followed by Canada (63%), Denmark (35%), and Spain (5%). The study also measured the utilisation rate of ECCE, where Spain appeared to use this technique the most frequent at 91 percent, followed by Denmark (65%), Canada (36 percent), and United States at 13 percent. From the study, it was clear that ICCE is no longer used in routine treatment for cataracts. Interestingly,surgeons more likely to use phacoemulsification tended to be those who were more likely to report higher surgical volumes in Canada (Bellan et al. 1997). This similar trend was also found in a U.S. study (Schein et al, 1994). Variation in the use of these two techniques may likely be associated with provider characteristics rather than the patients ' indications. 153. The rate of cataract surgery and its associated costs has increased considerably in many countries over the past decade. For instance, in Australia, the number of cataract extractions has increased by 2.6 times between 1985 to 1994 and IOL implants have increased by 2.9 times over the same period. Other countries have documented similar increases. Possible explanations for this increase range from the growing numbers of older people to changing indications for cataract surgery due to the advancements in modern technology, greater patient demand, and financial incentives. Growing inclination to perform extraction in the second eye in recent years may be contributing to these increasing rates of cataract surgery. 154. However, because of recent concerns over health care expenditures, much attention has been placed on how to save resources without impacting the quality of care and in turn, causing negative outcomes. One example of this is the move to perform cataract extractions as a day case. Since the mid- eighties, a growing number of extractions are being performed on an outpatient basis and in private clinics across countries rather than as an inpatient procedure requiring hospitalisation or an overnight stay. Thisshift has been most dramatic in the United States--currently with the highest percentage use of ambulatory surgical centers for cataract extractions with 40 percent according to the International Cataract Outcomes Study. Additionally, increased use of local anesthesia and other less intensive approaches have been reported (Norregaard et al., 1997) Plus, there has been questions of the added value of cataract surgery on the second eye in terms of improved visual acuity and its impact on clinical and physical function. In some38countries--such as United States, less coverage and reimbursement for second eye cataract surgery has been discussed. 155. Many countries with publicly funded universal health systems have waiting lists for surgery such as cataract extraction. With the increasing demand for cataract surgery, waiting lists have grown very long. In recent years, countries such as Sweden and New Zealand have taken steps to set criteria standards or maximum waiting time guarantee in an effort to expand access to care. As patients with cataract waits for diagnosis and treatment, some speculate that the severity of their condition is likely to increase, as well as the risks of reduced quality of life or perhaps injury associated with lower vision function. For cataractpatients, the waiting time between referral to hospital and the subsequent surgery is the most important interval as well as the outpatient wait \u2014referral to specialist such as ophthalmologist. Health Outcomes 156. Cataract surgery has been shown to be highly effective in improving visual acuity (Williams et al. 1994), particularly since the introduction of intra-ocular lenses. Traditionally, the main outcome forcataract surgery was primarily assessed with the Snellen visual acuity measurements and the change in visual acuity after a certain period of time after the surgery. However, it has become clear that visual acuity is an inadequate measure alone and that other measures should be developed to measure functional disability, quality of life, degree of independence and satisfaction. Particularly in older people, visual impairment may cause them loss of independence. 157. There have been some disease-specific instruments to measure functional impairment caused by cataract over the years which employ a visual functioning index such as the VF-14, Activities of Daily Vision Scale, Vision-related Sickness Impact Profile and Catquest (Steinberg et al, 1994, Mangione et al, 1992, Lundstrom et al, 1997). These instruments have identified a set of items related to visual activities to evaluate their level of visual functioning and its impact on their daily activities. 158. There are also several clinical outcomes which can be monitored to assess for any surgically- related complications. Complications can occur such as infectious endophthalmitis and retinal detachment, capsule rupture, and posterior capsule thickening \u2014one of the most common long term complication from cataract surgery which can compromise ultimate visual function. This latter complication can be treated by capsulotomy. These complications and subsequent treatment are likely to cause pain, additional resourcesin terms of further treatment and hospitalisation as well as possibly lead to a worsened outcome. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND Cross sectional variation of visual impairment, blindness, and blindness due to cataracts 159. As OECD populations age, there is an urgent need to plan for provision and delivery of eye care and treatment for cataracts. However, there is very little data on the prevalence of blindness or low vision and number of new cases of cataracts across OECD countries. It should be understood that the available data is not highly comparable due to definitional issues and criteria of blindness, low vision and evencataract. WHO has proposed definitions of blindness and visual impairment which are now included in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, and Related Health Problems , tenth revision. (Thylefors et al., 1995) 5 But, these definitions have not been evenly applied across countries. 5. Blindness is defined as visual acuity of less than 3/60 (0.05) or corresponding visual field loss in the better eye with best possible correction (visual impairment categories 3, 4, and 5 in ICD-10). Low vision corresponds to visual acuity39160. Blindness associated with specific causes is also not easily available. In particular, cataract is defined differently. Definition of cataract ranges from presence of lens opacities to a lens opacity that causes or is associated with loss of visual acuity to functional consequences of lens opacification for everyday activities. 161. Based on the presented data available from WHO in Table 15, prevalence of blindness - defined mostly as <3/60-- ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 percent in most OECD populations. Much of this data is based on population surveys which provide some estimates on the prevalence of blindness. Most studies during the 1990s demonstrated significant increase in the prevalence of impaired vision with increasing age (Klaver etal., 1998, Tielsch et al, 1990, Klein, et al. 1991. For example, in a recent population-based study in the Netherlands, applying the WHO definition of blindness, the prevalence of blindness ranged from 0.1 percent in subjects aged 55 to 64 years to 3.9 percent in subjects aged 85 years or older (Klaver et al., 1998). Prevalence of visual impairment ranged from 0.1 percent to 11.8 percent respectively for the 55 to 64 years and the 85 years and older. 162. Most of these studies found cataract to be one of the three leading causes of visual impairment and blindness for the older populations over 75.(Klaver et al., 1998, Attebo et al., 1996, Klein et al, 1996). In the United States, despite the high rates of cataract surgery with over a million extractions per year, there is still high prevalence of cataracts, particularly among the older populations. This highlights that there are still a fair amount of unoperated cataracts that are leading to visual impairment and/or blindness.Table 16. offers a comparison of estimated prevalence rates from the four available studies in the United States. The prevalence of cataract ranges from approximately 2 percent in the younger age groups to up to 45 percent at ages 75-85. (Javitt et al., 1996). There is also evidence from the United States that cataract is one of the leading causes of blindness among the older institutionalised population. Blindness was 13 to 15 times higher among nursing home residents than among non-institutionalised persons of the same age, sex,race, and background. (Tielsch, 1995). CONCLUSIONS 163. Based on this review, there appears to be little known about effective prevention programmes for cataracts and the only treatment for cataract is surgery. The main focus of the OECD ageing-related diseases is to explore the phenomenon of rising rates of cataract surgery across OECD countries withparticular attention paid to the differences in the adoption and practice of the type of surgery used (ECCE vs. phacoemulsification), the setting of the surgery (ambulatory vs. inpatient) and related costs. Possible reasons behind these rising rates of cataract surgery might be examined more fully such as changing thresholds for surgery, greater patient demand, growing older population, financial incentives, supply factors, access issues (e.g. waiting list and insurance coverage). Additionally, the associated costs and outcomes of cataract surgery might be collected to make cross-national comparisons. of less than 6/18 (0.3) but equal to or better than 3/60 (0.05) in the better eye with best possible correction (visual impairment categories 1 and 2 in ICD-10).40REFERENCES ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASES Berlin JA et al.

Overview of type of bone density measurement methods Type of method Indications, Advantage/disadvantage Single-energy absorptiometry: Single photon absorptiometry (SPA) and single energy x-ray absorptiometry (SXA)These methods measure bone mineral at peripheral sites such as the heel and wrist, but are not adequate for lumbar spine and proximal femur regions. Single photon absorptiometry (SPA) has beenreplaced by single energy x-ray absorptiometry(SXA) currently. SXA is reasonable in terms of cost, low radiation exposure, short scanning time (below 5 min), high accuracy (9%) and precision(0.5-1%). Dual-energy absorpitometry These techniques are more adequate for lumbar spine and proximal femur. DXA tends to meet mostrequirements more adequately than DPA. Dual photon absorptiometry (DPA) Long scanning time, and high cost and less precise and accurate than DXA, and need for frequentreplacement of isotope source. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) Reduced scanning time (3 to 10 minutes), result in low radiation exposure (10 to 30 uSv), accurate(error rate of 4 to 8 percent) and precise (error rateof 1 to 3 percent), relatively high capital costs. Quantitative computed tomography(QCT)Can be expensive, low precision with high radiation dose for the spine and longer measurement time.However, it can measure the porous and compact areas of the skeleton separately so measuring density in a true physiological sense. Ultrasound evaluation of bone No exposure to radiation; may be useful for diagnosis but not recommended in monitoring treatment. Can measure bone elasticity as well asthe density. Studies are needed to validate thistechnique further. Several radiographic techniquesincluding radiographic densitymeasurements at the bandMay be valuable for screening, but less well- validated.

Stages and Treatments for Breast Cancer Stages Description Treatment based on stage Stage 0 Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS: also known as intraductal carcinoma)Goal is local control of disease. DCIS treatment can be one of the following: total mastectomy; breast-conserving surgery with post- operative radiation to discourage recurrence depending onwhether it is symptomatic or asymptomatic. (Holland et al., 1994) Under clinical evaluation is lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy w. or w/o hormone therapy to prevent recurrence. Stage I/ Stage IIStage I. Tumour confined to breast, less than or equal to 2 centimeters in greatest dimension; Stage II. Tumour is no larger than 2 centimeters but has spread to the lymph nodes under the arm(the axillary lymph nodes) or tumour is between 2 and 5 centimeters (from 1 to 2 inches). The cancer may or may not have spread to the lymphnodes under the arm or tumour is larger than 5 centimeters (larger than 2 inches) but has not spread to the lymph nodes under the arm.Goal is locoregional control of disease and prolongation of disease-free and overall survival. (Harris et al., 1992) Breast-conserving surgery to remove only the cancer and surrounding tissue such as lumpectomy or partial orsegmental mastectomy. Followed by radiation. Lymph nodes might be removed for pathological assessment. Total mastectomy or modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection. Reconstructive surgery may be undertaken at the time of the primary surgery or as a delayed procedure. Same long-term cure rates for either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery. (Fisher et al. 1989, Lichter et al., 1992, Veronesi et al. 1981) Adjuvant therapy aims to prolong survival in terms of chemotherapy or hormone therapy (tamoxifen) if ER- positive. Usually initiated within 6 weeks. For ER-negative, adjuvant chemotherapy for selected patients. Stage IIIA/BStage IIIA: Tumour is more than 5 centimeters with positive underarm lymph nodes or tumour with is smaller than 5 centimeters andhas spread to the lymph nodes under the arm, and the lymph nodes are attached to each other or to other structures. Stage IIIB: Tumour has spread to tissues near the breast (skin or chest wall, including the ribs and the muscles in the chest) or tumour has spread to lymph nodes inside the chest wall along the breast bone.Goal is to control local disease and to prolong overall survival. In operable cases, either modified radical or radical mastectomy. If there is high risk of recurrence, radiation therapy given after surgery. Chemotherapy with or without hormone therapy given with surgery and radiation therapy. If lymph nodes are fixed or tumour too large, neoadjuvant chemotherapy might be needed to shrink tumour before surgery and/or radiation. Stage IV Tumour has spread to other organs of the body, most often the bones, lungs, liver, or brain. Or tumour has spread locally to the skin and lymphnodes inside the neck, near the collarbone.Goal with disseminated breast cancer is palliative and to reduce symptoms. Treatment includes radiation therapy or in some cases, a mastectomy to reduce symptoms. Also, hormonal therapy with or without surgery to remove the ovaries and chemotherapy.
