Final Report pg. i Executive Summary Project Background and Objectives To combat prostitution and human trafficking for th e purpose of sexual exploitation, criminal justice interventions and collaborative programs have emerged that focus on reducing demand for commercial sex. In a prior study, Abt Associ ates found that the use of anti-demand approaches was more widespread throughout the United States than previously thought. We also found that little research or descriptive information was available about the vast majority of interventions. It was also evident that communities attempting to address de mand had usually done so with little guidance from the collective experience of others; consequently, some initiatives had struggled or failed when faced with problems that had been solved elsewhere. In October 2008 the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) awarded a grant to Abt Associates Inc. to conduct a study, entitled A National Assessment of Sex Traf ficking Demand Reduction Efforts , intended to fill these gaps. The project was designed to develop a descriptive overview of anti- demand tactics employed throughout the United Stat es and to provide practitioners with actionable information to assist them in starting, improving, or sustaining initiatives. To share what has been learned, the project has generated several key products, one of which is the present report, A National Overview of Prostitution an d Sex Trafficking Demand Reduction Efforts , which summarizes the research activities and presents findings. Others include a website, entitled DemandForum.net, designed to expand upon the overvie w provided in this report and to provide assistance to practitioners and others in the form of information about the range of models and program structures implemented, obstacles face d, and how they can have been overcome. The website launch is planned for May, 2012. In addition to these produc ts, we have engaged in a number dissemination activities such as conference presentations and policy leader briefings. After the project has been completed, we will continue dist ributing information via the website and submission of manuscripts for publication in appropriate outlets. Purpose and Structure of this Report This report is designed to provide a descriptiv e overview of initiatives targeting the demand for commercial sex in the United States. It describes the process of gathering the information in this (and other) reports, discusses specific initiatives, and high lights selected communities to illustrate how and why their members have endeavored to address prostitution and sex trafficking by combating demand. The report is intended to serve as an introduction for those considering applying anti- demand tactics in their communities, and for those at the state government level who are considering policies, statutes, and infrastructure investments supporting local efforts. Those wishing to take more concrete steps towa rd planning, implementing, or improving existing programs will find additional information on the webs ite, where they can selec t from a wider range of information that best fits their specific needs. The website is the best means of disseminating to practitioners and policymakers the voluminous and va ried information collected. Websites have well- known advantages over static reports in terms of fl exibility, currency, the ability to convey large amounts of information in a way that does not overwhelm users, and allows users to access just the content of interest to them.

Final Report pg. ii We begin the present descriptive report with a discussion of prostitution and sex trafficking, the problems they pose for individuals and communitie s, and why a growing number of communities have elected to address these problems by focusing on the buyers of illegal commercial sex. We provide an overview of commercial sex markets, and the role of demand in driving both prostitution and sex trafficking. We describe the steps taken to gather data about anti-demand initiatives, and then present a typology and an overview of prevalence, key features, and history. We then present descriptions of several communities and their effo rts to launch and sustain initiatives designed to reduce or eliminate prostitution and sex trafficking by combating demand. A number of appendices provide supporting documentation a nd more detail about important point s. The website will expand the presentation much further, and will include checklists and capsule descriptions of the over 825 cities and counties known to have used anti-demand tactics, along w ith documentation and third-party reports relevant to each community's efforts. The research described in the report was sponsored to contribute to an ongoing process of gathering information on practices targeting demand for commercial sex. The intent was to develop for the first time a national picture of current and historical pr actices that will lay a foundation for further inquiry, and to gather and disseminate actionable inform ation for practitioners. While the reports are necessarily static and will become dated, the website is a \"living document,\" frequently refreshed as additional information is acquired. Input from the field of practiti oners, advocates, policymakers, and researchers will be actively encouraged. Given that the study's scope is broad, the National Assessment project necessarily included examination of many topics, but could not report exhaustively on every topic studied in a single report. Not all of the issues worthy of attention co uld be covered sufficiently in this report if the length was to be reasonable, but we expect info rmation to continually accr ue and will make it available on the website. For this report we prio ritized practices that are: (a) established as (or approaching the status of) evidence-based practice; (b) being implemented or actively considered by many communities; (c) controversial and the subject of debate among policymakers and practitioners; or (d) represent innovations or variations on basi c models of demand reduction initiatives. Guided by these criteria, we have emphasized reverse sti ng operations, shaming, and john schools in our research and reporting, although we also describe in detail the full range of practices we encountered. For each type of tactic, we describe not only the basic models, but variati ons and innovations, and present available evidence of effectiveness. Data Collection To assemble the information necessar y to pursue the project objectives, we utilized a number of data collection activities, beginning with compiling a pre liminary typology of interventions and a list of cities and counties identified as having some form of sex trafficking or prostitution demand reduction activity. We then conducted a survey and phone interviews with program and agency staff and stakeholders, and site visits that included program observations and in-person interviews. The steps involved, and the data collected, included: Reviews were conducted of research and evaluation literature (including books, journal articles, and technical reports); news reports ; program descriptions and other materials. o Web searches for reports about interventions used to combat demand were conducted daily for over three years.

Final Report pg. iii o The reviews resulted in the collection of over 4,000 source documents. o Program documents were collected about all known types of demand reduction interventions. Documents include: Tactical plans for reverse stings; city ordinances; memoranda of understanding; program ag endas; john school curricula; speaking points for public education presentations; the text of decoy advertisements used in web-based reverse stings; program summaries and reports; agency press releases; and prostitution exclusion zone maps. Questionnaires were sent to 500 sites . o Of these sites, 121 were targeted for more intensive follow-up. o The sites were flagged as bei ng of particular interest for any one of several reasons, such as being a pioneer in the use of a tactic, or having innovative or high-profile programs that have served as models for other sites. We also targeted sites to ensure our sample contained communities of various sizes, and to ensure we interviewed people at sites with each of the types of tactics identified. Completed questionnaires were received from 241 respondents at 199 sites. Two hundred twenty-two interviews were conducted with respondents at 75 sites. Through questionnaires and/or interviews, information was gathered from 274 respondents having the following breakdown of affiliations: 194 police and sheriff's departments 20 city and county prosecutor's offices 17 NGOs focused on prostitution and human trafficking 13 NGOs providing broad-spectrum social services and support 6 private counseling practices 6 public health departments 5 city/county government (e.g. mayor's offices, city services departments) 5 neighborhood organizations 11 \"other\" (community courts , probation departments, universities, Weed & Seed programs) Eleven site visits were conducted: o Atlanta, GA; Cook County, IL; Indiana polis, IN; City, City, AZ; Portland, OR; San Diego, CA; Tucson, AZ; Worcester, MA John schools were observed at five sites: o Indianapolis, IN; Norfolk, VA; Phoenix, AZ; San Diego, CA; and Worcester, MA. o Observations of a sixth john school - Firs t Offender Prostitution Program (FOPP) in San Francisco, CA - were conducted for a prior Abt Associates study, and this report contains some coverage of what was learned about that program. At the time this report was drafted, a total of 826 U.S. cities and counties had been identified as having employed at least one kind of anti-demand tactic at some point in time. o New sites are identified periodically; for an updated list of sites, please visit the Demand Forum website. Information was gathered on over 3,200 rever se stings resulting in over 33,000 arrests. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. iv Key Findings Findings from Literature Review Market Forces. The illicit markets of prostitution and sex trafficking are, like any other markets, driven by demand. Wherever de mand occurs, supply and distribution emerge. While it may be an oversimplification to say th at demand is the sole cause or influence on markets, and that there are feedback m echanisms and interactions among these three main components, it is indisputable th at removing or reducing demand reduces or eliminates markets. The need for people to provide a \"supply\" and for pimps and traffickers to \"distribute\" the supply to bu yers would not exist without demand. The historic emphasis on interfering with supply a nd distribution systems has been ineffective at producing substantial and l asting reductions in illegal commercial sex markets. Given that people are the commodity exploited, supply is difficult to contain. Distribution is also difficult to contain: since the markets are highly profitable, arrested traffickers and pimps are soon replaced. Distribution requires relatively little skill, and supply is plentiful and easily acquired, presenting few barriers to entry or startup costs for pimps and traffickers. Limitations of Focusing on Supply. Efforts to reduce prostitution and sex trafficking by constraining supply have not usually been successful, aside from temporary effects or displacing markets to other areas. Where demand is strong, interfering with supply chains usually results in shifting to other s ources or other means of distribution. The \"service gap\" is too great to close by addressi ng supply only. Conservative estimates of the number of victims of sexual exploitation and sex trafficking are in the tens of thousands nationwide, while fewer than 100 beds in residential treatment or shelters are known to exist that are designed specifically to serve survivors of prostitution or sex trafficking. Massive increases in victim services would still leave the majority of survivors un-served. While it is necessary and just to assist survivors, and expansion of those services is acutely needed, the interven tions are not designed to prevent or reduce the occurrence of exploitation. Difficulty Addressing Distribution. A very small portion of pimps and traffickers are ever arrested, due in large part to relian ce upon frightened and/or reluctant survivors to make cases against their abusers. The rare instances where pimps and traffickers are taken out of action may cause short-term interr uptions, but they are likely to be replaced as long as demand remains strong and there is profit to be made. Demand Reduction is Primary Prevention. Primary prevention refers to stopping negative events before they occur, ensuring that people do not become afflicted rather than addressing the symptoms of the afflictions that have occurred. The majority of effort to confront prostitution and sex trafficking in the United States has been devoted to tertiary or secondary approaches (trying to stem the progression of a problem, or recover from an affliction after it has occurred); while relatively little investment has been made in primary prevention (attacking consumer-level demand). Evidence of Effectiveness of Interventions Targeting Demand. When compared to evidence of the effectiveness of interven tions addressing supply and distribution in curtailing commercial sex markets, evidence supporting the impact of demand-reduction initiatives is relatively strong. There is very little in the way of an empirical case for This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Final Report pg. v supply- or distribution-focused interventions produce more than temporary suppressions or displacement. Evidence that anti-demand tactics (or comprehensive approaches that include addressing demand) can effectively suppress commercial sex markets is slowly accumulating and is robust in relation to evidence of the effectiveness of other approaches. However, formal evaluations ar e still confined to evaluations of a few anti- demand approaches implemented in a few locations. While the logical case for the efficacy of addressing demand and the histori cal record of intervening in other illicit markets (e.g., illegal drugs) lends credence to the accumulating data and anecdotal accounts from the field, it is premature to make broad conclusions about the value of most tactics or program models. Brief summaries of several studies and field reports addressing anti-demand initiatives - or those including a demand component - are provided below. The main types of evidence that have been produced are: (a ) formal program evaluations with quasi- experimental designs, (b) assessments of key descriptive indicators using pre- and post- intervention designs, and (c) informal observati ons of effects of interventions. Of these three types, the first is generally the strongest , the last is usually the weakest and is best characterized as anecdotal, and the middle option usually falls in between quasi- experimental and anecdotal methods in terms of producing credible evidence. 1 There are several general limitations that a re important to consider in reviewing the research and anecdotal evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing demand. One of the key limitations is that some of the interventions are multifaceted, making it difficult to isolate wh ether any observed effects were produced by the anti-demand components of the program, or by other program activities. Some of the interventions address supply as well as de mand, so that when a positive finding is observed one cannot be certain which of the two components were r esponsible. Another limitation is that most of the studies and reports based on police tracking data summarized below address have not controlle d for other influences on prostitution or trafficking markets, making it difficult to assess whether any observed effects were produced by the programs or by something else. It is possible that the positive results of most of the interventions listed below c ould have been artifacts resulting from other events unrelated to the interventions, the result of facets of the interventions other than those that addressed demand, or could be due to displacement. An exception is the evaluation of San Francisco's FOPP, which ex amined the influence of a focused demand- reduction intervention and could account for exogenous influences and potential displacement effects (Shively et al., 2008). Another exception is the Weisburd et al (2006), which was a tightly-controlled field e xperiment that accounted for displacement effects and exogenous influences; however, that study addressed supply as well as demand. While there is strong evidence that the experimental program produced an effect, inferences about the tactics addressing demand are confounded by the simultaneous interventions addressing supply. 1 These are general statements about the strength of evidence produced by categories of study designs. There can be great variation in the quality of information produced by studies within each type, and quality is dependent upon a number of factors. Stronger types of research designs can produce weak evidence if (a) they are executed poorly, (b) the design does not fit the data, program assessed, or the research questions, (c) the available data are of insufficient quality to su pport the research design, or (d) the data are not analyzed using the statistical methods appropriate for the data, design, and research questions. Assessing the credibility of study findings must be done on a case by case basis. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. vi It is important to keep such limitations in mind when reviewing the evidence of effectiveness, and not to assume that any of the aforementioned positive results represents unassailable, definitive evidence of a positive impact. Bearing in mind those limitations, positive findings were found in sev eral formal evaluations and in reports from police agencies relying on tracking data. Results from Formal Evaluations: o San Francisco john school reduced recidivism by over 40%. In an NIJ- sponsored evaluation of the FOPP, it was found that the annual one-year recidivism rate for arrested johns fell from 8.8 percent to 4.5 percent after the program began operating (Shively et al., 2008). The shift was immediate and was sustained for the subsequent decade. The impact could not be attributed to the effect of arrest, since all those in the \"treatment\" and statewide \"comparison\" groups were arrested. The impact could not be attributed to displacement to other cities, since the data allowed the research team to detect subsequent arrests anywhere in the state. The impact was also not attributable to a larger trend, since no substantial trend was observed in the statewide rearrest data. Finally, the impact is unlikely to be attributable to johns moving their activities online. While it is true that commercial sex solic itation has been shifting from the streets to online venues, the shift to online solicitation has been gradual rather than abruptly occurring in one year, and has been widespread rather than occurring only in San Francisco in 1995. o A comprehensive approach including rev erse stings reduced prostitution by 75% in controlled experiment in Jersey City, New Jersey : In a rigorous field study, Weisburd and colleagues (2006) found a 75% reduction in observed and reported prostitution from a comprehensive approach that included combating demand through reverse stings. The eval uation design tested for displacement effects, and the researchers concluded that the reductions were not attributable to simply pushing the problem to other areas of the city. However, the comprehensive nature of the intervention prevents attributing the positive effects to the demand piece or any other single component of the program. o Comprehensive effort including \"kerb crawler\" arrests and a john school reduced prostitution in Ipswich, England by 40% to 80%. A study by Poland and colleagues (2008) concluded that a la rge reduction in street prostitution in Ipswich, England resulted from an intensive and multifaceted intervention. The program featured enforcement and education aimed at demand (arresting \"kerb crawlers\" and having them attend the \"C hange Course,\" or john school), and a social service/therapeutic (rather than punitive) approach for providers of commercial sex. The study found 40% to 80% reductions in calls for police service and the number of persons involved in prostitution (Kendall, 2008; Poland et al., 2008). o Enactment of Swedish law that focused on demand has reportedly reduced street prostitution by 50% to 75%. In 1999 Sweden passed national legislation decriminalizing the sale of sex while simultaneously criminalizing the purchase of sex. The innovation of the \"Swedish Model\" law was in place in the entire legal burden for prostitution on the buyer rath er than the provider. An evaluation of the impact of the law found a 50% to 70% reduction in street prostitution through focusing on demand (Swedish Government Report SOU 2010:49, 2010).

Final Report pg. vii Police Reports and Anecdotal Accounts: o In St. Petersburg, Florida, a comprehensive approach emphasizing arresting and shaming johns was associated with a 24% reduction in calls for police service. Concluding that arresting women i nvolved in prostitution was ineffective in reducing the illicit business and the crime and disorder surrounding it, the city focused on a multifaceted effort that featured tactics aimed at demand. Reverse stings were conducted in 1993, and a le tter that included information about sexually transmitted diseases was sent to the home address of all arrested johns. Prostitution-related calls for service from police decreased 24 percent between 1993 and 1994 (Minor, 1997). o In Raleigh, North Carolina, a comprehensive approach emphasizing arresting and shaming johns was associated with a 38% reduction in calls for police service. In response to persistent prostituti on-related problems in the city, a study of prostitution was conducted, wh ich concluded that police and other agencies city should prioritize arresting customers and addressing the service needs of providers (Weisel, 2004). An initiative - Operation Dragnet - featuring those elements was launched. Among ot her outcomes, over 85% of the citizens surveyed were aware of the anti-prostituti on effort, and citizen-initiated calls for service initially increased due to increased aw areness, and then declined steadily by 38% compared to the pr e-intervention baseline. o Reduced street prostitution in Salt Lake City in 1971 and 1976 attributed by police to reverse stings. A three-month effort in 1971 to combat prostitution through concentrating on male buyers led poli ce to conclude that nearly all of the 75 known street prostitutes appeared to have left town. 2 In the crackdown on demand, 139 men were arrested during rever se stings. Subsequent reports stated that through 1976 the reverse sting program had arrested 1,129 johns, and that prostitution in the city had declined by approximately 50% soon afterward.3 o In Buffalo, New York, a 60% drop in 911 calls was associated with a comprehensive approach emphasizing arresting johns and sending them to a john school. From 1996 to 1997, the city incr eased john arrests 85 percent. Arrested men were sent to a john school progrma modeled after the one in San Francisco. Arrested women involved in prostitution were referred to an organizaiton for support and treatment. To assess the impact of the initaitve, 911 calls and arrest data were analyzed , and interviews were conducted with community members. They found that 911 calls fell 60% from 1996 to 1997, police observed fewer women engaging in street prostitution, and community members interviewed reported less prostitution activity. o Reverse stings and shaming reportedly removed Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania from a domestic trafficking circuit, and reduced the number of women engaged in street prostitution locally by 75%. In interviews conducted for the National Assessment, police department staff said that Wilkes-Barre had been a stop on a domestic sex trafficking circuit operati ng in upstate New York and central 2 The Deseret News, Page B-1, September 20, 1971. 3 Miami News, June 17, 1976.

Final Report pg. viii Pennsylvania. Through the mid-1980s, trad itional interventions had been tried and found ineffective: arresting prostitu ted women accomplished little (trafficked women soon left for the next stop on the circuit, and local women simply returned to the streets), and prosecution of pimps had been attempted, but never successfully. In 1986, Wilkes-Barre po lice tried a new approach, conducting large-scale reverse stings coupled with pub licizing the identities of arrestees. In each of the first several operations, they arrested from 50 to 100 men who were issued citations and ordered to pay fin es. Arrestee identities were included in press releases which ran in the local Sunday newspaper. After two years of these efforts, police concluded that Wilkes-Barre had been taken off the \"pimp circuit.\" The number of women known to engage in street prostitution fell from 20 to five, with the rotating circuit survivors gone and the remaining five being local women suffering from severe substance addictions. The existence of the domestic trafficking circuit and the level of poli ce reverse sting activity in the 1980s and 1990s were corroborated by news archives and interviews with police from other cities on the circuit. However, the stated impact on the number of street-level survivors could not be confirmed due to a lack of data from the time period (e.g., arrest data were not kept by the police department beyond seven years). Findings from National Assessment Data Collection There are more than a dozen distinct types of interventions that have been developed and implemented to combat demand, and variations within each type. The basic typology we have developed is outlined below, along with the number of cities and counties in the United States that are known to have ever employed each type, as well as some key details of each type of intervention and variations on the basic models. Reverse stings, street-level (occurring in over 826 cities and counties) o Police officers pose as women engaged in street-level prostitution. o Average support team is about sev en officers for each decoy. o Smaller departments may borrow female offi cer from another department if they don't have enough officers to serve as effective decoys. o Variation: Some police departments conduct reverse stings at venues such as truck stops and events that draw large numbers of men. o Variation: Some police departments have used decoys who are not police officers. Reverse stings, web-based (n=286) o Police post decoy advertisements online, set up reverse sting at hotel or apartment. o Variation: Police respond to real online ads, replace prostituted persons with police decoys, and continue taking calls from johns on the survivor's phone. o Variation: Women police decoys respond to online ads placed by johns seeking sex with prostituted persons. Reverse stings, brothel-based (n=13) o Police investigate brothels, make arrests, replace brothel staff with decoys, and continue fielding calls and walk-ins fro m johns in order to make arrests. Shaming - publicizing identities (n=484) o Publicizing identities of arrested johns, via news outlets, police websites, billboards.

Final Report pg. ix Shaming - \"Dear John\" letters (n=40) o Letter sent to address of registered car owner, alerting owner that car was seen in area known for prostitution. o Variation: Letters sent to arrestee's home address. o Variation: Content may also include warnings about health risks, detriments of commercial sex to communities and survivors. Seizing autos used to solicit sex (n=120) o Autos used in commission of crime are seized. o To retrieve autos, john must pay an impound fee, tow fee, and/or fines ranging collectively from about $500 to $2000. o Variation: Some communities allow for seized ve hicles to be forfeited and sold at auction as part of the penalty for the offense, or as the result of failure to pay the fees and fines necessary to reclaim vehicles. Suspending driver's license (n=19) o In some jurisdictions arrestees may have thei r driver's license suspended if they used a vehicle in the commission of a crime; nineteen communities have been known to apply this to men arrested for soliciting women police decoys. Geographic restraining orders or exclusion zones (n=83) o Johns prohibited from visiting areas with known prostitution activity, and/or the vicinity of their arrest. o Also called \"Stay Out of Areas with Prostitution\" or \"SOAP\" orders. Public education and awareness programs (n=67) o Proactive efforts to educate men and boys about prostitution and sex trafficking, encouraging them not to contribute to sex trafficking and sexual exploitation by purchasing sex. o Can also include targeting audiences in addition to actual and potential buyers, attempting to indirectly affect demand by lower social tolerance or encouragement of buying sex and enlisting community member support in efforts to combat demand. Neighborhood action (n=115) o To be counted for this study, neighborhood action must be a community-led initiative that is organized and formalized as a program or process, rather than being an ad hoc occurrence. o Some programs involve forwarding tips to po lice; citizen patrols; citizen-led blogs; billboard campaigns; participating in community impact panels or making presentations in john schools. \"John school\" education or treatment programs for arrestees (n=51) o Can be structured as a sentencing option, and coupled with other criminal sanctions, or a diversion program, resulting in dismissed charges. o Can be structured as one-day classes versus multiple-session counseling models.

This income normally fully covers program costs and often produces excess revenue used to fund survivor recovery programs. o A typical curriculum includes presentations on: health consequences impact on communities impact on survivors (survivor testimony) victimization risks and other negative outcomes for johns legal consequences o Variation: A video john school, a DVD presented by Cook County Sheriff's Office that is shown to arrested johns in various locations. o Variation: A \"roadside\" john school in Tucson, Arizona, involving officers delivering a short set of speaking points and providing a handout to men suspected of soliciting. o Variations : Class content can include many other topics, including anger management, domestic violence, STI testing, sexual addiction, healthy relationships, substance abuse, human trafficking. Community service programs for arrestees (n=50) o Like community service programs for any offe nders, arrested johns can be ordered to perform community service to meet conditions of a diversion protocol or a sentence. o Arrested johns often ordered to clean str eets where prostitution is known to occur. o For most johns, community service obligations range from four to 40 hours, and are coupled with other sanctions such as fines, fees, and/or john schools. Surveillance cameras (n=67) o To be counted as a demand-focused tactic in this study, cameras must be used to detect or provide evidence used against johns. o Variation: Some cameras are used as a deterrent, with signs posted that alert johns to their presence. o Variation: Some cameras are used covertly as a tool for gathering evidence for prosecutors. History of Demand Reduction Approaches Pursued in the U.S. The history of interventions used to combat demand for commercial sex in the United States is longer than is commonly reported . For example, o While there were scattered occasions where male buyers of sex have been arrested dating back to the 1910s, the use of modern \"reverse sting\" operations began in the mid-1960s . The first reverse sting operation we could identify occurred in Nashville, Tennessee in 1964. The first web-based reve rse sting we found occurred in Everett, Washington in 1995. o Some cities and counties arrest ed more male \"customers\" than female \"providers\" of prostitution as early as 1973 (e.g., Los Angeles, California). In 1975-1976, St. Petersburg, Florida applied some of the basi c principles that were much later featured in the \"Swedish Model\" law, shifting away from the traditional punitive approach targeting providers and a lenient approach toward buyers. St. Petersburg spent the majority of their police resources devoted to prostitution toward arresting male This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. xi customers in an effort to undermine the market by reducing demand, and shifted toward a primarily therapeutic/social serv ice approach used for those engaged in selling sex. o While the FOPP in San Francisco began in 1995 and is often cited as the first john school, we identified at least five education or treatment programs for arrested sex buyers that preceded it. The first known john school program was the \"The John Group,\" which began operating in Grand Rapi ds, Michigan in 1981. From 1988 to 1992, john schools were launched in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota (1988); Rochester, New York (1988); West Palm Beach, Florida (1991); and Kansas City, Kansas (1992). o The following table presents the location an d year of the first known use of each type of demand-focused intervention: Demand Reduction Tactics 1st Known Use Site Law Enforcement & Post-Arrest Interventions Reverse stings (street operations) 1964 Nashville, TN Reverse stings (web-based) 1995 Everett, WA Shaming: Names and/or photos publicized 1975 Eugene, OR Shaming: \"Dear John\" letters sent home 1982 Aberdeen, MD Auto seizure 1980 Roanoke, VA Driver's license suspension 1985 Tampa, FL Geographic exclusion zones 1975 Beaver Falls, OR Community service 1975 Miami, FL Surveillance cameras targeting prostitution 1989 Horry County, SC John schools 1981 Grand Rapids, MI Public Awareness/Education Campaigns 1980 Roanoke, VA Neighborhood Action Targeting Johns 1975 Knoxville, TN While we found more sites than expected to ha ve used reverse stings or other anti-demand tactics (n=826), and efforts to combat demand have a longer history than expected, it remains true that the majority of efforts to address prostitu tion and sex trafficking are still aimed at supply and distribution, rather than demand. Most communities that have targeted demand report doing so because they did not see positive results from their efforts to address pros titution or sex trafficking by focusing on supply (arresting providers) or distribution (arresting pimps) . The majority of reverse stings (at least 71%, and probably over 90%) are conducted in response to complaints that police departments receive from residents and businesses.

Final Report pg. xii Key Innovations When reviewing the numerous efforts to combat demand across more than 826 U.S. cities and counties, it is clear that there are several fundament al approaches used and that some of those basic models are relatively straightforw ard and well known to practitioners. For example, the planning and execution of basic reverse stings are simple and w ithin the skills and staffing capacities of most law enforcement agencies. Many of the other post-arr est interventions are also well known to police and the courts, since they are basic criminal justice interventions applied to one pa rticular type of offender - men who buy sex. Community service, geographic exclusion zones, auto seizure, and driver's license suspension are all basic sanctions applied to other kinds of offenders, and these sanctions are sometimes applied to buyers of sex. However, most communities are unaware of the range of variation in how these interventions can be configured and execute. This is critical since th e variations and innovations have evolved to solve problems and overcome challenges that prevent or limit the implementation of initiatives addressing demand. For example, many small communities rare ly conduct reverse stings due to limited number of female officers to serve as decoys, and so me do not implement john schools because they erroneously believe they are costly or must be structured as diversion programs. We have gathered information att esting to the range of extant inte rventions and alternative models that provide innovative solutions to real and pe rceived challenges to basic approaches, as well as evidence contrary to erroneous assumptions. For ex ample, many john schoo ls are structured as mandatory conditions of a sentence, most recover all of their costs through fees or collected, and many small communities exchange or borrow female decoys or entire reverse sting teams to solve their local capacity problems. A number of variations on basic models have been de veloped to meet particular challenges or to take advantage of opportunities. Some of these were listed above in the summary of the typology, and several examples are described in more detail below. Reverse Stings: Replacing prostituted women with police decoys. o In web-based reverse stings, the basic model involves police posting a bogus advertisement on websites used to transact prostitution, and to place a female police decoy and support team in a hotel room or apartment for appointments with johns. This requires substantial planning, obtaining a phone for police to use that is not detectable as a police phone, constructing a realistic ad, and can pose challenges in getting hotel or apartment space. A variation used that is designed to solve some of these challenges is to have po lice search real web ads for prostitution; they respond to the ad, remove the survivor, and inst all a police decoy who continues making appointments with johns on the survivor's hotel or cell phone. A similar concept is used in storefront brothels, where the st aff and survivors are removed and replaced with police officers who continue to make appointments and arrest johns. Reverse Stings: Borrowing decoys from other police departments. o Many police departments, particularly smalle r ones, have had trouble staffing reverse stings due to a shortage of women po lice officers who can serve as decoys, or because the decoys become too well-known to po tential buyers to be effective. A solution to this problem used by some po lice agencies is to borrow staff from other departments. For example, the small cities of Bluefield and Princeton, West Virginia have borrowed or shared decoys and sometimes other members of reverse sting teams. Similarly, Wilkes-Barre Pennsyl vania and communities such as Reading and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. xiii Allentown have exchanged staff, and the Pennsylvania State Police has developed the capacity to assist communities throughout the state in conducting reverse stings. John Schools: Variations on the basic model. The most well-known and frequently emulated john school is the aforementioned FOPP in San Francisco, which is structured as a criminal justice diversion program that involves a one day, eight-hour class. Paying a fee and completing the class leads to dismissal of charges. Variations on this basic model include john schools that are structured as programs where participation is court-ordered, rather than voluntary, and where participation does not result in dismissal or charges or reduced sentences. In addition to john schools being structured as diversion versus sentencing options, there is a wide range of program intensity, from very brief presentations (about 15 minutes, in two pr ograms), to one-day classes of anywhere from one to 8 hours, to multiple-session programs that span up to 15-20 hours distributed over four to 10 weekly sessions. Some of the variations on the FOPP model are summarized below. o Sentencing option. There have been objections to the diversion element of the FOPP structure, with some seeing it simply as a way to allow men to \"get away with\" exploiting women without seri ous consequence, and othe rs objecting to such an option being available for men but equivale nt diversion options not always being available for women involved in providing prostitution. However, not all john schools are diversion programs; in fact, 44% of the more than 50 john schools that have been initiated in the U.S. have been structured so that the program is (or can be) a condition of a sentence, and are neither volunta ry or result in dismissal of charges. o Counseling format . Rather than a one-day session of up to eight hours of classroom instruction, some john schools are structured as multiple-session counseling programs, in either individual or group formats, that span days or weeks. For example, the john school in Salt Lake City involves 10 weekly sessions in a group counseling format. o Video john school. The vast majority of john schools are financially self-supporting, with fees or fines covering the costs of th e classes. Even so, some communities have resource limitations that make managi ng and running the classes more burdensome than they are prepared to accommodate. To address such limitations and also to provide a consistent set of educationa l and awareness messages, the Cook County Sheriff's Office (Illinois) has recently de veloped a Video John School, which covers the basic curriculum components commonl y found in conventional john school programs: health and legal consequences, impact on survivors and communities, safety risks, and discussion of the links be tween prostitution and human trafficking, The video is shown to all arrested johns as they are being processed, and has been distributed to other cities for use in a variety of settings. o \"Roadside john school.\" John schools are dependent upon police making arrests in order to supply the programs with participants. However, reverse stings are among the most labor-intensive and costly anti- demand tactics. The leadership of the Tucson, Arizona Police Department's vice un it believed that to reduce prostitution and collateral crime and disorder, it was important to deter johns. They also believed that to do so, education would be an im portant tool. However, scarce resources limited the number of reverse stings they could conduct (the depa rtment had severely reduced and then eliminated the vice crimes unit), so the typical john school model of educating only arrested sex buyers would leave the educational intervention beyond This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. xiv the reach of the vast majority of men buying sex in the cite. Patrol officers and those working other details woul d consistently see men \"cruising\" and picking up women known to be involved in prostitution, but such observations are rarely sufficient to make an arrest (the evidence necessar y to make solid cases for prosecution is developed almost exclusively through reve rse stings). In an attempt to convey information to the majority of johns they observed but could not arrest, the department developed the Safety Th rough Deterrence (STD) program, known informally as the \"roadside john school.\" Police officers would detain men suspected of attempting to buy sex, deliver a 10 minut e lecture on the negative consequences of prostitution, and provide a four-page han dout containing similar information. Costs of Interventions Most anti-demand interventions cost little: Most of the tactics used to combat demand are not costly, many are essentially cost-neutr al, and some generate net revenue through fees and fines that can be used to support survivor programs or law enforcement efforts. For example, o Shaming . There are several ways to publicize the identities of johns, including billboards and placing ads in news outlets, which can incur costs. However, the methods of shaming used most often cost little. The most common method is for police departments to issue a press release, which is then carried or summarized in local news outlets and/or posted on a police department or city government website. The means of dissemination is cost-free, although staff time is necessary to write a release - perhaps an hour or two for civilian staff to gather the information from the officers and compose the release. o Auto Seizure. Most state criminal statutes allo w for the seizure of automobiles used in the commission of a crime, and many cities have municipal ordinances similarly supporting auto seizures. Th e costs of towing and of processing the paperwork associated with seizures ar e usually covered by impound and towing fees and fines which average over $1,000 collectively. o \"Dear John\" Letters. Cities that send letters to the homes of arrestees have typically produced form letters, with c ontact information and perhaps the date, time, and location of their observed activity or arrest, to be filled in. As criminal justice interventions go, Dear John letters are inexpensive, requiring just the initial drafting of the letters, and then perhaps 15 minutes per letter to complete and less than $.50 per letter to mail. o John Schools. John schools required a resource commitment to deliver properly, but they also generate the income necessary to be self-sustaining. The curriculum, eligibility criteria, agendas, MOUs and other material must be developed. Producing those materials is a one-time investment with some updating and maintenance. The classes th emselves require staffing: (a) usually an hour or two of staff time to register and check in participants; (b) instructors (usually two to six, depending upon the curriculum and the capabilities of available instructors); (c) translators ma y be necessary, although the majority of john schools function without them. While the cost of holding a john school class can be from no direct costs (if instructor time and meeting space are donated) up to $3,500 for a full-day class staffed by several compensated This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. xv presenters and translators, most fines and program fees are calibrated so that they cover all of those costs. Many john schools not only cover the cost of the class, but produce excess revenue used to fund survivor programs (e.g., Nashville and San Francisco john schools) and to reimburse police for reverse stings and the courts for their time in processing offenders (Portland, San Francisco, Tacoma). For example: The total fee revenue generated during the life of the FOPP in San Francisco is well over $3 million. The revenue from the FOPP has been approximately evenly split among the San Francisco District Attorney's Office (SFDA), San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and a nonprofit organization, Standing Against Global Exploitation (SAGE), with each of the three partners receiving over $1 million since 1995. The fees have: Covered all of the direct costs of the john school classes. Covered all FOPP administrative costs incurred by SFDA, SFPD, and SAGE. Covered most (88%) of the SFDA's costs for processing arrestees referred to the program. Covered about one-third of the co sts of the SFPD's reverse sting operations. Generated over $1 million in fee revenue has been generated to support programs for women and girls involved in prostitution. Almost all (94%) of SAGE's share of the FOPP fee revenue is used to support survivor programs. In 2010 alone, the Nashville, TN john school program generated over $100,000 for the Magdalene program for survivors of commercial sex. o Community service. Some communities require johns to perform community service, and this usually requires superv ision. However, consistent with community service programs covering other types of offenders, programs for johns (e.g., Norfolk, Virginia) require participants to pay a supervision fee, often of approximately $40 per day, whic h covers the supervision costs. Need for Improved Access to Information The research conducted during this project has confir med the basic assumption driving the study: that there is a large pool of experience in designing and implementing interventions targeting demand for commercial sex, and this experience could benef it communities implementing or planning initiatives with a similar focus. Our research has conf irmed that little of the information about these interventions is circulated broadly, and thus rema ins a resource untapped by others. Practitioners are often unaware of anti-demand inte rventions developed and implemen ted in other communities. The reason for this is simple: there is no central s ource or effective means by which practitioners can access the information.

Final Report pg. xvi Other Key Findings There are over 240 programs and organizations in over U.S. 100 cities and counties that specialize in providing assistance to survivors of prostitution or sex trafficking. Staff and clients from these programs can be (and often are) partners in initiatives that target demand. A list of such programs identified during the course of this study, and the communities they serve, is provided in Appendix J of this report. Several cities and counties have established \" prostitution courts \" that offer diversion or sentencing options for survivors that parallel those offered to male buyers through john school programs (e.g., Dallas, TX; Hartford, CT; Phoenix, AZ). Such programs can provide gender and role balance to the penalties and opportunities within a city that are provided to those selling and buying sex. Reductions in police funding since the mid-2000s has resulted in cutback or elimination of vice crime units (e.g., San Francisco, CA; Tucs on, AZ; Vallejo, CA), fewer revers e stings, and fewer arrests of johns. Th is has resulted in fewer participants in john schools and other post-arrest programs. Additional Information Available on DemandForum.net The systematic gathering of information and its dissemination are the primary objectives of the present National Assessment project. A website is the only practical way to manage the volume of information collected, and to make it readily accessible. It is evident that there is great interest and need for information about effectively combating the demand for commercial sex. Information exists that could be immediately helpful to practitioners a nd policymakers, and to make it available to those with an interest in using it, a web-based infrastru cture has been developed to: (a) gather information and source materials, (b) compile, screen, and orga nizing the information and materials, and (c) provide a means of dissemination. The website is also intended to facilitate communication among practitioners; anyone interested in a particular initiativ e or site can contact the website staff for local contacts. The majority of the information gathered in the present study is only summarized in this report, and will be presented in full on the we bsite where the technology can accommodate the volume of documentation. Structure of the Website At the DemandForum.net website there are two primary ways to search for and access information: By location o From a map, one can choose a city or c ounty and be led to information about the types of anti-demand tactics employed there. When selecting a city or county, a check-box summarizing the kinds of tactics th at have been used there is presented, along with a narrative summary of relevant site characteristics, interventions that have been implemented, and references or links to supporting documentation and other resources.

Errors occurring in this report are solely the responsib ility of the Abt Associates Inc. project team. For this report, a team of Abt Associates research ers and collaborators assembled information from a wide range of sources, and with the assistance of numerous individuals, agencies, and organizations. Much of this report's content was supplied or shaped by those we interviewed or surveyed who work in a variety of fields to combat prostitution and huma n trafficking: criminal justice, public health, city and county government, neighborh ood organizations, social service agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We are indebted to survey respondents, intervie w subjects, those who provided us with documents, and who helped us conduct site visits. To preserve confidentiality, we will not list them by name, but wish to acknowledge their invaluable contributions a nd thank them for taking time out of their days to help us conduct this study. We received input on issues related to the implementation of anti-demand efforts from 274 experts from law enforcement, public health, city government, and human services agencies, as well as neighborhood organizations and nonprofit organizations devoted to combating sexual exploitation and human tra fficking. In our survey we received 241 completed questionnaires from practitioners in 199 cities and counties. We th en conducted 226 interviews at 75 of those sites, and visited 10 cities and counties in order to observe program activities. We also wish to thank the numerous researchers, reporters, and practitioners who have published and posted reports and research on prostitution, human trafficking, and related subjects.

Police have attacked prostitution with the wrong method. They've gone after the prostitutes. I think the focus should have been on the customer.\" Chief Pierce Brooks, Eugene (Oregon) Police Department, 19784 To combat prostitution and human trafficking for th e purpose of sexual exploitation, criminal justice interventions and collaborative programs have emerged that focus on reducing demand for commercial sex. In a prior study, Abt Associat es found evidence that the use of anti-demand approaches was more widespread th an previously thought. It was also found that little research or descriptive information was available about the vast majority of interventions. Communities attempting to address demand had often done so with little guidance from the collective experience of others; consequently, some initiatives had struggled or failed when faced with problems that had been solved elsewhere (Shively et al., 2008). To fill these gaps, Abt Associates received support from the National Institute of Justice to develop a typology and a descriptive overview of anti-demand tactics employed throughout the United States, and to provide information of practical value that could assist communities in starting, improving, or sustaining programs and practices. A secondary obj ective was to assess the f easibility of evaluating demand-reduction interventions. The project has genera ted several key products, one of which is this report which provides an overview of initiatives targe ting the demand in the United States. It also describes the study's process of gathering informat ion, discusses specific initiatives, and highlights selected communities to illustrate how and why th eir members have addressed prostitution and sex trafficking by combating demand. The report is intended to serve as an introduction fo r those considering applying anti-demand tactics in their communities, and for those at the stat e government level who are considering policies, statutes, and infrastructure investments supporting local efforts. Additional information is available at the main product of the project, the website scheduled ( DemandForum.net) to be launched in March, 2012. The site allows for the presentation of a far greater number of case summaries, examples, supporting documents, than is possible in the present report, and has flexibility in updating and accessing content. The report is organized around the following components: A discussion of prostitution and sex trafficking, the problems they pose for individuals and communities, and why a growing number of communities have elected to address these problems by focusing on the buyers of illegal commercial sex. 4 The Eugene Register-Guard, July 8, 1978.

Final Report pg. 2 An overview of commercial sex markets, and the role of demand in driving both prostitution and sex trafficking. Steps taken to gather data about anti-demand initiatives. A typology of interventions, as well as an overv iew of their prevalence, basic traits, and history. A number of appendices provide references, s upporting documentation, a nd more detail about key points. Based on the assumption that most readers of this report will be more interested in the study's findings and less concerned about details of the methods used to acquire the information, detailed discussion of the study's research design and data co llection procedures is placed in two appendices: Appendix B contains a description of the research design, and Appendix C contains the survey and data collection instruments. The website expands the presentation of information collected in the study, and for all cities and counties will include checklists of tactics used a nd capsule descriptions of communities known to have used anti-demand tacti cs, along with links to any available program documentation and third-party repor ts relevant to each site. The research described in the report was conducte d to contribute to an ongoing process of gathering information on practices targeting demand for commercial sex. The intent was to develop for the first time a national picture of current and historical practices. This provides a foundation for further inquiry, and for gathering and disseminating actiona ble information useful to practitioners. While this report is necessarily static and will become dated, the Demandforum.net website will remain a \"living document,\" frequently refined and updated as additional information is acquired. Input from the field of practitioners, advocates, policymakers, and researchers will be actively encouraged, and contact information for individuals and organizations that hold information of value to practitioners will be provided. Not all of the topics worthy of attention and consideration could be covered sufficiently in this report, but we expect information to continually accrue on th e website. Given that the study's scope is broad and comprehensive, the National Assessment include d examination of many topics, but could not report exhaustively on every one. We prioritized pr actices that are: (a) established as - or may be approaching the status of - evidence-based practice; (b) actively being implemented or considered by many communities; (c) controversial and the subject of debate among policymakers and practitioners; or (d) represent innovations and attempts to solve challenges faced by traditional practices or standard models. Guided by these criteria, we have emph asized reverse sting operations, shaming, and john schools in our reporting, and in describing not on ly the basic models of each, but variations, innovations, and evidence of effectiveness.

Harman, Princeton, West Virginia Police Department, 20105 \"We really need to look at who's making the mo ney: the pimps and the traffickers. But where are they getting the money? They're making money off men who are willing to pay.\" Suzanne Keopplinger, executive director of the Minnesota Indian Women's Resource Center, 20106 \"Pimping and trafficking are the same thing. What they both come down to is sexual servitude. Whether someone is being moved from state to stat e, country to country, or street corner to street corner doesn't make any difference. It's about co mpelling women and girls to sell sex and then taking their money.\" Interview with investigator, Atlanta Police Department Vice Unit, 2010 \"The crime of prostitution clearly impacts our bu sinesses, our neighborhoods and the quality of life in our city.

Final Report pg. 4 still underdeveloped). An overvie w and citations for the logical and empirical case can be summarized as follows, and are then presented in detail: Prostitution and sex trafficking10 present a wide array of problems for providers and consumers of illegal commercial sex, and for communities in which it occurs. Most police response to prostitution is driven by complaints from residents and local businesses. The primary cause of prostitution and sex trafficking is consumer-level demand for commercial sex.11 To combat demand, it is not necessary (or practical) to separate prostitution from sex trafficking, because: a. The distinction between people selling sex who are versus are not compelled by a third party is usually invisible to buyers - particularly since most buyers are motivated to believe that providers are involved voluntarily. Market incentives and fear of reprisals from pimps and traffickers motivate providers of commercial sex who are trafficked to present themselves as if they participate voluntarily, and most johns cannot (or choose not to) see otherwise. b. It is not feasible to develop separate inte rventions for men buying compelled sex and for those buying sex from people who are not compelled by a third party. 12 The only practical approach is to combat all purchasing of sex. c. Prostitution is the \"front door\" to sexual sl avery and trafficking for law enforcement and other responders, since cases usually present first as involving prostitution, then some are reclassified as involving slavery or traffi cking when evidence emerges attesting to the participation in commercial sex being compelle d by third-party force, fraud, or coercion (or by finding the survivor to be a minor). The only practices for combating prostitution and sex trafficking that are demonstrated to be effective are those that include combating demand. a. There is evidence that anti-dem and interventions can be eff ective in reducing the activity of illegal commercial sex markets; there is no firm evidence that interventions focusing on \"supply\" and \"distribution\" reduce the prevalence or incidence of sex trafficking. There are two primary ways to directly affect actual and potential buyers of commercial sex: 10 The term \"prostitution\" is used when commercial sex involves adults and when no third-party force, fraud, or coercion is present. \"Sex trafficking\" is used when commercial sex involves children and/or when it is compelled by a third party using force, fraud, or coercion. 11 The term \"prostitution\" is used when involving adu lts when no third-party for ce, fraud, or coercion is present, and \"sex trafficking\" is used to refer to commercial sex invo lving children and/or compelled by a third party using force, fraud, or coercion. 12 An exception to this rule is that it is possible to form separate laws that provide penalty enhancements for men who buy sex from trafficked persons. It is also im portant to clarify that there are already separate laws for commercial sex with children, which is always human trafficking.

Illegal Commercial Sex Markets Like the market for any commodity or service, the illicit commercial sex market is a function of supply and demand. Like the market for any good or service (illicit or otherwise), demand is the key (but not the only) driving force, and the other com ponents follow. When there is demand, supply will be found or produced, and distributors (in this case, pimps, traffickers, or those acting as their own distributors) work to ensure that the two sha ll meet. The stronger the demand, the greater the economic motivation to obtain and deliver a suppl y. A simple model of the core dynamics of commercial sex markets is presented in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: A Flow Model of Commercial Sex Markets The figure illustrates the relationship between suppl y, demand, and distribution in commercial sex markets. Markets originate in consumer-level de mand, and supply and distribution are responses to demand. Of course, as a model, this is an ove rsimplification of market forces. Any market has complex interactions and feedback mechanisms between supply, demand, and distribution. But the model does illustrate something difficult to dispute: without demand, there is little need to generate and distribute a supply. The model also depicts how distributors (either pimps or traffickers) can be bypassed where demand can make direct connection w ith supply. In commercial sex markets, it is not always true that there are third parties broke ring (or forcing) exchanges between those providing This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 6 commercial sex and the consumers of commercial se x. For people engaged in providing commercial sex who do not have pimps or traffickers compellin g them, one can consider providers to serve as their own distributors. Until relatively recently (and in many communities, pr esently), criminal justice system attempts to suppress street prostitution have focused largely on interrupting supply by arresting and sanctioning the providers. But they have usually ignored th e individuals creating demand. While arresting women engaged in street prostitution may temporarily clear an area of visible activity, driving it to other neighborhoods or indoors, experience shows that this strategy alone produces few lasting benefits.13 Prostituted people cycle through the criminal justice system often and rapidly, typically returning to the streets within hours of being a rrested. Moreover, women and girls arrested for prostitution are rarely provided with services to help them address the issues that make them vulnerable to further sexual exploitation. This situation began changing in the 1960s and 1 970, and the pace of change gained momentum in the 1990s when communities, frustrated by the l ack of positive results from focusing on supply and distribution, began implementing anti-demand tacti cs. For example, \"john school\" programs, which seek to change the behavior of sex buyers through education or treatment, generally proceed from the assumption that some of the men who solicit prostitutes are amenable to treatment or education, and will change their behavior in response to new in formation. Some subsets of sex buyers may be unresponsive to such intervention. The proportion falling into the \"amenable\" and \"intractable\" groups is unknown, but it is not crucial to know preci sely: As long as there is a group of men drawn into the program that is amenable to change, the programs have a chance to make a difference as long as they are conducted properly. The john school m odel also assumes that a brief educational program is likely to do no harm. The programs are ofte n designed as an option for diverting people from normal adjudication, but in doing so expose the public to no additional risk since traditional sanctions for misdemeanor prostituti on offenses require offenders to spe nd little\u2014if any\u2014time segregated from the public. In addition, there is very little opportunity cost for investing in the programs, since the modest program expenses are covere d by fees paid by participants. \"The prostitutes aren't themselves the problem. The johns are the problem.\" Bernie Audette, Coordinator of the Blackford's Grove Neighborhood Association, Evansville, Indiana, 198214 Demand: Men's Decisions to Buy Sex Like the market for any commodity or service, the illicit commercial sex market is driven by demand.15 Both prostitution and sex trafficking (c ommercial sex provided by those compelled through force, fraud, or coercion) arise from a common source: men's decisions to buy sex. 13 E.g., Ayala & White, 2008; DeMuth & Steffensmeier, 2004; San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, 1993, 1999; Scott, 2003. 14 Associated Press.

Final Report pg. 7 Studies of male consumers of commercial sex find that buyers are similar to the general population in most regards, and quite unlike most populations of criminal offenders,16 although the population of johns also contains some dangerous criminals and sociopaths.17 A substantial portion of men in the U.S. admits to having purchased sex at some point in their lives, with most surveys finding between 10% and 20% to admit to this crime.18 The rates found in the U.S. are similar to those found in Australia and Europe (see reviews by Sanders, 2008; Weitzer, 2007). With one out of every five or six men admitting to purchasing sex, patronizing commercial sex is unlikely to be primarily the result of rare deviance or pathology. While not extremely rare, most men do not purchase sex, so the behavior cannot be considered a nor mative or intractable problem beyond the reach of intervention. A comparison of men who had been arrested fo r purchasing sex to nationally representative samples of men 19 found that those who had purchased sex were mo re likely to have atte nded college, and were just 15% less likely to be married (41% for arrested johns versus 56% in the national survey; Monto, 1999). Shively et al., (2008) found that a large proportion of the men in San Francisco's \"john school\" program were well educated, employed, and married, and few had extensive criminal histories. Similar results have been found in other studies. 20 Many studies have examined men's motivation for buying sex,21 and found that there is a wide range of reasons for procuring sex from prostitutes (see re view by Sanders, 2008). The distinct motivations identified in these surveys can be cat egorized into a few main types: (1) seeking intimacy (i.e., a way to approximate intimate relationships they are unable or unwilling to de velop); (2) seeking sex without intimacy (a way to get sex without the investment and compromises needed for intimate relationships); (3) seeking variety (fulfilling a desire for sex with women of various \"types,\" based on ethnicity, size, age, hair color, etc.), (4) thrill- seeking (being drawn by the \"thrill of the hunt\" and the illicit nature of prostitution); and (5 ) pathology (drawn by compulsion, addiction, or by forms of sociopathy, psychology, or misogyny where the intent is to control and harm). While men who solicit prostitution are not necessarily atypical demographically or in terms of criminal history, they are measurably different in terms of a range of attitudes toward women, relationships, and commercial sex. For example, Monto & McRee (2005) found that consumers were less likely to have sexually liberal attitudes (e.g ., to view premarital sex, sex among minors, and homosexuality as acceptable), and to think about sex more often. Commercial sex participants were also less likely to have been sexually molested as children, or to report ha ving forced women into sexual acts. The differences between samples were not large, but were statistically significant. 16 E.g., Kennedy, 2004; Lever and Dolnick, 2000; Monto, 1999. 17 E.g., Holzman and Pines, 1982; Reichert, 2004; Sawyer et al., 2001. 18 E.g., Michael et al., 1994; Monto, 1999; Sullivan and Simon, 1998. 19 I.e., male respondents of large-scale national surveys; see Monto, 1999; Monto & McRee, 2005. 20 E.g., Kennedy, 2004; Lever and Dolnick, 2000. 21 E.g., Bernstein, 2001; Durschlag Goswami, Holzman 1962; Xantidis & McCabe, 2000.

There's no one set 'MO' for a john.\" Jeri Williams, survivor and a Program Coordinator for the City of Portland, Oregon, 201022 Many studies have examined men's motivation for buying sex,23 and found that there is a wide range of reasons, and the relationships between prostitutes and their \"customers\" can become quite complex (see review by Sanders, 2008). Research has found that the reasons men hire prostituted persons include: To engage in sex acts that few other women are willing to engage in. To experience sex with women with a variety of physical traits. To satisfy the desire for sex and/or intimacy that they are unable to meet in other ways. To satisfy a need for emotional support that they are not receiving from others. To provide them with sex that requires little or no emotional involvement. Because they are attracted to the excite ment of the illicit nature of prostitution. Because they have difficulty meeting women conventionally (e.g., feeling shy or awkward approaching women). Because they feel that most women find them unattractive. Because they do not have the time nor desire th e responsibility of a conve ntional relationship. Because it provides a less risky means of mimick ing extreme or illegal fantasies, such as incest or rape. Because they desire being \"in control\" or dominating women when having sex. Many people who have studied the problems of sex trafficking and prostitution, including practitioners who have worked in the field to assist survivors and prosecute traffickers, have independently concluded that mitigating or eliminating sexual exploitation requires attacking it at its source: consumer-level demand. Without the de mand for commercial sex, there would be no market forces producing and sustaining the roles of pimps a nd traffickers as \"distributors,\" nor would there be a force driving the production of a \"supply\" of people to be sexually exploited. Supply and distribution are symptoms; demand is the cause. Currently, the weight of the evid ence suggests that most men in the United States do not illegally buy sex. But it is not universally condemned, with a least one out of six men buy sex and similar portions 22 http://www.kptv.com/yourvote/24436864/detail.html 23 E.g., Bernstein, 2001; Farley, 2007; Farley et Hoigard & Holzman Xantidis & McCabe, 2000.

Final Report pg. 9 of some populations saying they have sold sex larg er portions saying they believe it is victimless and should be decriminalized.24 A national survey of over 13,000 U.S. children in grades seven through 12 found nearly four percent to have exchanged sex for drugs or money, which extrapolates to 650,000 teenagers who have engaged in commercial sex.25 A substantial portion of the U.S. population believes that prostitution is a harmless vice and should be decriminalized or legalized.26 This indifference, tolerance, or support can be a major impediment to institutional and individual commitment of resources to combat commercial sex. The forces that contribute to commercial sex are found in concentrated form when examining the historic relationship between the presence of the military and prostitution. A great deal of attention has been paid to the role of military personnel in fueling demand for prostitution and sex trafficking worldwide (e.g., Allred, 2006; Zimelis, 2009), throughout history and across nations. 27 Where there is a large military presence, usually one finds high levels of prostitution (e.g., Daranciang, 2010; Stensland, 2008). In the United States, for exampl e, histories of civil war army camps discuss \"travelling brothels\" that follow troop movements (K rick, 2002). Contemporary reports describe how the presence of thousands of U.S. military personne l near the border of North Korea creates a robust market for commercial sex, and that women are tr afficked from abroad to serve this market. 28 A brief discussion the historic correlation between the military, prostitution, and sex tr afficking is provided in Appendix D. Prostitution, Sex Trafficking, and Harm There are long-running debates about the level of harm resulting from illegal commercial sex, and its proper legal status. At one end of the spectrum is the position that prostitutio n is inherently harmful and should be treated as a crime.29 At the opposite end are arguments that prostitution involving adults is victimless and should be legal and re gulated like other businesses, and that commercial sex workers choose to exchange their time and services for money, as in any legitimate employment arrangement.30 Evidence can be marshaled in support of either position, and sometimes the same evidence is used to support opposing conclusions. For example, pros titution opponents point to drug abuse, community deterioration, and ancillary crime that invariably accompany street prostitution as evidence supporting criminalization. Those supporting legalization argue that these same dysfunctions are driven not by prostitution itself, but by the criminal status of the enterprise, much like alcohol prohibition fosters black markets, organized crime, and street crim e. Legalization proponents generally assume that prostitution cannot be stopped, and argue that le galized prostitution would allow commercial sex to 24 E.g., Michael et al., 1994; Monto, 1999; Sullivan and Simon, 1998; see reviews by Sanders, 2008; Weitzer, 2007. 25 Edwards, 2006; see also estimates by Estes and Weiner, 2001; Shared Hope International, 2009. 26 E.g., Cotton et al., 2000; General Social Survey, 1996; Gallup Poll, 1991. 2000; Farley, 2004; Weitzer , 2007, 2010.

Final Report pg. 10 be taxed and regulated, and the conditions for pr ostitutes improved by the same kinds of oversight and legal protections provi ded in other workplaces. However, substantial empirical evidence finds sex trafficking and prostitution to be damaging, and that deregulation and legalization do not ameliorate those harms fo r more than a small portion of providers of commercial sex. The negative consequences of prostitution and sex trafficking for all parties directly and indirectly involved are well documented. Those working in the illicit sex trade, their \"customers,\" and residents and businesses in areas in which prostitution occurs all suffer tangible harm. 31 Sexually exploited persons typically enter the illicit sex trade as minors,32 are frequently coerced or forced to engage in prostitu tion by pimps or traffickers (e.g., Chapkis, 2003; Farley et al., 2003), and are frequent victims of violent crime committed by pimps, traffickers, and sex buyers. 33 Although they are often the perpetrators of violence, the custom ers of commercial sex (\"johns\") are also vulnerable to being victimized34 and are at elevated risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases.35 Businesses are harmed when prostitution is visible, and residents suffer from the vast array of felonies and community blight that invariably co-occur with prostitution nearby.36 The market forces of prostitution also drive demand for victims of human trafficking (e.g., Hughes, 2001; Mameli, 2002). Stratification of the Commercial Sex Industry Understanding that the commercial sex \"business\" is highly stratified and segmented is a key to resolving the conflicting portrayals conveyed by proponents and opponents.37 They make the least money, are more likely to be drug addicted, subjected to violence, and otherwise distressed; those who are pimped have the least control over their wo rkload, choice of \"clients,\" and the money earned. Somewhat better conditions are generally (but not always) available to those working indoors in brothels, massage parlors, and clubs. 38 Operating at the highest levels of the commercial sex business are elite escort services, which some have referred to as serving the \"luxury prostitution\" market (e.g., Ringdal, 2004). The images of commercial sex portray ed by proponents of legalization best fit the conditions of women working as self-employed escort s or in the higher-end, more professionally run brothels and clubs (e.g., Elkind, 2010). In those market segments, some researchers and advocates argue women are less vulnerable to violence, drug addiction, and sexually transmitted diseases, and are more likely to have greater control over their \"car eers,\" to be more selective about clients, and to make (and keep) more money.39 Many anti-prostitution initiatives target street prostitution, and are 31 Campbell et al., 2003; Newman, 2006; Nixon et al., 2002; Walker, 2002. 32 Edwards, 2006; Estes and Weiner, 2002; Farley et al., 2003; Shared Hope International, 2009. 33 E.g., Baldwin, 2003; Miller & Schwartz, 1995; Potterat et al., 2004; Urban Justice Center, 2003; Zimmerman et al., 2008. 34 E.g., Flowers, 1987; Miller, 1993; Sterk & Elifson, 1990. 35 E.g., Fernandez et al., 2005; Gil, 19 96; Remple et al., 2007; Simonsen, 1988. 36 E.g., Associated Press, 2009a; Ayala & White, 2008; San Diego Police Department, 1994; Wichita Police Department, 1996. 37 E.g., Chapkis, 2000; Lowman an d Fraser, 1996; Porter and Bonilla, 2000). By all accounts, street prostitutes occupy the lowest rung on the commercial sex ladder (e.g., Sanders, 2005; Scott and Dedel, 2006. 38 E.g., Albert, 2001; Church et al., 2001; Sanders & Campbell, 2007; Whittaker & Hart, 1996. 39 E.g., Albert, 2001; Brents & Hausbeck, 2005; Jeal & Salisbury, 2007; Sanders & Campbell, 2007.

Final Report pg. 11 not structured to address prostitution occurring at va rious indoor venues, arra nged online, or provided by escorts.40 Human Trafficking and Prostitution The links between street prostitution and both dom estic and international trafficking have been confirmed by dozens of studies,41 with the market forces of prostitution driving demand for human trafficking of women and girls.42 Estimates of the overall magnitude of human trafficking into and within the United States are the subject of deba te and are derived from data and methods with substantial limitations (e.g., Clawson et al., 2006), but most researchers agree that a substantial portion of trafficking is for the purpose of comme rcial sex (Ugarte et al., 2003; Wilson & Dalton, 2007). One of the objectives pursued by advocates fo r change in how prostitution is addressed in the U.S. has been convincing law enforcement, soci al service providers, and policymakers to view prostitution as part of a much larger system of commercial sexual exploitation,43 rather than merely a local, low-level street crime. Another objective is to change the perception of pimps as either harmless or glorified business mana gers to having them seen as traffickers who use force, fraud, and/or coercion to compel service and to sexually exploit for profit. There is currently no firm answer to the question of what pr oportion of prostituted persons in any given area in the U.S. have been trafficked intern ationally or domestically, pimped locally, or are engaging in prostitution inde pendently. While these distinctions are crucial for those involved in prosecuting pimps and traffickers, or serving the providers of commercial sex, the distinctions are relatively unimportant for attacking demand for st reet prostitution. People engaged in prostitution independently or because they are pimped or trafficked serve the same market, and if that market is weakened by reducing demand, there will be an impact on both trafficking and prostitution. Vulnerable Women and Girls Drawn Into Prostitution Most studies find the average age of entr y into prostitution to be between 12 and 16,44 and the vulnerabilities leading girls and young women into comme rcial sex often conspire to keep them there. Women and girls drawn or forced into prostitution typically are economically and emotionally vulnerable, with most having been scarred by chil dhood sexual and physical abuse and other forms of 40 The arrests of virtually all john school participants result from \"reverse stings\" in which female police officers pose as street prostitutes. Nothing else about the program would preclude it from serving male customers of escorts or brothels, or commercial sex arranged online. Police operations supply john schools with participants, and the range of their operations di ctates the types of offenders and types of prostitution that are addressed. In the U.S., this has limited the program primarily to serving men seeking street prostitutes, and nearly all of them men arrested have solicited adult police decoys posing as street prostitutes. None of the john schools accept men arrest ed for soliciting sex from children. Such men would be ineligible, and are never referred also because the pool from which john school participants are drawn is men soliciting sex from adults in reverse stings. 41 E.g., see reviews by Farr, 2005; Leidholt, 2003; O'Connor & Healy, 2006. 42 E.g., Farley, 2003; Hughes, 2001; International Human Rights Law Institute, 2003; Joe-Cannon, 2006; Mameli, Farr, 2005; McGill, 2003; United Nations, 2006. 44 Boyer et al., 1993; Estes and Weiner, 2002; Farley et al., 2003; Shannon et al., 2009; Silbert and Pines, 1982.

Final Report pg. 12 dysfunction in the home.45 For example, Farley et al. (2003) found that 63% of the prostituted women they interviewed in nine countries had been sexually abused as children, and 57% of the U.S. respondents also reported childhood physical abuse. Similarly, McIntyre (1999) found the majority of prostituted persons have a histor y of sexual and physical abuse (82% and 75%, respectively). Traumatic childhood experiences contribute to prosti tution via homelessness and a lack of economic self-sufficiency. Sexually and physically abused chil dren are at an increased risk of running away,46 and women and girls who are unable to sustain them selves financially are highly vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Providers of commercial sex are found to have high levels of childhood truancy, poor education, poor employment sk ills, and debt (e.g., Crime and Misconduct Commission, 2004; Walker, 2002a; Weisberg, 1985). Studies repeatedly fi nd that among the most important predictors of prostitution are running away from home and homelessness.47 The Minnesota Attorney General's Office (1999) found that many youths are approached for sex within 48 hours of becoming homeless. Many runaway and homeless yout h are too inexperienced, unskille d, drug involved, traumatized, and/or young to maintain legitimate employment, and may turn to prostitution to survive. \"I was raped and sexually abused before I was th ree years old, and it never stopped. I was having sex before I even knew what it was, before I even kn ew the language, or had words to describe it. By the time I was a teenager and started developing my own sexuality, I had no idea what real intimacy was. I was promiscuous and started selling sex - why not get paid for it? Then the pimps noticed me, and I had to do it for them. Much lat er I realized I was acting out, trying to hide the pain deep inside me. I was trying to forget what I couldn't remember. I covered it up with sex, drugs, looking for love but not knowing how, or wh at it looked or felt like. I thought I loved the pimps, but they just used me. It was so easy to ma nipulate me - I was lost. At the time, I did not even remember what happened to me as a small child , or thought of it as wrong. I was too young to know what it was, but it was all I knew... since I was a baby, I was there to provide sex to men, in my family or anyone else.\" Trafficking survivor, speaking in San Francisco FOPP \"John School\" class, 2007 Impact on \"Providers\" Once drawn into commercial sex, pr ostituted persons are at high risk for many kinds of additional trauma.48 One study found that the vast majority of women and girls trafficked internationally are physically (95%) and sexually (59%) abused while being trafficked (Zimmerman et al., 2008).

The most common causes of death were, in order: homicide, suicide, drug- and alcohol-related problems, HIV infection, and accidents. The homicide rate among women actively engaged in prostitution was seventeen times greater than the rate for age-ma tched females in the general popula tion (Potterat et al., 2004). After reviewing the literature and analyzing nine diffe rent data sets, Brewer and colleagues (2006) concluded that prostituted women \"...have the highest homicide victimization rate of any set of women ever studied.\" \"It put me in a place where it was really easy for someone to come in and victimize me.

Twelve hundred opport unities to catch AIDS (and) 1,200 opportunities to get killed.\" Jeri Williams, survivor and a program coordinator for the City of Portland, Oregon, 201149 Numerous studies have found that the majority of pr ostituted persons become victims of violent crime committed by customers, pimps, and/or traffickers.50 Surveys in the United States have found 73% to 92% of prostituted women to have been raped while providing commercial sex, and 59% of victims to have been raped more than five times (Farley, 2003; Parriot, 1994; Williamson & Flagon, 2001). Involvement in prostitution is also linked to a vari ety of health problems, including tuberculosis, HIV, STDs, anemia, and hepatitis.51 Rates of infectious disease are from five to 60 times higher among providers of commercial sex than in general populations (Jeal a nd Salisbury, 2004). In a national survey of U.S. school children, twenty percent of the girls who were prostituted reported that they had had a sexually transmitted infection, compared with four percent of girls in the group who had never exchanged sex for money or drugs (Edwards et al, 2006). The physical traumas resulting from commercial sex often lead to psychological distr ess, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.52 Non-assaultive commercial sex can also be traumatic, especially for underage girls newly involved in prostitution. For example, one study found that 90 % of a sample of prostituted women and girls had lost their virginity in an act of commercial sex (Silbert, 1984). Although some work independently, studies find that up to 80% of samples of women and girls serving as prostitutes had been coerced or forced to engage in prostitution by pimps or traffickers.53 In a comparison of female prostitutes with pimps to those without, Norton-Hawk (2004) found that pimp-controlled victims of sexual exploitation were more likely to have an inadequate education, to be chronically unemployed, and to have been you nger when they first had intercourse, tried drugs, and engaged in prostitution. Women with pimps usually have financial quotas to meet, and are subjected to many forms of manipulation and abuse designed to keep them under control and 49 http://www.kptv.com/yourvote/24436864/detail.html 50 Baldwin, 2003; Hunter, 1994; Miller, 1995; Mille r & Schwartz, 1995; Nixon et 2002; Raphael & Shapiro, 2004; Fedec, 1999; Urban Justice Center, 2003; Valera, 2000; Walker, 2002. 51 E.g., Campbell et al., 2003; Farley et al., 2003; McDo nnell et al., 1998; Nixon et al., 2002; Walker, 2002a; Wood et al., 2007. 52 E.g., Campbell et al., 2003; Farl ey et Farley et al., 2003; Raphael & Shapiro, 2002; Raymond et al., 2001.

Final Report pg. 14 generating money.54 Prostituted persons often keep little of the money they generate: Scott (2002) reports that pimps take an estimated 60% to 70% of the money earned, and substance-involved persons often spend much of the remainder toward satisfying addictions. Prostituted women in Nevada's legal brothels keep less than half of thei r earnings after paying half to the brothel, paying various fees and charges for food and supplies, tipping support staff, and paying pimps (Albert, 2001). \"When I was in the back seat of your car and you were on top of me, when I was giving you [oral sex], I couldn't use my own voice to tell you what I really felt. But when you touched me, my skin crawled. I hated it. I hated it. I was scared. I was in pain. I felt violated. I didn't care about you. I just wanted one more hit of crack so I didn't have to feel like I felt when I was 12 years old. This isn't a victimless crime. I haven't turned a trick in 15 years and I am still healing.\" Survivor speaking in Worcester, Massachusetts john school class, 2009 Studies have found that most women engaged in prostitu tion want to exit \"the life,\" but the emotional and physical harm resulting from commercial sex, compounding pre-existing vulnerabilities, can make leaving difficult. Farley & Barkan (1998) found 88% of a sample of female providers of commercial sex in San Francisco reported a desire to leave prostitution. Compromised health, addiction, PTSD, and a lack of employment skills can narrow options for developing financial self- sufficiency, and this creates dependency upon pros titution as a means of support, and perpetuates dependency upon pimps. After years of manipula tion and exploitation, women who have been controlled by pimps and traffickers can have di fficulty separating (e.g., Kramer, 2003). Pimps and traffickers will use combinations of force, manipula tion, and intimidation to maintain control of what, for them, is simply a financial asset.55 Raymond and colleagues (2001) found more than half of the women who tried to leave prostitution were threatened , stalked, abused, and/or forcibly returned. \"I had been going to juvenile halls, jails, psychiatric hospitals, emergency rooms and drug treatment programs since I was 12. No one ever as ked me about my life, about prostitution, being beaten, raped or kidnapped. I was just a whore, a criminal. How could I get out? No one ever treated me like a person. No one asked me if I hurt or why. I experienced sexual abuse including child prostitution... I had been brutally assau lted... I had been homeless... I suffered severe symptoms of PTSD and I desperately wanted to get out of prostitution and a life that made no sense to me.\" Norma Hotaling, sex trafficking survivor, 200256 54 Albert, 2001; & Finstad, 1994; Kennedy et 2007; Maher, 1996; Miller and Schwartz, 1995; Royal, 1998; Schwartz et al., 2007; Sterks, 20 00; Williams, 2007; Williamson & Cluse-Tolar, 2002. 55 E.g., Kennedy et al., 2007; Maher, 1996; O'Connor, 2004; Royal, 1998; Williamson & Cluse-Tolar, 2002. 56 Presentation to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice, December 13, 2002.

Final Report pg. 15 Pre-existing conditions, subsequent traumas, and market forces converge to keep women and girls involved in commercial sex. Those who were not in itially addicted to drugs often become addicted soon after becoming involved in prostitution (Chapkis, 2000; Kramer, 2003). Drug addiction and poverty serve to keep prostituted women and girls d estabilized and dependent. Substance abuse is a factor in both the initiation and persistence of prostitution.57 The trauma experienced by prostituted persons can result in greater dependence on drugs (Romero-Daza et al., 2003; Silbert et al., 1982), both as a means of self-medicating (Hwang & Bedford, 2004; Kramer, 2003) and to support a drug habit (Nixon et al., 2002), sometimes through exchanging sex for drugs (O'Leary & Howard, 2001). Interactions among prostitution, abuse (physical, sexual, and emotional), addiction, compromised health, diminished self-sufficiency skills, and othe r dysfunctions can send the lives of survivors in a downward spiral from which exit becomes progressively more difficult. \"People say it's a victimless crime, but what's vi ctimless about it? You got a girl beat up or drugged into becoming a prostitute, or who di d it because her mom was a prostitute. There are drug debts... Most girls aren't happy about what they do. And pimps beat them up if they don't make enough. Is it really victimless?\" Sgt. Anthony Bejaran, Stanislaus County, California, Sheriff's Department, 200858 Impact on \"Consumers\" While the providers of commercial sex suffer the mo st serious consequences, the consumers are also negatively affected. Although they are more often the perpetrators of violence, johns are also vulnerable to being victimized. Their involvement in a criminal act makes it unlikely that they will report victimization that occurs while they are w ith prostitutes. Prostituted persons and pimps are fully aware of this and some take advantage of the opportunity by \"setting up\" johns for robbery and assault (e.g., Ayala & White, 2008; Flowers, 1987; Miller, 1993). For example, Sterk & Elifson (1990) found that two-thirds of prostitutes in A tlanta and New York admitted to having robbed johns; Arnold and colleagues (2001) found 56% of the pr ostituted persons they st udied reported having assaulted clients for reasons other than self-defense. In addition to criminal victimization, johns are at elevated risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases.59 Johns frequently seek and pay a premium for unprotected intercourse and oral sex (e.g., Jeal and Salisbury, 2004; Strathdee et al., 2008), which greatly increases the risks of contracting and spreading STIs, HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis and more.60 Surveys of prostituted women find that those insisting on always using condoms face income lo sses of up to 79%, because most customers prefer 57 Hwang & Bedford, 2004; Farley et al., 2003; Campbell et al., 2003; Kramer, 2003; Maher and Daly, 1996; McClanahan et al., 1999; Potterat al., 1998; & Singer, 2003; Silbert, Pines, & Linch, 1982; Urban Justice Center, 2003; Walker, 2002a. 58 http://www.modbee.com/2008/01/06/171 676/nights-on-ninth-street.html 59 E.g., Fernandez et 2005; Gil, 19 et al., 2007; Rolfs et al., 1990; Simonsen, 1988; Ward et al., 2005. 60 E.g., Decker et al., 2008; Fernandez et al., 20 05; Gil, 1996; Remple et al., 2007; Simonsen, 1988.

Final Report pg. 16 sex without condoms (Rao et al., 2003). Between 35% and 55% of samples of prostituted women said they had engaged in unprotected commercia l sex, and 10 to 35% never use condoms while engaging in commercial sex.61 Disturbingly, surveys have found that just 47% of prostituted women know whether or not they are HIV-positive, less than half had health screenings in the prior year despite having sex with an average of 17 differe nt men per week, and 45% were infected with hepatitis C (Jeal and Salisbury, 2004; Rhode Island Family Life Center, 2009). Other research has found clients of brothels to have unprotected sex with both the women in brothels and their wives and other sex partners, provi ding an infectious disease \"bridge\" betw een commercial sex markets and the general population (e.g., Decker et al., 2008; Gomes do Espirito Santo & Etheridge, 2005). \"I've seen johns who have also been the victims of ADW [assault with a dangerous weapon], stabbings, shootings and robberies. A lot of johns tend to get robbed both by potential prostitutes and by people who victimize both the prostitutes and the johns because they feel they are easy victims who are not going to report their crimes to the police.\" Lt. John Haines, Washington, DC Metropolitan Police, 4th District, 201062 \"Both sides of the coin \u2014 whether it is the girl who is getting robbed or the john getting robbed \u2014 are vastly underreported because you've got an awkward situation. How [are] you going to explain it to the police; how [are] you going to explain it to your loved one?\" Lt. Terry Pasko, Akron, Ohio Police Department vice squad, 201163 Impact on Communities Prostitution is associated with higher crime rates and other forms of community degradation.64 Among the immediate safety problems are used condom s, syringes, and other health hazards left in public areas where prostitution occurs (see review by Scott & Dedel, 2006). A survey in Hudson County, New Jersey found that 23% of respondents to said that they live in an area in which prostitution is a problem (NJ.com, 2008). Surveys of business owners and community organizations find that street prostitution negatively affects lo cal businesses and lowers the quality of life within communities (e.g., Russell, 2006; see also Associ ated Press, 2009a). Collaborative problem-solving efforts over the past 20 years have repeatedly dete rmined prostitution to be among the higher-priority problems plaguing communities throughout the nation (Sampson & Scott, 1999). For example, Web searches and literature reviews conducted by our ev aluation team have identified more than 30 communities that have targeted prostitution as a focus of their \"Weed and Seed\" initiatives. 65 A study by the Justice Research and Sta tistics Association found that 32% of the 19 Weed and Seed sites 61 E.g., Hong-Jing, 2004; Jeal and Salisbury, 2004; Peralta et al., 1992; Rhode Island Family Life Center, 2009; Strathdee et al., 2008. 62 http://www.wusa9.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=107960&catid=187 63 http://www.ohio.com/news/local/online-pr ostitution-ads-popular-in-akron-1.252768 64 Ayala & White, 2008; San Diego Police Department, 1994; Wichita Police Department 65 \"Weed and Seed\" is a community-based strategy sp onsored by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), featuring proactive problem-solving and comprehensive multiagency approaches to law enforcement, crime prevention, and community revitalization. http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ccdo/ws/welcome.html This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 17 targeted prostitution as a focus of their local initiatives (O'Connell et al., 2004). More than a dozen nominees and winners of Goldstein Awards fro m the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing66 have named prostitution as a high priority issue, sought grant support, and have developed collaborative responses. In our National Assessment, we found th at at least 68% of police operations leading to prostitution arrests are driven by community compla ints, which include female residents and business customers not involved in prostitution being soli cited by johns (sometimes aggressively); used condoms and syringes on doorsteps and lawns; and fi ghts between pimps, johns, and/or people selling sex. In addition, research on adult-oriented busin esses such as strip clubs or adult books and video stores has found crime rates to increase when such businesses open, and to decrease when they close (e.g., McCleary, 2008). \"Prostitutes were stopping cars and blocking traffic, asking if the male drivers wanted a date. Collateral crimes, including theft, robbery, assaults , and 'john rolling' caused a significant draw on police resources. Complaints were received from local merchants, citizens and members of the city council, making this problem the numb er one priority for enforcement action by the Champaign Police Department.\" Chase Leonhard, police office r in Champaign, Illinois, 199967 Burden on Law Enforcement and Other Public Services Most crime statutes in U.S. states as well as abro ad categorize common street prostitution involving adults as a low-level misdemeanor, public nuisance cr ime. Advocates of legalization of prostitution view it as a victimless crime, while others see the community where soliciting occurs as the \"victim\" because prostitution negatively affects neighborhoods and attracts other criminal activity. These perspectives have led many cities to enforcement po licies oriented to accomplishing short-terms goals of cleaning up particular street corners and business districts; cities often to lerate prostitution activity confined to restricted locations. Frequently, enforcement activities involve arresting prostitutes followed by short-term punishment and no provis ion of services. Thus, police departments and district attorneys' offices process a large number of recidivist prostitutes with unaddressed service needs, but prosecute few johns. Prostitution places a substantial burden on the crimin al justice system and on providers of public health and social services. One study conducted in the 1980s found that 16 U.S. cities each spent an average of $15.3 million in one year for prostitution control (Pearl, 1987), adjusting expressed in 2010 dollars. More recently, Allard and Herbon (2003) estimated that prostitution arrests in 2001 cost the city of Chicago over $10.6 million (in 2007 dollars). Those involved in prostitution are typically in need of other public services. As discussed, prostituted persons are often sexually assaulted, and victims of sexual assault present an array of service needs ranging from the need for employment; refuge fro m abusers; child care; and legal advocacy to 66 See http://www.popcenter.org/library-goldstein-application-07.htm for a list of Goldstein Award nominees and winners. 67 http://www.popcenter.org/library /reading/PDFs/5Tackling.pdf This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 18 addressing psychological problems resulting from sexual violence.68 They also are at high risk for a host of physical and mental health problems, in cluding drug addiction, STD infection, PTSD, and injuries from violent crimes.69 Those supporting themselves exclusively through commercial sex are usually uninsured, and seek cost ly, reactive health care services at emergency rooms and public health care providers. Since many prostituted women and girls have children, they also are high-end users of the foster care system and child protective services. \"Some of the areas in the city where we have the greatest number of calls for service are the same areas where we have the greatest level of prostitution activity.\" Lt. Mark West, Rockford, Illinois Police Department, 2010 Challenges in Constraining Supply & Distribution Most of the communities that pursue strategies focusing on demand have arrived at that position because they have found sanctioning \"providers\" to be ineffective,70 and because they have difficulty successfully prosecuting \"distributors\" (pimps and tr affickers). Attempts to identify and prosecute pimps are particularly difficult. Women involved in prostitution are typically reluctant to cooperate with police in investigations of pimps or traffickers, or when police investigate violence against them by johns or pimps (e.g., Killan, 2008). Reasons for this reluct ance include having destructive experiences with officers who have abused them (e.g., Thukrul & Ditmore, 2003), and protecting their pimps or traffickers due to \"trauma bonding\" or \"Stockholm Syndrome\" (e.g., Graham et al., 1994; Lloyd, 2011). While the basic exchange of money for sex has oc curred throughout history, the methods used to solicit and arrange commercial sex (and for evadi ng law enforcement efforts to combat it) are constantly evolving and presenting new challe nges. As new communication technologies have emerged, they have been used to transact commercial sex and present new obstacles for law enforcement. With the advent of web-based so licitation, sexual exploitation is becoming more decentralized. Over the past decade, police depart ments nationwide have noticed a sharp increase in the use of the Internet for soliciting prostitution. 71 It is unknown whether this has expanded the sex market, or simply caused a shift from one segment (str eet) to another (online). In San Francisco, for example, vice unit officers argue that there has been a shift in prostitution from the street and toward the web, which has resulted in fewer solicitati ons made through contact on the street. 68 Baskin & Sommers 1998; Brownstein et al. 1995; Parriott, 1994; Ritchie 2000; Spunt et al. 1994. 69 E.g., Crime and Misconduct Commission, 2004; Council for Prostitution Alternatives, 1991; 2002; Stark & Hodgson, 2003; Widom & Kuhns, 1996; Walker, 2002. 70 E.g., 2008; Steffensmeier 2004; Norton-Hawk, 2001; LaPeter, 2005; Roane, 1998; Ross, 2005; Sanders, 2008.

Final Report pg. 19 Aside from Backpage and other online versions of classified advertisements, there are other web- based avenues used for the business of selling sex. Recent reports suggest that Facebook is quickly becoming an important tool for transacting commercial sex, particularly for escort services with stable client bases (e.g., Venkatesh, 2011). One report we encountered suggests that online gaming systems provide other web-based avenues for transacting commercial sex. 72 Prostitution is reportedly being solicited through Xbox's Microsoft Live, a video game and social networking site tied to Microsoft's gaming system. What makes the platform attractive for online solicitations is that Xbox Live can be linked to most other social netw orking services. Users can access Twitter and Facebook accounts and can also communicate directly with other users. In addition to providing an avenue for solicitation, the Internet is also used by consumers of commercial sex to communicate with one another a nd interfere with law enforcement efforts (e.g., Albert, 2001; Sanders, 2008). Dedicated websit es cater to customers of the sex trade (e.g., bigdoggie.net; usasexguide.info; nvbrothels.net; see discussion by Shaffer, 2008), including posting tips on how to avoid arrest and sharing informati on about police decoy operations (e.g., Holt et al., 2007). San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) vice officers have monitored commercial sex websites while reverse stings are occurring on city streets, and have seen johns post warnings describing the undercover officers and the location of the operation (Shively et al., 2008). SFPD officers report that alerts about reverse stings are pos ted within an hour of the start of an operation. Another relatively recent development is the \"qui ck hit\" brothel that leverages mobile phone technology and the web (e.g., Jeffreys, 2010). The b asic concept is that space can be rented for a temporary brothel, and text messages, tweets, or calls can go out to regular \"customers,\" alerting them to the location and the short timeframe of the brothe l's operation. Before police have time to receive tips or otherwise detect them, the brothel has run its course and moved elsew here. Another related system is the use of pimps or \"pimp assistants\" work ing in the taxi or hotel industries. In New York City, for example, pimps use cab drivers as assi stants, taking customers to women engaged in prostitution. 73 This mobile and flexible form of opera tion appears to be better suited to evading police than fixed locations such as nail sal ons and other storefront brothels. Such innovation in developing methods of evading law enforcement is common in any illicit market where demand is strong, and where large profits can be made. Our interviews with law enforcement and survivors are consistent with the research a nd anecdotal evidence cited above. There are also lessons to be drawn from experience dealing with other illicit markets. There is a vast body of research on U.S. and international efforts to comb at the illicit drug trade, and the weight of the evidence clearly points to one conclusion: enfor cement efforts focusing on supply and distribution can produce temporarily, marginal, and or localized impacts on drug trafficking, but the drug trade thrives nonetheless and problems surrounding these effort s may be exacerbated by them, rather than ameliorated.74 While there are modest benefits and tactical victories, the overall magnitude of the 72 http://www.tmrzoo.com/?p=14599 73 http://www.metro.us/newyork/local/article/10508 18--brothels-on-wheels- drivers-to-be-penalized http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2011/dec/14 /debate-over-how-dismantle-sex-trafficking-puts- focus-car-services/ 74 and reviews by, e.g., Anderson, 1998; Dave, 2007; The Drug Policy Alliance, 2010; Felbab- Brown, 2010; Goode, 1997; Grossman et al., 2002; MacCoun and Reuter, 2001; McBride al., Council, 2001; Reiman , 1990; Sharp, 1994; Walker, 2005.

Final Report pg. 20 drug trade and harms caused by addiction and colla teral crime remain robust, after decades spent pursuing a strategy of aggressively attacking su pply and distribution and de-emphasizing reducing demand. Evidence abounds showing that attacki ng demand for narcotics is effective and cost- effective (e.g., Basu et al., 2007; Wood, 2010). \"It is an open secret that delivery [of customers to women engaged in prostitution] has become a preferred method for promoting prostitution in New York City, as seen clearly in the advertisements from this morning's Spanish language newspapers.\" Lori Cohen, senior staff atto rneys, Sanctuary for Families, 201175 \"Three or four people might move into town litera lly on a weekend and engage in some of this business and then move out. As they come into to wn they post their ad, they do their business and then they take it down and they leave.\" Olmsted County Attorney Mark Ostrem, 201176 The experiences of law enforcement in addressing prostitution and sex trafficking, as well as other illicit markets such as those for illegal drugs, indicate th at little lasting, substantial impact results from strategies heavily focusing on supply and distribution. If law enforcement were suddenly to increase its commitment to arresting pimps and traffickers, and if it began to have greater success against them, it is likely that traffickers would adapt by changing tactics or replacing those arrested as long as demand for their \"product\" remained strong. If enforcement efforts were enhanced, the less organized and less competent small-time pimps may be the first to succumb to law enforcement, but may be replaced by more highly co ordinated human trafficking, drug trafficking, or organized crime networks. Alternatively, the same pimps and traffickers could change tactics to avoid whatever was working for police. We have encountered no evidence to suggest that tightening enforcement against distributors of commercial sex will solve the probl em, although it is a necessary complementary piece within a comprehensive strategy. Our observation about the limited impact likely to be achieved through efforts to curtail supply and distribution does not mean we are advocating less en forcement. The point we are making is that those efforts will be most effective when coupled with rigorous enforcement and education activity focusing on demand. 75 http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2011/dec/14 /debate-over-how-dismantle-sex-trafficking-puts- focus-car-services/ 76 http://kaaltv.com/article/stories/S2237365.shtml?cat=10219 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 22 programs (e.g., Akron, OH; Indianapolis, IN; Norfo lk, VA); \"shaming\" offenders by publicly posting their names and photos (e.g., Baton Rouge, LA; Chi cago, IL; New York, NY); and sending letters to arrestee's homes (e.g., Arlington, TX; Raleigh, NC; Worcester, MA). There are at least twelve distinct types of interventions that have been developed and implemented to combat demand, and variations within each type. As an overview, the basic typology we have developed and some key details about each type are outlined below. These in terventions are examined in greater detail in the remainder of the chapter. Reverse stings, street-level o Police officers pose as women engaged in street-level prostitution. o The average support team consists of about six officers for each decoy. o Smaller departments may borrow female offi cers from other departments if they do not have enough officers to serve as effective decoys. o Variation : Some police departments conduct reve rse stings at venues such as truck stops and events that draw large numbers of men. Reverse stings, web-based o Police post decoy advertisements online, a nd set up reverse stings at a hotel or apartment. o Variation : Police respond to real online ads, replace prostituted persons with police decoys at the hotel or apartment, and con tinue making appointments with johns using the survivor's phone. o Variation : Women police decoys respond to online ads placed by johns seeking sex with prostituted persons. Reverse stings, brothel-based o Police investigate brothels, make arrests, replace brothel staff with decoys, and the decoys continue fielding calls and serving \"walk-in\" johns in order to make arrests. Shaming - publicizing identities o Police publicize identities of arrested johns via news outlets, police websites, and billboards. o Variation : Citizen-initiated websites publicize id entities of arrested johns, or those suspected of being johns through citi zen observations of street activity. Shaming - \"Dear John\" letters o Letters are sent to addresses of registered car owners, alerting owners that their car was seen in area known for prostitution, and warning them about legal and other consequences of engaging in prostitution. o Variation : Letters can be sent to arrestee's home address, in addition to other penalties. Seizing autos used to solicit sex o Vehicles used in the commission of crime can be seized, usually pursuant to municipal ordinances allowing auto seizure. o To retrieve vehicles, johns m ust pay an impound fee, tow fee, and/or fines that range (collectively) from about $500 to $2000. o Variation : Some communities allow for seized vehicles to be forfeited and sold at auction as part of the penalty for the offense, or as the result of failure to pay the fees and fines necessary to reclaim vehicles.

Final Report pg. 23 o In some jurisdictions, arrestees may have thei r driver's license suspended if they used a vehicle in the commission of a crime, including soliciting sex from women police decoys. Geographic exclusion zones ( also called \"Stay Out of Areas with Prostitution\" or \"SOAP\" orders) o Arrested johns are prohibited from visiting areas with known prostitution activity, and/or the vicinity of their arrest. Public education and awareness programs o These initiatives are proactive efforts to e ducate men and boys about prostitution and sex trafficking, usually encouraging them not to contribute to sexual exploitation by purchasing sex. Neighborhood action o To be counted for this study, neighborhood action must be a community-led initiative that is organized and routinized as a program or process, rather than being an ad hoc occurrence. o Examples of neighborhood action include programs for forwarding tips to police; citizen patrols; citizen-led blogs; or billboard campaigns. o Variation : Some neighborhood organizations participate in community impact panels or make presentations in john schools. \"John school\" education or treatment programs for arrestees o The fundamental component of john school programs is an education intervention for men arrested for soliciting sex o The most common john school model is structured as a diversion program, resulting in dismissed charges, and the education is delivered in a one-day, one-time class. o The average fee or fine for a john school is about $400, providing revenue that normally fully covers program costs and of ten produces excess revenue used to fund survivor recovery programs. o A typical john school curriculum includes sections on: health consequences impact on communities impact on survivors (usually including presentations by survivors) impact on johns, including crime victimization risks legal consequences o Variations: Number of sessions. Some john schools are structured as multiple- session classes, or as a set of group or individual counseling sessions. o Variation: Sentence versus diversion. About one-third of U.S. john schools are structured to be a condition of a sentence, rather than a diversion. Participation is mandatory rather than voluntary, and does not result in dismissed charges. o Variation : Video john school. The Cook County Sheriff's Department (Illinois) has produced a \"video john school,\" a DVD pr esented to arrested johns as they are being processed and in other locations. o Variation : Roadside john school. The Tucson Police Departm ent (Arizona) implemented a \"roadside john school\" for two years. The Safety Through Deterrence (STD) program featured police delivering a set of speaking points and handouts to men suspected of soliciting sex from women engaged in prostitution.

Final Report pg. 24 o Variations : Educational content. The class content varies widely across programs, and can include many topics in addition to those in the basic curriculum outlined above, e.g.: anger management, domestic violence, STI screening and counseling, sexual addiction, healthy rela tionships, substance abuse, human trafficking, policing prostitution. Community service programs for arrestees o Like community service programs for any offe nders, arrested johns can be ordered to perform community service to meet conditions of a diversion protocol or a sentence. o Arrested johns in community service progr ams are often ordered to clean streets where prostitution is known to occur. o For most johns, community service obligations range from four to 40 hours, and are coupled with other sanctions such as fines, fees, and/or john schools. Surveillance cameras o To be counted as a demand-focused tactic in this study, cameras must be used to deter men from soliciting women involved in prostitution, or to provide evidence used against johns o Some cameras are used as a deterrent, with no effort to conceal them and signs posted that alert johns to their presence. o Some cameras are used covertly, as a tool for gathering evidence for prosecutors The Prevalence and First Known Use of Demand Reduction Tactics in the United States From our interviews, literature, and web searches in ne ws archives, we have compiled lists of sites in which demand reduction tactics have been employed. A summary of findings is presented in Table 3.1. As can be seen here, the most widespr ead demand reduction strategy is the police decoy operation, or reverse sting. We have identified over 826 sites in the U.S. that have conducted reverse stings.82 A complete list of sites with a tally of th e anti-demand approaches that have been employed in each is presented in Appendix E. Demand reduction efforts have operated in the Distri ct of Columbia and 49 states (Vermont is the only exception). Table 3.2 presents the number of cities and counties within each state that have conducted reverse stings, and most of those have employed at least one other demand-reduction tactic. Prostitution and sex trafficking are not strictly ur ban problems (and with the advent of web-based solicitation, are becoming even more decentralized), and many small towns had a need to address prostitution that was substantial enough devote the resources necessary to conduct police decoy operations targeting johns. Seventy-one towns with populations under 10, 000 have conducted reverse sting operations (including one to wn, Jefferson, WV, with a pop ulation of under 600), and 449 communities with populations under 75,000 have target ed johns in that manner. For the set of 724 82 Since the data are frequently changing, we had to \"freeze\" the data at the end of September, 2011 so it could be analyzed and tallied in such a way that the numbers would be consistent across tables and calculations. During October and November, we have l earned about additional sites and reverse stings. Up to date tallies will be kept on the Demand Forum website.

In this project, the review of news archives revealed that reverse stings had been conducted in several citi es in the 1960s, the first of which occurred in Nashville in 1964. We also learned that the av erage year of first use was 1989, among the 347 cities and counties in which we could establish dates for th e first occurrence of reverse stings. We were also surprised by how early the other kinds of inte rventions had been employed. The year of first known use of each tactic, and the sites where each occurred, are listed in Table 3.5. The early applications of these tactics will be discussed in descriptions provided on the DemandForum.net website. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Johns must first be arrested in order for john schools, community service programs, geographic exclusion zones, and several other tactics to be appl ied. The means by whic h the vast majority of johns are arrested is through reverse stings, whic h have been established as the primary method of producing the evidence necessary to satisfy criminal justice requirements that the illegal purchase of sex has occurred. Table 3.6 presents the percentag es of cities and counties that employ post-arrest tactics. Shaming, or publicizing the identity of arr estees, occurs in nearly 60% of arrests. Other sanctions or programs are applied relatively rarely. After the decision to cite or arrest is made, offenders in jurisdictions with criminal justice diversion programs for johns are issued a citation and informed of their responsibility to call the prosecutor's office for processing (either a city attorney's offi ce when johns are cited for violating municipal ordinances, or the district attorney's office wh en johns are arrested for committing a penal code violation).

We have counted as an awareness program any broadly-targeted attempt to focus attention on the role of the buyers of sex in contributing to problems associated with prostitution and/or sex trafficking. In some communities, such efforts involve posting signs or billboards informing johns about police activity or penalties for buying sex. For example, Rochester, New York put up billboards reading, \"Dear John, you're not welcome in our community.\" In Cleveland, there was a neighborhood-initiated campaign targeting johns in which residents took turns carryi ng signs in troubled neighborhoods stating, \"Dear Johns, your plate number is being recorded. Yours truly, the neighbors.\" This kind of approach is designed to deter buyers, and secondarily, to send a general message to the public about police action to address the problem, rather than to educat e about demand to any real depth. Another approach is to aim awareness efforts at the general public, rather than to actual or potential johns. This usually involves placing signs or posters for the public to see, or brief presentations about demand at meetings of community groups. We have considered an education program to be a more intensive and sustained effort to convey a larger amount of information. An example would be a curriculum developed to teach high school students or employees of a company about how buying sex drives prostitution and sex trafficking, and the negative consequences. While most experts agree that public education a nd awareness are critical to combating prostitution and sex trafficking, there are relatively few examples of programs designed specifically to address demand for commercial sex, when compared to the number of programs addressing supply and distribution. We have found some form of an ti-demand awareness or education activity to have occurred in at least 67 cities and counties. The earliest known efforts, which were awareness efforts rather than more intensive education programs, occurred in the 1980s (Table 3.7). The primary means of raising awareness and providing education include: Posters Billboards Brief presentations at community meetings Interviews appearing in print and electronic media Education programs, involving a curriculum and a sustained presentation to target audiences that conveys substantial amounts of information This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Most other communities have engaged in less extensive camp aigns, and have used simpler methods. For example Rochester New York put up billboards reading, \"Dear John, you're not welcome in our community.\" In Cleveland, there was a neighborhood initiated campaign targeting johns in which residents took turns carrying signs in troubled neighborhoods stating, \"Dear Johns, your plate number is being recorded. Yours truly, the neighbors.\" In San Antonio, a neighborhood-initiated campaign involved residents taking photos of johns in cars, recording license plate numbers, and sending the photos and information to police. Of the cities and counties that we know have engaged in some fo rm of education or awareness intervention targeting demand, the vast majority are designed to raise awareness. There are very few efforts that would meet more rigorous standard of programs with substantial educational content. A set of curricula or \"toolkits\" developed by the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation (CAASE), and a program developed by the U.S. Department of Defense are among the few true education programs we have found. These programs are discussed below. Example: Atlanta's \"Dear John\" Public Awareness Program The best-known and most ambitious public awareness campaign addressing demand is the \"Dear John\" campaign implemented in the greater Atlant a area. The involved a series of professionally- produced public service announcements and print medi a images that were circulated via the web, television, in print media, and signs posted in public areas (such as buses) in Atlanta. The \"Dear John\" campaign was initiated by the Mayor's Office of the City of Atlanta and was designed to provide a platform to raise public awareness on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation (of children in particular, but also mo re broadly). The objective was to generate public and political pressure to spur state and local agenci es (as well as nongovernmental organizations, such This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The substantive focus of campaign was on the buyers of sex and reducing demand. Figure 3.1: Main Print Media Message for Atlanta's \"Dear John\" Public Education and Awareness Campaign The idea for a public education and awaren ess campaign focusing on demand was built into recommendations of a study of prostitution and sex trafficking in Atlanta (Priebe & Suhr, 2005). After the study's release in 2005, the Mayor's Office reached out to a public relations firm (Edelman), which agreed to assist the city in de veloping the \"Dear John\" ca mpaign, pro bono. The Edelman firm and the Mayor's Office developed themes and text for print media messages, and a nonprofit organization, Atlanta Women in Film, produced three 30-second public service announcements (PSAs), pro bono. The campaigns produc ts were released to the public in 2006. A PSA featuring the mayor was taken to local televisi on stations that ran it for free during slow media times, and was also available on the city's website. \"Dear John\" print ads were placed without charge This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 32 in several local publications. Links to the PSAs are provided in this footnote83, and print messages used for paper ads, billboards, and elsewhere are presented in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. The national press discovered and featured the campaign, and the \"buzz\" helped the city to secure $100,000 from a private foundation to extend the reach of Dear John to paid advertising in the city's major publications. In 2007, one of the public service announcements won an Emmy award for \"Best PSA,\" which allowed the city to leverage another summer of free air time with public service directors at the three major networks in Atlanta. In 2007, Atlanta was awarded the top prize from the World Leaders Forum in the Law and Orde r category for the \"Dear John\" campaign. The main thrust of the campaign occurred in 2006 to 2008. Most of the initial activity and investment occurred in the first year, when materials were developed and placements were made in electronic and print media outlets. The national attention an d awards received by the campaign extended the program's peak activity into 2007 and 2008 by having the materials publicized and circulated by the media, and referenced by other organizations fighting prostitution and human trafficking. The campaign did not have a formal end to date, a nd could be regarded as still under way since the educational materials remain available online. The Dear John campaign was not formally evaluated, so its impact on the demand for prostitution or on sex trafficking in Atlanta is unknown. The main stated goal of the project was not to directly impact the behavior of actual or potential j ohns, although it was hoped that the messages would resonate with them. Instead, the key goal was to inspire action among those in government and nongovernmental organizations who could do something to combat demand for commercial sex. The level of activity in planning and implementing dema nd-focused interventions in the city increased after the campaign began. Of course, without an evaluation it is difficult to determine whether the activities would have occurred without the campaign, and at this point there is no way to make such a determination. Those who were interviewed in Atlanta for the National Assessment pointed to the \"Dear John\" campaign being an important element in overcoming inaction or resistance on the part of key players in the city, who later became partners in planning and implementing initiatives focusing on demand. For example, after the campaign was launched many meetings took place and initiatives began making progress that had not previously occu rred. Among the initiatives that were launched during the main thrust of the two year camp aign included the development of a john school, reforming state criminal codes regarding soliciting prostitution, and conducting a study of male buyers of sex. City government support for anti-demand efforts appeared to wane after Mayor Franklin left office in 2008. However, activity by NGOs has continued. Studies of sex buyers have continued without government support, through the funding of an N GO \"A Future Not A Past\" (AFNAP) and executed by The Schapiro Group. 83 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O9erzlB1W4 ; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRsbo6g21hU ; http://www.youtube.com /watch?v=1TzUyySQPlk This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 33 Figure 3.2: Additional Print Media Messages for Atlanta's \"Dear John\" Public Education and Awareness Campaign A new campaign was recently announced to revive th e pursuit of many of the goals of the original \"Dear John\" campaign in Atlanta. In 2012, AF NAP intends to focus on deterring men who buy sex with underage girls, and is planning to launc h a media campaign called \"Take a Stand to End Demand.\" Example: Education and Awareness Programs in Chicago and Cook County Over the past several years, the area would be hi ghest level of activity focused on combating demand for commercial sex is, arguably, the Cook County and Chicago areas of Illinois. An \"umbrella\" organization or coalition called End Demand Illinoi s (EDI) is comprised of over a dozen partner organizations that have launche d a wide range of initiatives targeting demand. Some of these organizations had been in focus initiatives in place before EDI existed, and some of the activity has been collective action organized or facilitated by EDI. For illustrative purposes we will discuss some initiatives of a few of the key partners of EDI. More information about EDI's composition and activity, and of its key partners, is ava ilable through the links in this footnote84 84 The website for EDI is: www.enddemandillinois.org .

Final Report pg. 34 EDI has engaged in a number of education and aw areness activities in the past few years. For example, a collaboration of Chicago Alliance Ag ainst Sexual Exploitation (CAASE), the Women of Power Alumni Association (WoPAA), the Polaris Pr oject, the Voices and Faces Project (Voices), and the Schiller DuCanto and Fleck Family Law Center of DePaul University College of Law (Schiller), and the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault, la unched a new website and coordinated events in the Fall of 2009. For example, an EDI volunteer (Katie Feifer, also affiliated with the Voices and Faces Project) of San Francisco-based research gr oup KGF Insights, conducted 31 interviews with a group of Illinois residents to gather feedback about statistics, beliefs and slogan statements, and the philosophy and messaging employed by EDI's pub lic education efforts. The conclusions and recommendations from the study served as the basis of campaign outreach materials. At the same time, Larissa Malarek, a volunteer documentari an, conducted 23 on-camera interviews with policymakers, law enforcement officials, service providers, and survivors throughout the state about prostitution, sex trafficking and demand in Illinoi s. These interviews were conducted to form the basis of the production of short documentary vigne ttes used for EDI public education initiatives. An initial clip of the documentary was released at EDI's launch event in September, 2009. CAASE, a Chicago-based nonprofit organization that is a member of EDI, is one of the few organizations in the United States with demand reduction as a primary focus. Many of the organization's activities are designed to prevent pr ostitution and sex trafficking by increasing public awareness and knowledge about of the risks and nega tive consequences inherent in commercial sex. CAASE has created educational curricula designed to encourage boys and men not to participate in, and to work against, sexual exploitation. The organization has also developed toolkits for nonprofits, faith-based groups, schools, businesses, and other comm unities and organizations to provide methods people can use to prevent sexual exploitation. Their descriptions of some of these awareness and education tools are presented in Figure 3.3. Example: U.S. Military Program to Combat Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking There is a long history of the military contributi ng to prostitution and sex trafficking (e.g., Bolkovach, 2010; Malarek, 2009). Relatively recently, the U. S. Department of Defense (DOD) has taken substantial action designed to reduce or eliminate the historic contributions (whether government agencies, large corporations, or others) of military personnel to prostitution and sex trafficking. Their approach is multifaceted, and features a focus on combating demand for commercial sex. While the scale of the military and the level of control over personnel are atypical of most organizations, the objectives and basic steps they have taken can prove instructive to other large organizations or agencies.

Final Report pg. 35 Figure 3.3: CAASE Descriptions of their Education Resources For Parents and Guardians: \"Engaging High-School-Age Sons to Stop Sexual Harm\" is a resource for families, role models, and any other person involved in the lives of young men. It provides background information on issues surrounding sexual exploitation, tips on initiating conversations about the issues, and other resour ces for parents and guardians. For High School Coaches: Coaches often play a key role in helping shap e the behaviors and attitudes of the young men they work with throughout the sports seas on. Understanding the significance of the coach/student relationship, CAASE and Coach for America created five short lesson plans that coaches can use with thei r athletes. Each plan is ten minutes long with an optional writing assignment. For High School Teachers: This toolkit offers activities and resources for educators of high school students. These activities focus on the pressures your students may face to engage in sexually exploitive acts or sexual activities that make them feel uncomfortable. The three main topics are gender roles, sexual exploitation, and human trafficking. The goal of this activity guide is to provide assignments, ideas, and classroom discussions to help educators facilitate interactive, informative, and moving interpersonal and p eer-group discovery about the difficult issues their students may be facing. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has taken substantial action over the past decade designed to reduce or eliminate the historic exacerbations of pr ostitution and sex trafficking due to the actions of military personnel. Their approach is multifacet ed, and features a focus on combating demand for commercial sex. While the scale of the military a nd the level of control over personnel are atypical of most organizations, the objectives and basic steps they have taken can prove instructive to other large organizations or agencies. The military code of justice and policies have been strengthened, clarifying the language and imposing substantial penalties on any military personnel (including ci vilian staff and contractors) engaging in commercial sex. The Law Enforcement Policy and Support office of the DoD has established the Trafficking in Persons Program, whic h has developed a series of trainings for military staff. A key component of their effort is tr aining about commercial sexual exploitation and human trafficking, and a key message in the training materials addresses demand. Most of the following is taken directly from the DoD training materials, available online. 85 One of the training presentations required of all service members before deployment begins with survivor anecdotes, photos, and an overview of how human trafficking is a large, global criminal enterprise. It says that the \"bad guys\" are \"not just the people wh o operate the trafficking enterprise - they are also 85 Source : http://www.combat-traffick ing.army.mil/documents/tr aining/TIP_20Feb09.ppt This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 36 their customers,\" who can be contractors, government civilians, or military personnel. They stress the message that there is \"zero tole rance\" in the Armed Forces of contributing to commercial sexual exploitation or trafficking, and that involvem ent in trafficking jeopardizes their careers: In 2002 the President signed a National Security Presidential Directive mandating a \"zero tolerance\" policy toward trafficking among me mbers of the US armed services, civilian employees and civilian contractors. In 2004, the Deputy Secretary of Defense expr essly forbade involvement with trafficked people by U.S. troops, government civilians and defense contractors, and called for commanders at all levels to ensure their units are trained to understand and recognize indicators of this serious crime The training contains definitions and several mess ages about the nature of human trafficking, and includes a focus on an anti-dema nd messages, such as: \"Don't assist the perpetrators: You aid and encourage trafficking in persons w ithout engaging in it directly by: Hiring prostitutes Attending nightclubs or strip clubs Patronizing businesses that are heavily guarded Not reporting cases of suspected trafficking Patronizing establishments that use forced labor\" Military personnel are informed of the Uniform C ode of Military Justice (UCMJ) Military Personnel Legal Prohibition on Prostitution. Trainees are also told that DoD Contractors are subject to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulati on (DFAR) TIP rule. Contractors have a trafficking clause in their employment contracts which stipulates they ar e responsible for following UCMJ prohibitions on buying sex, and that this responsibility applies to any and all subcontractors of a given company working for the DoD. We have included this brief discussion (and additi onal detail in Appendix D) about the DOD training for a number of reasons. First, the change in the Do D's approach is a sign that organizations that have historically tolerated (and sometimes encouraged) men buying sex can adopt an aggressive, proactive approach to education designed to combat demand. This suggests that here is little reason to believe that change cannot also occur in corporati ons, universities, other government agencies, and elsewhere. Second, the DoD training is example of an educati onal intervention that it is not simply a generic \"awareness\" exercise, reciting the horrors of human trafficking and urging unspecified action. The DOT training specifically focuses on the root cause of sex trafficking - consumer-level demand for commercial sex - and urges very concrete action: not buying sex or tolerating others doings so. Third, the general outline of the content can serve as a model for corporations or organizations wishing to develop a training program. Obviously , non-military organizations would not train about the military code of justice, etc., but the basic ou tline is probably transferable. The training starts with general issues and definitions, then quickly focuses on actions that individuals can and must take, and why. It makes the general appeals that ar e made in virtually all \"john school\" programs: (a) This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 37 an appeal to self-interest, discussing the consequences for them personally if they are caught engaging in prostitution, and (b) an appeal to altruism, di scussing the harm to those providing commercial sex in hopes that empathy will serve as a deterrent. One of the reasons for communities to be interested in implementing public education and awareness programs is that they are among the few types of interventions that are designed to be truly preventive, rather than to react to known offe nders. As can be seen in the typology we have presented about tactics used to combat demand, most are directed toward arresting men attempting to buy sex, and then applying post-arrest interventions such as community service or john schools. Such tactics are necessary and can be considered effi cient because they expend energy only on those known to be involved in commercial sex. However, in the words of many people interviewed for this project, there is a need to intervene \"further upstream,\" before men become sex buyers. That is where broadly targeted education and public service announcements come into play. Reverse Stings The most commonly used tactic to address demand for commercial sex is usually referred to as the \"reverse sting.\" These police special operations feature one or more women officers serving as a decoy (or decoys), posing as a prostitute to await being approached by those attempting to purchase sex (e.g., Dodge et al., 2005; Jetmore, 2008). The term \"reverse sting\" is an artifact of the historic gender inequity in the enforcement of prostitution. Until relatively recently, the vast major ity of police attention de voted to prostitution was focused on arresting providers of commercial se x. The most common police tactic to combat commercial sex has been using plainclothes male o fficers use to elicit offers of commercial sex from prostituted persons. These operations were known as \"stings.\" Beginning in the 1960s, but not becoming widespread until well into the late 1980s, we re operations focusing on buyers rather than providers of commercial sex. To distinguish tho se operations from the more traditional stings, the term \"reverse stings\" evolved into common usage, and implies that those operations that are something other than the typical or default tactic. The term is somewhat controversial particularly fo r advocates of approaches in which the majority of police attention is focused on buyers rather than se llers sex. It has been proposed by many that the movement to eradicate sexual exploitation should pr omote the use of the term \"sting\" to apply to operations aimed at johns, and not to arrests providers of commercia l sex at all. Since this report may address broad audiences and the term \"reverse sting\" is still the most common usage, we will continue to use it. Street-Level Reverse Stings In our observations of reverse stings, and in descriptions gathered from interviews with police and reviews of the literature, 86 we found the following to be typical. Areas of the city known to be active for street prostitution are selected, and a tactical pl an is either discussed or written and submitted for a supervisor's approval. Usua lly, five or more officers are used in a street reverse sting. In addition to the female officer or officers, there are usuall y several additional undercover police in supporting roles. The operations often consist of one or two male plainclothes officers on foot, posing as 86 Jetmore, 2008; Newman, 2007; Nolan, 2001; Scott, 1999; Spruill, 2009 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 38 pedestrians, at least one unmarked car carrying plainclothes officers, and at least one police patrol car with officers that may be in uniform. There are usually other officers who support the operations by processing arrestees and their vehicles. In some cases, police use a van serving as a mobile booking or screening station, and in other instances processing occurs in nearby police stations or substations. In the latter circumstance, the operations require more on-site officers so that there is less \"down time\" between arrests. At least two officers are usually required to transport each arrestee away from the site of the arrest: at least one escorting the arrestee, and another driving the arrestee's vehicle (when applicable). In our research we found that at least five police officers are usually deployed for each decoy used in a reverse sting. A supervising Sergeant is usually in charge of th e reverse stings. Decoys are escorted to drop-off locations near where the operations will occur. An unmarked police van serving as a mobile screening or booking station is usually parked nearby, but out of sight of the street operation. In some locations, police stations or substations are nearby , so a mobile unit is not necessary. The decoy officer usually has a hidden recording device and a ce ll phone (the first to collect evidence, the latter for safety, in case she is abducted). Some police departments videotape the reverse stings surreptitiously from an unmarked police car. The decoy always tries to remain in visual contact with the other officers. When potential \"clients\" speak with the decoy, the supporting officers track her until she makes a pre-arranged signal indicating a \"good case,\" which is when the man has made an offer of money in exchange for sex and has committed an \"act in furtherance \" of that offer. An act in furtherance is any overt behavior that can be construed reasonably as progress toward cons ummating the act of prostitution discussed. Such acts, in addition to the verbal exchange, complete th e legal requirements for making an arrest. Acts in furtherance can include reaching for a wallet, pointi ng to money on a bed or a car seat, driving around the block to the area where the sex act was arranged to take place, or opening a car or hotel door so that the decoy can enter. When the signal for a \"good case\" is given, the officers on foot or in unmarked cars converge and make the arrest. At this point, the decoy officer enters the police car as quickly as possible and leaves the scene, while the man is arrested and driven to a point where he will be processed. Sometimes he is driven in his own car by a plainclothes officer, and other times they are driven in a police car while another officer drives the offender's car. Arrestees who are on foot are driven to the van or police station in a patrol car. The license plate number of the car and the man's driver's license number and other identifiers are radioed or sent via computer to a dispatcher, and th e determination is made whether to issue a citation and notice to appear in court, or to book the arrestee and take him into custody. If they have identification and no outstanding warrants, they are us ually issued a citation and allowed to leave. If these conditions do not apply or if there are concur rent offenses (e.g., possession of drugs or illegal weapons), the johns can be taken into custody.

Final Report pg. 39 \"We usually have male officers out getting women to proposition them, but that really wasn't getting at the root of the problem. The men have be en just as guilty as the women all along and yet they never get arrested.\" Captain Bob Marshall, vice unit, Knoxville, Tennessee Police Department, 197687 As we've discussed elsewhere, reverse stings are the en try point for most of the kinds of interventions that have been developed to focus on male buyer s of illegal commercial sex. In order for john schools, community service programs, geographic excl usion zones, and several other tactics to be applied, johns must first be arrested. The means by which the vast majority of johns are arrested is through reverse things, which have been established as the primary way to produce the evidence necessary to satisfy criminal justice requirements. After the decision to cite or arrest is made, offenders in jurisdictions with criminal justice diversion programs for johns are issued a citation and informed of their responsibility to call the prosecutor's office for processing (either a city attorney's offi ce when johns are cited for violating municipal ordinances, or the district attorney's office wh en johns are arrested for committing a penal code violation). In the time it takes the officers to process the arrestee, the decoy officer usually remains in an unmarked car writing notes for her report and (if appli cable) checking to ensure that the quality of the tape of the transaction was acceptable. She then removes and marks the tape and inserts a blank in the recorder. She stays out of sight of the arrestee and away from the location where the arrest was made, until it is time to re-set the operation. When re verse stings use multiple decoys, it is possible to keep the street operations going continuously: if one or two of the decoys have made a good case and the men are being processed, there can still be one or more decoys active, provided that there are enough support officers for a safe operation. 87 http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lhEQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0IwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6887,7621071&dq=pr ostitution+men+arrest+solicit&hl=en This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 41 Table 3.8 presents the years in which 15 cities were known to have first used the reverse sting tactic to address prostitution. As can be seen here, at least five cities had conducted reverse stings in the 1960s, and 10 other cities had done so by 1974. These early oper ations will be discussed in descriptions of each city on the website. A common theme in the news reports covering these new kinds of tactics were that arresting men was necessary either (a) because of the inequity of only arresting women for prostitution when two parti es are involved, or (b) because arresting women \"providers\" had been ineffective and police l eaders felt that addressing demand may be more promising, and (c) complains from the community's residents and businesses drive police to take action against prostitution. This theme from the 1960s and 1970s has continued to the present, in news reports as well as what we learned in our interviews conducted with police in 2009-2011. One of the more compelling findings of the study is that several cities in the U.S. had begun to shift their emphasis away from arresting prostituted women and girls, and instead focusing their enforcement efforts on arresting men. Six of these cities had adopted this approach in the 1970s. Table 3.9 presents the cities and the number and pe rcentage of prostitution arrests of men versus women. At least 16 different communities have, for certain periods of time, focused more on combating demand than supply through their arrest pr actices. Some were bala nced, with john arrests accounting for 50 to 60 percent of all prostitution arr ests. Others were far more aggressive about demand, devoting the great majority of their enforcement effort on arresting johns. Identifying these sites demonstrates that the idea and implementation of applying more punitive measures to buyers rather than sellers of sex are not new, and that some cities in the U.S. had arrived at the conclusion over 30 years ago that the most effective model for combating prostitution is to focus enforcement on men and to take a less punitive approach to survivors of prostitution. We do not intend this to suggest that the model is widesp read, that cities using this approach in the 1970s and 1980s did not revert to prior methods, or to overstate that this may be a trend that is here to stay. What this demonstrates is that the approach has be en in use in the United States for nearly 40 years, even if only on a localized and perhaps temporary basis. Frequency, Duration, Staffing, and Arrest Yield of Reverse Stings We gathered information about how frequently cities and counties conduct reverse stings . We were able to obtain counts or estimates of how many tim es per month reverse stings were conducted in 166 cities and counties. The mean frequency was over nine per month, but that was positively skewed by a few larger cities (e.g., Los Angeles, San Franci sco, Brooklyn, Las Vegas, Knoxville) that routinely conducting reverse stings, and arrest hundreds of men (or more) per year. The mode (the most frequently occurring number) was two reverse stings per month, and that provides a more accurate representation of the average level of activity. Also, it is important to note that in most cities the level of reverse sting activity varies substantially over time . For example, at its peak in the late 1990s, San Francisco conducted at least 15 reversals per month, or approximately one every two days. Ten years later, they cut back to one-third of that rate. Other cities may concentrate high levels of activity in one location for a period of time in response to complaints or for other reasons, and then stop or slow down substantially as other priorities emerge.

We were able to obtain the number of hours committed to over 400 separate reverse sting operations. The mean was approximately five hours, and the distribution was not skewed substantially. We al so gathered information about the number of decoys used in each operation, and learned that the mean was approxi mately 1.5 and the mode was one. The mean number of decoys was skewed by a small number of reverse things that were very large in scale: about 25 of the 400+ reverse stings used between ei ght and 30 decoys in large, citywide crackdowns with several teams deployed in multiple locations. We also gathered information about the number of officers used in su pport of each female decoy posing as a person engaged in prostitution. We we re able to obtain the average number of support officers used in reverse things at 50 sites. We al so tied the number of support officers to the number of decoys to provide a sense of the staffing requirements for a reverse sting team. The mean number of officers used to support each decoy was 6.7, and the mode was five. We were interested in learning what the yield was, not only for each reverse sting operation, but more importantly, the yield of arrests for each decoy/team for each hour that the team is deployed . The number of arrests without these other considerations (number of decoys and number of hours) is not as meaningful, since arrests will be affected by whether there are multiple versus single decoys, and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

We found th at across several hundred reverse stings, the mean yield was approximately 1.5 arrests per decoy/hour, and the mode was one. \"I've been approached on the street right by my hou se by johns who thought I was a prostitute. I'll get in their face and yell at them, 'No, I'm not a prostitute. Go home to your wife!' Lately, if I walk around at night I try to wear my boyfriend's clothes and put a hoodie on so I'm not mistaken.\" Teresa Miller, 30-year-old student and resident of Vallejo, California, 201188 Community Complaints Drive Reverse Stings One of the issues that frequently arises in debat es about whether prostitution should be legalized, decriminalized, or remain prohibited is the contention that it is victimless. The argument against prohibition is the essentially libertarian idea that government should not intervene in commercial sex if it is between consenting adults. The argument for prohibition is that commercia l is inherently (or at least usually) harmful to the people directly involved, and also to others who are indirectly affected. \"We just go out when we receive enough compla ints from the neighborhood. Always in prostitution, you'll have areas where prostitution w ill pop up near crack houses, and for us putting female [officers] out, we're trying to get the males to stop from coming into that area.\" Chief Ken Swindle, Tuscaloosa, Florida Police Department, 200689 \"The kids who get out of school around 82nd (Avenue) are propositioned. [Prostitutes and johns] have sex in parking lots; we find condoms and need les; pimps fight against each other. When you think of how 82nd Avenue's been associated with these crimes, we want to get away from that.\" JR Ujifusa, Multnomah County, Oregon Deputy District Attorney, 201090 While our intent is not to settle that debate, we were able to gather in formation that is relevant in the discussion. During our initial interviews we were struck by how frequently - that is, virtually always - we were told by police officers and other responde nts that community complaints are frequently or mostly responsible for when and where police c onduct operations intended to combat prostitution. Once sensitized, we began asking routinely, and for those sites in which we conducted at least one interview and asked about community complaints, vi rtually every site said that community members such as residents and businesses complain about pros titution. In general, these complaints are not simply expressions of moral outrage (although that can certainly be involved) but instead are driven by (or at least accompanied by) complaints of tangible disturbance or harm. Frequently heard were 88 http://www.time.com/time/na tion/article/0,8599,2060969,00.html 89 http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20060130/NEW S/601300345?Title=Prostitution-sting-nets-arrests 90 http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/print_story.php?story_id=128035454437234300 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 44 claims that street prostitution was accompanied by verbal and physical fighting and accompanying noise; sex occurring in public areas such as doorways , alleys, and cars parked on the street; condoms and surrenders on streets or on private property. In addition, in areas where there is street prostitution there are frequent complaints of women and girls not involved in that activity who are solicited by johns, and men who live or work in those areas who do not welcome offers from those engaged in prostitution. A less frequent but serious problem mentioned in several communities (e.g., San Diego, California; Worcester, Massachusetts) was from wome n whose ethnic or cultural heritage was such that they would face serious repercussions if they we re seen to have been solicited by a john, even if a woman or girl did nothing to provoke it, did not welcome it, and did not respond to it. In response to the information gathered through inte rviews, we returned to the research literature and news archives to examine how frequently comp laints were reported as a reason for the police operations on prostitution. We found that complaints from residents or businesses were cited as a reason for reverse sting or sting operations in over 65 percent of the cities and counties studied. We also noted whether our interview respondents sai d community complaints drove whether police engaged in reverse stings (95% said \"yes\"). Fr om the news reports a nd interviews together, we found that complaints led to reverse stings in at least 71% of the communities studied. T h i s f i g u r e probably underestimates the overall percentage. Ne ws reports make choices about what to report regarding any specific reverse sting operation, and for space or other reasons can choose not to report that reverse stings were in response to complain ts from the community. Our finding that over two- thirds of the news reports mentioned complaints, but virtually all of our interviews said they received complaints, suggests that 71% is probably a low estim ate and that the portion of reverse stings driven by community complaints may be higher. Police Units, Agencies, and Multijurisdictional Task Forces Conducting Reverse Stings A range of law enforcement agencies, and units and departments within agencies, are trained and deployed to conduct reverse stings. Some of the departments or units focus on crimes on the lower end of the crime seriousness scale (measured by the felony/misdemeanor distinction), such as nuisance abatement or neighborhood safety units. Ot hers focus on felonies and higher end crimes, such as multijurisdictional drug task forces that focus on organized crime, felony level drug trafficking, and violent crime. Others fall in be tween, including regular patrol units. Many police departments, even in large cities, are relatively small (e.g., seven officers for San Francisco) and others have severely downsized or eliminated their vice units (e.g. Tucson, Arizona, and very recently, San Francisco, California), so other divisions or units (such as nuisance abatement or special investigations units) fill the void. In addition to cross-unit collaboration within de partments, there are cross-agency and cross- jurisdictional collaborations. A wide array of state, local, and federal agencies, and multijurisdictional task forces collaborate on rever se stings. Among the configurations of law enforcement collaboration that conduct reverse stings are Cross-unit collaborations within a police agen cy (e.g., patrol and community nuisance abatement) Federal agencies (particularly Immigrati on and Customs Enforcement, or ICE) Multijurisdictional task forces Multiple municipal police departments Municipal police departments and county sheriff's departments This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 45 State agencies that focus on alcohol enforcement State police agencies State probation/parole agencies Table 3.10 presents examples that portray the range of agencies, units, and levels of government that collaborate on reverse stings. As can be seen here, there are many configurations. Of the 16 cities and counties listed here as an illustration, no two had identical sets of partnerships. Of course, these were selected to represent variety, so the point is not to suggest that there are no modalities across sites. The most common scenario is for one city or county law enforcement agency (a city Police Department or a county Sheriff's Department) to conduct an operation within their jurisdiction. However, it is also common to see multi-agency coll aborations within cities or counties, as well as multijurisdictional teams. There are roads an d areas in which street prostitution becomes institutionalized, and these areas sometimes cross jurisdictions. For example, Mannheim Boulevard stretches across Chicago and several suburban cities a nd unincorporated towns in Cook County. It is common for County Sheriff's Departments or State Po lice to collaborate with cities and towns that share areas in which prostitution occurs. As Tabl e 3.10 shows, reverse stings can involve many different kinds of units within an agency, and can involve partnerships among agencies and across all levels of government (city, c ounty, state, and federal). Variations and Innovations in Reverse Stings A number of variations on basic models have been de veloped to meet particular challenges or to take advantage of opportunities. Several exampl es are described in more detail below. Replacing prostituted women with police decoys . In street operations, police may go to \"strips\" or \"strolls,\" arrest women engaged in prostitution, and replace them with police decoys. A similar concept is sometimes used to arrest the customers of brothels. Brothel raids typically focus on investigating whether prostitution occurs and then, if the necessary evidence is gathered, to arresting the women selling sex and the brothel's pimps or traffickers. Usually, the johns are either ignored entirely, or those that are present during the raid or \"take-down\" may be arrested but no furthe r effort is expended in attempting to arrest additional customers beyond those that happe ned to be present. However, in some communities police have taken advantage of the opportunity to identify and arrest additional customers. In storefront brothels such as nail salons or massage businesses, the staff and survivors are removed and replaced with police officers who continue to make appointments and arrest johns until the news circulates that the brothel is controlled by undercover police. Borrowing decoys from other police departments. Many police departments, particularly smaller ones, have had trouble staffing reverse stings due to a shortage of women police officers willing to serve as decoys, or because the decoys become too well-known to potential buyers to be effective. A solution to this problem used by some police agencies is to borrow staff from other departments. For example, the small cities of Bluefield and Princeton, West Virginia have borrowed or exchanged decoys and sometimes other members of reverse sting teams. Similarly, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and communities in the region (such as Reading and Allentown) have exchanged st aff. The Pennsylvania State Police have developed the capacity to assist any community in the state in conducting reverse stings by contributing decoys and support officers.

Final Report pg. 47 Web-Based Reverse Stings The Internet has been used with increasing frequenc y to transact commercial sex. Ads are posted on websites devoted to commercial sex (eroticreview.com, worldse xguide.com, myredbook.com) or on websites serving as a venue for a broader spectrum of transactions, such as BackPage.com, Yellow Pages, Craigslist.com, and periodicals such as the Phoenix New Times or SF Weekly. It is widely observed that the solicitation of commercial sex th roughout the United States has shifted from the streets to online. For example, in San Francisco th e average yield of arrests per street-level reverse sting fell by half between 2004 and 2007 (Shively et al., 2008), and the police department's vice unit personnel believed that much of the declining yi eld was because of the rise of online solicitation - particularly the use of Craigslist through 2009, and Backpage since then. Other factors cited in the decline in street prostitution are the effectiven ess of the city's john school program, and the persistence of police in conducting hundreds of re verse stings over the years. Craigslist has eliminated its adult or \"erotic services\" secti on that had been a central source of transacting commercial sex (although it is still used for comme rcials sex, through as posing as massage or other services),91 but it has been largely replaced by Backpage.com since 2010. Many police departments throughout the United Stat es have used online ads for commercial sex to their advantage. Approximately one third of all po lice departments that conduct street-level reverse stings (286 sites had been identified through 2011) have implemented web-based reverse stings since 1995. A list of communities and when they first cond ucted reverse stings is presented in Table 3.11. Online reverse stings are easy for police to initiate. The typical pro cedure is to post a decoy ad, and when potential johns respond with a phone call or an e-mail, the officers pose as prostituted persons or pimps and arrange for a meeting - usually at a hotel that has been prepared for a reverse sting. At the hotel, a female officer poses as a prostituted person, and once the john is face-to-face with the officer, the operation is essentially the same as th at used in conventional reverse stings. \"There are clear signs that some revenue and listings are migrating to Backpage and to other sites that specialize in prostitution advertising.\" Mark A. Whittaker, AIM Group, 201092 \"Backpage is widely used by local prostitutes and has been for years, and that's no secret. We get prostitutes that will work the street, and the services they would normally get $40 for in the back of the car or whatever now jumps up to $150 or up.\" Lt.

Final Report pg. 48 Variation on the on the basic web-based reverse sting model. In web-based reverse stings, the basic model involves police posting a bogus advertisement on websites used to transact prostitution, and placing a female police decoy and support team in a hotel room or apartment for appointments with johns. This requires substantial planning, such as obtaining a phone for police to use that is not detectable as a police phone, and constructing a rea listic ad. It can pose challenges in acquiring hotel or apartment space, due to the expense of ren ting and getting hotel or apartment management to cooperate with a police operation that may disrupt their business. A variation on the basic model that is designed to solve some of these challenges begins with police searching real web ads for prostitution, rather than placing their own \"decoy\" ads. Police respond to the real ads with undercover male officers posing as johns. They remove the woman or girl involved in prostitution or who is being trafficked, and install a police deco y who continues making appointments with johns on the survivor's phone. Typically, a support team is stationed in an adjoining room.

More than half (59%) of the 826 communities in the U.S. that are known to have conducted reverse stings publicize the identities of arrestees. For many police departments, revealing arrestee identities proceeds from the intent to deliver a punishment which will serve as a specific deterrent . It also pursues general deterrence - sending a message to potential johns that th eir identities will be revealed if they are apprehended for soliciting sex. For some police departments, publicizing iden tities does not appear to be programmatic or to specifically target demand for illicit commercial sex. It is instead a matter of routine, whereby This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Final Report pg. 49 identities of adult arrestees across all offense categories are revealed. For example, the identities of arrestees sometimes appears in lo cal news \"crime logs\" or \"poli ce blotters,\" with johns' identities revealed alongside those of burglars, vandals, and drunk drivers. However, the lack of a specific intent of reducing demand for commercial sex does not directly affect its potential for effectiveness as a deterrent.

In many cases, it is simply crime reporting. Police often list the identities of arrestees, regardless of offense type. The most common method of disseminating identiti es is through news outlets - both online and in print. Other methods include police websites 94 (e.g., Alton, IL; El Cajon, CA; Nashville, TN); billboards (e.g., Rochester, NY; Minneapolis, MN); websites (e.g., \"Trick the Johns\" in Chattanooga, TN, \"JohnTV\" in Oklahoma City, OK); and public access television (e.g., New York, NY). Variations on shaming tactics include an ef fort in Baltimore County, MD in which police inform residents of court dates for prostitution-related cases, encouraging them to appear at hearings and trials. The tactic is intended not only to sham e offenders by bringing residents to witness the men being accused in court, but also to encourage judges and prosecutors to follow through with charges and impose fair penalties. Another variation of sham ing is letters sent to the homes of alleged buyers of commercial sex, or to the homes of registered owners of vehicles used in known or suspected instances of soliciting commercial sex (these \"Dear John\" letters are described below). 94 http://www.jonesboropolice.com/jpd_news.php?item=69 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 50 Figure 3.5. Example of Police Department Press Release Publicizing Identities of Arrested Johns There are compelling arguments both for and against shaming. Proponents argue that it is a powerful deterrent, perhaps more important than arrest and legal sanctions. Surveys and anecdotal evidence lend support to this argument (e.g., Durschlag & Goswami, 2008; Farley et al., 2009), as does a body of criminology literature on the effects of extraleg al sanctions on deterrence (e.g., Vold et al., 1998; Zimring and Hawkins, 1973). For example, when as ked to name tactics that would deter men from buying sex, having identities publicly circulated was listed most frequently. In the Durschlag & Goswami study, 87% of the men listed \"photo and or name in local paper\" in response to the question, \"What would deter you from buying sex?\" This was the most frequently cited potential consequence, followed by \"jail time\" and \"photo and/or name on billboard\" (both and/or name on the Internet\" ( 82%), and \"a letter sent to fam ily saying you were arrested for soliciting a woman in prostitution\" (79%). Four of the five consequences that men most frequently cite as deterrents involve others finding out that th ey have had sex with pros tituted persons. While men's perceptions of what may deter them in hy pothetical situations does not necessarily correspond to what actually deters men in real situations, the results are provocative, and provide an empirically-based reason to suspect that shaming might be effective.

Some cities that are strongly committed to combating demand (e.g., San Francisco) do not pursue shaming specifically because of the impact it may have on those associated with alleged offenders, such as the children, spouses, and other friends and family members. Given the pr evalence of shaming and the potential for unintended consequences, it is important to determine whethe r effectiveness justifies its use. So far, the usefulness of the tactic has not been evaluated. \"It sounds really like a stunt. Are they going to have stocks next or paint 'A's on people's foreheads or make them carry a sign?

Final Report pg. 52 Challenges and variations Variations of the basic model of publicizing the iden tities of arrestees have emerged in an attempt to mitigate or prevent negative, unint ended consequences. For example, one of the challenges for police in implementing a program of shaming is monitoring whether information about alleged offenders is used inappropriately. Among the inappropriate uses of the information would be targeting the people identified for harassment or vigilante actions. The Wichita, Kansas Police Department suspended posting offender information on their website due to \"inappropriate use\" of the photos and personal information about those arrested for soliciting. The following message appeared on the Wichita Police Department website: \"For the past two years the Wichita Police Department has used this space [the department's website] to post photographs and information about individuals who have been arrested and charged with prostitution -related offenses in Wichita. The Department has learned that these photogr aphs and information were being used for purposes that the Department feels were inappropriate. Because of this inappropriate use of information by individuals outside law enforcement, the Department has suspended our practice of posting this information. \"100 Other have objected to shaming tac tics on the grounds that they violate the right to due process. This is a serious concern where identities of all arrestees are publicized - shaming is regarded by most to be a punishment, and occurs before conviction in most communities. In response to these concerns, some jurisdictions, such as Minneapolis, post on their police websites identities of men only after they have been convicted of soliciting.101 For cities and counties seeking to address their pros titution and sex trafficking problems, the results of an evaluation attesting to the effectiveness of shaming would be immediately useful. Police and concerned non-profit organizations would be interested in any measured \"treatment effects,\" while individuals further from the policing operational le vel would be interested in how any observed effects weigh against due process concerns a nd potential negative impact on the families and associates of men whose identities are publicized. Passi ng a risk/reward balance test requires that the tactic has been confirmed to be an effective \"treatment\" or deterrent. 100 http://www.wichita.gov/CityOffices/Police/ FieldServices/North/Prostitution+Page.htm 101 http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/police/ prostitution-convictions/convictions.asp This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 53 Figure 3.6: Cities and Counties that have Employed Shaming Tactics \"Dear John\" Letters A tactic that has been employed in at least 40 U. S. sites is sending letters to the homes of known or suspected buyers of commercial sex. The intention is to make it more difficult for johns to engage in sexual exploitation anonymously, or at least, unbeknownst to spouses or partners. People we interviewed for the national assessment cite as the primary reasons for using this tactic: (1) to alert partners of buyers of commercial sex so that they can protect themselves from contracting infectious disease, given the higher probability that johns may be carriers, and (2) to br ing pressure to bear from whomever lives with sex buyers to discourage them from that activity. There are two main variants of this approach. The first is sending letters to the registered owners of cars seen \"cruising\" known prostitution strips for the apparent purpose of soliciting sex from prostituted persons. This tactic re quires that police acquire the license plate number of the car that is being used in a way consistent with soliciting commer cial sex. An example of suspicious behavior would be when a car circles a block repeatedly and then stops so the driver can talk with women who appear to be engaged in street prostitution, and/or have are familiar to police due to prior prostitution arrests. Police sometimes also observe people kno wn to have been prostituted repeatedly entering cars that pull up the curb, and returning minutes later. While the purpose of this interaction is apparent on a commonsense level, in most jurisdictions there would be insufficient evidence to arrest the John for soliciting commercial sex, since there is This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 54 reasonable doubt about what actually occurred between th e two parties. In such circumstances, police in some jurisdictions will record the license number of the vehicle, and later find the address of a registered owner and send them a letter. Sometim es the observation is made not by the police, but instead by members of the community who observed this kind of activity and record the license plate numbers, and make a report to police departments. For example, police in Minneapolis, MN and Des Moines, IA have asked residents to record licen se plate numbers and descriptions of johns, and to forward the information to police so they can se nd letters to the allege d offenders Some police departments have forms for recording the informa tion, which asked members of the community to record the location of the event the time, make mode l and color of the vehicle, and most importantly, the plate number. Once police have been given this information, they can follow the same procedure as if they had made the observations themselves. The letters typically strive to make it clear that police do not assume that the registered owner of the vehicle was necessarily driving the car when the suspicious behavior was observed. The letter does not constitute being charged with a crime. Some of the letters explicitly address the fact that the suspicious behavior may have occurred while someon e other than the registered owner was driving. The tone may even be friendly, suggesting that the registered owner's vehicle is being used improperly, and that they should take care not to a llow others to use their vehicle for such purposes. Another application of \"dear john\" letters is sending letters to the hom es of arrestees. Such letters do not say that suspicious behavior occurred, but instead that an arrest of the addressee was made for prostitution. A sample letter used by the Escambia County Sheriff's Office is presented in Figure 3.7, and examples of English and Spanish versions of similar letters from Raleigh, NC are presented in Appendix F.

They also can raise objections similar to those in response to newspaper or website shaming: they can be argue d to violate due process protections if they are assumed to be punishments and are applied to peopl e prior to conviction. The letters we have encountered are carefully crafted to avoid these due process concerns, but the objections could be valid if the letters are not properly constructed.

The basic issues generally are whether the auto seizure constitutes a penalty that exceeds the maximum allowed for misdemeanors, and in other instances, local ordinances may conflict with state law. For example, on July 26, 2007 the California State Supreme Court overturned the city of St ockton's ordinance, causing the practice to be suspended throughout the state while ordinances were being reviewed or revised. Seizures resumed in several California cities in 2008 (e.g., Riverside, Sacramento). Similarly, a Miami ordinance that was passed by the city council in 1997 was decl ared unconstitutional in response to a 1999 case, and that decision was upheld on appeal. Washington , DC had a seizure program that was declared unconstitutional and suspended in 2003, and later resumed after revision. \"The vehicle is where most if not all the activity occurs, at least for street-level prostitution.\" Assistant City Attorney Jennifer Cacciapaglia, Rockland, Illinois102 A few communities have instituted forfeiture programs in which cars used by men to solicit sex with prostituted persons could be forfeited, sold at auc tion, and the proceeds retained by law enforcement to fund their efforts. For example, the Easton, Pennsylvania city council passed an ordinance in 2008 allowing for forfeiture of vehicles within one year of arrest, allowing time for due process.

Final Report pg. 57 the first set of men arrested in reverse stings who had their autos seized filed suit, challenging the forfeitures as excessive punishment since the pena lty of the local ordinance exceeded misdemeanor penalty standards for prostitution violations. Within two months of the ordinance's passage and the first set of arrests to which it was applied, all of the autos in Easton were returned and forfeitures suspended pending the outcome of the lawsuit. In Genesee County, Michigan johns have been required to forfeit vehicles, and can buy them back for $900 after a first arrest, $1800 for a second, and $2,700 for a third arrest. If they don't pay, the vehicle is sold at auction. Driver's License Suspension Of the tactics identified to combat demand, driver 's license suspension is the least frequently used. Only 19 communities have been known to suspend licenses of johns. The first identified use of license suspensions was in Tampa, Florida in 19 85. Few cities have followed this example. The concept and execution of license suspensions are simple. There must be an ordinance or a statute in place to support the suspensions for misdemeanor offenses, and if so, judges or magistrates can choose to mete out this punishment for arrested johns. Suspensions are not long, among the small number of cases we could identify. In Casselberry, Florida, the suspension can last up to one year, although it is rare for the maximum suspension to be imposed. The objections to license suspensions are similar to those of shaming and auto seizure. Given that many johns are married, in relationships, and employed, some punishments can have a negative impact on significant others and families. For ex ample, a license suspensi on can pose hardships for children who rely on a father for transportation, and the father may be the only family member with a driver's license. Geographic Restraining (\"SOAP\") Orders At least 83cities and counties have applied geographi c exclusion zones or restraining orders to men arrested for buying sex. The court orders for arr estees to avoid these zones are often referred to as SOAP orders (an acronym for Stay Out of Areas with Prostitution). For example, in 1993 a \"prostitution-free zone\" was established in Portland, OR along a corridor long known to be an area with the city's highest concentration of street prostitution. The exclusion zone specifications are described in the city ordinance establishing the z one, presented in Appendix G. Essentially, this ordinance allowed judges to order those arrested for prostitution offenses (including johns) not to Table 3.13: Sites with Earliest Known Use of Driver's License Suspension for Johns Year City or County State 1985 Tampa FL 1989 West Palm Beach FL 1991 Tallahassee FL 1995 Delray Beach FL 1997 Clearwater FL 2000 Kissimmee FL 2000 Daytona Beach FL 2006 Richmond CA This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 58 enter the restricted area. The ordinance allows fo r several consequences to be meted out against those who violate the order. Although it was widely regarded as successful locally, budget cuts rendered the Police Department unable to enforce the z one properly, and the City Council allowed the ordinance to expire. Area residents and busin esses reportedly soon observed an increase in visible prostitution and related activity, and in 2011 the mayor proposed reviving the prostitution-free zone. Geographic exclusion zones are sometimes resist ed by civil libertarians as needlessly and inappropriately restricting the free movement of individuals. However, the practices are seldom successfully challenged, provided that the restricti ons are applied only to convicted offenders, or are agreed to voluntarily as a condition of a diversion program. Neighborhood Action Throughout the United States there has been a wi de array of tactics employed that focus on the buyers of commercial sex that feature residents, businesses, or organize community groups either taking their own action or engaging in partnerships with law enforc ement. We have identified 115 cities and counties that have engaged in some kind of neighborhood action directed at demand. For this type of anti-demand tactic, it does not make sense to distinguish a basic model and then to review variations on that model, since the initiatives are highly variable and are customized extensively to suit the local context. Examples of neighborhood action include the following: Chattanooga , TN has a neighborhood led effort to shame johns (in addition to pimps and prostituted persons), asking for submissions of photos to be posted on an independent website: www.trick.the.johns.com . Baltimore , MD has the Baltimore John Watch which encourages residents to record license numbers of cars and submitting descriptions of the make, model, and license Table 3.14: Sites with Earliest Known Use of SOAP Orders for Johns Year City or County State 1975 Beaver Falls PA 1980 Washington DC 1985 Newport News VA 1990 SeaTac WA 1990 Santa Monica CA 1991 Tulsa OK 1991 Miami FL 1991 Tallahassee FL 1992 Pierce County WA 1993 Portland OR 1993 Everett WA 1994 Tacoma WA 1995 Oakland CA 1995 Wichita KS 1995 Anchorage AK This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Houston , TX contains neighborhoods in which residents have placed \"no prostitution\" signs on their lawns. This kind of activity could also be considered a public awareness program, but is also listed as a neighborhood ac tion since it was driven by the community and not by any agency or official organization. San Antonio , TX has a neighborhood-initiated campaign involving residents taking photos of johns in cars, recording license plate numbers, and sending the photos and information to police. Lansing , MI police developed the \"hot spot card program\" involving distributing cards that encourage residents to record information about known or suspected vice crimes and provide that information to police. Stockton, CA residents are asked by police to report the date, time, and the license plate numbers of vehicles involved in prostitution, using the Special Prostitution Enforcement Reporting System (SPERS). Police then send le tters to the registered owners telling the recipient the vehicle was seen in an area known for prostitution, but not accusing them of committing a crime. Neighborhood-led initiatives targeting demand were f ound to have occurred as early as 1975, and at least 15 cities and counties had implemented some form of community-led activity by 1985.

Surveillance Cameras While cameras are very widely used for general surveillance purposes, and the growth in their use began decades ago, their use specifically to target men who are (or may be) buying sex has not been widely adopted. Some applications are covert, w ith hidden cameras used to produce visual evidence that can be used by police and prosecutors. Othe r uses are overt and designed for deterrence rather than punishment. A few examples of the use of surveillan ce cameras follow: Tacoma, WA : Conspicuous surveillance cameras are placed in active prostitution areas with signs saying, \"Smile johns, you're on camera.\" A YouTube channel, called StopCrimeOnTacomaAve posts videos of a pparent prostitution and drug deals. Rochester, NY: Surveillance cameras in prostitution areas covertly. Durham, NC : Thirteen wireless cameras focus on \"hot spots\" of crime, including prostitution.

In most of the 50 cities and counties known to use community service fo r arrested johns, including the \"early adopters\" of this tactic listed in Table 3.17, the service programs are not very precisely targeted toward addressing demand, but instead appear to be sancti ons applied to misdemeanor's general and just This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 61 happened to apply to the buyers of sex as misd emeanants. However, community service in some locations is programmatic and specifically designed to deal with demand. For example, the Red Zone program in Indianapolis couples a john school in tervention with community service specifically designed for them. After four hours of hearing from a community impact panel and a health educator in the john school, the men are required to pick up trash around the streets known to be \"strips\" with high levels of prostitution activity. Men frequently encounter used condoms and syringes that often accompany street prostitution, and that is by desi gn. Documents regarding the Red Zone program, including instructions for arrestees entering co mmunity service, are provided in Appendix H. The type of service required is more variable in Norfolk, Virginia. In the program of the Norfolk Sheriff's Office, johns are required to serve eight hours of community service. It usually occurs on a Sunday and begins between 7:30-8:00 AM. The community service program for johns is coupled with the john school, a brief educational intervention that occurs on the previous day. If the john school gets out early on Saturday, then the johns will sometimes pick up trash downtown for an hour or so and then continue the next day. On the full day of community service, johns are added to community service details for other kinds of low-leve l offenders, and perform a range of jobs such as painting buildings and cleaning public areas.

A useful worki ng definition for john school is: An education or treatment program for men arrested for soliciting illega l commercial sex. To that basic definition, one could add that in order for an education program to be considered a john school, it must cover a range of topics designed to persuade or deter men from buying sex. That criterion would separate john schools from other kinds of court-ordered or diversi on program that focus only on health education. There are several education programs in the United States that involve education for arrested johns This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.National Overview of Demand Reduction Efforts Grant #2008-IJ-CX-0010 Abt Associates Inc. Final Report pg. 62 that we would not consider to be a john school. For example, at least 10 communities in the United States have a health education session (usually fo cused on HIV) for prostitution arrestees - including johns - but we would not consider that to be a j ohn school program, since the model's basic intention is to help men avoid infection and not necessarily to convince men to avoid commercial sex because of the harm it causes. The state of Virginia re quires health education for anyone convicted of a prostitution offense, and we would not define that as a john school for the male sex buyers who must attend. A wide variety of programs are often grouped together and labeled john schools. Among the key dimensions of variability are: Number of sessions: Most john schools are single sessions, but they can arrange up to 10 sessions spaced a week apart. Diversion versus sentencing option: About two-thirds of john schools in the United States are structured as criminal justice diversion programs, and the remainder are structured as conditions of a sentence. In the former, charges are usually dismissed upon completing the education program; in the latter, they must complete the john school to satisfy the conditions of their sentence, but do ing so does not result in their charges being dismissed. Fees or fines: The average fee or fine for john schools in the U.S. is roughly $400, and the range is from $0 to $1,500. Curricula: the common denominators of most john schools are that they discuss health and legal consequences for johns if they were to continue engaging in commercial sex, and the negative impact of prostitution on prostituted women and girls and communities. With a common foundation, there is a wide range of topics covered by at least one John school. For example, the Indianapolis \"Red Zone\" program features a community impact panel, and then has the men spend three hours doing community service by picking up trash on the streets with high levels of prostitution activity. Other curriculum components include discussions of healthy relationships, anger management, sexual addiction, pimping and pandering, human traffi cking, and johns' vulnerability to criminal victimization while engaged in commercial sex. Generic John School Logic Model Like any program, john schools are grounded in a set of goals. To pursue these goals, programs use resources that support activities intended to produ ce targeted results\u2014from those results that are immediate and specific, to those that are broader and longer-term outcomes. A logic model is a useful device for illustrating the linkages from pr ogram goals, to the resources committed to the program, to activities, to outputs (the direct repr esentation of activities), to program outcomes (the manifestation of the change that activities are seek ing to accomplish) and finally to impacts (the indications that the program's br oader goals have been realized). The logic model for the most common type of john school (modeled in part on the FOPP) is presented in Figure 3.8. The ultimate program goal is to decrease the demand for pr ostitution, and hence, reduce the amount of human trafficking and sexual exploitation that occurs. Program goals are pursued by committing resources (inputs) that support program activities (in john schools, the primary program activity is the This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 63 educational intervention for arrestees). The measu rable indicators of these activities are the program \"outputs .\" The activities are designed to lead to the aforementioned outcomes of knowledge and attitude change: increased awareness of the legal a nd health risks of engagi ng in prostitution, and awareness of the negative impact of the behavior on prostitutes, communities, and others. These outcomes are intended to reduce the likelihood that men will continue to solicit prostitution (i.e., the program impact ). Figure 3.8: Generic John School Logic Model Targeting the Educational Intervention John school directors typically assume that there ar e several key attitudes a nd beliefs that cause or allow men to solicit sex, and that the programs reach at least some of the men by countering erroneous beliefs and filling gaps in knowledge. The programs target some or all of the following: 1. The belief that the risk of arrest and legal sanction are low. 2. Denial or ignorance of the risk of contracting STDs or HIV through purchased sex. 3. Ignorance of the risk of being robbed or assaulted by prostitutes or pimps. 4. Denial or ignorance of the negative impact prostitution has on the neighborhoods in which it occurs. 5. Ignorance of the links between street prostitution and larger, organized systems of sex trafficking. 6. Denial or ignorance of what motivates them to solicit prostituted women or girls (e.g., addictions, compulsions, unmet social or sexual needs). 7. Denial or ignorance of the negative im pact of prostitution on \"providers.\" 8. Denial or ignorance of the fact that money is the only reason prostitu ted persons have sex with them.

Final Report pg. 64 9. The mistaken belief that the women they hire care about them, and that they are in some kind of relationship with them. 10. Denial or ignorance of the anger, revulsion, or indifference that many prostituted women have while they are having sex with johns. 11. Ignorance about how to have the healthy rela tionships that could replace their reliance upon commercial sex. Men who solicit sex would be correct in assuming that th ere is a low risk of arrest and legal sanction. On this point, john schools do not seek to confirm this perception, but instead try to elevate the perceived risk from whatever level exists prior to taking the class. Since many of the men in john schools are first-time arrestees, they may be ignorant of the sanctions they may face if arrested a second time, and the program was designed to provide them with this information. On most of the other points, the program managers usually assume that the men are ignorant or in denial about the risks and negative impact of prostitution, and th e program curriculum was designed to provide them with factual information and \"break down their denial systems\" (Hotaling, 2006). A precondition for a sustainable john school program is a sufficient flow of eligible participants. This requires a proactive approach on the part of law en forcement to conduct operations designed to arrest men for soliciting. Several john school programs ha ve been suspended or discontinued due to an insufficient flow of participants (e.g., Buffalo, Tampa) . This flow is determined primarily by whether police have and will commit the resources needed to conduct reverse sting operations. Programs whose fees are used only to support john school cl asses can survive with very small numbers (as few as 10 to 20 per year, enough for one class per year), but programs that rely upon the fee revenue to sustain programs for women and girls involved in commercial sex must have a reliable and substantial volume of program participants. A serious, current challenge for all john schools is cutbacks in police budgets that have resulted in reducing the frequency of reverse stings. Prevalence of John School Programs We have identified at least 58 U. S. cities and counties that have implemented john schools in lieu of, or in addition to, criminal penalties. Approximately fifty have programs that are still operating (Table 3.19), and 11 sites have had john schools that we re discontinued (Chicago, IL, Dallas, TX, Dover, DE, Hillsborough County, FL, King County, WA, Madi son, WI, Pinellas County, FL, Portland, OR, Santa Clara, CA, Snohomish County, WA, Tucson, AZ). An additional 11 sites have education programs for johns that are restri cted to health topics were identified (Chicago, IL, Covington, KY, Fitchburg, MA, Forsyth County, NC, Ft. Lauderd ale, FL, Guilford County, NC, Hollywood, CA, New York, NY, Pasadena, CA, Ventura, CA, Virginia 103). New john school programs have come online at a remarkably steady rate. On average, about four new programs have begun each year from 1997 to 2010. 103 Virginia state law requires HIV counselin g when arrested for soliciting prostitution.

For example, the Cincinnati john school serves the city of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. Kansas Cit y's program receives men from Kansas City, KS, Kansas City, MO, Lenexa, Prairi e Village, Johnson County a nd Wyandotte County. Salt Lake City serves both the city and county, and the john school in Tacoma serves that city plus Lakewood, Fife, and Pierce County. The john school in Toledo , Ohio serves Lucas County as well as its core city. The \"Breaking Free\" program in Minneapolis also serves the city of Rochester, MN and its surrounding county. Over time, some cities have had more than one program: Chicago, Illinois has had two john schools. The first was operated by Genesis House and Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, and was disbanded in 2005. The second is still functioning, and has been operated by Ame nd and the Chicago Police Department since 2005. Omaha, Nebraska's Adult Probation Community Resources Directory and the website of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services list a Wellspring program that provides \"therapy ... for men who solicit sex.\" The \"Men's Own Responsibility, Recovery, and Education\" (MORRE) program operated by Wellsprings in Omaha is described by Hughes (2004). We could not confirm whether either program still operates. Portland, Oregon is currently operating its third john school. The city has had two programs that were each discontinued afte r two years of operation: (1) The Sexual Exploitation Education Project (SEEP), was implemented in 1995-1997 by the Council for Prostitution Alternatives through an informal agreement with Multnomah County District Attorney and the District Court, and (2) the Portland Prostitution Offender Program (PPOP), was operated in 2003-2005 by the Lola Greene Baldwin Foundation in This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 67 One of the difficulties in counting the number of cu rrently active john schools is determining what it means to be \"active.\" Some programs meet infrequently, such as the Waco, TX program that meets about once per year. Most programs go through peri ods of greater and less activity, so may schedule classes monthly or bi-monthly, but postpone them if police activity has been low and the numbers are insufficient. Some programs that had been r obust and met frequently have gone through fallow periods of one or two years where no classes have be en held (e.g., Buffalo, NY). If the program is still hardwired into the system and the capacity to hold classes remains, but classes have not occurred due to an absence of participants delivered by police, we would regard it as still active. We reserve defining as \"discontinued\" only those programs that ha ve been explicitly cancelled, or that have not been held for many years and there is no sign of remaining infrastructure or intent to hold another class (e.g., Rochester, NY). Another challenge in keeping current on programs active \"now\" is that tracking program activity requires an ongoing surve illance system, which requires resources that have not been committed to this task. Staff at most of the john school programs we have id entified said that they used the FOPP as a model, but when we examined these progr ams' major features, no other program was found to be structured like the FOPP along all dimensions. For example, most of the other programs collect just enough fee revenue to support the john school classes, and are not designed to generate revenue for survivor programs. The FOPP staff (particularly from SAGE) regards the \" restorative justice \" component as one of the most crucial elements of their program, and believes that it is a serious shortcoming to omit that feature. Other programs are explicitly not modeled on the FOPP, such as the three-day SEEP program that ran in Portland, OR from 1995 to 1997. \"When the Red Zone Program was created it was b ecause we wanted to change these defendants' behavior.

Final Report pg. 69 We have gathered descriptive information on every john school known to have been implemented in the United States. For a few programs we know very little. For example, programs in Rochester, NY in 1988 and South Bend, IN, we know only through single stories in news archives that provided little detail, which we have been unable to verify or expand upon through interviews. No great deal of the other programs, especially the FOPP, based upon ou r two-year evaluation of the program, and from interviews, site visits and observa tions of programs in Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Norfolk, Phoenix, San Diego, and Worcester MA. A summary of a few traits of john schools is provided in Table 3.20. Appendix I presents an expanded set of informati on on all currently active and discontinued john schools in the United States Community Impact Panels Several communities have been found to rely upon residents and other representatives of communities to appeal directly to the buyers of commercial sex, in hopes of dissuading them from that behavior. Usually, this occurs in john school programs, since that is often the context in which known buyers of commercial sex are \"captive audiences,\" accessible to community members and required to listen to their views. In john school classes we observed in Indianapolis, San Diego, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Worcester, community representatives from local organizations discussed a range of negative effects that prostitution has on communities. Am ong the most common messages conveyed to johns is that where there is prostitution, residents and businesses experience the following: Drugs and violence. Condoms, syringes, and broken bottles on sidewalks and in parks that children and others can contact. Screaming, fighting, and loud cursing late at night. \"Drunks\" and \"addicts\" sleep in doorways. People defecate and perform oral sex in doorways to apartment buildings. Pimps \"beat up prostitutes.\" Prostitutes and pimps assault johns. In working class neighborhoods, people cannot a fford to lose sleep, and should not have to be deprived of sleep just because pe ople choose to commit crimes there. There can be repercussions for women and gi rls who have been propositioned by johns. Anecdotally, it was asserted that women and girls of specific ethnic groups could face consequences from their husbands or fathers if it was learned that they had been propositioned by a john, even if they did nothi ng to encourage it and it was unavoidable. Johns \"can do their business there and leave,\" but residents have to stay in their neighborhood and deal with the aftermath. In one presentation, the community representative asked whether the men in the cl ass were arrested in the neighborhood in which they lived. None of the 27 men present in the class said they had been arrested in their home neighborhood. Members of the communities emphasize that johns contribute to the problem, or in fact are the chief cause of the problem, since without \"customers\" ther e would be no prostituted persons or pimps.

Final Report pg. 70 John School Curriculum Items John schools curricula vary, as one would expect . The FOPP curriculum has been represented elsewhere (e.g., Shively, 2008), and represents a \"baseline\" for john school topics covered. To address the informational needs of offenders, the FOPP established a curriculum that was designed to be delivered in one eight-hour day. The outlin e below captures most of what the program has addressed since its inception. The current curriculum is divided into six main sections, which are outlined briefly here: 1. Prostitution Law and Street Facts , focusing on the legal consequences of subsequent offenses and addressing johns' vulnerability to being robbed or assaulted while involved in prostitution. 2. Health Education , describing the elevated risk of HIV and STD infection associated with prostitution, and stressing that many STDs are asymptomatic and/or difficult to detect and have long term negative impacts on health. 3. Effect of Prostitution on Prostitutes , focusing on numerous negative consequences for women serving as prostitutes, such as vulnerability to rape and assault, health problems, drug addiction, and various forms of exploitation. 4. Dynamics of Pimping, Recruiting, and Trafficking , featuring discussions of how pimps and traffickers recruit, control, and exploit women and girls for profit, and the links between local street prostitution and larger systems of human trafficking. 5. Effect of Prostitution on the Community , describing the drug use, violence, health hazards, and other adverse consequences that co-occur with street prostitution. 6. Sexual Addiction, focusing on how involvemen t in commercial sex may be driven by sexual addiction, and where help for this condition can be sought. Although not listed as a core component of the FOPP curriculum, many of the classes contain a section on policing prostitution . The discussions focus on police surveillance of all types of commercial sex (street, brothels, escort services, massage parlors, storefronts, and web-based), and are intended to provide participants with the impres sion that they will stand a great chance of rearrest if they continue involvement in any type of commercial sex. Other john schools have been found to have longe r programs with more items covered in their curricula, and shorter with fewer items. For exam ple, the Sexual Exploitation Education Program (SEEP) which operated in Portland, Oregon from 1995-1997 was a three-day, 15-hour intervention. Other programs are delivered in a multiple-session counseling format. The most involved of these is the program in Salt Lake City operated by Umoja Tr aining; an outline of their curriculum is provided below. 105 105 http://umojatraining.com/services.html This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 71 Week 1: Male Socialization Purpose: to gain understanding of male socialization process and its impact on male-female relationships. Week 2: Female Socialization Purpose: to identify differences between male and female socialization; understand how female socialization affects female relationship behavior; and gain insight into personal treatment of women. Week 3: Sexual Messages Purpose: to gain perspective about how familial rela tions, upbringing, religion, peers, and the media impact our sexual relationships and behavior. Week 4: Prostitute Panel Purpose 1: to dispel myths about why women prostitu te and educate about prostitution's impact on women. Purpose 2: to encourage class participants to evaluate their sexual treatment of women and to recognize and respect their sexual partners limits. Weeks 5 and 6: Communication Purpose: to make class participants aware of the relati onal impacts of different communication styles and to introduce new interpersonal skills. Week 7: Anger Purpose: to help class participants identify the way t hey express anger and the relational impact of their anger style; and increase awareness of alternative anger management choices. Week 8: Healthy Intimate Relationships Purpose: to differentiate between healthy and un healthy interpersonal and sexual relationships. Week 9: HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention Purpose: to decrease the spread of HI V and other sexually transmitted infe ctions between prostitutes, johns and their partners. Week 10: Personal Power Purpose: to encourage class participants to make healthier decisions about their lives. Other programs are shorter and simpler. For exam ple, the john school portion of the Indianapolis \"Red Zone\" program covers community impact and health consequences, although other topics will arise in the mediated discussion format. The Norfolk john school program is delivered in one to two hours, and the new video john school produce by th e Cook County Sheriff's Office covers the basic elements of the FOPP but in just 14 minutes. An expanded set of information on john school curricula will be provided on the website. The relative impact of the various program models is not known, as most program models have not been evaluated for their impact on reoffending. \"Like some of our other diversion programs, this [Prostitution Offender Program of Lucas County, or john school] is a great way for some of the first-time offenders to really learn the consequences of their actions and to give them an opportunity to examine what may have led to that behavior.\" Municipal Court Presiding Judge Michael Goulding, Toledo, Ohio, 2011106 106 http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2011/04/04/ John-School-offers-new-perspective-2.html This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 72 Common Misconceptions about John Schools The john school paradigm has become controversial, with both advocates and detractors. In our review of the research and professional literatu re and commentary among advocates involved in the issues of prostitution and human trafficking, it is clear that some of the discussion is based upon misconceptions about the range of variation in john school structure and program content, the types of offenders served by the programs. While information about the real range of programs and the people served by them is presented in th is report and on the guide and webs ite, we thought it would be useful to address the misconceptions and misunderstandings about these programs directly. Note that this discussion is not intended to advocate for or agains t johns schools, but instead to help place debates about them on firmer empirical ground. Misconception #1: All john schools are, and must be, diversion programs, allowing men who buy sex to avoid prosecution. The most common criticism of j ohn schools is that they are diversion programs that allow men arrested for attempting to purchase sex to avoid an ar rest record and or criminal punishment. While it is true that the model program that most people refer to when they are speaking about john schools (San Francisco's FOPP) is a diversion program th at results in dismissal of charges upon successful completion, the structure of these programs as divers ion versus sentencing opti ons is independent of the educational component that is the backbone of the program. In other words, it is mistaken to believe that john schools must be structured as diversion programs. Attendance in john schools is not at the offender's option in one-third of U.S. john schools: courts sentence men to participate in the program if they feel it is inappropriate treatment or punishment, and in such systems participation is mandatory, and charges are not dismissed for successfully completing the program. Men are sentenced to participate in nearly one-third (29%) of john schools, and another 19% are structured as options for both divers ion and sentencing options (some men attend as a condition of a sentence, others other in the same program may attend pursuant to a diversion program). Just 52% of the john schools in the United States are structured exclusively as diversion programs. Figure 3.21: John Schools Structured as Diversion Versus Sentencing Options John School Program Structure Number of John Schools Percent of John Schools Diversion 25 52 Sentence 14 29 Either Diversion or Sentence 9 19 For those debating the merits of john schools, it is important to consider whether it is fair or just for men arrested for soliciting to have access to a program that allows their charges to be dismissed and avoid a conviction appearing on their records. In jurisdictions where men ar rested for soliciting have the option of diversion, but women arrested for prostitution do not have equivalent options, the inequity is manifest. However, it is not logical to oppose all john schools because one disapproves of diversion programs. The educational component of john schools is independent of being structured as a diversion or sentencing option. Those believing that diversion programs such as the FOPP let men This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Final Report pg. 73 escape with \"a slap on the wrist\" should argue against having john school participation be voluntary and allowing participants to avoid criminal charg es and conviction. However, those features do not provide a legitimate basis for opposing the john sc hool concept, which is built around educating men who have been arrested for buying sex about the harm of such behavior. Misconception #2: John schools accept men arrested for soliciting sex with children. Some critics of john school programs argue that it is inappropriate for men who prey upon children to have the option of attending a john school and then have their charges dismissed and escape serious punishment. No rational person would disagree that this would be inappropriate - but the premise has no basis in fact. John schools do not accept me n arrested for soliciting sex with children. None of the publicly available information about john schools suggests that any of these programs are designed for men arrested for soliciting sex from mino rs. All of the eligibility criteria we have seen exclude men with sex offenses in their criminal hist ory, and stipulate the range of offenses for those who are targeted. In California, for example, th e john school programs admit men arrested for penal codes 647.b (soliciting sex) and 653.22 (loitering with intent to solicit sex), both misdemeanors. The FOPP in San Francisco is the largest john schoo l in the country and has served as the model for nearly all of the 50 john schools that have been laun ched in the U.S. since 1995. The eligibility criteria for the FOPP exclude anyone with a prior vi olent offense, sex offense, or domestic violence offenses, and all of the 7,500+ program participan ts were arrested during police operations using adults as decoys. One can safely say that and none of the participants was attempting to buy sex from a child when they were arrested, nor would they be allowed to participate in the program if they had such offenses in their criminal history. None of the other john school programs in the United States is known to operate differently. The pathway into john schools begins with arrest. Virtually all of the men who attend john schools in the United States are arrested for soliciting sex fro m a police decoy during reverse sting operations. All of the police decoys are adults, and none of them present themselves as minors. On occasions when reverse stings are web based, the bogus ads lead to men appearing at prearranged locations where an adult police officer serves as the decoy. It is true that police will conduct reverse stings specifically to find men who sexually exploit childre n, such as the large-scale operations coordinated by the federal Operation Lost Innocence. However, none of the men arrested for attempting to buy sex from children are eligible for any of th e john schools in the United States. We have no knowledge of a single case of a john sch ool attendee who was arrested for soliciting sex from a child, but it is possible that there are rare ex ceptions. For example, a few of the john schools in the United States (e.g., Kansas City, one of the Denver programs) accept self-referrals, and it is possible that some of the men who self-refer have seri ous offenses in their hist ories. Even in such cases, the serious sex offense against a child would not be the crime addressed by the john school. Misconception #3: There is no evidence that john schools reduce recidivism. Some john school critics argue that evidence of an impact on reoffending is either absent or inconclusive. There have been few formal ev aluations, but the one methodologically rigorous evaluation found a model john school program to substantially reduce reoffending (the other evaluation was inconclusive, but the data were insufficient to make a determination about the program's impact on recidivism). This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.National Overview of Demand Reduction Efforts Grant #2008-IJ-CX-0010 Abt Associates Inc. Final Report pg. 74 At this time, there have been only two formal evaluations estimating the impact of john schools on recidivism rates. The first was a study by Mont o and Garcia (2001), who studied a sample of 91 participants in the Sexual Exploitation Educati on Project (SEEP), a discontinued john school program that operated in Portland, Oregon from 1995 to 1997. The recidivism rates of the SEEP participants were compared to a group of 100 men arrested locally for soliciting sex who did not attend the program. Monto and Garcia found no significant difference in the recidivism rates of the two groups, but the design does not support any conclusion about the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of SEEP. The chief limitation of the study is that there were only three recidivists in the treatment and comparison group combined . There was simply insufficient statistical power to detect any program effect: three offenders could not be distributed in a way that would attest to a treatment effect, or to conclude that there was no effect. Aside from the sample limitations, the SEEP program did not provide a sound basis on which to assess the effic acy of the john school model. The Portland program studied by Monto and Garcia was atypical of john schools in the U.S. (or anywhere else), being a 15-hour, three-day program that was discon tinued in 1997 due to disagreements between the program staff and the government sponsors (e.g ., Hughes, 2004; Farley et al., 2011), and amid complaints that it was an ideological presentation rath er than an educational program (Franzen, 2003). Whether john school programs ought to be structur ed as diversion or sentencing options a separate matter from whether education is worthwhile or e ffective. A model for being both punitive and rehabilitative is the Norfolk john school, which levies a fine of $1,500, and mandates community service, and charges a supervision fee of $40 per day while doing community service, and requires attendance at a john school program. Attendance at the john school does not result in dismissed charges. The program provides both an educa tional intervention and applies relatively severe criminal sanctions - particularly for an offense classified as a misdemeanor, and beyond what we have seen in most other cities applied to those soliciting prostituted persons. Brewer and colleagues (2007) and ot hers (e.g., Farley et al, 2011) have used the Monto and Garcia (2003) study's results to argue that john school programs do not add anything beyond the deterrent effect of arrest. At the time Brewer and colleagues' research was underway, the prior study of the SEEP program was the only evaluation of a john school 's impact on recidivism, and it is true that Monto and Garcia did not find a pr ogram effect. However, given th e acknowledged limitations of the small-scale, comparison group study of one atypi cal, quickly defunct john school program (Monto and Garcia, 2003), it was premature fo r to conclude that the john school approach was ineffective in lowering recidivism. It is also a misrepresentation of the Monto and Garcia results to say they found the program to be ineffective; instead, the data we re insufficient to find any program effect, either positive or negative. Misconception #4: The deterrent effect of arrest is the rea l cause of the reduction in recidivism attributed to the San Francisco john school. One could argue that the arrest process alone - and not the john school program - could teach men how to avoid recapture. It is virtually impossible fo r arrest to have produced the decline in recidivism observed. First , arrest was a constant across all of the cases in the database used to evaluate the program (Shively et al., 2008). Since all of th e 80,000 men in the database had the experience of arrest from 1985 to 2005), something besides arrest must have produced the sharp post-1995 drop in recidivism rates in San Francisco.

Final Report pg. 75 Second , the decline in recidivism rates could be the result of FOPP graduates taking their commercial sex activity elsewhere (displacement). This is unlikely to explain more than a small portion (if any) of the observed effect. The data supplied by the California Criminal Justice Statistics Center (the state's central repository for criminal offender data) allowed us to capture re arrest anywhere within the state of California, and can therefore measure recidivism that may have been displaced by the FOPP to areas outside of San Francisco (except that pushed out of state). In addition, one must ask whether the FOPP would produce greater crime displa cement than would occur without the program. The FOPP is a voluntary program that allows offenders to have the charges ag ainst them dismissed. The participants must see the program as less punitiv e than tradition adjudication, or they would not choose that option. If so, it is reasonable to ask why the less punitive FOPP would be more likely to displace crime than the more punitiv e traditional sanctions. A possibility is that the class informs men of the increasingly harsh sanctions they will fa ce for subsequent offenses, and that those men who are either ineligible for the FOPP or who decline the option are not provided with the same information about the more severe consequences of reoffending. Third , the FOPP may motivate participants to stop pu rsuing commercial sex on the streets and to use escorts or solicit prostitutes in brothels or via the web. This displacement indoors or online is a plausible explanation and may account for some of the FOPP's effect. Since the SFPD conducts reverse stings almost exclusively as street ope rations, men who solicit sex online have almost no chance of being arrested in San Francisco. But again, there is no reason to expect that the FOPP would cause crime to be displaced online, beyond whatever displacement may be produced by arrest alone. Since john school presenters tell participants that police monitor prostitution transacted over the web, and this message is not conveyed to men adjudicated normally, we would expect the opposite effect: if affected at all, the participants of the FOPP should be less likely than others to shift their activity online. Misconception #5: John schools are costly. One of the recurring criticisms of john schools is that they are costly, and divert scarce resources away from pursuing more serious crime. There is little empirical support for any part of such criticisms. First, john school programs are not cost ly, and the modest resources that are necessary to support them are normally fully supported by fees or fines that are paid by a rrestees. A few of the john school programs that charge smaller fees do not fully support themselves, but still cover most of their costs. Most of the john schools in the U.S. are one-day programs from 4 to 8 hours in length. Most of the one-day programs meet four to six times per year , and some a few as once per year. Most of the presenters who are not public servants are paid mode st stipends of $50-$200 per day, and many come and present as volunteers. There are usually one or two people from the Police Department or prosecutors office who stay for the entire session, and sometimes other public servants (e.g., from a public health department) come for one hour or so to make brief presentations. We have not found any john school program to cost more than $3,500 per class to conduct; and single classes have been found to yield over $40,000 in revenue. There is little substance to fiscal criticisms of progr ams with low annual costs that typically cover all of those costs through participant fees or fines, and can generate additional net revenue used to subsidize police enforcement operations and survi vor support programs. The typical john school does not cost taxpayers anything, making them one of the most cost effective offender interventions.

Final Report pg. 76 Misconception#6: John schools are designed to shame. John schools have been portrayed as being shame-b ased, or built around the intent to humiliate or publicly berate men who buy sex. Whether this is true depends upon the john school program, the separate presentations within the program, and what is meant by \"shaming.\" If one defines shame as the personal feeling of shame about one's own beha vior, then the programs may promote shame. All of the john schools we have observed work hard to convey the message that buying sex is harmful, and that the men - knowingly or otherwise - contri bute to a wide array of social ills with their behavior. We have observed individual presenters and community impact panels in john schools in Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, Indianapolis, a nd Worcester (MA) whose style could be regarded as confrontational, and their intent could be to embarrass the men or make them feel ashamed of themselves. However, the empirical record shows that buying sex results in harm, and it is difficult to avoid pointing out the harm in the behavior when pursuing an education agenda. Shame in response to learning that one's behavior harms others may be a prosocial response, and provide motivation to change. If one defines shame as public censure, or social s tigma, then most John schools work in the opposite direction. Since over half of john schools are eith er exclusively diversion programs, or can be either diversion or sentencing options, diversion from normal prosecution helps arrestees to avoid being publicly shamed. Diverse programs allow arr estees to avoid a conviction by having charges dismissed, making it easier to escape having one's employ er, family, or friends learn about the arrest. However, about one-third of the john schools in the United States are structured as conditions of sentences where participation is not optional, a nd does not result in avoiding conviction. When sentenced to a john school, the program has neither mo re nor less of an impact on public shame than most other sentencing options, and far less than efforts to purposely publicize identities. Additional Observations about John Schools The john school model is one of a handful of tac tics that is a programmatic response specifically designed to address the buyers of commercial sex. Most of the other tactics we discuss are standard criminal justice procedures applied to the crime of purchasing sex, such as seizing autos used in the commission of a crime, community service programs, and fines are not tactics developed particularly for combating demand for prostitution. John school s are an innovation specifically designed to intervene with known buyers of commercial sex, at tempting to reduce the incidence of reoffending through education or treatment. John schools have become contr oversial among those working to address the problems of sexual exploitation and sex slavery. While there are st rengths and weaknesses for any sanction or response to crime, many of the objections about the prog rams appear to be based upon misconceptions or incomplete information. For example, some believe that john schools accept men arrested for soliciting sex from children, and believe that it is inappropriate for men to receive such a mild \"punishment\" from the criminal justice system for su ch serious offenses. They would be right the injustice of such a mild sanction, if it ever occu rred, but it is not true that john schools accept men who have bought (or were trying to buy) sex with children. None of the john schools in the United States accept men arrested for soliciting children , and to the best of our knowledge, all of the U.S. john schools structured as diversion programs disqualify men with sex offenses in their criminal history.

Final Report pg. 77 Objections can stem from legitimate concerns about john schools, but people may reject the whole educational paradigm based on features of one john school program (usually, the FOPP in San Francisco, the model for most john schools) that are not inherent to the model. For example, some object to men being allowed to have their charges di smissed if they attend a john school (e.g., Farley et al., 2011). One third of the john schools in th e United States are struct ured as sentencing options, in which participation is mandatory for men sentenced to attend, and attendance does not result in the dismissal of charges. In this report, we present evidence about the range of configurations of john schools, and discuss common misperceptions about them. The john school model is one of the few interventions designed to combat commercial sex markets for which there is strong empirical evidence of e ffectiveness. If communities wish to pursue \"what works\" and promote evidence-based practices, its leaders and coalition members should be well- informed about such practices. The john school programs vary substantially, and th is variability points out a need to gather and provide information about why alte rnative models have been developed, and how they operate on a number of dimensions: diversion versus sentenced, partners leading and participating, presenters, content of presentations, structured as brief singl e classroom sessions vers us counseling programs meeting weekly for over up to 10 weeks. Reverse s tings, auto seizures, and other standard criminal justice responses are fairly (or at least relativel y) uniform over time and across communities, and so they can be described more briefly. \"It's about time.

Discussion This project was designed to gather information that would provide a descriptive overview of initiatives targeting the demand for commercial sex in the United States. The current report describes the process of gathering the information used in this (and other) reports, and discusses specific initiatives, and highlights selected communities to illustrate how and why their members have endeavored to address prostitution and sex trafficking by combating demand. The report is intended to serve as an introduction and as foundational mate rial for those considering applying anti-demand tactics in their communities, and for those at the state government level who are considering policies, statutes, and infrastructure investments supporting local efforts. Those wishing to take more concrete step for planning, implementation, or improvement will find additional information on the website, where they can select from a wider range of information that best fits their specific needs. This final section of the \"descriptive overview\" report is not a revi ew or summary of its content, but instead is a set of concluding comments and a brief discussion of th e implications of some of the key findings. Description versus Evaluation An important consideration for any reader of this report is that the overview provided is not an evaluation of any or all of the programs and practices we have identified and discussed. Our study was designed to provide descriptive information, which provides a foundation that can be used to determine what interventions can or should be eval uated. Through our review of the literature we encountered evidence that some of the tactics have been or may be effective. Prior research on a small number of interventions has found the ones evalua ted to be effective, but those are conclusions reached from other studies and are not a conclusion that our research directly refutes or supports. While our primary data collection was for descriptive purposes, we did encounter one case where we were able to obtain anecdotal evidence suggesting e ffectiveness. The evidence was in the form of interview data regarding an effort in Wilkes-Barre, PA that featured a concentrated effort in the 1980s to conduct reverse stings and \"shame\" arrestees. Interview subjects said that the intervention led pimps/traffickers to remove the city from a domes tic trafficking circuit and reduced local street prostitution by 75%. While this finding from Wilkes-B arre is encouraging and consistent with prior studies of effectiveness and the logical argument re garding the potential for demand-focused efforts to impact markets, it is still anecdotal. The fi nding could not be confirmed due to the lack of confirmation through a formal evaluation, the lack of availability of archival data from that timeframe. Through interviews with police in other cities on the trafficking circuit and news archives we did confirm the existence of the trafficking networ k and some of the details of the efforts to attack demand in Wilkes-Barre. We have not evaluated th e Wilkes-Barre effort or any other program aside from the FOPP in San Francisco, and aside from what was found in prior research and some anecdotal evidence, cannot through this study shed light on whether they produce their intended effects. Demand-Reduction is Primary Prevention Primary prevention refers to stopping events before they occur, or ensuring that people do not become afflicted by crime (or disease), rather than treating its symptoms. Secondary prevention refers to early detection, in an effort to minimizing harm, while tertiary prevention addresses recovery from fully realized afflictions. The majority of efforts in the United States described as preventive pursue tertiary or secondary approaches. Very little investment has b een made in primary prevention approaches.

Final Report pg. 79 While total elimination of commercial sex markets is unrealistic as a short-term goal, there is no reason to assume that markets cannot be signifi cantly reduced if the root causes are addressed, resulting in fewer victims\u2014and that is the hallmark of primary prevention. To correctly be considered preventive, it must be demonstrated that the approach reduces the prevalence and/or incidence of sex trafficking or exploitation. Approaches that simply displace crime from one street to the next, from the streets to indoors, from one town to another, or from one set of victims to another, may be considered effective by people at the original locations, but not by the new hosts of sexual exploitation or by the new set of victims. Similarly, programs that help survivors recover from being enslaved or exploited, or punish those who profit from selling sex, cannot be considered prevention programs unless they reduce the size of the overall markets (although we again stress that efforts to help survivors and prosecute traffickers are critically important to restore lives and seek justice, and should be strengthened and expanded). The only methods empirically demonstrated to s ubstantially reduce the size of commercial sex markets are those featuring a focus on (or includi ng as a component) combating demand. There is a lack of evidence showing that attacking pimps a nd traffickers or rescuing survivors affects the markets substantially. Sanctioning \"providers\" of commercial sex is not only unjust and inhumane, but ineffective in curtailing illicit commercial se x markets (e.g., DeMuth & Steffensmeier, 2004; Scott, 2003; San Bernardino County Sheriff's De partment, 1993, 1999), and successfully prosecuting \"distributors\" (pimps and traffickers) is di fficult and costly, and convictions are rare. Reductions in commercial sex markets should not be e xpected as long as demand is strong. Efforts to eliminate drug trafficking and drug abuse with an attacking heavily emphasizing supply and distribution have proven enormously expensive an d largely ineffective (e.g., Goode, 1997; Sharp, 1994). From an examination of the logic and causal mechanisms of any market, and the history of efforts to suppress illicit markets, one should not exp ect secondary or tertiary prevention efforts to have a substantial impact, since they address the symptoms more than the cause. Applying these lessons to sex trafficking, one could expect that if every survivor were rescued and every pimp and trafficker were arrested tomorrow, others would quick ly emerge or be trafficked to take their places. When demand is strong and the trade lucrative, as in the illicit drug trade, new supplies will be found if current ones are interrupted, and new people will step into the role of traffickers as long as there are profits to be made. The men who buy sex are often viewed as too inept to obtain sex conventionally, and vulnerable to the enticement of prostituted women. Others view them as driven by the inherently flawed nature of males, who are predisposed by evolution to obtain sex by whatever means necessary, and enabled by patriarchal systems, misogynistic culture, and commodification of sex. In these portrayals, the individual buyers of sex are rarely viewed as the chief cause of all commercial sex and most sexual slavery. Frequently, police will raid brothels or c onduct street operations a nd arrest persons engaged in selling sex, and occasionally arrest a pimp, but simply let the \"customers\" go without any intervention, or after receiving less serious sanctions than the victims or pimps. The weight of the evidence shows that there is less interest in pursuin g the buyers of sex than in helping survivors or prosecuting pimps and traffickers although demand has been identified as a primary driver of commercial sex and trafficking markets.

Final Report pg. 80 Combating Demand: Major Needs and Opportunities Several substantive needs were identified by prac titioners working to prev ent and respond to sexual exploitation. Across many sectors, education was identified as a key need in the effort to combat demand. Specific needs include initiatives designed to: (a) directly impact actual and potential buyers of commercial sex, and (b) influence people who can be mobilized to combat sexual exploitation by implementing interventions for actual and potentia l buyers, including the general public, teachers, police, businesses, the military, public health professionals, and policymakers. Curricula are needed for programs reaching a variety of populations, resources are needed for training programs, and access to target populations must be acquired\u2014especially access men at risk of (or have engaged in) illegal commercial sex, policymakers, and practitione rs in professions comba ting sexual exploitation. An issue about which there was great consensus in our interviews and other research is the need to educate boys. While our study found that most interventions focus on arrest and post-arrest tactics, many of those we interviewed felt it was \"too far downstream,\" and the two really prevent sex trafficking one should go further upstream and attempt to intervene before the buying of sex occurs. There are processes established for how to include new topics such as commercial in school-based curricula. The basic steps of the process are (a) as sembling panels of experts in the subject matter, education, and curriculum development, (b) deve loping a core curriculum, and then fielding the curriculum. Important to include in the process of curriculum development are school boards and textbook publishers. There are past successes in impl ementing lessons in sex education, civility, bullying, and hate crime in school curricula, and these successes can serve as models. Regarding sexual exploitation and sex trafficking, the CAASE program in Cook County and Chicago has already developed (in collaboration with other local partners ) a curriculum that could be helpful in developing a model that could be refined, adapted, and replicated. One of the major impediments to productive action against sexual exploitation is that in some communities, prostitution is not considered a pr iority requiring substant ial attention of law enforcement. To shift public opinion and generate political will, a small number of communities have developed messages directed to the public, and to distinct segments of the population that can support and lead efforts to combat demand\u2014such as lawmak ers, agency supervisors, and practitioners from public health, criminal justice, social services, business, and education. The city of Atlanta has conducted the most high-profile and systemic efforts of this kind, which will be described in the city profile on the DemandForum website. One of the most important targets for education is prosecutors. Police tend to follow the lead of prosecutors in their enforcement ac tivities, since they don't want to commit their time to investigating cases that are not carried forward for prosecution, or that result in minimal penalties. Where police know that prosecutors will pursue their cases against men who buy sex, they have incentives to bring those cases to prosecutors. Both prosecutors and police could benefit from training about the definition of sex trafficking/sexual slavery, par ticular in relation to pimping. In our National Assessment research, we found that most police and prosecutors did not regard women working for pimps necessarily to be sex trafficking victims. However, any reasonable definition of slavery or human trafficking (i.e., service compelled through force, fraud or coercion; lack of compensation beyond subsistence; inability to leave freely) ma kes pimps traffickers, and women \"working\" for them to be trafficking victims. Education and trai ning is needed. One of the challenges is that law enforcement is wary of the anti-trafficking movement pushing the definition of slavery into street prostitution, and federalizing what is a local or stat e crime. The training would have to make it clear This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Final Report pg. 81 that compelled commercial sex or prostitution is sex ual slavery, but that prostitution without a pimp or trafficker (although itself a crime) is not. In addition to educators, police are on the front lines in the efforts to reduce prostitution and sex trafficking, but most law enforcement agencies are under-resourced and/or do not prioritize sexual exploitation. There is a need for information, peer support, and other resources police require for intervening with the buyers of commercial sex, as well as special programmatic interventions and collaborative community problem-solving approaches designed specifically to combat demand. While there is a need for information sharing, there is also a great reservoir of knowledge and experience among practitioners. Some communities ha ve conducted reverse stings for over 45 years, and have had john school programs operating for nearly 30 years. There are numerous tactics that can be supported by providing practitioners with training and technical assistance , generating peer networks and suppor t through conferencing and web-based solutions: Leveraging existing resources and opportunities. There is an existing foundation of resources and opportunities to build upon in tr ying to increase, expand, or improve anti- demand efforts. For example, existing professi onal associations and programs with parallel interests could be prevailed upon to add co mbating demand for commercial sex to their current platforms, e.g., campus date rape training programs, corporate travel policies and human resource protocols, and military traini ng programs could add messages about the harm of buying sex. Survivor leadership has been critical in producing prev ious successes, such as encouraging police to focus on demand, founding john school s and public education programs designed to generate greater awareness among policymaker s, practitioners, and the public about sexual exploitation in general, and the need to co mbat demand in particular. Survivor-led organizations and/or those providing services to survivors are in place in over 100 U.S. cities (see Appendix J), and are positioned well to assist efforts to combat demand. Research . Whenever possible, it is preferable to have a solid empirical foundation to inform the development of new interventions, and to assess and improve the performance of existing efforts. The key test of any initiative is whether they produce results, and performance measurement systems and evaluations produce th e most credible evidence. Research and development is an important support for action and accountability, and includes the gathering of new descriptive information about the range of the current practice and policy, performance monitoring of current and new de monstration interventions, evaluations of programs and practices, basic research on the cau ses and consequences of sexual exploitation, and disseminating research findings to benefit practice, policy, and effective interventions\u2014including educational and social marketing efforts. Money . While money is certainly not all that is n eeded, and in some instances is not the most critical need, one cannot avoid concluding that every sector (private, public) at all levels (federal, state, local; policy and practice) would benefit from additional resources. Most NGOs operate with limited resources, and the financial downturn of recent years has reduced their capacity and impaired their work. Simila rly, government agencies have had budget cuts, curtailing enforcement of laws and policies, and implementation of prevention programs. One of the frustrations we observed among law en forcement personnel was that many agencies This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Final Report pg. 82 and organizations have the necessary skills and desire to take action, but are prevented by resource limits from conducting the number or kinds of operations they believe are effective. For example, arresting buyers of commercial sex and educating those who are arrested are evidence-supported practices (e.g., Poland et al., 2008; Shively et al., 2008; Weisburd et al., 2005), when properly executed, and hundreds of police departments across the country have identified the need for reverse stings, have the skills necessary to conduct them, and are convinced they are effective tactics. Yet many police departments have severely cut or have eliminated the enforcement units that conduct reverse stings and other operations aimed at sexual exploitation (e.g., Tucson, Arizona; Va llejo and San Jose, California). In other instances, police departments shift priorities wh en the community demands it or when other crime problems increase. For example, the Rockland, Illinois Police Department continued to receive an average annual flow of approxi mately 1,500 community complaints about prostitution in 2011, but during the summer had ex perienced an increase in armed robberies. The Rockland Police Department cut back on pr ostitution reverse sti ng and sting operations, and shifted those resources to address the emerging armed robbery problem, and arrests of johns fell 64% from 2010 to 2011. 108 We have tracked reverse stings for over five years (in this and a previous project), and have seen a sharp reduction in their numbers over the past year. Our interviews with police staff found that budget cuts have led to widespread staff reductions, and department leaders have had to rearrange priorities to stretch scarce res ources. Given that prostitution is classified as a misdemeanor crime or a civil ordinance violatio n, it is easy for police departments to justify de-prioritizing anti-prostitution efforts in order to focus on \"more serious\" crimes - that is, those classified as felonies. While most police personnel recognize that prostitution both attracts and generates the full array of felonies (e.g., kidnapping, rape , assault, drug abuse, robbery, weapons offenses, organized crime a nd gang activity, property crimes, and human trafficking), departments have to cut somewh ere, and they often choose to de-emphasize pursuit of misdemeanors when faced with staff reductions. Given how demand drives sexual exploitation, and how prostitution and sex trafficking are magnets for\u2014and causes of\u2014many felonies, many people i nvolved in combating pros titution and trafficking believe that more severe penalties for buying sex ar e necessary. In addition to education, there is a punitive aspect of law enforcement interventions. Among the other suggestions we heard from police and others interviewed about how to deter men from buying sex were: o Make the purchase of sex a felony . o Establish mandatory, substantial jail sentences for first offenses , and prison terms for subsequent offenses. o Require those convicted of purchasing sex to register as sex offenders . o Eliminate diversion options that allow johns to have their charges dismissed. 108 http://www.wrex.com/story/16414527/prostituti on-arrests-in-rockford-drop-significantly This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Final Report pg. 83 o Mandate severe fines , and use the revenue to support \"restorative justice\" programs for survivors. o Require men arrested for buying sex to assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting pimps and traffickers o Mandate education for men arrested for buying sex, without necessarily offering education as an optional diversion in lieu of criminal sanctions. We have encountered arguments against most of these suggestions, and there are reasons why some of these ideas - particularly the ones about harsher penalties - are unlikely to be realized, or occur only rarely. For example, criminal justice rese arch has established the general concept of court systems (including all participants: judges, prosecu tors, and defense attorneys) developing a \"work group\" understanding of \"the going ra te,\" or a general agreement about what is a fair punishment for each offense type (e.g., Walker, 2006). If the court work group believes a certain level of punishment is fair and just for a specific crime, and new legislation or ordinances require more serious punishment, the group will find a way to work around it - through plea bargaining to other offense categories, or through changing enforcement pract ices. The more serious punishments may be enacted in locales where there is the political will to pass new laws, but it is unknown how they will be enforced. A frequent refrain in discussions of attacking pimps and traffickers is that it is nearly impossible to convict them because the testimony of prostituted and trafficked women is needed, and they seldom cooperate (and when they do, it can be at great risk to them). However, there is another source of intelligence that has seldom been pur sued, and that is the buyers of sex. Requiring men arrested for buying sex to assist law enforcement in investig ating and prosecuting pimps and traffickers is an approach that is not necessarily punitive - and c ould be less punitive, if they exchange their cooperation for reduced penalties. It has the advantag e of opening up an avenue of investigation that has seldom been pursued. Buyers often interface directly with pimps and traffickers, and they could provide valuable information about the identities of traffickers, particularly if the penalties for johns were severe enough so that police would have leverage in plea barg aining. A type of sting could be utilized that would involve male undercover officers approach ing pimps who had been identified through intelligence from customers, and having them try to arrange \"dates\" with prostituted or trafficked women. Details of such operations would have to be worked out, and it is uncertain how effective these would be, but it is an idea that seems worth pursuing. Mandating education for men arrested for buying sex could be considered more punitive than having it as a diversion option, but punishment would not be the objective. In addition to its inherently punishing nature, arrest provides an opportunity to educate men about the consequence of soliciting prostitution\u2014particularly about health risks, the trauma experienced by survivors, and the impact on communities.

Appendix B B-1 Appendix B. Research Design and Data Collection Methods Overview The study was designed to fill current gaps in knowledge about prostitution and sex trafficking demand reduction efforts through nationwide, primary da ta collection via surveys, interviews, and site visits, and through review of information from se condary sources such as the social science literature and news archives. The purpose is to inform pr actitioners and policy makers about the range of options that have been successfully - and in some cases, unsuccessfully - employed. The key objectives of the study were to gather and disseminate practical info rmation about initiatives designed to reduce problems associated with prostitu tion and sex trafficking through efforts to reduce demand for illegal commercial sex. To do this, we developed and executed a strategy designed to gather as much information from as wide a range of sources as we could, given time and resource parameters. Our two key foci were (1) gathering descriptive information of the kind most useful to practitioners and policymakers who are either planning or implementing demand reduction interventions; and (2) to develop a typology and a national overview of tactics that have been implemented. To pursue these objectives and maximize return on our investment of resources, we did not attempt to field sample surveys designed to estimate prevalence or otherwise generalize beyond our sample. We engaged in purposive sampling and an approximation of \"snowball sampling\" in order to gather data from a wide range of sites and ensure we had data from each type of intervention in our preliminary and then final typology. Given that we are not estimating for generalizing, we do not focus on response rates for statistical power provided by our sample. In this appendix we describe the steps taken in conducting our reviews of the professional and research literature, and in reviewing news archiv es and contemporary news reports. To assemble the information necessary to pursue the project objectiv es, we engaged in a number of data collection activities, beginning with compiling a preliminary typology of interventions and a list of cities and counties identified as having engaged in some fo rm of sex trafficking or prostitution demand reduction activity. We then conducted a survey a nd phone interviews with program and agency staff and stakeholders, and site visits that included program observations and in-person interviews. More detail about the decision-making behind the method, and details about the execution of the design are provided below, but as an overview the steps involve d, and the data collected , can be summarized as follows: Web searches and reviews of research and evaluation literature o Reviews yielded over 4,000 source documen ts collected, including books, journal articles, technical and agency reports, news reports Daily web searches were conducted for three year s, focusing on news of tactics applied to combat demand Questionnaires had been sent to 500 sites o Completed questionnaires were receive d from 241 respondents at 199 sites This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Appendix B B-2 227 interviews were conducted with respondents at 75 sites o Between a paper survey and interviews, we received input on issues related to the implementation of anti-demand efforts from 274 experts from law enforcement, public health, city government, and human services agencies, as well as neighborhood organizations and nonprofit orga nizations devoted to combating sexual exploitation and human trafficking. o In our survey, we received 241 completed questionnaires from practitioners in 199 cities and counties. We conducted 226 interv iews with people from 75 of those sites, and visited 11 cities and counties in order to observe program activities and conduct interviews. Through questionnaires and/or interviews, information was gathered from respondents having the following breakdown of affiliations: 194 police and sheriff's departments 20 city and county prosecutor's offices 17 NGOs focused on prostitution and human trafficking 13 NGOs providing broad-spectrum social services and support 6 private counseling practices 6 public health departments 5 city/county government (e.g. mayor's offices, community service departments) 5 neighborhood organizations 11 \"other\" (community courts, probation departments, universities, Weed & Seed programs) 274 Total Eleven site visits were conducted: o Atlanta, GA o Cook County, IL o Indianapolis, IN o Kansas City, MO o National City, CA o Norfolk, VA o Phoenix, AZ o Portland, OR o San Diego, CA o Tucson, AZ o Worcester, MA John schools were observed at five sites: o Indianapolis, IN o Norfolk, VA o Phoenix, AZ o San Diego, CA o Worcester, MA This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Program documents were collected about all known types of demand reduction interventions: o For example, tactical plans for reverse stings; city ordinances; memoranda of understanding; program agendas; john school curricula; speaking points for public education presentations; the text of deco y web advertisements; program summaries and reports; agency press releases; prostitution exclusion zone maps Literature and Web Reviews With the goal of identifying communities that have employed tactics to address the demand side of markets for illegal commercial sex, and obtaining in formation about the interventions, a systematic review of hundreds of documents and web sites was conducted, including obtaining sources describing: research on prostitution that examines its etiolo gy and the impact on the all of the parties directly involved and the communities in which it occurs whether there are links between prostitution a nd human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation the motivations of men who buy sex sites that have employed anti-demand tactics descriptions of programs and practices that have been used to combat demand evaluations or other studies of the effectiveness of interventions that address demand contact information for those engaged in anti-prostitution and anti-trafficking efforts We engaged in a multifaceted effort to identify, screen, and collect source materials. From our previous work on prostitution and human trafficki ng we had accumulated a substantial collection of literature. We built upon our exis ting library through systematic web searches, as well as through an approximation of \"snowball sampling,\" examining the sources cited by each of our obtained sources. In addition, we examined publication lists, references, and links to other resources provided by advocacy organizations. Assessing the Utility of Source Materials Decision rules were developed and imposed to help manage the great volume of source materials. The rules were designed to help determine the cr edibility and value of source materials, to guide decisions about inclusion in our review. Ou r knowledge of human trafficking and prostitution dynamics and interventions led us to many of th e obvious and widely known sources: e.g., various Department of Justice publications; the work of prominent scholars and experts in relevant areas; non-government organizations; and st ate government offices and task forces. We then expanded the search beyond sources of which we were previously aware. When faced with new research source materials, we weighed (1) whether the methods employed appeared sound, when assessing empirical research, and (2) the credibility of the sources, when assessing empirical research as well as opinion, commentary, testimony, and \"thought-pieces.\" Appl ying these two criteria often involved additional This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. Abt Associates Inc. Appendix B B-4 steps and the application of secondary criteria, par ticularly in trying to assess source credibility. For example, a strong indicator of the credibility of a piece of research or legal commentary was whether it was published in a forum involving a review proc ess. Government-sponsored studies and academic journals were regarded more highl y than other sources primarily becau se of relatively rigorous review and accountability processes, at both the research and the publication phases. Given the nature of our study, news reports were valuable sources. From the beginning of the project, the project staff has conducted daily web searches fo r contemporary reports of the employment of tactics aimed at reducing demand, such as reverse sti ngs and shaming. We also found news archives an important source of information about the development and earliest uses of anti-demand interventions. We found there were usually limits to what can be learned about the early use of these tactics based upon interviews; given the normal lengt h of careers and staff turnover, most of the people we surveyed and interviewed were unable to provide information on interventions or events that occurred more than 10 or 20 years ago. News archives were used to verify and often to override what was learned through interviews about the hist ory of efforts to address demand in communities. Some unpublished research manuscripts, editorials, press releases, and other documents are accessible via the web pages of individual researchers and those of associations, advocacy groups, and other private organizations. Unpublished sources were regarded as supplemental at best, and were scrutinized carefully for methodological rigor and for other signs of credibility since they had not passed a peer review process. On-Line Search Services Abt Associates began its extensive search of publis hed journal articles using web search engines. For reports on applied research and program evaluations in the field of criminal justice, we used the online capacities of the National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS). NCJRS maintains one of the largest repositories of web sites devoted to criminal justice statistics, and is arguably the world's most extensive source of research and statistical information on criminal justice. NCJRS is a central source of information produced by all th e bureaus of the U.S. criminal justice agencies, including the Department of Justice, Office of Ju stice Programs, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the Office of Juvenile Justice and Deli nquency Prevention (OJJDP), the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC), and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). The NCJRS search functions also cover research and practice journals, and reports by state and municipal criminal justice agencies. Google scholar was used to expand the search. The web tool supports searches across a broad range of disciplines and sources, including peer-reviewed ar ticles and reports, student theses, books, abstracts and articles, from academic sources, professional or ganizations, private research, and universities. To double-check for published articles that may have evaded Google Scholar and NCJRS, we used free online services to search university library co llections, and searched the major law and social science journal web pages. In addition, we sear ched for books on prostitution, sex trafficking, and law enforcement with at Amazon.com. To supplement and double-check for sources that may have been missed through the NCJRS, Google Scholar, Amazon, and library sear ches, we conducted web searches using Google and other commercial search e ngines (e.g., Ask, Yahoo). The general searches broadened the search considerably, identifying we bsites of state and local government agencies, non- governmental organizations, and i ndividuals, blogs, newspaper articl es, state and federal laws, and other materials. Some of the source materials f ound through these search engines were available in This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Appendix B B-5 full-text form online and free of charge. Other s ources were obtained through local libraries, library duplication and loan services, or were purchased by Abt Associates' staff. Table B.1 illustrates the breadth of source materi als identified by several of the online search engines1. While numerous key words and phrases were used, we illustrate using general phrases like \"prostitution \" and \"sex trafficking.\" As can be s een here, a Google search of the full web listed over 39,000,000 \"prostitution\" and over 4,000,000 \"sex trafficking\" source materials. Google News searches identified a high volume of entries, with an average of over 6,000 items appearing on \"prostitution\" and over 300 for \"sex trafficking\" in a given month. Google Scholar found over 260,000 sources for \"prostitution,\" and 6,000 for \"s ex trafficking.\" Amazon.com identified over 4,500 \"prostitution\" and 145 \"sex trafficking\" books and monographs. The NCJRS abstract search returned over 300 sources for \"prostitution\" and 25 sources for \"sex trafficking.\" These figures are provided not to suggest that we examined all of the sources, but to convey the \"sampling frame\" or broad scope of the pool of resources available on the topics studied. Table B.1: Sources Identified by Select Internet Search Engines The numbers presented in Table B.1 cannot be totale d due to considerable overlap across types of sources of search functions. For example, many of the books on prostitution identified in the NCJRS abstracts search were also included in the list of sources returned by Amazon, Google Scholar, and Google Web. In some cases, reports on the singl e study resulting in a research report or monograph would also appear in journal article form, and w ould be identified in the Ingenta search as well as in Amazon or NCJRS searches. Finally, the numbers returned by the general Google Web and News searches are inflated by repetition and by sources in appropriate for our inquiry, such as listings for television shows, lecture notes for college courses, commentary in blogs and \"position statements\" by private individuals with no apparent expertise as either practitioners or researchers in the areas of prostitution or sex trafficking. 1 These numbers are provided for illustrative purposes, to provid e a sense of the breadth of material available and the magnitude of the task of reviewing it. These figures were accurate on one day in late 2011, but change frequently as new sources are added and links to some web sites are added or deleted. For example, a Google search on the phrase \"prostitution arrest\" returned over 10,200,000 listing, but may produce different results at any later point. Given this, the numbers provided in Figure B.1 are not replicable.

Appendix B B-6 The NCJRS search engine was highly effective in identifying relevant reports describing applied and academic research sources and scholarly journal artic les. Google Scholar returned many of the same journal articles as those identified by NCJRS, and was useful for expanding the search and identifying articles addressing sexual exploitation published outside of mainstream cr iminal justice journals (e.g., sociology and psychology journals ) and those addressing subjects not tied to the criminal justice system: e.g., those examining causation, victim impact, and community experiences with prostitution or trafficking. Amazon.com was effective in identifying books and monographs not located by NCJRS. Organization Web Sites The web sites of organizations addressing hate or bias crime issues were examined for research reports, legal resources, or other references. Fo r example, foundations and advocacy groups such as the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, End Child Prostitution and Trafficking, Polaris Project, and Prostitution Research and Educa tion have made available reports, position statements, news updates, links to other sites, and other materials re garding prostitution and sex trafficking. Web sites of research organizations (e.g., Urban Institute, Po lice Executive Research Fo rum, and the Institute for Law and Justice) and of professional associations (e.g., International Association of Chiefs of Police, National District Attorneys Association, Am erican Prosecutors Research Institute) were also examined to find studies and other materials focu sing on criminal justice and other government responses to hate crime. Several organizations mo nitor human trafficking crime law (both statutory and case), and we reviewed their work on the subject (e.g., Polaris Project). Surveys Overview of Respondents In the first stage of survey data collection, the first 500 sites identified to have engaged in anti- demand tactics were surveyed. About 400 of the entr ies on the list of 500 sites were identified prior to the study. Web searches of news reports and archives in the early stages of this study builds the list to 500 and end then beyond. Completed surveys were re turned by at least one respondent in 199 sites.2 This is a 40% overall response rate . As we discussed, response rates are not very important for this study, as we are not modeling, estimating, or otherwise trying to generalize beyond our sample. Nevertheless, we calculated the rate for those who may be curious. Since the main purpose of the study was to describe tactics used , rather than to model or estimate, the response rate below the standard threshold of 60 or 70%, when used for studies involving estimation or modeling is not considered problematic. Our key concern was getting information about the full range of the kinds of interventions that have been identified. The second step was to select sites of specific interest. They were selected on a number of criteria intended to yield a sample that had representation of small, medium, and larg er communities, counties as well as cities, to ensure that each of the tactics was represented by several sites that use those tactics, and to ensure that the sample included sites that have innovative, successful, and pioneering programs. Of the sites targeted, respondents from 142 returned the survey, for a 92% response rate 2 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Appendix B B-7 among targeted sites. The \"screening\" survey instrument and the \"second interview\" guide are presented in Appendix C. The third step was to select sites for interviews. Su rvey respondents were asked whether they would agree to be interviewed for the study. Respondent s from 193 of the 199 sites agreed to be interviewed (a 97% agreement rate). Seventy -five sites were selected for additi onal data collection via interview, and 226 interviews were conducted at these sites. The criteria for selection were the same as for targeting sites for the survey: to ensure that each of the tactics wa s represented by several sites that use those tactics, to capture innovative practices, etc. The fourth step was to conduct site visits. Site Visits The principal purpose of the site visits was to doc ument the operations of a variety of prostitution and sex trafficking demand reduction programs in order to prepare the project reports and the Website, offering detailed, practical suggestions for how other jurisdictions can establish, sustain, and improve their own programs. From the interviews, surveys, and literature review, we gathered site-specific descriptive information, such as years of operation, program goals, struct ure, activities, and in rare cases, evidence of outcomes and impact. Based on this information we developed a typology of interventions. Criteria for selecting sites to visit and study more intensiv ely were developed to pr ovide a subsample with a range of: 1. longevity and stability 2. organization and structure 3. curriculum content and modes of delivery (for john schools) 4. innovation 5. geographic diversity We selected some sites in order to provide insight into \"best practices\" for major types of interventions. To this end, we over-sampled well- established sites that were in operation longest and for which there was evidence of stability and future program sustainment. To provide points of contrast, we studied newer initiatives as well as those that were more well-established. For example, Phoenix, Arizona has a john school that is among the longest running, while Portland, Oregon was preparing to launch a new John school within two weeks of our site visit (as well as having one of the more interesting histories regarding implementing johns schools, with two programs that had been started and then discontinued in the 1990s and 2000s). While such criteria were anticipated from the stud y's beginning, what we learned through experience led us to another criterion for selecting sites to visit: The sites must have something to observe that justifies the investment in conducting a visit. While initiatives might be innovative or exemplary, some types of interventions are straightforward enough that not much is gained in observing them or being on site to interview staff in person. We soon learned that most of the types of interventions are simple and straightforward enough that they could be readily described in a little more would be gained in watching them operate. For example, reve rse stings can be captured sufficiently through This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Appendix B B-8 description of the number of decoys and support sta ff involved, the areas in which they operate, and the \"rules of engagement\" governing how decoys interact with potential and actual arrestees. We did \"ride alongs\" with police during reverse stings in Cook County, Illinois and Tucson, Arizona, but did not pursue police ride-along as further. Similarly, th ere was little reason to visit sites in order to study shaming, \"dear john\" letters, and several other t ypes of initiatives. We observed johns engaged in community service activities in Norfolk, Virginia an d Indianapolis, Indiana, but again, learned little by doing so that would be helpful to other communiti es, so we did not make an effort to observe other community service programs. We learned that john schools were the kind of inte rventions that required observation in order to understand them. John schools are comprised of presenta tions or sessions whose content is part of a curriculum that may be outlined or described, but it' s beneficial to observe them to confirm that the content is being delivered as intended, and by whom , and how well. For example, we visited several john schools that all discuss health risks involved with prostitution, but in one program this component occupied nearly two hours of an ei ght-hour class and was intensely detailed (Los Angeles), while the typical program covered this in about 30 to 40 minutes (e.g., Phoenix, San Francisco), and at the other end of the spectrum were john schools providing coverage of health topics in less than 15 minutes (e.g., Indianapolis). We ultimately visited 11 sites, eight of which ha d john schools and at had implemented at least three other kinds of anti-demand interventions. Table B.2. indicates the tactics known to have been employed in each of the 11 sites. The two sites that are shaded do not have john school programs. Table B.2.

Cook County, did not have a john school when the site visit occurred in 2009. In October 2011, the Cook County Sheriff's Office released a short video version of a john school, designed to be shown to all men arrested for soliciting while they are being processed. The intervention is a 14 minute DVD briefly addressing the topics typical of most john schools, such as health, legal, and crime victimization risks, and the impact of prostitution on communities and the providers of commercial sex This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Appendix B B-9 Overview of Site Visit Activities Each site visit continued the accumulation and assessment of information about demand reduction efforts at the sites, building upon what was learned through web and literature searches, survey, and interviews. The key activities of each site visit were: Site visit planning Site visit o Observe program activities o Collect program documents and information o Interview program staff and stakeholders Reporting o Summarizing the site's program(s), highlighting what is innovative, unique, and/or effective. o Integrating the information gathered into the database, final report, and guidance document. Depending upon what was encountered at a site, completion of the site visit protocol would involve follow-up phone interviews, additi onal document requests, or additional web searches. Each site visit, as explained below, invol ved conversations with program contributors and collection of program-related materials. Where relevant and feasible, each visit also involved observation of program operations. Site Visit Observations and Discussions In advance of our visits, we worked with each pr ogram director or supervisor to identify both the general types of people we wished to talk with as well as the specific individuals. Some interviews were conducted via phone before or after the site visit, but most occurred on-site. Respondents . The specific types of individuals we spoke with varied with each program, in general we sought to interview: program directors (e.g., john school directors; Chiefs of Police; heads of NGOs) program supervisors (e.g., head of vice unit; assistant district and city attorneys, judges) and line staff (e.g., patrol officers, detectives, john school presenters) staff of contributing agencies and organiza tions (social workers, neighborhood watch members; members of community-based organizations) agency administrators whose support for the progr am is essential to its existence (e.g., social service agency directors; city council members) information specialists (e.g., police department crime analysts, heads of agency information systems) Interviews generally ranged from twenty minutes for busy participants or those with a less central role, to two hours for program directors or supervisors. Locations . We met in a variety of venues, e.g., at the program office of NGOs (e.g. Kansas City), churches hosting john schools (e.g., Indianapolis), po lice stations (e.g., Worcester) and substations This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Appendix B B-10 (Cook County), Sheriff's Offices (e .g., Norfolk), city halls (e.g., San Diego) and police vehicles during ride alongs (e.g., Cook County, Tucson). There were instances where we met with people in gr oups. For example, in Portland we held a group meeting with eight individuals from the district at torney's office, city council, and several NGOs from Portland, Multnomah County, and Marion County. In Atlanta we held individual meetings in offices of an NGO, held a group meeting in the city hall, and attended a program session for survivors in a jail. While the group settings allowed us to obt ain a wide range of feedback efficiently, most of our site visit conversations took take place in one-on-one settings so that people did not feel constrained in what they could tell us. Site Visit Discussion Objectives and Topics. Going into each visit, we learned as much as we could about the site's demand reduction programs through web reviews, the screening survey and additional phone discussions and email exchange s, and from documents we had collected from site staff. The visits were primarily for observation, confirmati on, and additional data collection, and follow-up interviews with staff. The precise questions to be asked for each visit varied, since many questions had been asked and answered prior to the visit, and other questions were very site-specific and interview subject-specific, and others arose in res ponse to what encountered during the visits. That said, prior to the visits we anticip ated asking questions in one or more of the following general topic areas. The site visit discussion guide is presented in Appendix C. program origins (e.g., initial \"champions,\" goals, needs assessment, rationale) program planning and implementation (e.g., personnel, steps taken, obstacles and challenges encountered, timeline) staffing (e.g., who, how many, hierarchy, responsibilities, qualifications, recruitment, turnover, champions, meetings, training) collaborating agencies and individuals (e.g., roles, contributions, staffing levels) coordination (e.g., lines of authority, meetings, MOUs) operations (physical location(s) of activities; descrip tions of typical programs or operations (e.g., reverse stings, shaming, john school classes [see the attached discussion guide for operational questions specific to each type of demand reduction program]) operational challenges and solutions (e.g., securing resources over time; competing demands on staff and other resources) aggregate description of the johns targeted (e.g., age, socioeconomic status, marital status) funding (e.g., annual budget; changes over tim e; sources; fund-raising strategies) facilities used (e.g., office space; pre-existing or rented, leased, or purchased for the program) legal issues (e.g., enabling legislation, legal challenges, case law) evidence of effectiveness (tracking data, performance meas ures, evaluations conducted) accountability (e.g., who is responsible for ensuring that the program is implemented as intended, and how evidence is used to make this determination) Site Visit Observation Guide and Checklist When relevant and feasible (in terms of the safety of project staff, privacy concerns related to johns, and confidentiality of program operations), we observed the program \"in action.\" For example: This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Appendix B B-11 for an educational program (e.g., john sc hools), we arrange to observe a class for a reverse sting, we observe the street-level decoy operations for community service, we watched j ohns performing the required activity When we learned that observing a program was feasible, we used an observation checklist specific to the particular activity we would observe to ensure that we focused on the actions and dialogue that were pertinent to our report. For john school programs, we used an IRB-approved observation protocol based upon one that Abt Associates had used for the evaluation of San Francisco's First Offender Prostitution Program (the observation protocol is included in Appendix C). The observations allowed us to: confirm that the program operates and provides some insight about whether it does so as designed learn more about challenges faced by the program, and how they are overcome gain a visual understanding of its operation that will assist us in describing the program in our reports or website develop a rapport with program staff that can facilitate responsiveness to our information requests be physically present, enhancing our ability to collect documents (such as an agenda and handouts for john school classes) Documentation and Secondary Data Collection We attempted to obtain as much program documenta tion as possible before we visited in order to: reduce the amount of time we spent on site collecting materials that could otherwise be spent talking with program staff and stakeholders gain the best possible understanding of the program before we visited, so that our questions are most relevant compare the materials with what participants told us and wh at we observed about program operations We collected some materials while on site that program participants preferred to give us in person, or felt required explanation. The following are exampl es of the materials we attempted to obtain when they existed and could be shared with us (i.e., the materials were open to the public, and there were no privacy or other human subjects concerns or restrictions): program proposals or concept papers needs assessments contracts, interagency agreements, or M OUs among partner agencies and organizations staff recruitment information (e.g., brochures, job descriptions) statistical reports (e.g., on local economic conditions, criminal ju stice statistics, public health statistics) tactical plans (e.g., for reverse stings) decoy ads for web and print media reverse stings This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

We cannot generalize findings beyond the sa mple studied, and make no attempt to do so. There are reasons to believe that we have capture a substantial portion of all cities and counties that have conducted a reverse stings were employed other tactics studied. One indication of this is that the pace of uncovering new sites slowed dramatically over the past year. Part of that decline appears to be a function of fewer reverse stings being co nducted due to shrinking police budgets and to competing priorities of law enforcement agencies. But it may also result from our having discovered a large proportion of sites that have engaged in these activities. Substantiating that possibility is the fact that when we find news coverage of rever se stings, they are usually in communities that are already in our sample. In a ddition, we learned of very fe w additional sites through snowball sampling; when respondents listed other communities that have employed anti-demand tactics, we usually knew of them already through our literature review and news archive searches. While there are some encouraging suggestions that we have capt ured in our study most of the sites we sought and types of tactics that have been used, it is likely that there are some communities that have engaged in demand focused interventions that we have not discove red, and tactics that we have not learned about. Another limitation of the study's design is that th e surveys, interviews, and site visits captured information at a point in time, with attempts made to fill in history where possible. Most of the interviews and the surveys occurred in 2009-2010. The information was current at that time, but this study was not and is not a surveillance system - do es not capture program feat ures and events in real time, or represent what occurs at each site toda y. Surveillance systems are ongoing, and far beyond the resources available for our project. The curre nt study was meant to provide an overview and sense of the range and prevalence of tactics, and where possible, their history. More importantly, it was meant to capture information th at can be used at sites starting new efforts or seeking to sustain, improve, or expand existing efforts.

Appendix C C-6 II. Second ______________ of Abt Associates, and I' m calling regarding our project for the U.S. Department of Justice on efforts to reduce the de mand for prostitution and sex trafficking. We had contacted you* several weeks ago and received permis sion to contact you for an interview. Is this a good time talk, or should we arrange for another time? The discussion should take between 30 and 40 minutes. Your community has been selected to be one of 1 50 U.S. sites that we are studying to learn more about different approaches to reducing demand for prostitution and sex trafficking, such as reverse stings, john schools, and publicizing names of arrested johns. The purpose of the project is to produce and distribute a \"best practices\" guide and establish a practice-oriented website. The information you provide will be kept strictly confidential: No specific individuals will be quoted or identified in any reports produced from this survey. The only exception to strict confidentiality is that you may choose to be listed as a resource in the guide and website we produce. We will ask you about this later in th e discussion, and there is a consent form for those who are interested in serving as a resource. Your participation is completely voluntary: you m ay decline to answer any particular question, or stop altogether at any time. Your refusal to participate will not jeopardize your relationship with the Federal Government or with your agency or organization. If you have questions about the study or about your participation in it, information for contacting Abt Associates research ers will be provided (Michael Shively at 617-520-3562, or Sarah Jalbert at 617-349-2998).

Appendix C C-7 1. Confirm the Range of Local Demand-Reduction Initiatives In our first survey we learned that in this community the following activities occur that focus on the buyers of commercial sex. We want to confirm that we are aware of all of the local demand reduction effort: Approach Occurs locally (Yes / No) Year Began # Per Year Street level reverse stings Web-based reverse stings Other reverse stings (e.g., print media escort ads; CB radio) Shaming (publicizing names/photos of arrestees, sending letters home) Auto seizure Driver's license suspension Geographic restraining orders or \"stay- away\" zones Public education/awareness campaigns Neighborhood watch programs Surveillance cameras Community service programs Letters to homes (\" dear john\" letters) John schools Other In the rest of this discussion, we will ask you about The history of these efforts locally : when they started, how and why they were initiated. Structure and operational details : e.g., how often reverse stings are run, staffing needed, penalties for arrestees, etc. Program activity and performance : e.g., tracking data, performance measures, annual reports, program evaluations. Whether the program could be evaluated : e.g., whether data exist that could support an evaluation, and whether they would be inter ested in collaborating with evaluators. Collecting and displaying program documents Interest in participating in further research and evaluation: e.g., additional interviews, allowing research staff to visit and observe.

Appendix D D-2 A Brief Discussion of the Military and Demand for Commercial Sex The forces that contribute to commercial sex are found in concentrated form when examining the historic relationship between the presence of the military and prostitution. A great deal of attention has been paid to the role of military personnel in fueling demand for prostitution and sex trafficking worldwide (e.g., Allred, 2006; Zimelis, 2009), throughout history and across 2007; 1993; Moon, 2009; Ringdal, 2004). Where there is a large military presence, usua lly one finds prostitution in high concentrations (e.g., Daranciang, 2010; Stensland, 2008). 1 In the United States, for example, histories of civil war army camps discuss \"travelling brothels\" that fo llow troop movements (Krick, 2002). Contemporary reports describe the presence of thousands of U.S. military personnel near the border of North Korea as creating a robust market for commercial sex, and that women are trafficked from abroad to serve this market (e.g., Enriquez, 1996, 2005; Macint yre-Tongduchon, 2002; Malarek, 2002; O'Sullivan, 2004). By the 19th and 20th centuries, the US military had taken some form of a stance against prostitution (e.g., Krick, 2002; Ringdal, 200 4), but mostly to avoid infectious disease and other negative consequences for their armed forces, rather than a concern for women and girls in prostitution or an objection to the injustice of exploitation. U.S. war propaganda and basic training portrayed \"promiscuous girls\" and prostitutes as the war's \"t hird peril\" (Ringdal, 2004). Until relatively recently, aside from the health ri sks, involvement in prostitution was often tolerated (if not encouraged) by military leaders, who viewed is inev itable for robust, young, and single men, or even a healthy diversion and effective means of handl ing stress. Many have asserted that military establishishemnts globally, including those of the Un ited States, have (and perhaps still do, to some extent) tacitly approved of prostitution as a \"diversi on\" or means of stress management (e.g., Parsons, 2005; Protection Project, 2005; Raymond, 2004; Ringdall, 2004; Talleyrand, 2000). The role of the U.S. Military in Asia has receive d particular scrutiny. For example, Japanese and South Korean bars and nightclubs close to U.S. military bases attracts service members (e.g., Hughes et al., 2007; Moon, 1997; 2009), and play a role in domestic and international sex trafficking. Beginning during the Korea War, American servi ceman have historically found easy access to prostitution, and several distinct kinds of pr ostitution involving military personnel as customers became institutionalized. Moon (1997) discusses camp towns whose economies are heavily 1 To some extent, it may be unfair to focus on the military's contribution to sexual exploitation, unless similar scrutiny is applied to other sectors. It may be that the critical factor in the hi storic correlation between military presence and prostitution is the concentration of young men in a largely single-sex environment, and not the military per se. Prostitution has been found to increase around large sporting events such as Super Bowls and soccer World Cups, and business conventions and areas catering to male business travelers. In these environments, the gender imbalance and period of time spent in gender segregated environments are far less than in military environments. That said , the observation that prostitution occurs with greater frequency in areas with a larger military presence is beyond dispute. We focus on it here not to malign the military, but as background information explaining recent, promising steps the U.S. Armed forces have taken to ameliorate the problem. It may be that the DOD is taking a leadership role, and their training on commercial sex can serve as a model for businesses and other sectors.

Appendix D D-3 dependent upon what American servicemen spe nd in establishments featuring prostitution. Prostitution along the military zone adjacent to the North Korean border contain a lower strata of persons engaged as street prostitutes, to those working in bars and brothels, to a higher strata in which women serve a role as a \"camp town wife\" or domestic servant expected to provide sex. \"A standing army always contains a significant proportion of a nation's most vigorous young men, at the phase of their lives when their sexual energ y is at its peak. Soldiers live in a controlled environment, with few chances of social or emotional diversion... More than two thousand years of tradition had established as a qu asi-scientific \"fact\" that soldi ers need brothels and that the need increases as an Army switches over from passi ve readiness to active warfare. Discipline and the line of command are strengthened and stress factors expand exponentially. This accentuates the need for diversion among the soldiers, no matter how little free time they have.\" Nils Ringdal, Historian, 2004. Establishments hosting prostitution that operate near military bases in South Korea are known as \"juicy bars\" (Rabiroff, 2010). The U.S. Forces Ko rea currently lists about 60 establishments as off- limits to service members because of prostitution and human-trafficking violations, but there are an estimated 200 juicy bars near U.S. bases (Rabiro ff, 2010). Women working at these bars are given with the primary job of flirting with service memb ers in hopes they will buy the women expensive juice drinks in exchange for their company. The bars make money on the sales of drinks. The women at such establishments are often Filipino and workin g without pay; if they fail to sell the quota of drinks, bar owners may force the women to prostitute themselves to costumers to pay off their \"bar fine\" (Zimelis, 2009., Rabrioff & Hae-Rym, 2009). Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, in its report on South Korea (Protection Project, 2005), discussed the military's influence on prostitution: \"In March 2002, Fox Television broadcasted an undercover investigative report documenting the participation of U.S. servicemen in the South Korean sex industry. U.S. Courtesy Patrol officers sta tioned near Camp Casey in Tonguch'on shared information with journalist Tom Merriman on the mechanisms used by traffickers to bring women into the country and even offered tips on how to barter for the services of prostitutes. All places of prostitution are off limits to military personnel in South Korea, but according to some, U.S. military commanders condone and even support visits to prostitutes by assigning Courtesy Patrol officers to the bars to facilitate safe access to commercial sex for the servicemen.\" Although solicitation of prostitution is an offense under article 134 of the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice, few U.S. servicemen have been prosecuted for this offense (Rowland, 2008). In May 2002, a U.S. senator and 12 members of Congress, alarmed by the Fox Television report, requested a Pentagon investigation into the U.S. military's role in the trafficking of women and girls to South Korea. The Department of Defense concluded in a 20 03 report that soldiers visiting brothels in South Korea may have facilitated sex trafficking in South Korea and surrounding countries (Protection Project, 2005). It has been widely speculated that although prostitution is illegal in South Korea, the This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Appendix D D-4 government has tolerated or played a role in allowing a prostitution industry to exist that is geared toward serving U.S. troops (Zimelis, 2009). The 2010 U.S. State Department Trafficking in Pe rsons Report references juicy bars and describes how U.S. military bases influence the location of prostitution establishments. Singers and bar workers recruited to work in bars near U.S. military bases were often trafficked for prostitution. Advocates in the fight against human trafficking hope the r ecent mention will spur the Korean government to enforce stricter laws about prostitution near military locations (Rabiroff, 2010). In the past 10 years there are signs that prostitu tion and sex trafficking are being regarded as more serious problems, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) is taking steps 2 to ensure that the armed forces do not contribute to the problems (e.g., Casem, 2004; Jelinek, 2004). In 2004, the DOD launched a program to combat commercial sexual exploitation and human trafficking, and has strengthened their policies and established a training program that features educating personnel about the harms of prostitution. 2 See article at http://www.stripes.com/news/next-up-for-172nd-dealing-with-sadr-city-1.54000, and U.S. Army and http://www.combat-trafficking.army.m il/documents/training/TIP_20Feb09.ppt http://www.dodig.mil/Inspections/IPO/combatinghuman.htm http://ctip.defense.gov/ This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The Chief of Police or designees will ask a person requesting a variance to provide and update an address through which the person can be reached for the duration of the variance in the event the City determines there is a need to amend or revoke the variance. E. REVOCATION OR AMENDMENT OF VARIANCES. Variances may be revoked or amended for the following reasons and in the following manner: 1.
