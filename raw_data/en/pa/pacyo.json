In this article, we'll talk you through everything you need to know about essential oils, so by the end, you'll be fully in-the-know about some of the different options (as there are many essential oils out there), the benefits and uses. So, let's start at the beginning shall we? By providing you with an overview of what essential oils are: What are essential oils? Essential oils are oils, but they aren't like the oils you use to cook with, such as your vegetable and olive oils, they're oils that capture a plant's aromatic scent or flavour. These oils are extracted from plant leaves, bark and roots by either using distillation or cold pressing. Once extracted, they're then combined with a carrier oil, creating a product that's ready for us to use. (Note - essential oils that have been created through chemical processes are not classed as being true essential oils).1 What are carrier oils? Carrier oils are oils that are taken from a plant's nuts, kernels or seeds and used to dilute the powerfulness of essential oils. Given the fact essential oils contain sure pure plant extracts, they're almost too pure to use neat. Doing this can potentially result in skin irritation, such as redness, or even, burning. So, this is where carrier oils come in. They're vegetable oils, coconut or avocado oil, for instance, that are mixed with essential oils to reduce their potency. In turn, this can help improve their effectiveness on our skin. (Tip - carrier oils are also called base oils too, just in case you were thinking you have to use base and carrier oils). Other types of carrier oils: jojoba, black cumin seed, jojoba, grapeseed, evening primrose, rosehip.2 Types of essential oils Now that we've covered carrier oils, which are a necessary element of using essential oils, let's focus back on essential oils again. Just as there are different types of essential oils, there are all sorts of different essential oils too! They include: - Lavender - Tea tree - Peppermint - Spearmint - Geranium - Lemon - Clary sage - Frankincense - Ylang ylang - Patchouli - Tangerine - Orange - Citronella - Cedarwood - Grapefruit - Ginger - Star Anise - Spearmint - Sandalwood - Thyme - Rosemary - Turmeric - And many more.... How to use essential oils Now this is where the fun begins, as there are lots of ways you can use essential oils. You may want to just use them in one particular way or you may want to experiment and mix up the way you work with them, each and every time you use them. You can:3 - Add some drops to your bath - this can help boost their therapeutic and relaxing qualities because they affect the limbic system or the emotional brain. - Pop some into a diffuser - this is a great way for you to feel the therapeutic benefits of essential oils in the environment around you. What's more, you only need to use two to three drops at a time. The best essential oils for diffusers include: eucalyptus, peppermint, lavender, tea tree and patchouli.4 - Inhale them - to do this, put a few drops of your chosen essential oil on a muslin cloth and take three deep breaths. Alternatively, mix your essential oil with a carrier oil, such as coconut or evening primrose oil, and then apply a few drops on your palms and breathe in deeply. - Put them on your skin - it's really important to remember that you shouldn't dab essential oils directly on your skin, as they may be too strong for your skin and cause some sort of reaction, which is far from ideal. However, this doesn't mean you can't put them on your skin, you just need to blend them with a carrier/base oil before you do. Once combined, you can apply essential oils to your face and the rest of your body. It is important to seek professional advice and to follow instructions on label carefully prior to use. - Dab them on your feet - now this may sound a little unusual, but it's a common practice when using essential oils. Just pop some on the soles of your feet and massage it in - our feet actually contain key absorption points for essential oils. (Don't forget to blend them with a carrier oil first though).
