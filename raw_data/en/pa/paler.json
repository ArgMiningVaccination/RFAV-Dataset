Fact is, they don't need to. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or benign prostatic hypertrophy, is a common problem encountered in the older man. Estimates of how many males suffer from an enlarged prostate vary: Whatever the exact figure is, it is clear that symptoms of an enlarged prostate are common in men over the age of 50. The prostate is part of the male reproductive system. The prostate gland lies at the base of the bladder, surrounding the urethra - the tube that carries urine from the bladder when you urinate. A healthy prostate is about the size of a chestnut. As a man gets older, there is a tendency for the prostate to enlarge. Although we know quite a bit about the biochemistry affecting prostate cells, we don't really know why prostate enlargement occurs - why some men suffer an enlarged prostate and others don't. However, what is clear is that as the prostate gland enlarges, it presses against the bottom of the bladder (irritative symptoms) as well as squeezing the urethra in a way which interferes with urination (obstructive symptoms). This is the reason an enlarged prostate can give rise to difficulty in urination as well as trouble in control of bladder and sexual function. Symptoms of an enlarged prostate, in general, affect men from the age of 50 onwards. So, if you are in your 30's or early 40's, though not totally unknown, it is unlikely you will have a significantly enlarged prostate.

If you are experiencing symptoms of an enlarged prostate or think you have an enlarged prostate gland, the first thing you should do is to see your doctor to have the diagnosis confirmed. This step may involve an internal examination to feel your prostate gland, but it is important to overcome the embarrassment factor as it is vital to rule out more serious conditions such as prostate cancer. Should an enlarged prostate be detected, your GP may take blood samples for laboratory testing to ascertain PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) levels. This will provide further information and help in the diagnosis of an enlarged prostate. When the diagnosis of an enlarged prostate is confirmed, your doctor will be in a position to discuss the treatment options available to you.
