The last MYB covered 2018- 2022 and was delivered in 2019. I am pleased that after three full years of an all -hands -on-deck response to the once- in-a-lifetime COVID -19 pandemic, we are once again able to provide the PHEMCE MYB. This year's installment picks up where the last one left off covering 2022- 2026. As this MYB was built over a period of time in which there were continuing resolutions, omnibus spending bills, and a near -simultaneously released President's budget \u2014this MYB is indicative of the assessed need and does not substitute for requested levels in the President's Budge t or accompanying documents. If you have any further questions or would like more information, please do not hesitate to be in touch. Dawn O'Connell Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response 2 Introduction This Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Multiyear Budget (PHEMCE MYB) Report is the sixth submission in response to the requirement in Section 2811(b)(7) of the Public Health Service Act. This report includes the multiyear budgets for fiscal y ears 2022- 2026 for the following Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) entities involved in MCM development and stockpiling: the National Institutes of Health (NIH); the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response ( ASPR ) Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) ; and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is and will continue to be an important member of the P HEMCE ; however , this report does not include information on CDC's specific outyear budget. While CDC has activities related to Medical Countermeasure (MCM) utilization, those efforts fall outside the specific requirements for this Report. Section 2811(b)( 7) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act requires ASPR to lead the development of a coordinated five- year budget plan for medical countermeasure (MCM) development and to update the plan annually. Section 2811(b)(7) states: (7)COUNTERMEASURES BUDGET PLAN .\u2014Develop, and update not later than March 15 of each year, a coordinated 5- year budget plan based on the medical countermeasure priorities described in subsection (d), including with respect to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agent or agents that may present a threat to the Nation, including such agents that are novel or emerging infectious diseases, and the corresponding efforts to develop qualified countermeasures (as defined in section 319F - 1), security countermeasures (as defined in section 319F -2), and qualified pandemic or epidemic products (as defined in section 319F -3) for each such threat. Each such plan shall\u2014 (A)include consideration of the entire medical countermeasures enterprise, including\u2014 (i)basic research and advanced re search and development; (ii)approval, clearance, licensure, and authorized uses of products; (iii) procurement, stockpiling, maintenance, and potential replenishment (including manufacturing capabilities) of all products in the Strategic National Stockpile; (iv) the availability of technologies that may assist in the advanced research and development of countermeasures and opportunities to use such technologies to accelerate and navigate challenges unique to countermeasure research and development; and (v)potential deployment, distribution, and utilization of medical countermeasures; development of clinical guidance and emergency use instructions for the use of medical countermeasures; and, as applicable, potential post deployment activities related to medical countermeasures; 3 (B)inform prioritization of resources and include measurable outputs a nd out comes to allow for the tracking of the progress made toward identifie d p riorities ; ( C)identify medical countermeasure life- cycle costs to inform planning , bu dgeting, and anticipated needs within the continuum of the medic al c ountermeasure enterprise consistent with section 319F -2; ( D)identify the full range of anticipated medical countermeasure needs related t o r esearch and development, procurement, and stockpiling, including the potenti al ne ed for indications, dosing, and administration technologies, and ot her c ountermeasure needs as applicable and appropriate ; ( E)be made available, not later than March 15 of each year, to the Committee o n A ppropriations and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of t he Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Ener gy an d Commerce of the House of Representatives; an d ( F)not later than March 15 of each year, be made publicly available in a man ner t hat does not compromise national security . Congress requires A SPR to submit a PHEMCE M YB that includes c onsideration of t he entire medical c ountermeasures e nterprise and provide such document t o Congress annually. The last PHEMCE MYB was delivered in late 2019 and covers FYs 2018-2 022. ASPR is revising internal processes to ensure that future iterations of this critical professional judgment budget document will reflect both current resources provided by Congress as well as projected needs that build on requested l evels in the President's Budget. ASPR will continue to ev aluate its resources, as appropriated by Congress, to ensure the highest priority MCM needs are met. HHS appreciates the partnership with Congress to authorize and appropriate resources for critical missions and commits to improving the regularity of thes e reports . ASPR i s pleased to deliver t he curren t PHEMCE M YB which will forecas t the f unding required t o develop a nd su pport t he transition o f ten (10) MCM candidates f rom BARDA's P roject BioShield (PBS) t o stockpili ng by the SNS by F Y 202 6. While some of these MCM s may n ot have FDA approval , at the time of initi al delivery to the SNS, t hey coul d be hel d and lat er used in ce rtain circumstance s, such as under i nvestigational dr pr otocols, cl inical t rials or u nder t he FDA provisions for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) un der the Federal Food, D rug a nd Cosmetic (FD&C) Act. The tabl e below sh ows t he enacted funding provid ed to PHEMCE m ember a gencies i n FY 2022, requested funding in F Y 2023 P resident' s Budget , and estimate d funding through FY 2026 to improve preparedness and respons e for f uture publi c health e mergencies . The funding levels do no t accoun t for supplemental ap propriati ons (most notably COVID -19 supplemental appropriations) or requeste d mandatory f undin g to ke ep year -over-year f unding estimat es as comparable as p ossibl e. As d escribed in the t able below , the PHEMC E MY B projects an estimat ed overal l fundin g need of $64. 0 billion o ver the five-year per iod1 . The report est imates a 1 The previous report (FY 2018- 2022) included a different calculation methodology than the current report. The last report included two professional judgment estimates (FY 2021, FY 2022), the current report includes three years . 4 gap of $35.3 billion between the flat (FY 2022) level2 and projected five- year total , which would make it challenging for PHEMCE agencies to meet some of the programmatic goals described in this report within the five -year period. In addition, the table below depicts a sharp rise in projected costs for BARDA beginning in FY 2024 with slight decreases in projected needs in FY 2025 and FY 2026. The projected increase aligns with a multitude of 'start up' costs are not needed in FY 2025 and FY 2026. The PHEMCE MYB reflect s past appropriated levels (e.g. FY 2022) and is consistent with the FY 2023 President's Budget request; therefore, FY 2024 is the first year that is projected using the methodology described in this report . It is important to note this report's projections beginning in FY 2024 align to the principles described in the American Pandemic Preparedness Plan. Table 1: Estimated Total PHEMCE Spending by HHS Division and Fiscal Year (dollars in millions) Division represents HHS's current estimates for the basic research, advanced research and development, regulatory review, procurement, stockpiling, and replenishment of the U.S. government's (USG's) civilian medical countermeasure enterprise. This budget forecast does not take into account the competing priorities or budget totals that the Secretary, other HHS officials, and the President must consider when developing the annual President's Budget request. As noted in the FY 2018 -2022 Multiyear Budget that was delivered in 2019, and other reviews of federal stockpiling efforts, the primary challenge faced by the PHEMCE is the sustainability of the MCM response capabilities and capacities of the SNS . Successful development and procurement of an MC M by BARDA obligates SNS to expend additional funding for sustainment. PBS funding is used for initial MCM procurement for the SNS but is rarely used for replacement once the product is approved by FDA. Once products are approved, authorized, cleared, or l icensed by FDA, SNS assumes costs associated with ongoing maintenance and replacement . In the past, the PHEMCE SNS Annual Review recommended tradeoffs when available SNS funds were insufficient to both maintain current capabilities and absorb additional products. These tradeoffs translated to increasing levels of risk across the threat portfolios , potentially jeopardizing the nation's ability to realize the full benefits of prior research and development investments . For example, to meet budget constraints prior SNS Annual Reviews proposed reducing anthrax vaccine and antibiotics holdings . Such tradeoffs have led to the SNS inventory being below the established stockpiling goals for several types of MCMs. Beyond these immediate challenges, the PHEMCE must address the entire range of capabilities required to effectively use stockpiled MCMs in response to a public health emergency or natural 2 Flat level calculation assumes enacted FY 2022 funding for five-year period. 5 disaster. These include: the ability to rapidly and accurately detect that an incident has occurred that requires MCM assets; the capability to rapidly generate the data necessary to support the emergency use of MCMs using appropriate frameworks including clinical trials as well as expanded access and other emergency use authorization when necessary; the availability of evidence -based guidance on the appropriate use of these MCMs in all populations; the ability to monitor efficacy and safety of MCMs in all populations during and after an emergency to inform future actions; and the ability of state and local partners to receive, distribute, and dispense MCMs. These capabilities, the costs for which are only partially reflected in this report as this report only reflects HHS requirements and components within the PHEMCE enterprise, are as important as establishing and maintainin g a complete inventory of the appropriate pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. ASPR looks forward to working with Congress to overcome these challenges and ensure America is prepared for whatever threat is around the corner. Overview of Funding in Outyea rs The PHEMCE MYB forecasts the funding required to develop and support the transition of ten (10)MCM candidates from BARDA's Project BioShield (PBS) to stockpiling by the SNS by FY 2026. National Institutes of Health The NIH conducts and supports basic, translational, and clinical research to better understand the biological effects of, and to dev elop medical countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical, biological, and radiological/nuclear threats. Most of this work is conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) at the NIH. NIAID supports basic research on microbiology an d immunology as well as applied and clinical research to evaluate candidate MCMs including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. This strategic effort includes advancing approaches that could be used to develop MCMs against multiple threats or pathogens. These approaches include the development of vaccine platforms such as mRNA, discovery and development of novel vaccine adjuvants, and the discovery and development of targeted antibody therapeutics and broad- spectrum antibiotics and antivirals. NIH work s with partners in industry, academia, and the PHEMCE to ensure that promising countermeasures for biological, chemical, and radiological public health threats can proceed to advanced development. NIH has supported the early development of dozens of candi date MCMs for high -priority threats, and ultimately transitioned support for those candidate MCMs to BARDA for advanced development, with the goal of FDA approval, licensure, clearance, or authorization, and for potential inclusion in the SNS . NIH is well- positioned to respond rapidly to infectious disease threats as they emerge by leveraging research efforts , domestic and international research infrastructure that can be quickly mobilized and utilizing collaborative and highly productive partnerships with industry. For example, the accelerated COVID -19 response was made possible in part due to decades of research on vaccine platforms , vaccine adjuvants, and immunogen design, as well as the mobilization of several NIAID -supported clinical trial networks, in cluding the HIV Vaccine Trials 6 Network (HVTN), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC). NIH continues to expand and increase its support for the research infrastructure required to better prepare and respond to public health threats. For example, in 2021 NIH and BARDA launched the Antiviral Program for Pandemics (APP), which aims to build sustainable platforms for targeted drug discovery and to develop a robust pipeline of antivirals against viruses with pandemic potential. Innovative technologies and approaches supported by NIH are enabling the accelerated development of new MCMs. High- throughput sequencing and platform -based technologies are facilit ating the development and manufacture of MCM candidates to expedite their clinical evaluation. NIH continues to explore the use of antibodies to treat emerging and re- emerging infectious diseases, and as a first line intervention to prevent or slow the progress of infectious disease outbreaks as vaccines are being developed. Another innovative approach specific to vaccine development is the use of adjuvants. Adjuvants are valuable tools that boost immune responses to otherwise modestly effective vaccines, redirect immune responses to be more efficacious against specific pathogens, improve immunity in populations that otherwise respond poorly to vaccines (elderly, newborns, immunocompromised patients), and potentially can expedite development of vaccines for emerging pandemic threats. By providing antigen dose sparing, adjuvants can also stretch the vaccine supply. These NIH -supported activities are advancing a robust pipeline of candidate MCMs needed to ensure the development of safe and effective products to protect the public's health. As detailed in Table 1, NIH projects that the five-year funding estimate is $880.8 million above the flat level. Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response In 2005, Hurricane Katrina demonstrated the need for a federal agency to coordinate public health emergency preparedness and response, and the following year, the Pandemic and All - Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) established the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Last summer, 2022, HHS Secretary Becerra determined that ASPR would be elevated to an HHS Operating Division and renamed the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. This designation signals the important work that ASPR supports in the area of preparedness, response, and recovery. ASPR' s BARDA leads the advanced research and development and some acquisition of MCMs. ASPR's SNS leads the stockpiling of MCMs. As detailed in Table 1, ASPR projects that the five -year BARDA funding estimate is $31.1 billion above the flat level. Funds will primarily support BARDA's continued advanced development across Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear ( CBRN) threats, procurement of MCM s and new activities focused on COVID -19, and cross -CBRN threat advanced development. Ultimately, w hile BARDA has been successful in supporting the advanced development of 69 products that recei ved FDA approval , licensure, clearance, or authorization, the SNS's budget 7 has not had a commensurate increase to support stockpiling targets identified and set by the PHEMCE to aid in preparedness against identified public health and medical threats . As detailed in Table 1, ASPR projects that the five -year funding estimate for SNS is $2.6 billion above the flat level . For SNS, increased funding needs in FY 2024 are driven by the A nthrax , Ebola, and Smallpox portfolios. While the planned transition of Ebola vaccine to SNS procurement in FY 2024 makes up a relatively small portion of the SNS overall five-year budget plan, sustainment of Anthrax and Smallpox capacity is expected to account for approximately two thirds of SNS's procurement budget during FY 2022 to 2026. Food and Drug Administration The FDA plays a critical role in protecting the U.S. from CBRN and emerging / re- emerging infectious disease threats, such as SARS -CoV-2, Ebola, and mpox . FDA's responsibilities include reviewing the safety and effectiveness of MCMs \u2014including drugs, therapeutic biologics, vaccines, and devices, such as diagnostic tests \u2014to counter these threats.3 In addition to its regulatory responsibilities, FDA works closely with USG partners to build and sustain the MCM programs necessary to effectively respond to public health emergencies. This includes numerous engagements through the PHEMCE as well as worki ng closely with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to facilitate the development and availability of MCMs to support the unique needs of American military personnel. FDA supports the PHEMCE and DoD by providing subject -matter expertise in MCM development and by providing scientific and regulatory input to inform MCM development, procurement, and stockpiling decisions. In addition, FDA facilitates access to available MCMs to respond to public health and military emergencies, even when products are still investigational or not yet approved for that particular use, provided certain criteria are met. 4 The FDA facilitates the development of and access to appropriately safe and effective MCMs to counter high- priority CBRN and emerging/re- emerging infectious dis ease threats through a variety of activities, including: Supporting developers, manufacturers, researchers, and others in the development of new and innovative MCMs to meet FDA's standards ; Providing regulatory advice, guidance, and technical assistance to sponsors developing investigational MCMs for CBRN or emerging infectious disease threat indications ; Discussing questions with potential product sponsors to help clarify requirements for approval or emergency access if needed; Reviewing MCM marketing applications and approving those that meet standards for approval ; 3 MCMs include qualified countermeasures as defined in section 319F -1(a)(2)(A) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 USC. \u00a7 247d- 6a(a))(2)(A); qualified pandemic or epidemic products as defined in section 319F -3(i)(7) of the PHS Act (42 USC. \u00a7 247d -6d(i)(7)); and security countermeasures as defined in section 319F -2(c)(1)(B) of the PHS Act (42 USC \u00a7 247d- 6b(c)(1)(B)). 4 See e.g., sections 561 and 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). 8 Supporting the establishment and sustainment of an adequate supply of MCMs, including interagency collaboration on efforts to advance MCM supply chains ; Enabling access to available MCMs that are not yet approved for use\u2014when necessary \u2014through an appropriate regulatory mechanism, such as clinical trials, expanded access investigational new drug (IND) protocols, or EUA ; Responding to emerging and re -emerging public health threats ; Establishing an d sustaining Public Health and Security Action Teams to identify and catalyze the resolution of regulatory and scientific challenges associated with MCMs to address high priority threats ; Developing capabilities to monitor and assess MCMs used during publi c health emergencies and beyond including by providing technical advice to application holders on scientifically rigorous methods of assessing MCM effectiveness during real -world use and facilitating the production of reference panels to test the sensitivity and/or annual reactivity performance of certain EUA and cleared MCM in vitro diagnostic devices ; Sustaining the MCMi Regulatory Science Program to create tools, standards, and approaches to develop and assess MCM safety, efficacy, quality, and performance ; Encouraging manufacturers to develop innovative and emerging approaches to produce medicines through advanced manufacturing technologies ; Ensuring that the FDA regulatory and policy framework adequately supports MCM development and enables preparedness and response activities ; and, Sustaining the MCMi professional development program to ensure that FDA meets the regulatory challenges posed by the new scientific and technological developments to support the MCM mission . As detailed in Table 1, FDA projects that the five -year funding estimate is $7 77.2 million above the flat level. This increase is essential to enable FDA to sustain its ability to foster the establishment of clear, scientifically supported regulatory pathways for MCMs as well as to fill critical scientific gaps that inform regulatory decision making and support efforts to establish regulatory policies and mechanisms to facilitate the efficient use of available MCMs. Conclusion This report represents HHS's current estimates for the basic research, advanced research and development, regulatory review, procurement, stockpiling, and replenishment of the U.S. government's (USG's) civilian medical countermeasure enterprise. Estimates are subject to change . 9 Appendi x A: PHEM CE MY B Detaile d Portfoli o Analysis Background on the Multiyear Budget Methodology Each agency and program developed its own methodology for providing estimates for the PHEMCE M YB. T he estimates for procurement costs are point-i n-time estimates and could change in future reports t o reflec t current market prices. N IH assumed an inflationary increase in FY 2024, 2025, and 2026, using the NIH's B iomedical and Development Price Index (BRDPI) . For COVID -19 s ustainment, NIH assumed based funding to support efforts for preparedness a nd r esponse, such as evaluating effectiveness of countermeasures against COVID -19 v ariants and the discovery and development of pan- coronavirus vaccines . B ARDA assumed funding levels to address all DHS -identified threats with Materi al T hreat Determinations and to meet the goals of the HHS 2017 Pandemic Influenza Pla n U pdate and Executive Order 13886 Modernizing Influenza Vaccines in the United Stat es t o Promote National Security and Public Health. This funding is also in alignment wit h A merican Pandemic Preparednes s Plan, COVID- 19 lessons learned, and several oth er E xecutive Orders, including EO 140001- A Sustainable Public Health Supply Chain, an d E O 14005 Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers . T he SNS assumed funding levels necessary to maintain the current inventory as of th e dat e of this Report, including replenishment of all FD A ap proved/licensed/cleared/authorized MCMs and those not y et ap proved/licensed/cleared/authorized , including those originally acquired by Projec t B ioShield. Also, SNS includes an estimate of the funding that will be needed in out -year s t o replenish products originally purchased by PBS that are not yet FDA approved b ut w hich are forecasted to become so and require replacement in those years . F DA assumed a three percent increase for each of FY 2024, 2025, and 2026 for CB RN, pa ndemic and AMR funding. For COVID -19 sustainment, FDA assum ed 15 per cent of the total COVID -19 sustainment received for FY 2024 and 30 percent of the to tal COVID sustainment received for FY 2025 for NIH, BARDA, SNS , and FDA, were developed without regard to the competing priorities or budget totals considered in the annual President's Budget formulation process. These estimates are subject to change in the future. Summary of PHEMCE MYB MCM Investments This section provides an overview of spending across NIH, ASPR, and FDA, and describes accomplishments and projections over the course of the five- year period. Congress does not appropriate funding directly to the PHEMCE, but PHEMCE members , coordinated by ASPR , contributed information to provide the below summary of PHEMCE achievements. 10 Overview In total, the three HHS Divisions were appropriated $5.7 billion for non-COVID -19 MCMs and MCM- related activities in FY 2022 and have requested $6 billion to support th ese efforts in FY 20 23. Estimated five-year spending across the HHS enterprise is delineated in Table 1. The A ppendix B - PHEMCE MYB Spend Plan Tables provide additional detail. PHEMC E i nvestments for the five- year period total of over $64 billion . A SPR BARDA receives its funding from multiple sources including Advanced Research and Development (ARD) funding, Project BioShield (PBS) , and Pandemic Influenza (PI) funding. These sources (Table 2) have differ ent authori ties and periods of availably . For example, BARDA receives PI funding that is both annual (available for one fiscal year) and no- year (available until expended). Table 2: Estimated BARDA MCM Spending by Funding Source, FY 2022- 2026 -Based Approaches Figure 1 shows total five -year spending by HHS division for select high-priority threats. No single factor drives spending within any one portfolio, and each portfolio may contain several types of MCM s (e.g., vaccine, therapeutic, and diagnostic, etc.). A significant investment by BARDA may lead to a novel MCM that could be procured and stockpiled by the SNS during this report's timeframe, such that: Relatively less mature portfolios will show an absence of SNS spending (e.g., broad- spectrum antimicrobials emerging portfolios of earlier state research and development) . T hose MCMs that reflect a transition from early stage to advanced research are reflecte d by larger spending in BARDA's portfolio (e.g., chemical, filoviruses, radiologic al c ountermeasures) . R elatively more mature portfolios emphasize sustainment and reflect investments i n r eplenishment costs (e.g., anthrax, smallpox) . 11 Figure 1: MCM Estimated Spending by High-Pri ority Portfolio and HHS Division for FY 2022- 20265 Table 3: MCM Estimated Spending by High-Priority Portfolio and HHS Division for FY 2022- 2026 Anthrax Botulinum Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials Chemical COVID - 19 Filoviruses Multidisciplinary a combined summary of select PHEMCE investments as depicted in Figure 1. A detailed explanation of investments in each of these areas fol lows this summary and describes how funding support s research , development , and stockpile activities. Anthrax : $1.7 billion over five years. Part of this funding will support the advance d dev elopment, licensure, and procurement of the next -generation anthrax vaccine , A V7909, which will potentially lower future stockpiling and replenishment costs by r educing the number of doses of vaccine needed to treat patients . B otulinum : $388 million over five years. Funding will support sustainment of investment s i n preparedness for the misuse of botulinum toxin. This also includes development of a nex t-generation intervention to treat botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) . B road Spectrum Antimicrobials : $5.0 billion over five years. Funding will suppor t i mproved preparedness to treat infections caused by urgent and severe threats, as def ined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), includi ng 5 Figure does not include FDA regulatory support . 12 antimicrobial -resistant bacteria and biothreat drug- resistant fungal infections. Chemical: $1.5 billion over five years. The chemical threats portfolio includes : researc h di rected by the NIAID across six NIH institutes ; BARDA's advanced development of saf e an d more effective therapeutics for exposures to pharmaceutical -based agent s ( including synthetic opioids) ; chemical warfare nerve agents and vesicating chemicals ; t oxic pulmonary, cellular respiration, and anticoagulating agents/materials ; and, variou s ot her toxic material s that inhibit respiration and clotting processes . The portfolio als o i ncludes funding to support sustainment of SNS's current level of preparedness throu gh r eplacement of expiring anticonvulsants, nerve agent antidotes, and other supportiv e m edical mater iel. C OVID -19: $3.3 billion over five year s at mi nimum . Funding will allow HHS to continu e k ey investments in vaccines, therapeutics, and devices (including diagnostic tests) and ens ure they continue to improve and are effective against new COVID -19 varian ts. S eparately, FDA estimates an additional $705.4 million would be needed to support it s C OVID -19 regulatory efforts (included in the \"other PHEMCE portfolios\" section below) . T his figure does not include funding that could support research, development, and pr ocurement of next generation mucosal vaccines . F iloviruses : $2.3 billion over five years. Funding will support continued advancement o f c ountermeasures in preparedness and response for the filoviridae family. The portfoli o s upports the late- stage development and procurement of MCMs against the Ebola virus . T he PHEMCE would continue to support activities associated with the transition of MC M c andidates from early development supported by the NIH and the DoD to advance d dev elopment at BARDA and toward F DA approval if safety and efficacy ar e d emonstrated. For vaccines, BARDA will support the advance development of two t o t hree leading candidates each for Marburg virus and Sudan ebolavirus with the goal of hav ing at least one of each in Phase 3trials in five years. For therapeutics, BARDA will s upport the advanced development of one to two monoclonal antibody therapeutics eac h f or Marburg virus and Sudan ebolavirus with the goal of having one candidate each i n P hase 3trials in five years . NIAID will continue to develop monoclonal antibodies agains t E bola Zaire, Sudan, and Marburg viruses that provide protection when administere d pr ophylactically. BARDA would also support advanced development of one to two broad- spectrum antivirals, targeting to have one candidate in Phase 2 . All of these efforts will w ork toward the goal of FDA approval/licensure/clearance/authorization. Additional , f unding would s upport BARDA's efforts to scale up manufacturing and procurement of E banga for Zaire ebolavirus and continue to support procurement of Inmazeb for Zair e eb olavirus. Funds would also support the transition of procurement of Ebola vaccin e ( Ervebo for prevention of Zaire ebolavirus) from to SNS procurement . M ultidisciplinary Efforts : $20.8 billion over five years. BARDA will use $16.7 billion t o dev elop the tools and platforms that cut across multiple pathogens in the CBRN space t o i mprove our preparedness and response posture. Similarly, NIH continues to support it s 13 cross- cutting science portfolio which includes research activities that cannot be assigned to a specific threat ($4.1 billion). Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza : $8.8 billion over five years. This funding, across NIH , BAR DA, SNS, and FDA, support s pandemic preparedness objectives as outlined in th e 20 17 Pandemic Influenza Plan Update, Executive Order 13886 Modernizing Influenz a V accines in the United States to Promote National Security and Public Health, an d C OVID -19 lessons learne d. R adiological/Nuclear : $6.9 billion over five years. This investment includes spending f or bas ic and advanced clinical research and development of products to address the shor t an d long- term multi -faceted injuries from radiation exposure, trauma, and thermal burn s ant icipated from a nuclear detonatio n. Sm allpox : $2.5 billion over five years. Funding will support sustained investment in a l yophilized (freeze dried) formulation of JYNNEOS, a non- replicating smallpox vacci ne t hat is licensed for the prevention of smallpox and mpox disease. This portfolio als o i ncludes procurement of vaccine doses and oral and IV TPOXX to replenish product s us ed to respond to the mpox outbreak . De tailed PHEMCE Portfolio Activities Anthrax The anthrax portfolio has a total estimated spending of almost $1.7 billion over the five- year period. The portfolio includes significant cross- agency support for a next -generation anthrax vaccine, AV7909. Funding will support a NIH Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of this lyophilized (thermostable) anthrax vaccine, AV7909. Enrollment is complete, immunizations are underway, and the trial will be completed within five years. Similarly, BARDA is supporting the development, preparation of an application for approval, and procurement of AV7909. Submission of a Biologics Licensure Application (BLA) for AV7909 for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is expected in 2023. In addition, NIH is supporting the development of a small molecule inhibitor of Anthrax Lethal Factor and an IND submission to FDA enabling GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology studies. Chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC) submission to the FDA for drug substance and drug product is nearing completion in FY 2023. The goal is to advance to Phase 1 clinical trial as soon as FY 2024. The anthrax therapeutics portfolio is a matur e portfolio of three FDA -licensed monoclonal antibody therapeutics. BARDA maintains a small program to test the long- term stability and efficacy of these stockpiled products. This portfolio also supports the replenishment of significant quantities of expiring antibiotics used for post - exposure prophylaxis after an anthrax incident. Estimated spending for antibiotics to prevent and treat plague and tularemia to meet PHEMCE requirements are largely supported by the anthrax portfolio as the antibi otic requirement for the former is much lower (fewer doses) than the latter. 14 Botulinum The botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) portfolio, $388 million over five years, will support development of a next -generation intervention to treat exposure to BoNT. The cur rent approved product is produced from sera of an equine herd using an unsustainable process. BARDA is supporting development of a mAb based product that is anticipated to have better safety and potency profiles than the current product. Funding will advance the proof -of-concept development and testing of this product. NIH is supporting the development of a monoclonal antibody cocktail against the botulinum toxin (BoNT) serotype F. A master cell bank, critical to the production of antibodies, is being generated with the potential to deliver product in FY 2023, followed by continued process development towards compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP ) manufacturing regulations for a Phase 1 clinical trial. Broad -Spectrum Antimicrobial Consis tent with the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (2020- 2025)6, one of the largest spending estimates is for new products to address gaps in the broad-spectrum antimicrobial portfolio. The estimated spending total is $5.1 billion over five years. NIH continues to build a pipeline for candidates in early development. NIH will continue to evaluate and advance a small molecule antibiotic product , epetraborole (EBO), for treatment of acute melioidosis as the first indication sought, and then potentially later indications of other biothreat agents (i.e., Plague, Anthrax, and Tularemia). There are plans for a potential prospective observational study in FY 2023- 2024, with plans to file an IND in FY 2025 for a possible Phase 1 study to commence in FY 2026. NIH is supporting the development of multiple gram -negative antibacterial small molecule therapeutics with potential to advance to clinical trials. NIH is supporting the development of a small molecule antibacterial produce effective against the gram -positive bacterium Clostridium difficile that may complete a Phase 2 clinical trial as early as CY 2023. NIH and Merck have collaborated to discover a novel tuberculosis specific oxazolidinone related to linezolid, a therapeutic candidate that is currently finishing IND -enabling toxicology studies and is scheduled to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial early in CY 202 3. Building on this, BARDA funding will support development and procurement of products to treat infections caused by antimicrobial resistant bacterial and fungal threats that complicate the ability to respond to and recover from any public health emergency. Funding will ensure these life-saving drugs are available to treat infections in both adults and children. Our goal is to develop through FDA approval five to six new innovative antibiotic candidates to treat urgent and severe threats, as defined by th e CDC and one or two novel antifungal candidates to treat drug- resistant fungal infections. Further, we will pursue pediatric indications for up to four of these drugs. Significant investment is also planned for development of diagnostics that quickly identify which antibiotics are effective to treat a patient and inform antibiotic stewardship. 6 The National Strategy can be found here, accessed 10/13/2022, https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/carb - national -action-plan- 2020- 2025.pdf 15 Chemical Spending on MCMs to mitigate harm from chemical threats is forecasted to have a five- year total of $1.5 billion. The chemical threats portfolio includ es early -stage MCM research directed by the NIAID across six NIH institutes and advanced research and development by BARDA . The NIH and BARDA chemical threat portfolios are both focused on the development of improved therapeutics to treat the injuries cause d by exposure to pharmaceutical -based agents (such as fentanyl) , chemical warfare nerve agents and vesicating chemicals, as well as toxic industrial pulmonary, cellular respiration, and anticoagulating agents/materials . The NIH chemical threats MCM discovery research and early development portfolio includes approximately 80 therapeutic candidates. In addition to chemical threat MCM advanced research and development , BARDA funding will also support needleless devices for improved delivery of MCMs. BARDA will invest in repurposing of host -targeted and threat -agnostic treatments for lung, skin, eye, and systemic injuries, particularly those that can be used by first responders. In addition, we will continue to develop enabling technologies, such as organs -on-chips, and animal models to identify the injuries caused by exposure to chemicals and to evaluate MCMs to treat those injuries. Finally, funding will support the advanced development through approval or clearance and procurement of next gen eration autoinjectors that contain rapid treatments to reverse the effects of nerve agents and other organophosphates. Filoviruses In the filovirus portfolio, which combats Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) caused by filoviruses such as Ebola virus species (Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus ) and Marburg virus, the PHEMCE estimates five -year spending to be $2.3 billion. This portfolio supports the late- stage development and procurement of MCMs against the Ebola virus. At this funding level, current investments would continue to support activities associated with the transition of MCM candidates from early development supported by the N IH and the DoD to advanced development at BARDA and toward FDA approval /licensure/clearance/authorization if safety and efficacy are demonstrated. NIH is supporting development of two to three therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for treatment of Marburg vir us with the goal of advancing the most promising candidates to Phase 1 trials as early as CY 2024. NIH is supporting preclinical development of a pan- ebolavirus monoclonal cocktail that neutralizes Ebola Zaire, Sudan, and Bundibugyo viruses. NIH anticipate s the manufacturing of clinical trial material and initiation in CY 2023 or 2024 of Phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate two different vaccine platforms for Sudan ebolavirus and one vaccine platform for Marburg virus. NIH is developing an improved pre/post -exposure VSV -EBOV vaccine and will characterize the vaccine in preclinical models, including nonhuman primates. This candidate will be available for clinical development through industry partnerships. NIH is exploring the potential for low -dose protection efficacy of the VSV -Marburg virus (MARV) and VSV -Ebola virus (Ervebo by Merck) vaccine in the preclinical nonhuman primate model. NIAID is supporting the development and manufacturing of adenovirus -vectored against Sudan (ChAd3- SUDV) and Marburg ( ChAd3 -MARV) viruses in preclinical models and Phase 1 human trials. Finally, NIH is characterizing the protective efficacy of the VSV -Sudan virus vaccine in 16 preclinical m odels, with the t arget o f GMP pr oducti on and implementing clinical t rials as e arly a s CY 20 23. BARDA w ill suppor t activities t o achieve an intermediate leve l of preparedness for Marburg virus and Sud an ebolavirus , meaning at l east two vaccine candidates for each threat w ith clinica l data and a su pply of dose s that c an be used i n clinical t rials. With current f unding, B ARDA will complet e Phase 2 clinica l development f or two candidat es each to prevent i nfections c aused by Marbu rg viru s and Sud an ebolavir us by 2 024, w ith at l east o ne pr ogram t ransitioni ng to advanced development an d procureme nt un der PBS i n 2025. F or therapeutics, BARDA w ill continue to suppor t the late -stage development, m anufacturing of clinic al doses, and efforts toward l icensure of m Ab pr oducts f or Sudan ebola virus a nd Marburg virus. In addition, B ARDA will bring a n addition al mAb produc t for Sudan ebolavir us and Marburg vir us an d a broad acting antiviral w ith the p otential t o compleme nt the mAb pr oducts and reduce l ong term p ersistence leadi ng to vi ral re-emergence into the p ortfolio. F inally, funds w ithin thi s portfolio would support the transition of pr ocurement o f Ebola vaccine fro m BARD A procureme nt to S NS pr ocurement. Pandemic an d Season al Influenza Across NIH, B ARDA , SNS, a nd FDA , estimated spendin pandemi c and seasonal i nfluenza is $8.8 billion over the five-y ear period. This amount supports pandemic preparednes s objectives as outlined in the 2017 Pandemic Influenza Plan Update, Executive Order 13886 Modernizing Influenza Vacc ines in the United States t o Promote National Security and Public Health, and C OVID-19 lessons learned. This update includes HHS's es tablishment of one of its key actions to \"support innov ation in influenza vac cine production for improved efficiencies to enable the production and distribution of final pres entation v accines for pandemic res pons e within 12 weeks from the declaration of an influenza pandemic.\"7 Other objectiv es include the need for improv ements in diagnostic s and treatment options. NIH w ould continue to suppor t discover y of i nnovative n ew pandemic i nfluenza vaccine prototypes, while advancing t he clinica l development of cu rrent universal i nfluenza vaccine candidates . NIH i s supporting t he clinical e valuation of va ccines a nd adjuvants t o protect against seaso nal an d pandemic st rains of i nfluenz a. Candidates i nclude br oadly pr otective or universal i nfluenza vaccines, a nd ca ndidat es against pandemic i nfluenza strains su ch as H 7N9. NIH i s supporting preclinica l and translatio nal development o f a di verse portfoli o of i mproved seasonal , pandemic, a nd br oadly pr otective univers al influenza vaccines. Five novel s easonal and universal i nfluenza vaccines i ncludin g mRNA, nactivated, a nd live attenuated vaccin es hav e entered GM P manufacturing w ith Phase 1 trials a nticipated t o be initiated in FY 2 023-2024. An Outer M embran e Vesicle (OMV) -based universal i nfluenza vaccin e is targete d to advance to a Phase 1 tri al in CY 20 24. An adenoviral -based pa ndemic and universal i nfluenza vaccine is t argeted t o advance to a P hase 1 tri al by C Y 2027. N IH continues t o support cl inical trials of broadly -protective \"universal\" i nfluenz a A vi rus vaccine candidates. T he initial P hase I study of o ne vaccine candidate i s underway, and Phas e 1 studies of an other vaccin e candidate are planned t o begin as ear ly as CY 2 024. P hase 2 7 The Pandemic Influenza Plan: 2017, can be found here, accessed 3/21/2023, https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic - resources/pdf/pan- flu-report -2017v2.pdf 17 efficacy studies in the human volunteer influenza challenge model could begin as early as CY 2023. NIH is currently pursuing advanced nanoparticle- based vaccine candidates for both pandemic and seasonal strains of influenza. As nanoparticle- based influenza vaccine candidates have shown promising results in proof -of-principle Phase 1 trials, it is possible that an additional candidate designed to provide broad protection against pandemic and seasonal influenza strains will advance to Phase 1 trials as early as CY2023 . The increased spending estimate supports BARDA efforts to include: the development of more effective and accessible influenza vaccines, including next -generation pandemic influenza vaccines that could potentially be delivered without needles and syringes. Modernized manufacturing capabilities to support transition to next generation platforms and further increase domestic vaccine manufacturing as well as fill/finish capabilities. Development of diagnostic tests for use across the spectrum of c are to include at home tests, point of care tests, and tests that can differentiate influenza- like illnesses. Development of therapeutics for pre -exposure prophylaxis, treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, or products with new mechanisms of act ion for acute, uncomplicated influenza infection s. Funding for SNS supports sustainment of SNS's current level of preparedness through replacement of expiring antivirals in addition to the procurement of Baloxavir, an antiviral being added to the SNS at t he recommendation of PHEMCE. Radiological and Nuclear Threats Spending by BARDA and NIAID on MCMs against radiological and nuclear threats, the next largest investment for this five- year period, totals $6.9 billion. This investment includes spending for basic and advanced clinical research and development of products to address the short and long- term multi -faceted injuries from radiation exposure, trauma, and thermal burns that would occur after a nuclear detonation. NIAID will continue funding early and advanced research activities for products to address radiation- induced damage to the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and lung, and plans to have at least one product type of each organ system injury under FDA regulatory consideration. NIAID has initiated a clinical trial to study safety of a novel oral product that can remove a broad range of radioactive particles from the body and expects to transition this drug to BARDA for licensure and procurement activities. NIAID funds development of diagnostic platforms to enable rapid triage of large numbers of radiation- exposed people, to guide medical management and scarce resource allocation, and plans to approach the FDA to seek clearance for several biomarker panels/devices. BARDA will procure treatme nts for the loss of platelets and white blood cells, biodosimetry devices, and artificial skin to treat thermal burns, which will augment our preparedness for radiological/nuclear incidents. BARDA will continue the development of next generation blood products, with approval anticipated in FY 2025. Blood products will help address the anticipated deficit of blood products from a nuclear detonation and may help address blood supply sustainability issues. BARDA will also lead the advanced development of ther apies to address traumatic injury, a diagnostic test for traumatic brain injury, imaging systems to detect fractures and tissue damage, and treatments for burn wounds and penetrating injuries. If these products receive FDA approval or clearance , they will be deployed to healthcare facilities and first 18 responders to be integrated into routine care. Platform technologies, like organ- on-a-chip, are in development to accelerate evaluation and regulatory approval of MCMs to treat the injuries caused by nuclear detonation and diminish our dependency on animal models. For SNS, funding included within the radiological and nuclear threat portfolio supports sustainment of SNS's current level of preparedness, replenishing expiring anti microbials to treat infections related to ARS , decorporation agents, and supporting medical materiel. Between FY 2022 and 2026, SNS expects to continue procuring several products previously supported by BARDA including an antineutropenic drug and a burn/blast bandage. Smallpox Investment in MCMs to mitigate smallpox is forecasted to have a five -year total of $2.5 billion. IH is supporting the Study of Tecovirimat for Human Mpox Virus (STOMP ) study, a clinical trial evaluating the antiviral tecovirimat (TPOXX) for the treatment of human mpox disease, and the DOSES study, a clinical trial evaluating alternative strategies for administering the JYNNEOS smallpox/ mpox vaccine to increase the number of available doses. NIH is working with United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infect ious Diseases ( USAMRIID) and the CDC to screen, evaluate and develop new therapeutics against Orthopoxviruses with different mechanisms of action than the FDA approved drugs, TPOXX and TEMBEXA. NIH is currently working with Battelle to produce a Mpox Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) for use in clinical trial testing, with plans to develop an assay for use in clinical trials as early as FY 2023. NIH is evaluating monoclonal antibodies with broad protection against several human poxviruses, includi ng mpox , to identify optimal antibody cocktails as possible next generation therapeutic and prophylactic treatments. NIAID is additionally supporting the development of mRNA -based vaccines that are broadly protective against or thopoxviruses. Funding will support sustained investment in a lyophilized (freeze dried) formulation of JYNNEOS, a non -replicating vaccine that is licensed for the prevention of smallpox and mpox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or mpox infection, which is a mandate under the PHS Act. BLA submission for the lyophilized formulation in expected in late 2024 or early 2025. BARDA will also utilize this funding to support the manufacturing of additional doses to bolster domestic supply of JYNNEOS. The increase in estimated spending also includes procurement of vaccine doses and oral and IV TPOXX to replenish products used to respond to the 2022 mpox outbreak. BARDA will also support the development of a next generation monoclonal antibody -based therapeutic to treat smallpox. This mAb product will advance to GMP manufacture and adequate and well -controlled animal studies to support licensure. BARDA/Multidisciplinary Advanced Development Efforts (new) ASPR will apply lessons learned from the COVID -19 response in developing the tools and platforms that cut across multiple pathogens in the CBRN space to improve our preparedness 19 and response posture, as outlined in the American Pandemic Preparedness Plan8, the FY 2023 President 's Budget request for mandatory Pandemic Preparedness funding9, and several publications including 'Advancing development of medical countermeasures: Incorporating COVID -19 lessons learned into future pandemic preparedness planning' by Johnson, White and Disbrow10 . These efforts include further development of vaccine platform technologies that developers can rapidly adapt to address new threats, and broad- spectrum therapeutics. Funding will also support innovative scientific approaches to MCM development an d manufacturing to decrease time to production so that we can respond quickly to an outbreak. This work will be critical to our response to current and future public health needs. In total, five- year spending for this effort is forecasted to be $16.7 billi on. NIH Multi-Disciplinary Advanced Development Efforts The Multi -Disciplinary Advanced Development Efforts in the cross -cutting science portfolio includes the NIAID research activities that cannot be assigned to a specific threat. These investments support capabilities such as animal models, diagnostics, sequencing facilities, reagent manufacturing, clinical training programs, epitope mapping, biosafety lab support, computational biology, and development of vaccine platform technologies. The five -year budget plan estimate for this portfolio is $4.1 billion. NIH/Other Threats The NIH/Other Threats portfolio is the next largest area of estimated spending and includes investments at NIAID that support activities against threats such as arboviruses, waterborne and foodborne pathogens, tuberculosis, adjuvant discovery/development, and activities investigating fundamental aspects of the human immune system. Total five- year spending on these investments is estimated to be $4.0 billion. Other PHEM CE Portfolios The remaining funds, $ 6 billion for the five -year period are allocated to: SNS Non- Procurement Costs and federal medical stations, FDA Regulatory activities , NIH's Multiplex Diagnostics, BARDA's Management and Administration, and tularemia, MCMs for glanders and melioidosis, ancillary products, and biodiagnostics. 8 American Pandemic Preparedness: Transforming Our Capabilities (September 2021) , can be found here, accessed Fact Sheet: The Biden Administration's Historic Investment in Pandemic Preparedness and Biodefense in the FY 2023 President's Budget , budget/#:~:text=The%20FY23%20President%27s%20Budget%20includes,Prevention%20(CDC)%2C%20the%20Nat 10 Advancing development of medical countermeasures: Incorporating COVID -19 lessons learned into future pandemic preparedness planning, can be found here, accessed 3/21/2023 , https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/36302122/ 20 COVID -19 (new)11 Throughout the COVID -19 response, HHS made key investments that have contributed to the availability of life saving vaccines, therapeutics, and devices (including diagnostic tests). An estimated minimum of $3.3 billion over five years is needed to support of these effort s, which build on activities initiated or accelerated with supplemental resources provided in FY 2021 and FY 2022 . ASPR estimates an additional $2.3 billion is necessary to continue advanced development of some vaccines with broader protection and durability than current products, and antivirals that could be used if a variant were to emerge that demonstrates resistance to our currently available antivirals. Additional funding would be required for multiple candidates of intranasal vaccines and development of monoclonal antibodies with broader protection against multiple variants. This funding is critical to our continued response to the COVID -19 pandemic. Additionally, $546 million is required to sustain manufacturing capabilities, non- clinical and assay testing, and storge of MCMs and $525 million to continue NIH clinical trial support. Separ ately, $705.4 million of FDA's regulatory support activities would directly support COVID - 19 efforts (funding included in \"other PHEMCE portfolios\" above). For COVID -19 sustainment, FDA assumed 15 percent of the total COVID -19 sustainment received for FY 2 024 and 30 percent of the total COVID -19 sustainment received for FY 2025 and FY 2026 . Mandatory Pandemic Preparedness (new) Finally, to generate greater preparedness to future public health needs and in line with the goals set forth in the American Pandemic Preparedness Plan, the FY 2023 President's Budget proposed $81.7 billion in in mandatory funds for HHS to enhance efforts to develop MCMs to respond to pathogens with pandemic potential. T he report does not present this mandatory funding within the funding totals or exhibits, given its broad, cross -cutting nature. 11 The COVID -19 Portfolio estimate does not include SNS or next generation mucosal vaccine funding. The future COVID -19 SNS requirements are still under review. 21 Figures 2 and 3: Estimated PHEMCE Spending by Portfolio and Fiscal Year (dollars in millions) 12 12 Figures 2 and 3 depict estimated spending by portfolio for FY 2022- 2026 in the MCM development life cycle of early and advanced R&D, development, acquisition, stockpiling, and regulatory approval. The data in Figure 1 show the suite of investments directed towards CBRN and EID MCMs. Allocation of these existing resources is made based on a variety of criteria including available market prices, maintain a balanced portfolio, precedence from previous commitments, and acquisition of new products to the Stockpile. 22 Table 4: Estimated PHEMCE Spending by Portfolio and Fiscal Year (dollars in millions) ten (10) potential MCM product transitions from Project BioShield to SNS. Transitioning these products will increase the need for funding in the SNS budget to support replenishment of expiring MCMs. Replenishment costs arise from products purchased previously by BARDA or SNS that expire and need to be restocked. A total of $2.175 billion is estimated to support replenishment of MCMs by SNS. As noted above, the SNS does utilize, when and where possible, the Shelf -Life Extension program. The funding projection below takes such considerations, when available, into account.
