IN TH E NEWS Influential legacy ... Clark Kerr , a towering figure in higher education, died Dec. 1 at the age of 92. As president of theUniversity of California from 1958-1967, Kerr was chief architect of the master plan that guided California publichigher education for four decades and is still a nationalmodel. He also served as UC Berkeley's first chancellor from 1952-1958. Kerr's clear, logical vision of both the promiseand problems of modern higher education influencedgenerations of political and education leaders. Energy efficiency ... The California Public Utilities Commission has awarded UC and California State University $12 million to implement energy-efficiency programs on their campuses. Each system will receive $6 million. The award will help improve energy-efficiency,reduce costs and move UC and CSU towards greater environmental sustainability. UC and CSU will work with the Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison andSouthern California Gas companies. These innovativepartnerships between UC, CSU and the utilities are amongthe first of their kind in the nation. Visionary Project ... The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation awarded $17.5 million to the Univer sity of California for collaboration with the California Institute of Technology on a project intended to build the world's most powerful telescope. Coupled with an award by thefoundation to Caltech for the same amount, $35 million isnow available for the two institutions to collaborate on thisvisionary project to build the Thirty Meter T elescope. Prolific researcher ... A national five-year study has ranked Richard Mayer , a professor of psychology and education at UC Santa Barbara , the nation's most prolific researcher in the field of educational psychology. The same study rankedUCSB the third most-prolific university in that field.Published in the journal Contemporary Educational Psycho logy, the study was conducted by researchers at Northern Illinois and Southwest Missouri State universities and covered 1997-2001.HEALTH AND NUTRITION Arm position matters ... Blood pressure readings taken on arms parallel, or extended in the same direction as the body,are up to 10 percent higher than readings taken when theelbow is at a right angle to the body with elbow flexed atheart level, according to a study by UC San Diego School of Medicine investigators and colleagues. Because blood pressure values determine treatment options, a designated and consistent arm position should be adhered to whenmeasuring blood pressure, they noted. The researchersadded that a previously published study found that 73percent of health care workers failed to use proper arm positions (with slightly flexed elbow and held at heart level)and blood pressure cuff positions. Gene discovery ... UC San Francisco scientists have identified a single brain protein that can account for most ofthe intoxicating effects of alcohol. The finding pinpointsperhaps the best target yet for a drug to block alcohol's effect and potentially treat alcoholism, the researchers say. Thediscovery was made in a six-year research effort focusing onCaenorhabditis elegans , the roundworm widely studied because about half of its approximately 20,000 genes have counterparts in the human genome. This is the first finding that a single gene and the brain protein it codes for - knownas an ion channel - are responsible for the intoxicatingeffects of alcohol in a living organism, say the scientists. Shyness can be deadly ... How you react to stress influences how easily you resist or succumb to disease, includingviruses like HIV , discovered UCLA AIDS Institute scientists. The new findings identify the immune mechanism thatmakes shy people more susceptible to infection thanoutgoing people. The UCLA team studied the effect of stresson viral replication in a group of 54 HIV-infected men.During the evaluation period, some of the research subjectsbegan antiretroviral drug therapy. The researchers studied these men's responses to the drugs by tracking their viralloads and T-cell counts. A boost in T-cells shows recoveryfrom HIV on antiretroviral drugs. Researchers found astrong linear relationship between personality and HIVreplication rate in the body \u2014 shy people with high stress responses possessed higher viral loads.Online danger ... A Chinese herbal product known to cause kidney failure and cancer in people and banned forimportation two years ago by the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration is readily available through the Internet, pointing out the need for FDA policies regulating the sale ofdangerous herbals through the Web, according to UC Berkeley researcher Lois Swirsky Gold . She said herbal products containing aristolochic acid can be easilypurchased through the Internet. There's an urgent need toremove these products from the Web and to develop a policy that addresses Web sales of hazardous herbal products, Gold said. DEVELOPMENT AND DISCOVERIES Improving chances for recovery ... People who suffer spinal cord injuries may have a greater chance of recovery if treated with drugs that block the body's own immune response to the initial trauma, researchers from the Reev e-Irvine Research Center at UC Irvine have found. In addition, UCI neurologist Hans Keirstead and immunologist Thomas Lane have laid the foundation for these drugs by creatingantibodies that, when tested on rats, stopped the secondarynerve and spinal cord damage caused by the immune systemresponse. Use of these antibodies resulted in significantly improved rates of recovery. Important trigger ... A single gene appears to kick off a critical step in the development of the early embryo - theformation of the brain and spinal cord - and thus may offera way to screen for fetal spinal cord defects such as spinabifida, say UC Berkeley researchers and colleagues. Neural tube defects, including spina bifida - an open spinal cord -and anencephaly, or lack of a complete brain, are among themost common serious birth defects in the U.S. While theincidence has gone down in this country thanks toeducational efforts encouraging pregnant women to takefolic acid supplements, some 30 percent of neural tubedefects appear to have a genetic cause unrelated to folic aciddeficiency. The scientists established that activation of a lonegene triggers specific cells in the embryo to bend, initiating acurling of tissue into a closed neural tube that eventuallybecomes the spinal cord and brain. Curve ball power ... Popular wisdom says you can hit a fastball further than a curve ball, but it turns out theopposite is true, according to UC Davis researchers and colleagues. That's due to the spin of the ball. Curve balls are thrown with topspin so the top of the ball rotates in thedirection of flight. When hit by the bat and thrown intoreverse, curve balls automatically have backspin which gives them lift and carries them further. Fastballs are thrown outwith backspin, so they spin the other way when hit, have less lift and sink faster.Plant reproduction ... Researchers at the UC Riverside have identified a protein that helps guide sperm to egg inflowering lily plants, a significant step forward in the field ofplant reproduction. Botanists have long known that, inflowering plants, the female organs play a role in guidingsperm-laden pollen tubes to the eggs found in ovules. Butuntil now, they did not know exactly how. A research teamled by Elizabeth Lord , professor of plant biology, found that chemocyanin, a protein with a previously unknownfunction, effectively guided sperm-laden lily pollen tubes tothe plant's ovules, which hold the eggs from which comeseeds in the lily. Understanding how plants reproduce is vitalfor the future manipulation of crop and nursery plants. THE CUTTING EDGE Endowed faculty ... UC Irvine has received a $20 million gift to help attract and support the work of leading researchers in the university's nationally ranked School of Information and Computer Science. The gift from a donor who asked to remain anonymous matches the largest singlecontribution ever to UCI and will create 10 endowed faculty positions - an unprecedented number in a single gift to thecampus. The school is the first independent computerscience school within the UC system and one of the fastest-growing programs of its kind in the nation. Milk genome ... UC Davis food science professor Bruce German is organizing an international research consortium to study the \"milk genome,\" the genes that encode instructions for making milk. Once scientists learn how milkworks, he thinks they'll be able to transfer its benefits to other foods, making them healthier. The new researchconsortium will be supported by funding from Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland. Its work will compare genes telling how to make milk in many species, with an emphasis on human genes. Novel dete ction ... A new technique that might lead to the quick, accurate and safe detection of nuclear materials beingsmuggled inside sea-going cargo containers has beendemonstrated by a team of researchers from Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories and UC Berkeley . Using Lawrence Berkeley's 88-inch cyclotron, the researchers showed that irradiating a cargo container'scontents with a beam of neutrons and then measuring the emission of high-energy gamma rays provides a unique identifying signature of plutonium or highly enricheduranium that can be used in weapons of mass destruction.Nearly seven million cargo containers offload at U.S. ports every year, but according to the U.S. Customs and BorderProtection agency, less than two percent of these containers are ever opened and inspected at U.S. seaports.PLANET AND ENVIRONMENT Coastal waters ... Global warming could have profound effects on the wind-driven upwelling of deep ocean wateralong the California coast, according UC Santa Cruz researchers. Their studies showed changes in both the intensity and the seasonal timing of the upwelling, whichbrings cold, nutrient-rich water into coastal ecosystems. Thisseasonal upwelling supports California's diverse marine lifeand productive fisheries, but how changes in the upwellingwill affect these and other aspects of coastal ecosystems remains uncertain. Methane release ... Scientists at the UC Riverside and colleagues have found evidence of the release of an enormous quantity of methane gas as ice sheets melted at the end of a global ice age about 600 million years ago,possibly altering the ocean's chemistry, influencing oxygenlevels in the ocean and atmosphere, and enhancing climatewarming because methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. Theglobal ice age is of particular interest to paleobiologists because it took place shortly before the first appearance of animals in the fossil record, and may have supplied anenvironmental drive for evolution. Fuel refinement ... Snapshots of a catalytic process in action taken by researchers at UC San Diego provide important information for the first time about the chemical action ofcatalysis, and could have implications for improving theenergy efficiency and environmental safety of the reactions involved in the refinement of the hydrocarbons inpetroleum. These new findings provide a snapshot of how modern catalysts work and open possibilities to create a newgeneration of efficient tools to form and modify carbon-carbon bonds from limited natural resources, such asnatural gas and raw oil. This is important not only intransportation and electricity generation, but also in the development of products derived from natural resources. INSIGHTS ON SOCIETY Gambling and smoking ... A new economic analysis finds that smoke-free laws do not reduce profits from charitablebingo parlors, contrary to claims made by groups opposingsmoking restrictions. The analysis by researchers at UC San Francisco follows other studies that have found no loss of business - and sometimes increased business - at restaurantsand bars when smoke-free ordinances are enacted. The newanalysis is the first objective assessment of the effect ofsmoke-free policies on gaming profits. Researchers collectedinformation on profits from state-licensed bingo and othercharitable gaming from 220 towns and cities in Massachusetts that permitted such games from 1985-2001. The analysis by UCSF researchers showed that while bingoprofits were falling over the entire period studied, this trend was well established before passage of smoke-free laws in theearly 1990s and was unaffected by these laws. The result heldregardless of the size of the community.Unprecedented progess ... Recent progress in technology development to counter biological and chemical terrorism has been unprecedented, according to a team of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory researchers. They note that while important challenges remain, new detection systemsshow increased sensitivity, greater automation and fewerfalse alarms. T echnologies for countering bioterrorist agentsare improving, the researchers say, and are approaching thesophistication of technologies for fighting chemical warfareagents. Marked advances have been made during the pasttwo decades in biological detection, where there has been acombined 1,000-fold improvement in sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity refers to needing smaller amounts ofmaterial for detection; specificity involves making theidentification without false alarms. Bullying pervasive ... More than one in five 12-year-olds are repeatedly either bullies, victims or both, and bullies are often popular and viewed by classmates as the \"coolest\" intheir classes, according to new UCLA research from the most comprehensive study on young adolescent bullying in an ethnically diverse, large urban setting. Psychology professorJaana Juvonen , lead author of the study, said the research dispels the myth that bullies suffer from low self-esteem,which guides many programs conducted in schools.Educators and parents should be concerned with thepopularity of bullies and how to change the peer culture thatencourages bullying. LOOK ING TO TH E FUTURE Superconductor advance ... A new way to manufacture a low-cost superconducting material should lead to cheapermagnetic resonance imaging machines and other energy-efficient applications, say Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists. Hot isostatic pressing of wires made ofmagnesium diboride, or MgB2, significantly increased theamount of electrical current the wires can carry withoutelectrical resistance. Wires made from MgB2 would reducethe costs of such products as MRIs and electrical generators,say the researchers. They note that the material will likelyserve as a bridge to the energy future in a variety of cost-driven applications, because potentially this is the lowest-cost superconducting material. Studying smog ... A UC Irvine epidemiologist will lead the nation's first public health study to understand how ultrafineparticles in urban air pollution contribute to coronary heartdisease in the elderly. Supported by a $3 million NationalInstitutes of Health grant, Ralph Delfino of UCI's College of Medicine and colleagues will monitor elderly individuals to see how daily pollution levels impact their ailments. Theseseniors will have existing heart disease and live in SouthernCalifornia retirement homes impacted by high regional or local air pollution.President, University of California To learn more about UC research discoveries, and other news from UC campuses and national laboratories, please visit: UC Berkeley www.berkeley.edu/news/ UC Davis www.news.ucdavis.edu/ UC Irvine today.uci.edu/releases/index.html UCLA www.newsroom.ucla.edu/ UC Merced www.ucm.edu UC Riverside www.newsroom.ucr.edu UC Santa Barbara www.ucsb.edu UC San Diego ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/ UC San Francisco http://pub.ucsf.edu/today/cache/index.html UC Santa Cruz www.ucsc.edu/news_events/ Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/News-Releases.html Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/news.html Los Alamos National Laboratory www.lanl.gov/worldview/news/releases/index.shtml UC system www.universityofcalifornia.eduCompiled by Strategic Communications/University Affairs.

UC Santa Barbara has received a donation of four patents from the Boeing Co. that arerelated to improving the performance of electronic circuits. Boeing's research into stacked multi-chip modules alongwith their advanced cooling technology will be transferred to the University of California for further development and commercialization. Boeing gave the intellectual property to UCSB largely because of its faculty expertise in novel chipdesign and its skill in technology transfer. The patents aredirectly related to the research of Kaustav Banerjee , a UCSB assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering,who has worked extensively on three-dimensional integratedcircuits and thermal analysis of both 3-D integrated circuitsand high-performance microprocessors. Additionalapplications for the technology include mainframecomputers, computer workstations and servers, personal computers, and telecommunications. KUDOS Guatemalan twins ... UCLA health sciences media relations director Roxanne Yamaguchi Moster , senior public information officers Elaine Schmidt and Amy Waddell and the health sciences media relations staff received 2003 PrismAwards from the Public Relations Society of America for their work in covering the UCLA Medical Center's care for the Guatemalan conjoined twins. Presented by the society'sLos Angeles chapter, the awards honored outstandingachievements in health-care public relations, print-media placements and television coverage. Tech-savvy interns ... An innovative student-run internship program at UC Santa Cruz that trains undergraduates in the latest tools of information technology, which they in turnuse to advance the causes of global justice, peace and genderequity, has received nearly $300,000 from the ComptonFoundation Inc. Established in 1998, the Global Information Internship Program aims to build a network of tech-savvy undergraduates who share their skills with activists aroundthe world. The two-year grant will support student travel scholarships and stipends, bring speakers to campus, andhelp cover administrative costs. Workplace recognition ... Judith W. Boyette , UC associate vice president for human resources and benefits, has been recognized with a national award for the university's efforts to provide equal treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex employees. Out and Equal Workplace Advocates, a national organization devoted to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex workplaceissues, presented Boyette with an \"Outie\" award at theorganization's recent annual summit in Minneapolis. $1 billion mark ... For the fourth consecutive year, the University of California in 2002-03 raised more than $1 billion in private support from alumni and friends,corporations and foundations. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, gifts, grants and pledges totaled $1.037 billion, an11.5 percent decrease from the previous year when donorscontributed $1.171 billion. The 2002-03 results reflect the generous support for major fundraising campaigns at theLos Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego campuses and forthe efforts of a number of campuses that are preparing forcomprehensive campaigns. UC set a fundraising record - $1.222 billion - three years ago. "}
