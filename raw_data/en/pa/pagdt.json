Emergency Immune Boost Through Meditation Length: 4 minutes 3 Ways Meditation Boosts the Immune System According to a groundbreaking research study conducted at the University of Southern California in 2016, meditation and mindfulness exercises boosted the immune system in several different ways.[ [1](#references)] Meditation Boosts Helper T Cells The first finding was that meditation increased the number of T cells in the body. T cells are your body's main line of defense against harmful organisms. They attack intruders and break them down so the body can remove them. We always want to have a strong supply of T cells, and meditation and mindfulness play an important role in stimulating the production of both of them. [Stress and worrying](https://explore.globalhealing.com/essential-oils-for-anxiety/), the opposite of mindfulness, can actually [damage our immune system](https://explore.globalhealing.com/12-ways-support-immune-system-naturally/) and T cell production.

At the end of each of our chromosomes, there's a section called a telomere. Telomeres are like caps on the end of each chromosome. And as our cells age or become damaged, these telomeres shorten and become weaker. This is a sign of cellular aging.

Meditation Improves Antibody Response The third way meditation and mindfulness helped the immune system was antibody response.

Antibodies help your body [inactivate toxic substances](https://explore.globalhealing.com/20-reasons-toxic-metal-cleanse/), defend against viruses and bacteria, and help immune cells function better. This finding means that through regular meditation and mindfulness training, we can actually increase the amount of antibodies in our body before we actually come in contact with any harmful organisms. This results in [a more resilient immune system](https://explore.globalhealing.com/what-is-the-immune-system/).
