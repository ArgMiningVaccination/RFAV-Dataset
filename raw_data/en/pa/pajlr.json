While we offer a wide variety of chiropractic services ranging from medical care to nutritional counseling, our consultation services are also an essential service for chiropractic health. If you're wondering how our chiropractor can help boost your immune system, you're in luck. A healthy spine and core is a big part of overall health, including immune health. Research has shown that people who regularly undergo chiropractic care are more likely to have healthy immune systems. These results are not necessarily after years of care. Many of the patients studied had received chiropractic care for less than one year. A healthy spine leads to higher production of the body cells essential to a well-functioning immune system. Why does chiropractic treatment result in such huge differences in immune system health? A large portion of the work of a chiropractor is to improve the function of the nervous system, and the immune system is very closely linked with the nervous system. Factors including stress, muscle tension, and other standard chiropractic conditions can negatively affect the nervous system. This is often because most people tend to carry stress in their shoulders, neck, or back. Additionally, conditions a chiropractor commonly addresses, including a misaligned or damaged spine or other injuries, can rapidly lead to lowered immune health if not treated. If this sounds like you, we can help relieve your tension and improve your immune system.
