What is Traditional Chinese Medicine? Traditional Chinese medicine is not just one treatment, but rather an entire branch of medical treatment. Oriental medicine differs from traditional western medicine in a number of ways. Generally, TCM focuses on: - Yin & Yang: One of the major tenets of traditional Chinese medicine is the yin and the yang. You may have seen the familiar yin yang symbol, consisting of circle divided in half by black and white colors. According to TCM, the entire universe - and by extension our bodies and health - can be categorized as either yin or yang. The interaction between these two forces is crucial to oriental medicine. - The Five Elements (Wu Xing): Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe that all of nature can be broken down in to five distinct elements: wood, earth, metal, fire and water. TCM practitioners seek to manipulate these elements for the benefit of health. - Energy: Oriental medicine doctors and practitioners also seek to manipulate the body's energy, known as qi or chi. According to TCM practitioners, qi travels along pathways throughout the body known as meridians. - Balance: From an overarching perspective, traditional Chinese medicine seeks to provide balance across all energy levels and elements. By doing so, order and health can be restored to the body. Unlike traditional western medicine, TCM is less considered with the individual parts of the body and more concerned with their functions, such as breathing, eating, sleeping and many more.
