Find out whether you have IgG antibodies & how many. Next day result.", "sitename": "Harley Street Health Centre", "date": "2021-02-24", "cleaned_text": "This brand new quantitative IgG antibody test for COVID is exciting because it not only lets you know whether you have IgG antibodies but also, how many. This means that post-vaccination, antibody levels can be tracked, from after one month after your first dose. For example, COVID-19 IgG antibodies tracked in one of our 80-year-old patients who has had both of their vaccine doses and has never knowingly had COVID-19 previously showed the following: - Day 14 - 389 U/ml - Day 28 - >2500 U/ml - Day 42 - 1799 U/ml We are continuing to track these levels and will update accordingly. As you can see, tracking antibodies gives an interesting insight into the immunity response to the COVID vaccine but also, as antibodies decline over time, testing also helps give insight into levels of protection. Immunity is made up of more than just IgG antibodies however - we know that T-cell response is also important - but tracking IgG antibodies gives a good idea of the level of protection available. During these difficult times, it's difficult to know who to trust. Our clinic has been in operation for 23 years and is regulated by the Care Quality Commission. We have carefully vetted any laboratory we work with to ensure they are accredited appropriately and clinically sound.

Frequently Asked Questions When should I test after vaccination? What test do you use and what does the result mean? So will this test let me know if my vaccine has worked? Can you tell me what level of antibodies is considered a successful immunisation for each vaccine? Will you know whether the present antibodies are because of a previous infection or because of my vaccination? I've had my second dose over 28 days ago but I tested negative - how is this possible?
