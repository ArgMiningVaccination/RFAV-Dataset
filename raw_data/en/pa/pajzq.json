They're all different but your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will choose the one most likely to be safe and effective for your condition. There are several types of medication for heart conditions including: [ACE inhibitors](/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/drug-cabinet/ace-inhibitors)(angiotensin-converting enzyme - Diuretics [Nitrates](/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/drug-cabinet/nitrates) You may also be on more than one type of medication depending on your condition. Understanding your heart medication It's important to know what you're taking, why you are taking it, and how it will affect you. When you're given a new prescription, speak to your doctor about: - the medication prescribed for you and its potential benefits and risks - how to take it safely - when to take it - possible side effects and what to do if you notice any - taking other kinds of medicine at the same time, including any over-the-counter medicines or supplements. You can find more detailed information about your medication on the [emc website](http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/). Will my medicine cause side effects? All medicines may cause side effects, but these are usually temporary and disappear after a short time. Not everyone experiences side effects and you may have none at all. If you're experiencing side effects it's really important to keep taking your medication, but you should talk to your GP or consultant about it. They can adjust the dosage or prescribe a different medication to improve the side effects you're experiencing. Continue to take your prescribed medication even if you feel better, as your condition may get worse if you stop taking it. For severe side effects or allergic reactions, you should call 999 immediately. Tip: The [Yellow Card Scheme](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) collects information from health professionals and medicine users on suspected side effects. You can register with the scheme to report any side effects you experience. How are heart medicines taken? Heart medicines come in many shapes and sizes. The most common are: - Tablets or capsules - These need to be swallowed with or sometimes dissolved in water. Sometimes you have to keep the tablet under your tongue until it dissolves. - Aerosol spray - You spray the medicine under your tongue. - Self-adhesive patch - A patch containing your medicine is placed on your skin where the medicine is absorbed over a period of time. You may find that different manufacturers use different names and packaging for your medicines. Always check with your pharmacist if you have questions about this. When will I need to take my medication? Most medications need to be taken regularly. Some will need to be taken when you experience a symptom such as angina. You should always follow your doctor's instructions. If you've missed a dose, check the information leaflet that came with the medication for advice. Usually you should take it as soon as you remember. If it's nearly time for your next dose, you may need to skip the one you missed and take the next dose at its scheduled time. Never take a double dose. Are you finding it hard to get medical help? We know that many of you are experiencing delays to treatment at this time, or have questions and concerns about getting medical help. We've created this set of information to help you with these issues. How should I store my medication? - Store your medicine in a cool dry place, like your bedside cabinet. - Don't leave your medicine on a windowsill in the sunlight or keep it in your car. - Always keep your medicine out of the sight and reach of children and pets. - Where possible, you should keep your medicine in its original packaging to protect it and help you keep track of how much you have taken. Don't take medicines that have changed in colour, consistency or odour. If you have any old or left over medicines, return them to your pharmacist who will dispose of them safely. Tip: Never share your medicine with other people or take medicine that's not yours. Even if they have the same condition as you this could be dangerous. Salt and medicine Some medicines contain sodium, which is found in salt. Having a large amount of sodium in your diet can increase your blood pressure, putting added strain on your heart and can lead to cardiovascular disease. For those taking a regular dose of 75mg dispersible aspirin, the amount of sodium is extremely small so the benefits far outweigh any risk. If you're concerned about the levels of sodium in your medications, ask your local pharmacist for guidance. Can I get help with paying my prescription? Medical prescriptions are free in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. They are also free for people in England who meet certain criteria, including people who are: - under 16 or over 60 - receiving Income Support, JSA, ESA or Universal Credit - pregnant - 16-18 and in full-time education - and/or have certain health conditions, including a continuing disability or diabetes that can't be controlled with diet. If you aren't entitled to free prescriptions for your medicines you might be able to save money by buying a Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC). Over-the-counter medication, herbal medicines and supplements Check with your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medicine, herbal medicines and supplements.
