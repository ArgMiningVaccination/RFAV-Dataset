Beam, JD, Acting Secretary of Health SUBJECT: Update: COVID Vaccine Second Dose Administration and Timing DISTRIBUTION : Statewide LOCATION: n/a STREET n/a This transmission is a \"Health Update ,\" provides updated information regarding an incident or situation; unlikely to require immediate action. HOSPITALS: PLEASE SHARE WITH ALL MEDICAL, PEDIATRIC, NURSING AND LABORATORY STAFF IN YOUR HOSPITAL ; EMS COUNCILS: PLEASE DISTRIBUTE AS APPROPRIATE ; FQHCs: PLEASE DISTRIBUTE AS APPROPRIATE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS : PLEASE DISTRIBUTE AS APPROPRIATE ; PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS: PLEASE DISTRIBUTE TO YOUR MEMBERSHIP ; LONG -TERM CARE FACILITIES: PLEASE SHARE WIT H ALL MEDICAL, INFECTION CONTROL, AND NURSING STAFF IN YOUR FACILITY Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) provides this guidance based on available information about COVID -19 and is subject to chang e. On February 10, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated their Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines Currentl y Authorized in the United States . The DOH provides the following guidance on dosing intervals for receiving the second dose of mRNA COVID - 19 vaccines. Persons receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine should follow the recommended scheduling as closely as possible. DOH and CDC recommend receiving the same vaccine prod uct at both vaccinations. If it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval because of any reason, including vaccine availability, the second dose may be administered up to 6 weeks after the first dose. Every effort should be made to complete the vaccine series using the same vaccine product. If the first dose product cannot be determined or is unavailable , any available mRNA COVID -19 vaccine may be administered at a minimum interval of 28 days between doses . If two doses of different mRNA vaccine products are administered for any reason, no additional doses are recommended at this time. The discordant doses should be noted on the person's vaccination card. If you have questions about this guidance, please call your local health department or 1 - 877-PA-HEALTH (1 -877-724-3258). UPDATE: COVID Vaccine Second Dose Administration and Timing Page 2 of 2 - Update # 552 Time interval between Doses: Persons should not be scheduled to receive the second dose earlier than recommended (i.e., 3 weeks [Pfizer -BioNTech] or 1 month [Moderna]). However, second doses administered within a grace period of 4 days earlier than the recommended date for the second dose are still considered valid. Doses inadvertently administered earli er than the grace period should not be repeated. The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval and a delay in vaccination is unavoidable, the second dose of Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines may be administered up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There are currently limited data on efficacy of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines administered beyond this window. If the second dose is admi nistered beyond these intervals, there is no need to restart the series. Interchangeability with other COVID -19 Vaccine Products: Either of the currently authorized mRNA COVID -19 vaccines can be used when indicated; ACIP does not state a product preferen ce. The safety and efficacy of a mixed -product series have not been evaluated. Both doses of the series should be completed with the same product. It is strongly preferred that the vaccine series be completed with the same product. Every effort should be made to determine which vaccine product was received as the first dose , in order to ensure completion of the vaccine series with the same product. In exceptional situations in which the first -dose vaccine product cannot be determined , is no longer availabl e, or would not be available within the 42 day period after the first dose, any available mRNA COVID -19 vaccine may be administered at a minimum interval of 28 days between doses to complete the mRNA COVID -19 vaccination series. If two doses of different mRNA COVID -19 vaccine products are administered in these situations (or inadvertently), no additional doses of either product are recommended at this time. In this event, DOH recommends noting the discordant vaccine products on th e individual's vaccination card, but there is no need for any additional vaccine administration.
