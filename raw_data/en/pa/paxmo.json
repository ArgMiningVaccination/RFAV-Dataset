Worried about getting hit by a cold in this pandemic environment? It's time to make some [Jamu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamu) and boost up your immune system with this refreshing detox drink! Jamu is a traditional herbal medicine from Indonesia, used to treat many health problems. It can be found everywhere in Indonesia but it's most popular in Java. I first heard of Jamu in an episode of Chef's Table starring pastry chef [Will Goldfarb](http://www.willgoldfarb.com/), who after burning out in New York, moved to Bali. He restored his health there by drinking Jamu daily and later opened a dessert restaurant, Room4Dessert, which we were lucky enough to visit. The main ingredients in this drink are usually turmeric (a lot of it), ginger, coconut water, lemon juice, and natural sweetener of your choice (I prefer coconut nectar. It is similar to honey). Benefits of Turmeric [Turmeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric) is a powerful anti-inflammatory and natural detoxifier which shows potential in [treating arthritis, muscle soreness and anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/). In traditional herbal medicine, turmeric is also used to [treat digestive disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92752/). Health benefits come from the active ingredient: [Curcumin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin), known for its antioxidant effects. No wonder the famed beauty of Javanese princesses and royalty is said to be owed to this herbal drink. While traveling in Bali, we tried every Jamu we could find. We went from traditional medicine shops to hip cafes and to grocery stores...you name it. After returning to Canada, we had to brew our own. I'm going to share with you our recipe. Instructions: - Wash turmeric and ginger roots well because we're going to blend it raw. - Chop turmeric and ginger roots into small pieces. - Blend chopped turmeric and ginger with 1 cup of coconut water until well mixed. - Pour the blended ingredients into a saucepan and add the 3 remaining cups of coconut water. - Bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 minutes. - Add a squirt of lemon juice and 2 to 3 tbsp of coconut nectar. Then stir and let cool to room temperature. - Strain it twice so you don't get chunks of turmeric or ginger in your drink. - Refrigerate and enjoy within 3 days. Ingredients: - 125g fresh turmeric - 25g fresh ginger - 4 cups of coconut water - 2-3 tbsp coconut nectar - 1/3 lemon Summer's coming and we're still under quarantine in our homes. Why not treat yourself like it's Bali with a glass "}
