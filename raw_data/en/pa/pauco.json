In the United States, Ayurvedic Medicine considered a form of alternative medicine. Alternative medicine describes treatments that are used instead of traditional medical therapies. Ayurveda answers all lifestyle management questions in a natural way. What is Allopathy? Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, refers to science-based, modern medicine, such as the use of medications or surgery to treat or suppress symptoms or the ill effects of the disease. The main difference between Ayurveda and Allopathic medicine is important to understand. Western allopathic medicine focuses on symptomatology and disease, and primarily uses drugs and/or surgery to rid the body of pathogens or diseased tissue. Much advancement has been made with allopathic medicine and many lives have been saved in the course of human medical history. However, there are side-effects to allopathic medicine, mainly due to the toxicity of man-made drugs which can weaken the body. Ayurveda uses a different approach to heal the body because it does not focus on disease. Rather, it focuses on keeping the life energies in balance. Note that Ayurveda is not a substitute for Western allopathic medicine, however, it can be used in conjunction with Western medicine to make a person stronger and less likely to be afflicted with disease and/or to rebuild the body after being treated with drugs or surgery. What is Ayurveda? Ayurvedic Medicine, also known as Ayurveda for short, is one of the world's most ancient holistic healing practices. The practice originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. In Sanskrit, the language of ancient India, Ayurveda means \"Knowledge of Life.\" Ayurvedic knowledge was often passed down from generations in an oral tradition and some of the knowledge made it print texts several thousand years ago. Ayurvedic medicine is based on the belief that good health depends on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Panchakarma treatment, Ayurvedic therapy and Ayurvedic massage are some of the most revitalizing forms to indulge in. An important facet of Ayurveda is the belief that everyone is made up of the universes' five basic elements: space, air, fire, water, and earth. These elements combine in the human body to form three energies, otherwise known as doshas. These special energies control how the human body works. The three doshas are Vata Dosha, which represents space and air; which represents fire and water; and Kapha Dosha, which represents water and earth. In Ayurveda, it's believed all your ailments and health problems are connected to the balance of your doshas. That's why the practice of Ayurveda focuses on techniques in each of the doshas. Vata Dosha - Space and Air This dosha controls basic body functions, such as breathing, muscle movement, blood flow, heart function, and how healthy your intestines are. Vata determines how your body is functioning at a cellular level as well. If your vata is in balance, you could experience a variety of health problems such as anxiety, asthma, heart problems, and skin problems. Pitta Dosha - Fire and Water This energy controls your digestion, metabolism, body temperature and nutrition. If it's out of balance, it could lead to a series of health conditions. Kapha Dosha - Earth and Water This life force controls muscle and bone growth, body strength and your immune system. Kapa lubricates joints and moisturizes the skin and maintains immunity. Benefits of Ayurveda There is a multitude of benefits to Ayurveda. One of the best parts of Ayurvedic Medicine is that is completely customizable to individual needs. A treatment plan specifically designed for you will take into account your primary life force, and the balance between all three of these doshas:Vata, Pitta or Kapha. The individualized treatment plan will cleanse your body using a process\u2014called \"Panchakarma\"\u2014 which are various techniques designed to reduce your symptoms and restore harmony and balance. Other Benefits of Ayurveda 1.Weight Management A healthy diet and modification in lifestyle and eating habits through Ayurvedic treatments a specific dietary plan according to your dosha type. 2.

The emphasis in a balanced meal, (taking into account your dosha type), toning exercises, and Ayurvedic supplements promote healthy skin and scalp. 3. Stress Relief With a fast-paced lifestyle that leaves no scope for rejuvenation or relaxation, Ayurveda focuses on reducing stress and anxiety. Regular practice of yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, massages, and herbal treatments allow the body to calm down, detoxify, and rejuvenate. 4. Reduced Inflammation Lack of proper diet, unhealthy eating routines, insufficient sleep, irregular sleep patterns, and bad digestion can lead to inflammation. The root cause of neurological diseases, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, pulmonary diseases, arthritis, and many others starts with inflammation. As you begin to eat according to your dosha type, the digestive system begins to strengthen. Consumption of certain foods at the right times reduces toxins in the blood and digestive tract. A consequent result of this is increased vitality, high energy, and an overall decrease in lethargy and mood swings. 5. Body Purification Panchakarma treatment in Ayurveda is the practice of eliminating bodily toxins through enemas, oil massages, blood-letting, purgation, and other oral administration. 6.

Plaque is a result of the formation of cholesterol and fats in the inner lining of the arteries. This condition is called atherosclerosis and is the root cause of heart attacks and strokes. 7.
