Michigan State University is celebrating its [13th annual C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez & Dolores Huerta Commemorative Celebration](https://inclusion.msu.edu/awards/chavez-huerta-celebration/index.html) Friday, March 31, 2023, honoring the legacies of local and national community leaders and organizers with a special lunch on campus for MSU students, employees and community members. The public is welcome. This event recognizes the brave champions that secured change for farmworkers and Latinx communities. Their historic struggles led to lifesaving improvements in working conditions and progress for workers' rights and civil rights in America. Graphic design by Sofia Mireles-Gonzales. This year's theme is Recordando y Progresando Raices: Remembering and Progressing our Roots. The commemorative lunch will feature keynote speaker Teresa Romero, President of United Farm Workers. The first Latina and first immigrant woman to become president of a national union in the United States, Teresa Romero replaced Arturo S. Rodriguez as the third president of [United Farm Workers](https://ufw.org/) in December 2018. Formerly the union's No. 2 officer as secretary-treasurer, she has years of experience overseeing the complex financial management, administrative, staff recruitment, personnel, fundraising, IT and social media operations of a far-flung organization involved in field organizing, contract bargaining and administration, legislative and legal affairs, and far-reaching international initiatives. Romero is admired by her peers for her work ethic, calm competence, organizational skills, ability to build relationships, and the Si Se Puede! Spirit. History of the Event Each year, the Michigan State University, Greater Lansing, and East Lansing communities gather at MSU to honor the legacy of two of the most prominent U.S. labor leaders and civil rights activists, C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez and Dolores Huerta. This event grows from the strength of the Latinx and farmworker communities and the allies who stand in solidarity to raise awareness of the contributions, hardships, and ongoing or newly surfaced obstacles encountered by migrant and seasonal farmworkers.
