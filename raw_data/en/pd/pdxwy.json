Supports the Full Chakra & Aura - chakras are energy wheels located throughout the body that govern all aspects of life, and our aura is a subtle energy field that surrounds our physical body, heavily influenced by our emotions. Both work cohesively to create harmony in our lives, but can wreck havoc if not properly cleared and cared for regularly. "}
