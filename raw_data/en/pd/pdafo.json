According to Agarwal et al., 2010, 79% female reported by dysmenorrhea in which 37% were absents from school due to severe menstrual pain [14]. To evaluate the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in Mexican university students a survey was conducted. Data were collected through questionnaire from 1539 students.

They concluded that dysmenorrhea is alarmingly accelerating now a days, women should be aware of with this and consider medical therapy [18]. A study conducted on King abdulaziz university students revealed that prevalence of dysmenorrhea in KAU was 60.9%, which was not acceptable because of the health effects.

Results revealed that chamomile as Copyright@ Sidra khalid | Biomed J Sci & Tech BJSTR.

Another study explored for the treatment of the dysmenorrhea. And it was reported that medical plants (chamomile, fennel and ginger) had ability to reduce dysmenorrhea level [25]. Another study analyzed the herbal association of dysmenorrhea. Approximately 900 students with age of 12-18 years old were involved in the study, on the rural girls of Egypt. Almost 89.9% students were suffering from dysmenorrhea and 78% use herbal treatment. The herbal treatment that was suggested in which chamomile, cinnamon, fenugreek and green tea were reported.

Begum et al., 2016 stated that the use of allopathic medicines likes non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral contraceptives have their own side effects and are less effective. So, there must be use of herbal medicines such as chamomile in form of tea and oil to treat dysmenorrhea. With this other herb may also be used which could have their own properties [28]. Another study investigated the association between ginger- chamomile to reduce the dysmenorrhea. The medication that was given to the students had a great combination to check the most effective combination for reduction of dysmenorrhea.

From chamomile essential oil is extracted from whole plant which is used as aromatic or medicinal purpose.

It reduced depression and control hormones [32]. Primary Dysmenorrhea and Chamomile In primary dysmenorrhea there is not any type of abnormality and in secondary dysmenorrhea gynecological problems which causes pain and cramps. Primary dysmenorrhea must be linked with genetics, stress and type of body other than the levels of prostaglandins. Uterine muscles produce prostaglandins which produce severe muscle contractions in uterus when menstrual cycle occurs. There is not any strong evidence that may relate level of prostaglandins and menstrual pain. Sometimes women with high level have more cramps than women with lower level of prostaglandins [27]. A study was conducted to find out that chamomile tea effect on dysmenorrhea. 80 students participated in this study for a month before 1 week to menstruation in first five days of their periods to drink chamomile tea 2 times a day.
