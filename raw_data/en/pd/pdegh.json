Mary Kay Hudson Deputy Director Judicial Center / Division of State Court Administration 30 South Meridian Street, Suite 900 Indianapolis, IN 46204 Media Advisory: June 22 criminal justice improvement meeting A wide-range of organizations and government agencies are meeting June 22 to continue efforts to improve Indiana's criminal justice system. Police, prosecutors, public defenders, judges, probation officers, corrections officials, mental health experts, and community members are coming together to create a safer and healthier Indiana. Indiana Judicial Center 30 S. Meridian, Suite 900 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. The meeting is part of a continued effort by local and state leaders to reduce Indiana's crime rate, reduce recidivism, ensure a fair and just criminal justice system, and ensure decisions are driven by data. A grant from the National Institute of Corrections (NIC) is paying for the effort. NIC provides assistance to states seeking meaningful reforms to their justice systems. Six counties (Bartholomew, Hamilton, Hendricks, Jefferson, Porter, and Tipton) volunteered to participate in a study as part of the effort which is nationally known as Evidence Based Decision Making (EBDM). EBDM is the practice of using research to guide decisions across the justice system. A state policy team leads the effort and is chaired by Indiana Supreme Court Justice Steven David and vice-chair Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council Executive Director David Powell.

Delegates to the Indiana Republican Convention on Saturday in Indianapolis will vote on the platform, along with choosing a nominee for state attorney general and schools chief. Ahead of the gathering, a committee tasked with exploring changes to the platform voted not to revise language favoring trad itional marriage that party members added in 2014. It states, \"We believe that strong families, based on marriage between a man and a woman, are the foundation of society.\" Opponents of the language still have opportunities to alter it. A second committee, whose membership includes influential party members, will meet Friday where changes \u2014 although unexpected \u2014 could occur before nearly 1,700 delegates vote on the platform Saturday. Advocates of maintaining the provision say it constitutes a compromise str uck two years ago, where language also was included to support \"diverse\" family structures. But those who want the \"between a man and a woman\" definition removed, such as former Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard and new Marion County GOP Chairman Mike McQuil len, argue it's time for a more inclusive party. Megan Robertson, a leader in the effort to remove the language, said Republicans have an opportunity to show the party is welcoming and diverse. \"Instead of recognizing it as an opportunity, it was seen as 'We don't want to talk about this issue. We don't want to bring it up, so let's not change anything on it,' \" said Robertson, a LGBT rights activist and member of Enterprise Republicans, a group chaired by former Angie's List CEO Bill Oesterle. Oesterle, a critic of Pence, left the tech firm last year to promote gay and transgender rights after the passage of the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Serving as a backdrop to the debate is the city's annual Indy Pride Festival that's occurring in Indianapolis the same day as the state Republican convention. The festival, which supports the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, is expected to draw more than 100,000 people to Downtown Indianapolis. Indiana Republican Party Chairman Jeff Ca rdwell said the language received overwhelming support at the 2014 state convention. \"It passed with better than 80 percent of people that participated the last time around. So nothing has changed at all. I think it will be fine,\" Cardwell said. 4-WAY RA CE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL: With a party platform to approve, along with an attorney general and state superintendent races to vote on, Saturday could be a long day for delegates at the Indiana State Republican Convention (Osowski , Evansville Courier & Press ). There are four candidates for the Republican nominee for attorney general. Instead of a primary, candidates for statewide elected offices such as attorney general or state superintendent, are picked by delegates at state conventions. Hoosier voters choos e an overall winner in November. This year, with current Attorney General Greg Zoeller choosing not to seek re -election, former attorney general Steve Carter, State Sen. Randy Head of Logansport, Elkhart County Prosecutor Curtis Hill and assistant attorney general Abby Kuzma are all vying for the open position. Carter was attorney general for eight years, serving from 2001 to 2009. Now he's looking for another go -round and running on the fact that he has won this position before. \"I'm the only one of the ca ndidates who has won a statewide race before and I've done it twice,\" Carter said. \"I'm the only one who's done the job we're running for.\" Head, a former deputy prosecutor, has spent most of his tenure in the Indiana General Assembly focused on crime bill s. Now he wants to concentrate on combatting criminal activity full -time as attorney general. Federal government overreach and more rehab options for drug addicts are also priorities for Head. \"We've got to have a more effective way of treating drug addict ion,\" Head said. \"Incarceration isn't the answer for everyone.\" Hill has won four consecutive terms as Elkhart County Prosecutor and said being an elected prosecutor gives him an advantage over the other candidates. He said his current position has allowed him to receive endorsements from several county prosecutors, including Vanderburgh County's Nick Hermann. Hill is also courting delegates by telling them he's an outsider to Indianapolis and the status quo. \"You look at the other three candidates \u2014 one us ed to be the attorney general, one works for the current attorney general and the other is in the general assembly,\" Hill said. Kuzma, who has been with Zoeller since 2009, said her experience gives her an advantage on the competition. She said she has spe nt her time learning how to react to the various problems and said she is best suited to continue the work Zoeller has done. Kuzma specifically wants to continue to crack down on sex trafficking and fraud if elected, two priorities of the Zoeller administr ation. She said her goal is to keep on helping Hoosiers as the next attorney general. \"I'm not running with another goal in mind,\" she said. \"This office is where I want to be. I want to keep working.\" SANDERS PREPARES TO EXIT: Bernie Sanders on Thursday gave the strongest signals yet that he will soon bow out of the presidential race, telling reporters after meeting with President Barack Obama that he will ally himself with Hillary Clinton in the fight against Donald Trump ( Politico ). But he's not quite ready to go yet. The Vermont senator declared that he will stay in the race for the Democratic nomination until next Tuesday's District of Columbia primary and said he wants to see whether the final vote count in California shows a tighter result. He also is planning to go forward with a big rally in Washington, D.C., on Thursday night. After spending an hour meeting with Obama in the Oval Office, Sanders acknowledged that he would work with Clinton, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, to defeat Trump in the general election. Delivering remarks prepared before his sit -down with the president, Sanders ticked through a list of his priorities, promising to take those issues to the convention in Philadelphia next month. \"Needless to say, I'm going to do everything in my power, and I'm going to work as hard as I can, to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States,\" Sanders said after meeting with President Obama Thursday morning at the White House. OBAMA ENDORSES HILLARY : President Obama offered his formal endorsement of Hillary Clinton with a video Thursday and plans to campaign with the former secretary of state in Wisconsin next week, efforts aimed at speeding the Democratic Party's unification around its presumed pres idential nominee ( Washington Post ). \"I know how hard this job can be, that's why I know Hillary will be so good at it,\" Obama says in the video. \"In fact I don't think there's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office. She's got the courage, the c ompassion and the heart to get this job done.\" The swift endorsement came after the president met with Sen. Bernie Sanders at the White House earlier Thursday and the senator from Vermont indicated he is preparing to exit the Democratic nominating battle. MESSER, BUCSHON ECHO THE 'INAPPROPRIATE' TERM FOR TRUMP: Donald Trump's ethnically charged comments about an Indiana -born judge were inappropriate, but Trump is not a racist, Rep. Luke Messer said Thursday (Groppe, IndyStar ). The Shelbyville Republican a nd member of House Republican leadership also said it's unclear if Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, can conduct himself with maturity. \"I think one of the real unknowns of the upcoming campaign season is, does Donald Trump really have some sort of strange personal tic where he can't control his comments,\" Messer said. \"Or is he an adult, is he a leader, is he somebody who can control his tongue and focus on the real challenges of the American people.\" Messer, chairman of the House Republican Policy committee, was asked about Trump while appearing on C -SPAN's Washington Journal call -in program. \"To claim someone's ethnicity or race contributes to his or her job performance or ability to be impartial is unacceptable and inappropriate,\" Rep. Lar ry Bucshon, R -Newburgh, tweeted Tuesday. Messer said Thursday that, while Trump's comments \"were using the race card and we need to speak out against that,\" Trump doesn't have a record of being a racist. TRUMP HAS NO NATIONAL CAMPAIGN; RNC FILLS IN: Katie Walsh, the Republican National Committee's chief of staff, was just a few hours from meeting with Donald Trump's new political director this week when the television outside her office blared the latest news breaking out of the Trump orbit. \"Christie def ends Trump: He's not a racist,\" the CNN headline declared ( Washington Post ). The scene illustrates the tricky task facing the party, which is serving as the main engine behind Trump's presidential bid: How do you a run a disciplined campaign for a candidat e who is anything but? \"He's the nominee and he's going to make sure his views are known,\" Walsh said carefully during an interview. \"He's made that pretty clear. We will leave it to Mr. Trump to speak for Mr. Trump . . . And we will keep hitting Hillary a nd raising money to be ready for November.\" Trump's failure to build a truly national campaign has left it to the GOP to run one on his behalf, while also trying to extinguish the regular political brush fires set off by the unpredictable candidate. The ar rangement has intensified the burden on the Republican National Committee, forcing it to absorb core campaign tasks and testing whether it has improved the field and data capabilities that it fell short on in 2012. The Trump campaign has yet to build out i ts headquarters or national staff, ending the primaries with just 70 employees compared with 732 on the payroll for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. TRUMP STIFFED HUNDREDS OF WORKERS, COMPANIES: During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet -builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza ( USA Today ). The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward's father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort's builder. Edward's son, Paul, who was the firm's accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 yea rs later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. \"That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company... which has been around since my grandfather,\" he said. Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your jo b.\" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades - and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them. At l east 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty -eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. In the interview, Trump repeatedly said the cases were \"a long time ago.\" ADVOCATES DECRY $500 FINE FOR ETHICS VIOLATIONS: A former top official at the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles will be fined $500 for violating state ethics laws when he helped negotiate a lucrative state contract with a company, then took a job with the f irm (Cook, IndyStar ). The punishment immediately drew criticism from ethics experts and government accountability advocates who say it doesn't go far enough to deter such violations in the future. The penalty is the result of a settlement agreement between former BMV Chief of Staff Shawn Walters and Indiana Inspector General Cynthia Carrasco, who accused him of violating the state's ethics rules after an IndyStar investigation last year. The Indiana State Ethics Commission signed off on the agreement Thursd ay without any discussion. Walters helped negotiate a contract with Express MVA. The deal provided the company with BMV workstations and allowed it to charge customers a \"convenience fee\" for providing title and registration services normally available thr ough state license branches. The company collected about $6 million a year in fees under the arrangement. Walters then accepted a newly created executive position at the company in 2013. Critics of his $500 fine say it is too small to discourage other stat e employees from using their government jobs to advance their personal financial interests. \"It amounts to a slap on the wrist,\" said Julia Vaughn, policy director for Common Cause Indiana. DCS WARNS GROUP TO STOP USING BABY BOXES: Indiana child welfare officials have warned an organization that installed two baby boxes at firehouses where mothers can drop off unwanted newborns anonymously to remove them, saying they question their safety and whether women who use them could face child abandonment charges (Associated Press ). According to letters obtained by The Associated Press, Department of Children Services Director Mary Beth Bonaventura also is warning the not -for-profit group Safe Haven Baby Box not to install any more boxes. Founder Monica Kelsey say s the group doesn't plan to stop. Bonaventura sent a letter to James Bopp, an attorney for Safe Haven Baby Box, on June 3 recommending the organization discontinue the use of the baby boxes in Indiana and not install any more. In a letter Thursday to Gov. Mike Pence's office he said DCS has \"no legal basis for the position that Baby Boxes are currently unlawful.\" Indiana's Safe Haven Law allows someone to give up an unwanted infant less than 30 days old anonymously without fear of arrest. But Bonaventura sa ys the law specifies that the baby must be left with an \"emergency medical service provider,\" such as a firefighter, law -enforcement officer, paramedic or emergency medical technician. She says the law does not allow someone to leave the infant \"merely at a location.\" HPI DAILY ANALYSIS: For a party that has been absolutely routed, neutered in Southern Indiana over the past three election cycles, losing both Congressional districts, losing all but three legislative seats south of Bloomington, losing most of the major mayoral seats, the actions of the Indiana Democratic Party with regards to the 8th CD recount are bizarre. As things stand now, the recount between Ron Drake and David Orentlicher won't begin until sometime after the 4th of July - more than tw o months after the primary - and won't conclude until sometime in August, after the national conventions. With the potential of a Trumpian disaster for the Republican Party exponentially growing daily, the down ballot carnage could easily extend to the 8th CD. But neither Drake or Orentlicher will be able to raise much money until a nominee is determined. Republican Secretary of State Connie Lawson, the Election Division and the Recount Commission are derelict in their duty for not prioritizing a timely rec ount for one of Indiana's nine Congressional Districts. In a year of bizarre behavior, this episode is a strange, strange twist. But the strangest is the benign detachment of the Indiana Democratic Party. - Brian A.

CURTIS HILL R EACHES TIPPING POINT IN AG RACE : Elkhart County Prosecutor Curtis Hill has made phone calls, tended to social media and met one -on-one with GOP leaders across the state (Vandenack, Elkhart Truth ). Come Saturday, the Indiana attorney general hopeful \u2014 one o f four Republicans seeking the post \u2014 will find out if his effort will pay off. The Indiana Republican Party will hold its annual convention in Indianapolis, where GOP delegates will select which of the AG hopefuls to put on the statewide November ballot. \"We feel pretty good,\" Hill said Thursday. Still, the pick is to be made at a convention, where last -minute wheeling and dealing can occur, \"which means anything can happen.\" Carol McDowell, an Elkhart County Republican leader and one of the 1,796 delegate s who will converge on Indianapolis from around the state, said Hill has campaigned hard and should have solid backing from around north -central Indiana, where he's most known. \"I don't think there's a candidate that's worked harder than Curtis Hill. He's been all across the state the last nine months,\" said McDowell, who supports his bid and will work the convention floor on his behalf on Saturday. Likewise, Elkhart City Councilman Brian Dickerson, another delegate, said none of the attorney general candid ates have reached out to him as much as Hill. GREGG SAYS STATE SHOULD BE MORE FRIENDLY TO VETERANS: Calling for a renewed commitment to those who have served in our nation's military, John Gregg, Democratic candidate for governor, released a proposal to improve services for veterans and to attract more service members and veterans to the state ( Howey Politics Indiana) . A Gregg campaign news item stated Indiana is ranked second to last in the nation for military retirees and 46th worst for veterans receivi ng the benefits they have earned. Between 2013 and 2014, Indiana saw a 65 percent increase in the number of veterans leaving the state. \"Indiana can and should be a more veteran -friendly state, and will be with new leadership that focuses on practical solu tions and creative partnerships, not politics, ideology or empty rhetoric,\" said Gregg, a former university president and speaker of the Indiana House. \"Hoosier veterans are motivated, hardworking and bring unique skills to our state. Indiana needs to do a ll it can to better engage them in our economy and assist in getting them the benefits they have earned.\" Highlights of the \"Gregg/Hale Veterans Services Plan\" proposal include streamlining job placement services; implementing a statewide marketing and out reach campaign; adding veteran service officers and hours; attracting more service members and veterans to Indiana; and, increasing advocacy on behalf of Hoosier veterans. GOP CLAIMS GREGG BROKE LOBBY VOW: Indiana Republicans want Democrat John Gregg's t ime as a lobbyist to be a major sticking point in the race for governor (Kelly, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). But Thursday's attempt to paint Gregg as a liar wasn't quite a bull's -eye. The party sent out a short missive saying Gregg \"promised\" not to return to lobbying when he left the General Assembly but registered as a lobbyist the next year. They quoted a February 2002 Associated Press story where Gregg shocked the Indiana House chamber by announcing he would not seek re -election. \"Despite being overwhelm ed by emotion, Gregg joked that although he would remain speaker through this session and the November election, there \"are probably 52 of you right now\" on the Democrat side thinking of running for the speaker post after that. \"I won't be lobbying up here , so there is nothing to worry about that,\" Gregg said, drawing laughs. After being contacted by The Journal Gazette , Republican Party spokeswoman Kristen Williams provided an Indianapolis Star article that said Gregg would return to the full -time practice of law in Vincennes, not the job that first started him in politics, lobbying. And an Evansville Courier & Press article found by The Journal Gazette also said he planned to go back to Vincennes and practice law. \"He joked that he'd be buying none of his f ellow legislators dinner as a lobbyist, a job ex -lawmakers often take,\" the Evansville paper reported. Andrew Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics, said Gregg didn't \"promise\" anything, but that there is enough confusion in the art icles to make it fair game. PENCE CAMPAIGNS IN WEST VIRGINIA: Praising right -to-work laws, regulatory reforms and charter schools, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence boosted Bill Cole's candidacy for governor at a Charleston fundraiser on Tuesday ( Charleston Gazett e-Mail). Speaking to about 70 donors at the Embassy Suites hotel, Pence touted his state's right -to-work law, passed by his predecessor in 2012, and praised Cole for passing a right -to-work law this spring. West Virginia is the 26th state to adopt a right -to-work law, which allows employees at unionized workplaces to opt out of paying union fees, even though unions are obligated to represent every employee at the workplace. He argued that such changes, as well as stalling or rolling back state regulations, will yield business growth. \"Our economic development pipeline is fuller now than it's ever been in our state's history,\" Pence said. \"If you'll balance budgets, if you'll live within your means, if you'll work hard to create a pro -business environment, th e thing will sell itself.\" Among Pence's best known acts as governor was signing a \"religious freedom\" law last year that he said would protect those whose \"religious liberty is under attack,\" but which opponents called a license to discriminate against ga y, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. Asked Tuesday if he would recommend West Virginia try again to pass a \"religious freedom\" bill, Pence did not answer, instead giving a response praising right-to-work and \"strong Republican leadership.\" An aide ushered Pence away when a reporter attempted to follow up. DEMOCRATS SLATE MOORE V. WOLKINS: A Democratic caucus this week chose Dee M. Moore to run against GOP Rep. David Wolkins in the House District 18 contest this fall (Kelly, Fort Wayne Journal Gaze tte). Precinct committeemen from the district must meet and vote in order to fill a vacancy from the May primary. A press release said 26 people attended and Moore was nominated unanimously. The district covers all of Wabash County, most of Kosciusko Count y and some parts of Grant and Miami counties. Moore, of Kosciusko County, has farmed with her husband for 38 years. She grew up in Steuben County and has a degree from Purdue University in fine arts and art education. She has taught in area schools intermi ttently over the years. \"I'm not a politician but he was unopposed and that's just not right,\" Moore said. RITZ ENDORSES HENDERSON: Linda Henderson thinks it's time for lawmakers to start working together again. \"I've been distressed ... seeing all the d ivisiveness at the Statehouse,\" Henderson, a Democrat running for the Indiana Senate in District 44, said during a fundraising event Thursday evening (Banta, Bloomington Herald -Times ). Henderson, an alumna of Bedford North Lawrence High School and Indiana University and a lifelong Lawrence County resident, is running against state Rep. Eric Koch, a Bedford Republican, for the seat being vacated by state Sen. Brent Steele, also a Republican from Bedford. \"We're excited about this race,\" Henderson said, addin g that the Indiana Democratic Party has identified it as a targeted race. \"What that means is that it's winnable. ... A middle -of-the-road person can win it.\" Superintendent of Public Instruction Glenda Ritz, who spoke briefly at Henderson's fundraiser was excited to support Henderson. \"I have to have good support here at the Statehouse because we have a lot to get done with education,\" Ritz said. \"Having another educator over there at the Statehouse would be an absolute marvel.\" LINDSEY CHALLENGING REP. ELLINGTON: Democrat Steve Lindsey is running as an advocate for working people. Lindsey, who is challenging state Rep. Jeff Ellington, a Republican from Bloomington, for the right to represent Indiana House District 62, said he's about as conservative as a Democrat can be (Banta, Bloomington Herald -Times ). The Greene County native and former Greene County commissioner is pro gun rights and a longtime member of Right to Life, but he's also a self -described \"poster child for public education\" and supporter of the average laborer. \"I do believe in the workin g people,\" Lindsey said in a brief visit to The Herald -Times on Thursday. \"I feel they need to be treated fairly.\" Lindsey said he got into the race for three main reasons. He's tired of seeing money funneled away from public education; he wants the state to have a working wage; and he wants to see more money for infrastructure trickle down to the county level. And he wants to be a representative who actually would speak for the people in his district, he said. \"The Indiana state line doesn't end at Interst ate 70,\" he said. \"I feel that southern Indiana needs to be represented better.\" Presidential 2016 TRUMP FALTERS IN FOX POLL: Faltering support for Donald Trump among voters is boosting Hillary Clinton's advantage over him, a ccording to a new poll released Thursday ( Politico ). Clinton leads Trump by three percentage points \u2014 42 percent to 39 percent \u2014 among voters nationwide according to the new Fox News poll. Clinton's lead, which falls within the poll's margin of error, repr esents a reversal of fortune for Trump, who held a three -point lead in a different Fox News poll three weeks ago. Since then, Trump's support has dipped from 45 percent to 39 percent while Clinton's has remained steady at 42. Among independents, the news i s even worse for Trump, whose support dropped 11 points relative to the previous Fox News poll. Support for the presumptive Republican nominee among voters who identified themselves as Republicans also dropped three points. REPUBLICANS SAY THEY ARE NOT A LARMED: The Republican Party is unified and there is absolutely no reason to be alarmed. Or at least that was the message coming out of the meeting of top Republican donors and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump ( CBS News ). Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort said it was a \"very good meeting\" and said \"Mr. Trump did a great job. And we're excited,\" as he walked out. Judging from the tone of meeting attendees at the Four Seasons hotel in New York, you might have forgotten for a moment that many top ele cted Republicans have lambasted Trump in the last week and openly expressed unhappiness with the top of the ticket as a result of his ethnically based comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a Trump University lawsuit. Trump, New Jersey governor and early Trump supporter Chris Christie and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus all addressed the crowd of about 70 donors. All three entered and left without taking questions from reporters. Trump only stayed at the meeting for approximately 20 minutes before leaving. HOOSIERS REACT TO CLINTON NOMINATION: Thirty years ago, Jeffersonville resident Barbara Anderson was told that despite her impressive interview, she would not be hired as director for the social services agency f or which she worked. Why? Because the company wanted a \"strong man\" in the position (Beilman, News & Tribune ). \"That's the way it was,\" Anderson said Wednesday, the day after Hillary Clinton made history by surpassing the number of delegates needed to win the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. She's the first woman who will represent a major political party in the race for the White House. And a marathon it has been. \"Women made a lot less money,\" recalled Anderson, who now is executive director of Haven House Services Inc. \"They were expected to do a lot of the grunt work, and they did.\" Things have changed since then. Not only does the United States have more female CEOs leading major corporations, but also it has more women in politics, and now one who is but an election away from leading the nation. \"That's hugely significant, for my daughter, for my granddaughters ... There's nothing that can hold them back from what they want to be,\" Anderson said. For symbolic reasons, the night was \"hugely important,\" political consultant and former state Democratic Party chairman Dan Parker said. \"I have a 15 -year-old daughter, and she sat and watched the secretary's speech with me last night,\" Parker said. \"I think the most important part is, it's just one more barrier that's broken. Anyone in this country can grow up to serve whatever you want to do.\" CLINTON MULLS VEEP CHOICE: Hillary Clinton is already searching for a vice presidential running mate and the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee says she's looking at \"the most qualified people\" ( CBS News ). \"I'm looking at the most qualified people and that includes women, o f course, because I want to be sure that whoever I pick could be president immediately if something were to happen,\" Clinton told CNN. \"That's the most important qualification.\" But she also said she doesn't yet know whether or not she'll announce her runn ing mate before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this July. \"I'm not sure how long it's going to take to try and sort all this out. We'll have it done by the convention,\" she said. \"I'm not going to speculate how much before the conventio n it'll be completed.\" Some of the potential running mates that have been floated are Sherrod Brown, Tim Kaine, Tom Perez, Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro. Choosing Brown or Warren could be risky since they both represent states in the Senate that have GOP governors who would be able to appoint their successors. Warren has not yet endorsed Clinton. Indiana Democratic sources tell Howey Politics Indiana that former governor and senator Evan Bayh is not being vetted by the Clinton campaign. He was under co nsideration in 2008 by President Obama. WARREN TO MEET WITH CLINTON: Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton will meet privately Friday morning, according to two knowledgeable Democrats. The sit -down, coming just hours after the Massachusetts senator formal ly endorsed the presumptive Democratic nominee, will fuel speculation about her prospects as a potential vice presidential pick. The women have had several conversations over the past month, including one that lasted around half an hour, sources told The Washington Post . The conversations were broad and focused on large topics and issues, rather than the nitty - gritty of the campaign. Their staffs have been engaged in more tactical discussions. WARREN RIPS TRUMP: Speaking at a judicial conference in D.C. o n Thursday night, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren unleashed one of her strongest attacks yet on presumptive GOP nominee and \"wannabe tyrant\" Donald Trump over his rhetoric on judges -- and his troubles over Trump University ( CBS News ). \"Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin -skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves no one but himself,\" she told members of the American Constitution Society. \"And that is just one of the many reasons why he will never be President of the United States .\" Warren specifically spoke about the lawsuits over Trump University, the now -defunct series of real estate seminars Trump marketed and sold. \"Donald Trump has run into a lot of legal trouble,\" she said. \"Ah yes, Trump University, which his own former emp loyees refer to as a 'fraudulent scheme.'\" SO DOES BIDEN: Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren both ripped into Donald Trump as a \"racist\" on Thursday \u2014 but not before Biden tipped his hand for his official endorsement, saying \"God willing, \" Hillary Clinton will be the next president of the United States ( Politico ). Biden made the comments, delivered in an offhand tangent, shortly after meeting with Bernie Sanders at his Naval Observatory home. Warren had already taped her endorsement of Cli nton in an appearance on MSNBC that aired after she spoke. And of course, both followed President Barack Obama's official endorsement of Clinton released earlier in the day. But first, they both ripped into Trump as a dangerous, obnoxious man whose presenc e in the Oval Office threatened to undermine the Constitution and the very fabric of America, using their forum at the American Constitution Society convention to build their case around Trump's attacks on the supposed bias of Gonzalo Curiel, the judge in several class -actions lawsuits over Trump University, because of his Mexican ancestry. Trump, Biden said, \"cannot be trusted to respect the independence of the judiciary as a president.\" Either he doesn't understand or doesn't care, Biden said, the danger of what he's sowing with his comments, which the vice president said tilt toward authoritarianism and tyranny. \"These are words in my view of one who would defy the courts if they ruled against him as president,\" Biden said, but, \"It's not the racism that worries me. We've dealt with racists before. It's the potential impact on the court.\" But the wider blistering attack came from Warren, who also called Trump a disgrace and a shame on the country. But her favorite attack: \"thin -skinned.\" TRUMP ASKS ABOUT CLINTON EMAIL: Donald Trump lobbed a comeback at Hillary Clinton via Twitter Thursday as the two presumptive nominees traded social media barbs ( Politico ). More than an hour after Clinton tweeted at Trump to \"delete your account,\" Trump fired back with a burn of his own. \"How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up,\" Trump wrote on Twitter, quoting Clinton's earlier post. \"And where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?\" McCONNELL WON'T RULE OUT RESCINDING ENDORSEMENT: The top -ranking Senate Republican has made clear in multiple interviews over the course of the last two weeks that Donald Trump's comments about Indiana -born Judge Gonzalo Curiel being a \"Mexican\" are unacceptable ( Politico ). But Mitch McConnell, in an interview with Bloomberg published Friday, went a step further, and would not categorically rule out revoking his endorsement of Trump as the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee. \"I'm not going to speculate about what he might say, or what I might do,\" McConnell told B loomberg's Masters in Politics podcast. \"But I think it's pretty clear and I've been pretty clear publicly about how I think he ought to change direction and I hope that's what we are going to see.\" KASICH WON'T ENDORSE TRUMP: Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Thursday he still isn't ready to endorse presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump ( CNN). \"Why would I feel compelled to support someone whose positions I kind of fundamentally disagree with?\" he told Fox News. Kasich suspended his own run for the White House a little more than a month ago and has since declined from endorsing Trump, decrying the divisiveness and \"name -calling\" he says has been a part of the campaign. \"Mr. Trump called me and said, 'What are you going to do to support me?' and I said, 'We 're like two companies. We have a difference vision, a different value system, and a different objective,' So its pretty hard to put that together,\" Kasich told Fox News' Bill Hemmer, referencing a conversation that occurred a couple weeks ago. WALKER TO HESITANT TO ENDORSE: Former 2016 presidential candidate and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued a sharp condemnation of Donald Trump's criticism of a federal judge on Wednesday -- even threatening to withhold his support from the presumptive GOP nominee ( CNN). Walker, who has yet to endorse Trump, told reporters: \"We will watch and see what happens. There's still quite some time until he is the nominee.\" \"He's not yet the nominee. Officially that won't happen until the middle of July, that's the time frame. In particular, I want to make sure he renounces what he says with regards to this judge -- that flies directly in the face, and on the religious test alone, that's directly in conflict with the Sixth Amendment,\" Walker said in Madison, Wisconsin. CHARLE S KOCH FED UP WITH TRUMP, CLINTON: Billionaire Charles Koch, one of America's most influential conservative donors, said he is fed up with the vitriol of the presidential race and will air national TV ads that call on citizens to work together to fix a \"rigged\" economy that leaves behind the poor. Koch, in a telephone interview with TheAssociated Press , described Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton as part of personality politics at its worst. He said that's why neither he nor the political and policy groups he controls are playing much of a role in the presidential election. Instead, in an unusual strategy, the ads will be paid for by his private company, Koch Industries. \"Both the primaries and the general (election) seems it's more, 'You' re the enemy, you're evil, or you're stupid,' or whatever ad hominem attacks on each other,\" Koch said, \"rather than trying to find common ground so different opposing views can learn from each other and we can find better solutions.\" MAJORITY IN FOX POLL SAYS CLINTON IS LYING: American voters think Hillary Clinton put national security at risk by mishandling classified emails -- and that she's lying about it ( Fox News ). By a 60 -27 percent margin, they think she's lying about how her em ails were handled while she was secretary of state, according to the latest Fox News national poll of registered voters. And by 57 -32 percent, voters say U.S. safety was at risk because of Clinton's mishandling of national secrets. \"Clinton's explanations are clearly not cutting it with voters,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democratic pollster Chris Anderson. Congress COATS AMENDMENT TO PROTECT IRS FRAUD VICTIMS: An amendement introduced by U.S. Sen. Dan Coats (R -IN) to protect victims whose identity is stolen through IRS and Social Security fraud unanimously passed the Finance Committee (Howey Political Report ). This situation arises when undocumented workers steal the Social Security numbers (SSNs) of A merican citizens in order to illegally obtain a job, according to an op -ed penned by the senator and distributed by his office. Undocumented workers are issued an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to file taxes, but they cannot use an ITIN t o apply for a job. So instead, many will attempt to use a stolen SSN and someone else's identity to obtain a job. Employers then will send wage information based on this stolen identity to the IRS and the Social Security Administration (SSA) on a W -2 form. When the time comes to file taxes, undocumented workers will file a tax return with their own name and ITIN but attach a W-2 with an obviously false identity. The legislation would require the IRS to notify victims, rather than leave it up to the IRS. It would provide steps that victims can take to protect themselves and offer IRS victim protection measures. It also would require the IRS and SSA to communicate with each other about these cases so that victim earnings are correctly reflected by both agencie s. COATS CRITICIZES WASTEFUL DEFENSE SPENDING: The Defense Department spent $46 billion between 2001 and 2011 on a dozen different weapons programs that were never finished, according to U.S. Sen. Dan Coats (R -Ind.), the chairman of the Joint Economic Co mmittee ( Howey Politics Indiana ). Coats spoke on the Senate floor about the DOD Weapons Acquisition System, which is the process by which the DOD procures weapons systems or related items from various defense contractors. This process includes the design, development, deployment and disposal of weapons used by our military. Coats said the current process needs to be reformed because it is wasting taxpayer dollars. \"As a former member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have long supported a strong nat ional defense, and I am well aware of the important role that our weapons systems play in the defense of our nation,\" said Coats. DONNELLY, GRASSLEY PRESS CHINA ON AG BIOTECH AGREEMENTS: U.S. Sens. Joe Donnelly (D -IN) and Chuck Grassley (R -IA) sent a let ter to China's Ambassador to the United States to ask the Chinese government to prioritize the approval of eight biotech traits that have been pending in the Chinese regulatory system for years ( Howey Politics Indiana ). According to a press release, the le tter comes after the good faith efforts made by U.S. biotechnology companies to address questions and concerns about their products were met with continued delays by the Chinese government. Several of the traits in question were first submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture for approval in 2011. No approvals were granted in 2015. \"We are troubled by the fact that the Chinese regulatory system continues to be cumbersome and unpredictable,\" Donnelly and Grassley wrote. \"Some companies with pending traits wer e asked for data that had been previously supplied. We ask that the Chinese government and the Ministry of Agriculture prioritize the final decisions for these eight traits.\" Both Donnelly and Grassley pressed for more Chinese action to show their commitme nt to improving U.S. -China economic relations through agricultural trade. BUCSHON VOTES IN FAVOR OF OZONE LEGISLATION: U.S. Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-IN) reported that he voted in support of \"a commonsense bill that will provide states, like Indiana, the flexibility in implementing the Environmental Protection Agency's ozone standards.\" ( Howey Politics Indiana ) The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 4775, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act. Bucshon issued the following statement: \"I have always believed regulations put forth by the administration should strike the appropriate balance between protecting our environmen t and protecting the jobs and affordable energy supported by the energy industry,\" said Bucshon. \"The path forward should be achieved through private sector innovation and technological advancements, not one -sized fits all government mandates that only ser ve to stymie development. That's why it is so important the House passed legislation today to provide states, like Indiana, the flexibility and time needed to implement new ozone standards on an efficient and realistic timeline and address other practical implementation challenges they face. This legislation will help protect our state's coal mining and manufacturing jobs.\" ROKITA URGES REFORM OF FEDERAL BUDGET PROCESS: U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita (R-IN) chaired a House Budget Committee hearing yesterday focuse d on the need to control automatic spending and unauthorized programs ( Howey Political Report ). It was the second of this year's hearings aimed at informing a rewrite of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Rep. Rokita serves as the Vice Chairman of the H ouse Budget Committee. He sent the following statement in a news release: \"The authors of the Congressional Budget Act did not anticipate that the chronic deficits and automatic spending of today would become so dominant. We can either reduce spending furt her on discretionary programs like infrastructure, education, medical research and national defense, which already represent a shrinking portion of the federal budget, or we can continue to rob future generations, our kids and grandkids, by continuing to b orrow and grow our national debt. The first choice will not solve our fiscal challenges and the second choice is downright unfair.\" CARSON ANNOUNCES $4M IN AMERICORPS FUNDING FOR STATE: More than $4 million in new federal grants will support AmeriCorps m embers throughout Indiana, according to a news release from the office of U.S. Rep. Andre Carson (D -IN) (Howey Politics Indiana ). The grants are administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the federal agency that oversees Ame riCorps. The list of 2016 competitive grants include the University Notre Dame ACE Program; Robinson Community Learning Center AmeriCorps Program through the University of Notre Dame; Boys & Girls Club of Wayne County - Project ACES; Amrican Red Cross of Indiana; Public Allies of Indianapolis; Phalen Leadership Academies - Scholars Excel AmeriCorps Program; and, Teach for America. ROKITA WELCOMES INDIAN PRIME MINISTER: While serving as Indiana's Secretary of State, U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita (R -IN) was the fi rst state -wide officeholder to travel to India in an official capacity, and is a current member of the House Indian and Indian Americans Caucus ( Howey Politics Indiana ). Rep. Rokita had this to say about when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India addressed a joint session of Congress during a state visit to the United States :\"I am honored to welcome Prime Minister Modi back to the United States for today's address. I had the privilege of meeting the Prime Minister back in 2014, and was impressed by his com ments on free markets and democracy, in addition to his wanting to reduce government red tape and corruption. These are goals that we share, and should serve as a reminder to lawmakers of what we should be striving for with every bill we consider.\" Before Prime Minister Modi's speech, Rep. Rokita hosted fellow Hoosiers and close friends from the Indiana Indian community to discuss current events in American and Indian politics. General Assembly HERSHMAN, MERRITT CELEBRATE TRAIN DAY: State Sens. Brandt Hershman (R - Buck Creek) and Jim Merritt (R -Indianapolis) joined other state leaders on the Hoosier State passenger rail train from Indianapolis to Lafayette in honor of Hoosier Train Day(Howey Political Report ). Hershman and Merritt, alo ng with Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb, rail-industry and state leaders and members of the public, toured the Hoosier State's upgraded, historic train equipment. The group then took the train, which started in Indianapolis, to the Lafayette station, then back to th e state capital. Hoosier Train Day celebrates passenger trains across Indiana. The Indiana Department of Transportation and Iowa Pacific Holdings sponsored the excursion featuring a two -level observation dining car. BURTON SAYS FED BATHROOM MANDATE IS OU T OF LINE: The federal bathroom mandate \"is an example of extreme federal overreach from Washington, D.C.,\" reads an op -ed by State Rep. Woody Burton (R -Whiteland), which was posted yesterday to the website of the House Republican Caucus website ( Howey Pol itics Indiana) . \"With these strings attached, their guidelines feel more like requirements and less like suggestions. I want to be perfectly clear that no one should ever feel they are being discriminated against. Personally, I do not believe schools shoul d allow young children to choose a bathroom or locker room that does not match their biological sex... Decisions of this magnitude should be made at the state and local level by people who will put the best interest of our children ahead of political ideol ogy... Already, Indiana school boards have proven that they can appropriately address and handle these decisions. Each school and district is unique. No one knows this better than local school leaders and educators. In making accommodations, they can exerc ise appropriate judgement and compassion on a case -by-case basis, not adhering to blanket, one -size- fits-all mandates from the federal government.\" Burton notes the legislature's Interim Study Committee on Courts and the Judiciary has been assigned the top ic of civil rights related to gender identity and sexual orientation. HATE CRIME LEGISLATION DEBATED: Indiana came closer than it's ever come during the last session to joining the ranks of states with bias crime, or hate crime, laws (Indiana Public Medi a). The Associated Press recently found that 52 percent of Indiana police agencies didn't file voluntary hate crime reports with the FBI between 2009 and 2014; that's three times the national average of 17 percent. Bias crime, or hate crime, laws punish th e motivation behind a crime - for example, if a person attacks someone because of the victim's race, religion, or gender, the attacker could receive a harsher punishment. Indiana is one of only five states without such a law...though it's getting closer to c hanging that. A bias crimes bill passed the Senate 34 to 16 last session before dying in the House. \"I believe there is a legitimate shot in 2017,\" says Chris Paulsen of LGBT rights group Freedom Indiana. But Pastor Ron Johnson doesn't think last session's progress should be a harbinger of things to come. Johnson, who heads the religious conservative organization the Indiana Pastors Alliance, says groups like his had their attention on an LGBT rights bill last session. \"There was so much focus on what was t aking place there and trying to keep our religious liberties from being eroded that frankly, I think this slipped in through the side door,\" Johnson says. State GOVERNOR: PENCE TO SPEAK AT WALMART'S FEED 'EM FOR FREEDOM - Later today Gov. Mike Pence will offer remarks at Walmart's Feed 'em for Freedom, in which soldiers at Camp Atterbury will be treated to a free lunch. The event is slated for the USO Club Building at Camp Atterbury near Edinburgh beginning at 11 a.m. EDUCATION: ELLSPERMANN TOURING IVY TECH CAMPUSES - Ivy Tech's new president has a plan. She's going to focus on what employers are looking for, and work toward a system that prepares students to fill those needs (Pemberton, Kokomo Tribune). Sue Ellspermann, f ormer lieutenant governor, will start as the school's president in July. This month she's visiting with campuses across the state. She visited Kokomo on Wednesday, citing the need to renovate the campus. For the school system as a whole, she plans to figur e out which classes are necessary and which aren't. The college is trying to focus on what employers need, she said. She's waiting on data from the Department of Workforce Development. The DWD is required to develop an occupational demand report by July 1, showing what employers need and the training required to fulfill those needs. Once the school has the data, Ellspermann said the school will focus more heavily on programs that help students get jobs. \"I really want to know the numbers,\" she said. \"I don' t want to just say we need more STEM graduates. That doesn't help me.\" ECONOMY: THRIVING COMMUNITIES MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS - A systematic, 18 -month examination of the policies and programs needed for Indiana's urban, mid -sized and rural communities to th rive in the state's third century has produced dozens of recommendations for Hoosiers to consider implementing (Carden, NWI Times ). The Thriving Communities, Thriving State project of Indiana University's Policy Choices Initiative analyzed the current growt h rate of the state's population and economy, then used community conversations and expert research to develop plans for how to significantly improve both over the next 10 years. \"Change is inevitable, but we actually have to plan for progress,\" said John Marron, an analyst at IU's Public Policy Institute. \"If you project the current trends out into the future, things don't look very good.\" The study found all Indiana localities need to improve education and workforce preparation, encourage community leader ship and civic engagement as well as invest in quality -of-life and quality -of place amenities. HISTORY: DANIELS NAMED A LIVING LEGEND - Former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels is one of five recipients of the Indiana Historical Society's annual 'Indiana Living Legends' award (Indiana Public Media ). The yearly award recognizes what IHS calls \"extraordinary Hoosiers\" for local, statewide and national achievements. Daniels currently serves as the 12th president of Purdue University, after serving as Indiana's 49th governor. Daniels has previously served as President of Eli Lilly's North American Pharmaceutical Operations and senior advisor to President Reagan. Other 2016 'Living Legends' are Indianapolis Children's Choir founding director Henry Leck, Indiana historian Dr. James Madison, Central Indiana Community Foundation President and CEO Brian Payne and civic and corporate leader Yvonne Shah een. The recipients will be honored at a gala on Friday, July 22 at the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center. Tickets are $250 per person. INDOT: OFFICIALS SAY INDY -CHICAGO TRAIN LINE SAVED - Officials are calling a public -private partnership to keep the Hoosier State Train on the tracks a success - but the cost long -term, and who will pay for it, remains a question (Heinz, WRTV). INDOT, which is paying $255,000 a month to keep the train running, last year signed a two -year contract with Iowa P acific and Amtrak to keep the Indianapolis -to-Chicago service moving. The goal is for people to be able to catch a ride more frequently between Indianapolis and Chicago. \"There were a lot of hurdles to overcome in getting that far, but customer satisfactio n is tremendous, on -time performance is dramatically better, ridership has increased, but the clock is ticking on the state budget allotment, and it will have to compete with a lot of other priorities,\" said State Sen. Brandt Hershman (R -Buck Creek). The f unding is coming from the tax amnesty program - a one -time revenue stream. It will continue through next June. Beyond that, Hershman says future funding from the state is uncertain. INDOT says ridership was up 15 percent last month compared to May 2015. AGRICULTURE: FARM SERVICE AGENCY RUNNING OUT OF FUNDS - For the first time since 2013, Indiana's Farm Service Agency is running out of loan funding for banks and farmers (Ropeik, Indiana Public Media ). A spike in loan applications has put the FSA close to its own lending record. The agency lends money in two ways: directly to farmers for costs such as equipment upgrades or crops, and to local lenders as a sort of insurance on loans those groups give to farmers. Indiana farm loans chief Greg Foulke says the latter has been the problem this year. Farmers are still recovering from low commodity prices and a rainy growing season that hurt their 2015 yields. Banks are asking the FSA to balance their books. It's caused a major spike in lending - $170 million has b een given out, with four months left in the fiscal year. Foulke expects to run out of direct loan funding this month, and guarantee funding next month. After that, he says they'll start queuing applications to receive money once Congress replenishes the FS A budget. Most farmers have the money they needed for this year's crops, he says. But the wait could cause new farm real estate deals to fall through. ECONOMY: LIFE SCIENCES AMONG STRONGEST IN NATION - Indiana's life sciences industry continues to be one of the strongest in the country according to a new report by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (McGowan, Inside Indiana Business). The BIO report, released at the organization's annual global conference in San Francisco, says over 1,700 businesses in the industry employ more than 58,000 Hoosiers. It also ranks Indiana high in patents and research and development, but says the state co ntinues to struggle when it comes to venture capital investment. The third - party analysis, which BioCrossroads Project Director Brian Stemme calls the \"gold standard,\" suggests job growth between 2012 and 2014, especially for pharmaceutical companies. BIO also breaks down the strengths of several cities in Indiana that rate well among their peers. They include the metropolitan statistical areas of Bloomington, Evansville, Indianapolis, Lafayette, Michigan City, South Bend -Mishawaka and Terre Haute. It sugge sts the industry overall in Indiana grew by 1.4 percent over the two - year period and research universities in the state conduct some $582 million in life sciences R&D annually. EDUCATION: BSU FAR SHORT OF RESEARCH FUNDING GOALS - Ball State University ob tained only $11.1 million in external funding for research and other scholarly work in 2014 -15, far short of the $25 million goal, the university's board of trustees was told this week (Slabaugh, Muncie Star Press ). The university's Sponsored Projects Admi nistration estimates Ball State faculty and staff secured $15 million in research, creative and programmatic external funding in 2015 -16, which was barely half of the $29 million goal. The goal for 2016 -17 is $32 million. The university announced in March that \"Papa\" John Schnatter and the Charles Koch Foundation were awarding a $3.25 -million grant to fund Ball State University's new John H. Schnatter Institute for Entrepreneurship and Free Enterprise. The state Legislature has appropriated $62.5 million fo r Ball State to create a new College of Health, which is expected to attract more research funding to the university. EDUCATION: BALL STATE ENROLLMENT DECLINE - Total enrollment, including undergraduate, graduate, international, on campus and online, dec reased from 22,147 in 2011 to 20,879 in 2015, while total on -campus enrollment dropped from 18,241 to 16,602 during that time (Slabaugh, Muncie Star Press ). Total on -campus enrollment is projected to increase to 16,619 in the fall of 2016 and to 16,920 by the fall of 2020. BICENTENNIAL: LITERARY MAP HONORS HOOSIER WRITERS - The Indiana Literary map was created by Indiana State Library in partnership with several literary organizations to feature outstanding writers in the history of Indiana, as well as, contemporary writers (Gary Qi, Statehouse File ). \"There is a lot of great and talent that exists in the state now and always has been, but maybe a lot of people aren't aware of all the authors that have come from Indiana or have made Indiana their home,\" sa id Travis DiNicola, Executive Director of Indy Reads, a non -profit bookstore and publisher in Indianapolis. As a literary center, Indiana has been home to many renowned writers. DiNicola said Dan Wakefield, the Hoosier -born author of the bestselling novel \"Going All the Way,\" told him that at one point back in the 1920s, half of The New York Times best-selling authors were from Indiana. DiNicola said this map will give readers a chance to discover new authors they did not know about or learn that one of the ir favorite authors came from Indiana. The map features 200 Indiana writers from different literary genres. SPORTS: HOOSIERS #7 IN HOOPS ATTENDANCE - Attendance is rarely an issue at Assembly Hall, as Indiana is enjoying a 44 -year run that has seen the H oosiers' average attendance rank among the top 10 in the nation 38 times (Goff, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). Indiana announced Wednesday that it averaged 17,106 fans in the 2015-16 season, the seventh -best number in the country. The Hoosiers, who won the Big Ten regular -season title, drew about 800 more people per game than the season before. Indiana's latest success also came at a time when the Big Ten announced continued attendance dominance. For the 40th straight season, the Big Ten led the nation in ave rage attendance. The league's figure was 12,555 for 2015 -16. Nation WHITE HOUSE: OBAMA WORRIED ABOUT GOP - President Barack Obama made the case for Democratic unity on the late night couch -- appearing on NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" to say he hopes Democr ats are \"able to pull things together\" ahead of the general election (CNN). \"My hope is over the next couple weeks, we're able to pull things together. And what happens during primaries, you get a little ouchy. Everybody does,\" Obama told host Jimmy Fallon . \"There's a natural process of everybody recognizing that this is not about any individual\" and said he expects a \"great convention\" in Philadelphia this summer. When Fallon asked Obama if he thought the Republicans were happy with their choice of Donald Trump as their presidential nominee, he deadpanned -- \"we are\" -- before seriously ruminating on the need for \"a healthy two -party system.\" \"The truth is actually I am worried about the Republican Party,\" he said. \"You want the Republican nominee to be som ebody who could to the job if they win. And you want folks who understand the issues. And where you can sit across the table from them and you have a principled argument. And ultimately can still move the country forward.\" Obama continued: \"So I am actuall y not enjoying, and I haven't been enjoying over the last seven years, watching some of the things that have happened in the Republican Party, 'cause there's some good people in the Republican Party. There are wonderful Republicans out in the country who w ant what's best for the country and may disagree with me on some things but are good, decent people.\" WHITE HOUSE: MALIA OBAMA TO GRADUATE - A milestone has arrived for President Barack Obama: Daughter Malia is graduating from high school ( Associated Press). The 17 -year-old is receiving her diploma from the private Sidwell Friends School on Friday. Malia Obama was just 10 years old and longing for a promised puppy when her family moved into the White House. During seven years of growing up in the public eye, she has gotten and shed braces, learned to drive and even spent brief stints away from her family. Presidents are parents, too, and it hasn't been easy for Obama to watch as his daughter \u2014 \"one of my best friends\" \u2014 has grown up fast, and in front of the world. \"I'm not going to talk about the fact that my daughter leaving me is just breaking my heart,\" he said last week. Local CITIES: RETIRED MUNSTER ADMINISTRATORS ASKED TO REPAY $851K - The Indiana State Board of Accounts released a scathing report on certain School Town of Munster finances, targeting retired Superintendent William Pfister and retired Assistant Superintendent Richard Sopko, who also was superintendent for two years, askin g the pair to repay $851,000 to the school district (McCollum, NWI Times ). The special investigatory report has been sent to the Indiana Attorney General's Office and the Lake County prosecutor. An FBI investigation also is underway. The audit asks Pfister to reimburse the district a total of $463,922 for overpayment to his annuity, salary and stipend, and other items. It asks Sopko to reimburse the district a total of $377,475 for overpayment to his annuity, salary and stipend, and other items. With an $8 million deficit, the School Town of Munster's budget has been in the red for several years. In May 2013, Munster voters agreed to pay an additional 19.9 cents per $100 of assessed valuation to raise $3 million each year for the next seven years, or $21 mil lion. Munster school teachers' pay was frozen in 2010 during Pfister's and Sopko's tenure, and teachers were asked to roll back their pay to 2009 numbers mid -year, said Munster teacher's union President Ryan Ridgley. Teachers still could earn step increase s for years of service if they had been there for fewer than 20 years, he said. CITIES: FORT WAYNE PAYS $125K TO SETTLE LAWSUIT - The city of Fort Wayne paid $125,000 to settle an excessive -force lawsuit with a Michigan man arrested in January 2013 (Gree n, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). According to court documents, Casey Wentzel suffered facial and skull fractures, as well as a concussion when he encountered Fort Wayne Police officers on the city's southwest side while in the throes of a mental health cris is. While he was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of resisting law enforcement, the charge was dismissed days later by Allen County prosecutors. Two Fort Wayne Police officers were named as defendants in the case, but officer Christopher Michel was eventua lly cleared in the internal investigation. The other officer James Arnold was given a 30 -day suspension for his conduct and the inter - departmental review led to a change about how similar situations will be handled in the future, as well as changing the wo rding from \"excessive force\" to \"unreasonable force.\" CITIES: BLOOMINGTON CRACKING DOWN ON FAILED PARKING METERS - The city of Bloomington is cracking down and fixing parking meters that were failing at a huge rate (Glavan, Fox59 ). Mayor John Hamilton sa id Thursday that the city now has its hands around the problem, which he first brought to light in February. At the time, all of the city's 1,500 parking meters were failing at least two times a year. The monthly fail rate was at 18 percent, meaning you ha d a one in five chance of picking a meter that wouldn't work. \"They were leaking, they were rusting, they were freezing. Coins were sticking, cards weren't working, batteries were failing. You can name a way a meter might fail and we found it,\" Hamilton sa id. The city bought the refurbished meters, which housed new software, and installed them in 2013. CITIES: WHEEL TAX ORDINANCE INTRODUCED IN GARY - Gary will join other area municipalities in deciding whether to impose a \"wheel tax\" to raise money from local residents who own automobiles (Tejeda, Post-Tribune ). An ordinance imposing the tax was introduced before the Gary Common Council on Tuesday and was assigned to the council's Finance committee, which is scheduled to meet June 14 at City Hall. Accordin g to the proposed ordinance, Gary is considering a wheel tax of $25 per year for passenger vehicles and motorcycles, along with trucks whose declared gross weight us under 11,000 pounds. Buses would be charged $40, along with recreational vehicles, semitra ilers, tractors and trailers. The rates are reflect the maximum allowed under state statute. Sponsored by Mayor Karen Freeman -Wilson, if it gets committee support, the proposal could come up for a final vote when the full council meets again. The tax rate, if approved by the Common Council, would take effect Jan. 1, 2017. The city Controller would provide the Common Council by Aug. 1 with an estimate of wheel tax revenues to be collected each year. CITIES: MAYOR TO BRING NEW STREET LIGHTS TO CITY - Indian apolis Mayor Joe Hogsett has begun his initiative to end a 30 -year-old ban on new street lights in the city thanks, in part, to a partnership with Indianapolis Power & Light Co. (Brown, Inside Indiana Business) . Hogsett's office says \"Operation Night Light \" is being funded through cost savings and will not require additional tax dollars. The plan involves the installation of 100 new street lights throughout Indianapolis. As part of the initiative, IPL will fund the city's first study of residential lighting to assist in the planning of future phases of the project. The mayor's office says additional lights will be installed based on several factors, including community growth, neighborhoods requests to the Mayor's Action Center, and public safety. The MAC wi ll accept requests for new street lights for the first phase of \"Operation Night Light\" for the next 30 days. CITIES: END OF FLIGHTS FROM FORT WAYNE TO PHILADELPHIA - There will be no more flights to Philadelphia from Fort Wayne International Airport by the end of the summer (Gong, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). Flights to the City of Brotherly Love will end on Aug. 23 because passenger loads were not large enough. The service started in October 2014. To be able to offer nonstop flights to Philadelphia, the Fort Wayne City Council in 2014 gave the airport authority $600,000 - half from the city's Legacy Fund and half from the local economic development income tax - as part of a minimum revenue guarantee to ensure that American Airlines would not lose money i f the route proved unsuccessful. In addition to the $600,000 from the city, the airport authority also received $600,000 from the U.S. Department of Transportation, $500,000 from Greater Fort Wayne Inc. and the airport authority, $150,000 from Allen County , $100,000 from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, and $50,000 from the Northeast Indiana Regional Partnership for a total pot of $2 million.

COUNTIES: POT LEGALIZATION GROUP SUES TIPPECANOE - A group advocating for the legalization of marijuana is suing Tippecanoe County after it says it was denied the right to hold a rally on the courthouse square (Brosher, Indiana Public Media) . The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf o f the Higher Society of Indiana Thursday and claims the county's policy for holding rallies on the public property is discriminatory and violates the First Amendment. According to court documents, the courthouse is considered a \"closed forum\" and rallies p lanned on courthouse grounds must be sponsored by at least one of the county commissioners. The Higher Society of Indiana says it received permission from the commissioners to hold a rally on May 11. But following the rally, the Tippecanoe County Attorney informed them the request was approved by mistake. When the Higher Society requested permission to hold a second rally on the courthouse grounds on June 17, the request was denied because none of the commissioners would sponsor the event. In its lawsuit, t he group says the denial \"is not reasonable and represents viewpoint discrimination.\" The Higher Society claims the county's closed forum policy violates the First Amendment. COUNTIES: VANDERBURGH WARRANT ACCOUNTABILITY - People lined up outside Room 110 at the Civic Center in Evansville Thursday morning , waiting for their shot to turn themselves in and to get their warrants lifted and a new court date set (Tristatehomepage.com ). \"It's great to give an opportunity and see so many people take advantage of it,\" Vanderburgh County Prosecutor Nick Hermann said. The Vanderburgh County Prosecutor's Office and the county judges teamed up for a warrant accountability event, giving people with warrants for misdemeanors, level 5 and level 6 felony crimes a second c hance. \"Having something like that hang over your head, that you could be arrested at any moment and taken to jail while you're taking your kids to school or doing something like that, being able to get in here and get into the system is important,\" Herman n said. There are more than 12,000 warrants out in Vanderburgh County, according to the Prosecutor's Office.

She highlighted that there were 77 total applications, covering 156 total programs, requesting $29.1 million. Ms. Braun stated that readiness, capacity and the funding formula based on county population were used in making the recommendations. She also reported that some counties got more than requested because DOC used a set amount of $35,000 plus benefits for probation officer and community corrections officer salaries and several recommendations for funding earmarks were made. Ms. Braun explained that DOC recommends a $500,000 earmark for prosecutor diversion programs so that DOC could provide them education on evidence- based practices and appropriate target populations. The Advisory Council members discussed this earmark and the potential for opportunity.

Update from DMHA on Recovery Works. Terry Cook distributed a handout and reported that participation in Recovery Works services has doubled to 1947 since February, with 100 new people enrolled every week. Sara Cozad reported that the top five services are housing assistance, group substance use counseling, skills development training, intensive outpatient treatment, and individual substance use counseling and the top four referring counties are Marion, Vanderburgh, Madison, and Monroe. Ms. Cozad reported that all counties are served by a Recovery Works designated agency and that the projected enrollment by the end of FY 16 is 2845 participants. Ms. Cozad also reported that they would like to see more referrals from Lake, Allen, and Vigo counties. She stated that it takes 3-6 months to spend the $2500 cap amount for an individual receiving Recovery Works services and DMHA expects to carry over $8 million dollars into the next fiscal year. The Advisory Council members discussed the spending cap, if removing the cap might result in more referrals, and the need for more health navigators for faster Healthy Indiana Plan enrollment. Terry Cook made a motion to lift the $2500 participant cap and the $500 medication cap in the Recovery Works program. Larry Landis seconded the motion, which was approved unanimously. Terry Cook also reported that DMHA is interested in expanding the 21 day pre-release package to include assessment and case management to support re-entry and is interested in removing the requirement for prior authorization. David Powell made a motion to support expansion of the 21 day pre-release package to include assessment and case management and to increase it to 30 days pre-release. Julie Lanham seconded the motion, which was approved unanimously. Terry Cook also reported that DMHA is proposing a change of rates to match HIP reimbursement rates. He said the idea is to increase the rates to incentivize provider participation. Larry Landis made a motion to increase Recovery Works reimbursement rates to match HIP rates. Julie Lanham seconded the motion, which was approved unanimously. Terry Cook further reported that DMHA has been discussing the idea of using Recovery Works funding for county care coordinators to coordinate referrals and do system navigation. Larry Landis made a motion to appoint a workgroup to explore the issue of care coordinators and report back at the June meeting. David Murtaugh seconded the motion, which was approved unanimously. The following Advisory Council members volunteered for the care coordination workgroup: Larry Landis, Steve Luce, Chris Cunningham, Sara Cozad, Matt Brooks, Christine Kerl, Steve McCaffrey, and Mary Kay Hudson. The Advisory Council members also discussed treatment services in jail, and policy considerations on how to provide programming through Recovery Works. As a result of this discussion, Jane Seigel asked the care coordination workgroup to also look at the issue of jail treatment services. 7. Legislative Update. Larry Landis reported that the legislative committee met recently and distributed a handout with two proposed statutory amendments. The first proposed amendment would add misdemeanors to IC 12-23-19-1 on mental health and addiction forensic treatment services and the second proposed amendment would clarify IC 35-38-3-3(d) on commitment of Level 6 felons to DOC. Mr. Landis also reported that the committee has discussed the legislature's 2015 repeal of the county misdemeanant fund. Kristin Rivera from the Indiana Senate stated that the repeal was unintentional and that it was added back in during the 2016 session in HEA 1290 (p. 39, \u00a729). Ms. Seigel asked the Advisory Council members to review the proposed statutory amendments and be prepared to discuss at the June meeting. David Powell reported that the committee did not prepare an advisory opinion on IC 35-38-3-3 because the members do not think they have authority to prepare such an opinion. 8. Next meeting. Jane Seigel announced that the Advisory Council will meet on June 20, 2016 at 10:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. at the Indiana Judicial Center.

I understand the numbers were revised by the FSSA's Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning, with assistance from an outside consultant. In a nutshell, from the attached report, it looks like hourly reimbursements will decline by the following amounts: Registered nurse: $38.50 (down 8.4 percent) Licensed practical nurse: $25.63 (down 5 percent) Home health aide: $16.85 (down 7.9 percent) Physical therapist: $16.35 (down 3.4 percent) Occupational therapist: $15.67 (down 6 percent) Speech pathologist: $17.93 (down 1.2 percent) I hope you can answer a few questions: 1) Are these numbers correct? 2) Why are the reimbursement rates going down? 3) Agencies say this will make it difficult to retain workers, especially nurses, in the face of a nursing shortage. Are you concerned about a compromise in care if agencies can't attract and retain enough nurses to provide home health care? 4) What did Indiana (and/or Medicaid) pay for home health care services last year? How much has this expenses changed over the past five years? 5) How many agencies are certified to provide home health care services in Indiana? I know this is a bit of a rush, but my deadline is 3 p.m. today to include your information and comments. Please let me know if you have any questions. Many thanks.

For SFY 2006, the overhead rate de creased 18% and the RN rate decreased 5%, the LPN and Therapy rates increased a nd the Home Health Ai de rate decreased slightly. The decreases were the result of the methodology utilized at the time to compute the arrays. Under that methodology, th e arrays were weighted by Medicaid utilization and the median costs were determin ed based on the weighting. This resulted in a few large agencies' costs establishing the ra tes. The OMPP determined that those rate decreases would not be implemented and the prior year's (SFY 2005) home health Medicaid rates would remain in effect for SFY 2006 and SFY 2007 while a revised reimbursement methodology was developed. An in flation adjustment was applied to the SFY 2005 Medicaid home health rates to establish the SFY 2008 Medicaid home health rates. The revised home health reimbursement methodology no longer used Medicaid utilization to weight the a rrays and established the rate s at 95% of the un-weighted medians. This revised methodology was im plemented for SFY 2009 and resulted in significant Medicaid home hea lth rate increases ranging fr om 1% to 33% for SFY 2009. During SFY 2010 the OMPP promulgated an emergency rule (LSA Document # 10- 187(E)) to avoid an anticipated budgetary shor tfall and to remain within the available Medicaid appropriation. The result was a 5% re duction in the Medicaid home health rates effective April 1, 2010. LSA Document #11-381 (E) extended this 5% rate reduction through December 31, 2013 where it changed to a 3% rate reduction effective January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014. LSA Document #1 3-422(F) extends the 3% rate reduction through June 30, 2015. LSA Document #15-34(F) extends the 3% rate reduction through June 30, 2017. Overview of SFY 2017 HHA Rates and Utilization: When comparing the HHA Rates for SFY 2016 to the HHA Rates SFY 2017, staffing rates remained relatively consistent with Re gistered Nurse decreas ing the most at 8.42% and Overhead rate increasi ng the most at .67%. The number of home health agency cost repo rts included in the arrays increased from 194 for SFY 2016 to 205 for SFY 2017. Prepared by Myers and Stauffer LC March 31, 2016 Indiana Family and Social Services Administration Summary Description of Rate Methodology SFY 2017 Home Health Agency Rates Cost Report Review Annual Medicaid cost reports are submitted by Medicaid certified hom e health agencies to Myers and Stauffer. Myers and Stauffer pe rforms desk reviews on these cost reports. As part of the desk review, Myers and Stau ffer ensures that all information reported on the cost report appears reas onable and is consistent with the Medicare cost report information, if the provider is Medicare certif ied, or the provider's financial statement information, if the provider is not Medicare certified. In determining the reasonableness of the cost report information, Myers and Stauffe r ensures that all disciplines with visits reported also have salaries, hours, and total costs reported. Total costs should generally be a function of the number of home health visi ts. For example, if total visits increase from the prior year, one would expect total costs to also increase. In addition, the calculated hourly staffing rates are reviewed for reasonableness compared to the prior year rates, industry averages, and above mi nimum wage. For example, an RN hourly staffing rate would normally be between a bout $30-$50 per hour. If the information reported on the Medicaid cost report does not appear reasonable or correct, Myers and Stauffer will write back to the provider requ esting corrected information or clarification about items on the cost report. If no resolution from provider, an adjustment was made to agree staffing rate to minimum wage. The cost reports included in the arrays for the SFY 2017 rates are for fiscal years ended April 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015. The most recently available cost reports are utilized each year to set the HHA Medicaid rates. Home health rate changes were effective January 1 of each year prior to LSA #07-31(F), which took effect July 1, 2008. Home health cost reports are due 150 days following the agencies' fiscal year end pursuant to 405 IAC 1-4.2. Therefore, cost re ports for fiscal year ends March 31, 2015 would be due at the end of August 2015. This wa s the latest that co st reports could be received to be included in rate arrays effective July 1, 2016 and allow adequate time for review of the data. Field Compliance Reviews and Expanded Reviews There are three levels of review that may be performed on home health cost reports: desk reviews, enhanced desk reviews, and field co mpliance reviews. A desk review is the first level of review. Desk reviews focus on revi ewing the cost report for reasonableness and consistency with reporting requirements and tr acing costs, visits, and hours from the Medicaid cost report to the agency's Medi care cost report or financial statements. Enhanced desk reviews are an expanded desk review and include desk review procedures and additional procedures to trace costs, visits and hours to documentation such as payroll journals, 941s, trial balances, and visi t detail. Field complian ce reviews are actual Prepared by Myers and Stauffer LC March 31, 2016 visits to the agencies to verify the cost re port data to the accounting records and source documentation. Desk reviews were performed on 206 cost repo rts, 205 of which are included in the SFY 2017 arrays. Additionally, 5 field compliance reviews and 13 enhanced desk reviews were performed on these cost reports. All ad justments made during the field compliance reviews and enhanced desk reviews are incorporated into each provider's cost calculations included in the arrays. Findi ngs for the field compliance reviews and enhanced desk reviews have been reported to the OMPP and providers under separate reports. Rate Calculations Following the cost report desk review, hour ly staffing rates are determined for the following disciplines: RN, LPN, Home Hea lth Aide, Physical Th erapist, Occupational Therapist, and Speech Pathologist. Thes e staffing rates are calculated by dividing Salaries plus Benefits plus a Semi-Variabl e Cost allocation by Hours Worked. The Semi- Variable Costs include direct supervisors' salaries, routine non-billable medical supplies and direct care tr ansportation costs. Based on the desk review, an overhead cost per visit is also computed for each provider. The overhead rate is calculated by dividing to tal allowable costs less all salary, benefit, and semi-variable costs by th e total number of visits. Per 405 IAC 1-4.2, each provider's hourly sta ffing rate for each discipline and overhead rate are arrayed high to low. Each provider's historical costs in the arrays are inflated from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the expected rate period, using the CMS Home Health Agency Market Basket indices publis hed in the Fourth- quarter 2015 IHS Economics Healthcare Cost Revi ew. From this array, a median rate for each staffing discipline and overhead is calcul ated. For an even number of rates, the median is calculated by dividing the middl e two rates by two. Per 405 IAC 1-4.2, the statewide rates for Medicaid home health agen cies are calculated as 95% of the median rate. The statewide Medicaid home health agency rates are effective July 1 and remain in effect for the entire state fiscal year. OMPP intends to extend the three percent (3%) rate reduction pursuant to LSA #15- 34(F) through June 30, 2017.

Prepared by Myers and Stauffer LC March 31, 2016 The utilization of Home Health services has been increasing as shown below: SFY 2014 SFY 2015 Discipline Units of Service Units of Service Difference % Change 17.4% SFY 2013 SFY 2014 Discipline Units of Service Units of Service Difference % Change change in utilization, the esti mated fiscal impact of the SFY 2017 home health rate changes is ($14,854,124). Th is implies that ($14,854,124) of the ($17,487,112) total fiscal impact for SFY 2017 is due to the rate changes. The average inflated staffing costs per hour in cluded in the arrays have decreased over the past year. The average overhead cost per visit has increased over the past year. These changes in average inflated costs are shown below: Change in Average Inflated Cost Discipline SFY 2016 SFY 2017 Difference % Change Overhead $ 40.51 $ 42.38 $ 1.87 4.61% Registered Nurse $ 51.05 $ 43.87 $ (7.18) -14.06% Licensed Practical Nurse $ 31.72 $ 30.71 $ (1.01) -3.19% Home Health Aide $ 22.74 $ 20.32 $ (2.42) -10.66% Physical Therapist $ 79.83 $ 73.90 $ (5.94) -7.43% Occupational Therapist $ 83.40 $ 73.62 $ (9.78) -11.73% Speech Pathologist $ 84.19 $ 76.49 $ (7.70) -9.15% Prepared by Myers and Stauffer LC March 31, 2016 The number of home health agencies whose data is included in the arrays has increased over the past year except for Physical Th erapist and Occupational Therapist as shown below: Change in Number of Agencies Discipline SFY 2016 SFY 2017 Difference % Change Overhead 193 203 10 5.18% Registered Nurse 193 198 5 2.59% Licensed Practical Nurse 137 138 1 0.73% Home Health Aide 188 192 4 2.13% Physical Therapist 145 139 (6) -4.14% Occupational Therapist 130 128 (2) -1.54% Speech Pathologist 103 107 4 3.88% Conclusion There are many factors that can influen ce results produced by a reimbursement methodology that is based on median costs. Due to interrelationships that exist between many of these factors, it is not feasible to isolate and explain precise causes for changes in the arrays from year to year. Based on the above analysis, the SFY 2017 Medicaid Home Health rate chan ges appear reasonable. Prepared by Myers and Stauffer LC March 31, 2016 Indiana Family and Social Services Administration Provider Summary SFY 2017 Home Health Agency Rates High Calculated Staffing Hourly Rates and Overhead Rates For calculated staffing hourly rates and ove rhead rates in excess of $100, we have reviewed and determined that all providers included in each arrays are appropriately included. Although some rates appear reasonabl y high, in determini ng the reasonableness of the cost report information, Myers and St auffer ensures that all information reported on the cost report appears reasonable and is c onsistent with the Me dicare cost report information, if the provider is Medicare certif ied, or the provider's financial statement information, if the provider is not Medicare certified. Myers and Stauffer has inquired to providers requesting supporting documentati on, clarification, and re presentation on noted issues within the desk reviews. Providers Excluded From the Arrays During completion of the desk reviews, various issues were discovered with submitted cost reports for the following agencies. As discussed with OMPP and approved prior to completion of the arrays, these agencies we re excluded in all or part of the array calculations. All Arrays ~ 201060380-Attentive Home Healthcare Agency is reporting estimated st atistical and financial data on the cost report. The agency has represented that they did not track actua l data related to th e 2014 cost report being used in these arrays. The have started appropriately tracki ng for the 2015 cost report. As such, the agency was excluded from All Arrays. All Staffing Arrays ~ 201190850-1st Opti on Adult Day & Home Health; 200955970-American Choice Home Health Care; 201050820-Foster Healthcare Agencies are paying disciplines per visit and therefore have represen ted that they do not track actual hours worked (productive or nonpr oductive). As hours are the basis for the calculation of the staffing a rray and actual hours are not be ing tracked these agencies were excluded from All Staffing Arrays. Prepared by Myers and Stauffer LC March 31, 2016 All Staffing Arrays ~ 200121810-Community Home Health Care; 200009300-Home Health of St. Mary; 20094590-Home Health of St. Catharine's; 100265450-Physicians Home Care Agencies are tracking only productive hours (t ime spent performing visit) as they pay by visit. Additional time spent on charting, travel , etc. (non-productive hours) is not tracked. This was discovered during the desk reviews re lated to an inquiry of an excessively high staffing rate / hour. As hours ar e the basis for the calculation of the staffing arrays and the agencies have represented that non-productive hours are not tracked, these agencies were excluded from the All Staffing Arrays. PT, OT, & SP Staffing Arrays ~ 1002 73050-The for Pallative Care; 201081670- 200951600-Bette r Health Care; 100265830- Intrepid of Indiana, Inc; 200008340-Franciscan Home Care Agencies are reporting visits equal to tota l hours worked for contracted personnel (PT, OT, and SP). The agencies have represented th at they are assuming one visit equals one hour and therefore not tracking actual hours worked (productive or nonproductive) and billing one hour per visit. As hours are the basis for the calculation of the staffing array and actual hours are not being tracked these agencies were excluded from PT, OT, & SP Staffing Arrays as this only appl ied to the contracted services Overhead Array ~ 201005960-Loving Care Agency; 201134760-Citi Home Care Services Agencies are tracking only hours worked and no t visits performed. As total visits are the basis for the calculation of th e overhead array and the agencies are not tracking the visit encounters, these agencies were excluded from the Overhead Array.

EBDM Phase V state teams are eligible to apply provided their application is accompanied by a minimum of three EBDM Phase V local team applications . It is expected that states will solicit application s from interested local teams and submit the state and local applications as a single package. NUMBER OF SITES TO BE SELECTED NIC will select one or more EBDM states to advance to Phase VI. NIC will also select three or more local EBDM teams to advance to Phase VI along with their state team. The final number of teams selected to advance to Phase VI will be dependent on the strength of the applications received in combination with the availab le resources . GOALS OF PHASE VI The goal of Phase VI of the Evidence -Based Decision Making in State and Local Criminal Justice Systems Initiative (EBDM) is to provide ongoing support to state and local EBDM teams as they advance their work around buildi ng justice systems that align with the four EBDM principles. More specifically, Phase VI is designed to provide support to EBDM teams as they implement the change targets identified during Phase V. Other goals include supporting teams to : Deepen the level of collaboration among policy team members ; Use research, data, and information to inform and align decision making at the system, agency , and case levels ; Further engage colleagues, peers, decision makers, staff , and partners in advancing EBDM ; Implement specific, consensus -driven strategies designed to advance evidence -based decision making ; Strengthen state -local partnerships in furtherance of building justice systems at the state and local level s that embrace the EBDM framework as their model for justice system improvement ; and Proactively engage community stakeholders in advancing EBDM. 2 COORDINATION OF STATE AND LOCAL APPLICATIONS In the Phase V application process, the state's EBDM representatives (i.e., the Phase IV team) were asked to identify and select up to six local teams to partner with the state team in the Phase V application. This application process differs in important ways. The following describes the key components of the Phase VI application process : Participatin g state and local teams should make independent decisions about whether it is desired and advantageous for them to move forward to Phase VI in the EBDM Initiative . If the state team chooses not to submit a Phase VI application, the local teams within that state are not eligible to submit applications. If the state team chooses to submit a Phase VI application , it must be accompanied by applications from at least three Phase V EBDM local teams. Phase V EBDM state teams should submit an application from the s tate team and applications from local teams (i.e., 3-6 local teams) as one package. The state team is not expected to choose from among the local applications nor is it expected to rank order the local applications. Instead, the NIC review team will asses s the package of applications as a whole, and each individual application , based upon their individual merits . If NIC selects the state to advance to Phase VI, NIC may select all applying local teams from within the state, or choose from among them. The ultimate decision regarding the makeup of the state and local partnership to advance to Phase VI lies with NIC. In addition, unlike Phase V, in which EBDM Phase II/III sites were not eligible to apply to be a part of the state's application package, in Pha se VI , NIC welcomes applications for participation from the Phase II/III teams. The application requirements are different for these teams and are described more thoroughly below. APPLICATION SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCESS Applications will be carefully considered on a competitive basis by a review team comprised of NIC staff, as well as others who may be determined by NIC. Applicants should submit their applications electronically in PDF format. Applications should be submitted to Rachelle Ramirez, Program Associate for the Center for Effective Public Policy, at rramirez@cepp.com . Questions about the applicat ion, the application and selection process, and/or application submission should also be directed to Ms. Ramirez at rramirez@cepp.com or 301 -589-9383. Applications must be received by 12:00 pm EST Friday, July 29, 2016. Please request a \"read receipt\" to confirm that your application has been received. Ms. Ramirez will also confirm receipt of applications, via direct email to the individual submitting the application, upon its receipt. A review of the submitted applications will be conducte d in August , and applicants will be notified of the final selection on a date yet to be determined in September 2016. 3 APPLICATION ELEMENTS AND POINT DISTRIBUTION The following is a summary of the elements of the Phase VI application and the point distribution: Section Page Limit Maximum Points Part I: Cover letter 5 pages maximum; d oes not count toward s page limit Required ; no points Part II: Statewide Collaboration and Expansion of EBDM (STATE TEAM ONLY) 3 pages maximum 10 points Part III: Phase II/III Site Partnership 3 pages maximum 5 points Part IV: Collaboration 5 pages maximum , plus 1 -page list of team members, plus stakeholder letters 20 points Part V: Description of Phase V Accomplishments 5 pages maximum , plus work sample 15 points Part VI: Phase VI Implementation Plans Logic model and work plan ; does not count toward s page limit 25 points Part VII: Harm Reduction Goals, Scorecard, and Communications Strategy 5 pages maximum , plus scorecard 20 points Part VIII: Description of Phase VI Expectations 1 page maximum 5 points 22 pages ( state team s) and 19 pages ( local teams) of narrative 100 points for state team applications 90 points for local team applications In summa ry, state applications should not exceed 22 pages (for a possible maximum of 100 points) and local team applications should not exceed 19 pages (for a possible maximum of 90 points) , excluding the cover letter, list of team members, letters from stakeholders , sample work product, logic model, work plan, and scorecard .

Determine next steps Agenda 1. Welcome and review meeting goals Justice David called the meeting to order at 1:30 pm. Members in attendance were: Jenny Bauer, Indiana Judicial Center George Brenner, LCSW Andrew Cullen, United Way of Central Indiana Chris Cunningham, Grant Correctional Services Steve Creason, Office of the Indiana Attorney General Andrew Falk, Sagamore Institute Michelle Goodman, Indiana Judicial Center Mary Kay Hudson, Indiana Judicial Center Larry Landis, Public Defender Council Derrick Mason, Division of State Court Administration Cindy McCoy, Grant Correctional Services Dan Miller, Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council David Murtaugh, Indiana Criminal Justice Institute David Powell, Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council, Vice-Chair Jane Seigel, Indiana Judicial Center Judge Mark Spitzer, Grant Circuit Court Lisa Thompson, Trial Court Technology Dave Williams, Trial Court Technology Note: Mimi Carter was not present for this meeting. 2. Debrief of March 4, 2016 local and state team meeting Reactions to local presentations - Members discussed that the presentations were consistent with the state team change targets. All local teams have selected pretrial as a change target. See meeting handout (EBDM State and Local Team Meeting - March 4, 2016) for a summary of the local change targets by county, Phase VI application/selection process - Mary Kay Hudson will draft a letter for Justice David and David Powell signature thanking the counties for their participation, encouraging them to seek state team support if needed and asking the counties to advise the state team by April 15 whether they intend to apply for Phase VI. The letter will be on Indiana EBDM Policy Team letterhead. Mary Kay and Cindy will scheduled a conference call with the local TA providers for their input in the site's readiness for Phase VI. NIC will require at least three sites to apply with the state for Phase VI. Mary Kay will check with Mimi regarding whether the state or NIC makes the final determination on the local sites. Members discussed the importance of developing capacity to work with other counties across the state. If Indiana is not selected for Phase VI, members discussed seeking other funds and using the capacity builders to expand to other sites. Members created a subcommittee to communicate with the local sites. Members include Steve Creason, Mary Kay Hudson, Cindy McCoy, IPAC and Larry Landis. Mary Kay Hudson reported that the NIC will host a webinar on the Phase VI application process. 3. Work group report-outs and work group process discussion Data (David Murtaugh and Lisa Thompson, Co-Chairs) Lisa Thompson reported that the group is initially focusing on improving the quality of criminal history because it effects so much of the other processes. The data group has joined with the Indiana State Police initiative. ISP has funding for some aspects of the project and other aspects they are seeking funding for. Lisa reported the group may need some direction generally and regarding when do they start looking at data and pulling data. The data group has discussed looking at larger data collection issues (for example, jail data and community corrections access to Odyssey. The Justice Reinvestment Advisory Council and the Indiana Criminal Justice institute is identifying data for the HEA 1006 reporting requirements. Members discussed at length the need to incorporate research and evaluation into the change targets so that the team can measure change and outcomes. Members agreed that the data work group will now be the data and evaluation work group. Dave Murtaugh advised the members of ICJI staff and Sagamore Institute (Andrew Falk) are members of the work group and can assist with the evaluation piece. Professional Development (Jane Seigel and Julie Lanham, Co-Chairs) Jane Seigel reported that the professional development group is inventorying the training available and by whom. Work group members DOC and other state agencies about their training schedules and topics. Jane would like for the state team to take the EBP survey for the next meeting. Judge Spitzer reported that he is presenting on Judicial Leadership at the Spring Judicial College and will include EBDM in his presentation. Angie Hensley will send Judge Spitzer information on the evidence based practice training IJC is proving to community supervision. Pretrial (Larry Landis and Judge John Surbeck, Co-Chairs) Judge Surbeck attended the March 4 meeting and will work with Larry to direct the EBDM pretrial change target and the pretrial pilot project. Jenny Bauer reported on her attendance at the NIC Pretrial Executive Training. The training emphasized that pretrial supervision cannot be probation officers and that the purpose of pretrial is to have them return to court v. to \"fix\" people. Jenny suggested that members of pretrial work group attend the training if possible. Jenny reported that New Mexico recently adopted a constitutional amendment to permit preventive detention. Mental Health (George Brenner and Sara Cozad, Co-Chairs) George Brenner reported the group is identifying the continuum of care and concerned about the providers' readiness to serve the population. There is a widespread lack of access to services and payer sources. George stated that the treatment evidence based practices must align with the criminal justice evidence based practices and criminogenic need. George reported that the Office of Medical Planning has decided to let LCACs be reimbursable under Medicaid, although he is not sure when it is effective. As a result, LCACs should also be billable under HIP 2.0. George reported that the mental health group also has corrections in their group and they are looking at Crisis Intervention Teams, Immediate Detention and Emergency Detention opportunities. The group has worked through steps 3 and 4 and now are at step 5 to identify the treatment gaps. George reported they need to survey the treatment providers on what services they are offering and what number are criminal justice referrals. This survey will be the initial baseline data. Larry Landis asked if the mental health courts can refer directly to an LCAC. George advised him that some licensed providers do not have the ability to bill Medicaid and the agency still has to be certified to provide addictions treatment services. Behavioral Responses (Chris Cunningham and Jenny Bauer, Co-Chairs) Jenny Bauer reported that the work group has talked a lot about data collection and professional development. The group has started working on their logic model and are working through the work group steps. Andrew Cullen volunteered to serve on this work group. Jenny reported the work group has talked about requesting technical assistance on what data is needed to measure outcomes. Jenney reported that the work group will do a survey of probation, parole and community corrections regarding data collection practices. Dave Powell ask if they are willing to survey the jails and Jenny agreed to include the jails. Risk Reduction Strategies (Dan Miller and Mary Kay Hudson, Co-Chairs) Mary Kay Hudson reported the work group met this morning and reviewed the work group document provided to the group (See Risk Reduction Strategies Work Group DRAFT 03/07/2016) . The work group reviewed each decision point's \"what should happen\" and \"opportunities\" identified on the EBDM decision point narrative for each decision point. The work group began to assign each area to a work group and identified which NIC Principle of Effective Intervention it was connected with. The work group will finish assigning each area to work groups and will reformat the document in a spreadsheet color coded by work group. All of the work groups may use this as a reference to inform their work group activities and logic models. Mary Kay Hudson will distribute a revised document to all team members when it is complete. 4. Discussion: Indiana's EBDM scorecard Members briefly discussed the need to identify what the team wants to report to the public, legislature or governor's office in one, two, three and five years. The data, research and evaluation team can be active in developing the scorecard to identify our indicators of success. Members will continue this discussion with Mimi Carter during the April 18 meeting. 5. Legislative Update George Brenner previously reported that Medicaid rule change that LCACs will be billable. There was no additional legislative update. Dave Powell recommend that we all get on one page about what funding is needed across agencies. Members discussed that DOC will report there have not been any 1006 savings to report and that the group needs to explore funding sources outside of the executive branch or transferring oversight of DOC facilities to DMHA for inpatient treatment. 6. Adjourn Justice David adjourned the meeting at 4:30 pm. Next Meeting Dates: April 18, 2016 9:00 am - 3:00 pm at IJC May 9, 2016 9:00 am - 3:00 pm at IJC June 22, 2016 9:00 am - 3:00 pm at IJC Scott.A.Milkey From: Gilson, Katie Sent: A2016nl17.pdf Katie Gilson, Staff of Pence KGilson@gov.in.gov Phone: (317) 232-1198 Fax: 317/817-9997 FAX 317/817-9998 04/18/16 Volume 28, No. 17 What you may see for IURC Recent history portends a legislative pick for this Democratic seat With Carolene Mays-Medley leaving the her post on th e Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to lead the White River State P ark Commission, the Governor has a Democratic appointment to make to th e IURC . . . and her departure also leaves the Commission devoid of form er legislators \u2014 a stock from which governors of both parties have selected f rom in recent decades (Monk, Duvall, McCarty, Server, Atterholt, Mays, to name j ust a few). With the recent pushback against trackers as the uti lity equivalent of an automatic tax increase, having a former lawmaker se rve on the panel could also help members be a bit more sensitive to the polit ical (with a small \"P\") implications of those types of scenarios on a commi ssion that is now home to no former elected officials. The first order of business, however: finding a new ch air for the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission Nominating Commission, as Gwen Horth is now serving as chair of the Indiana Parole Board. Assuming the Governor (and chief of staff Jim Atterho lt, a former IURC chair) decide to reach out for a legislative Democr at, they could perhaps look to persuade Rep. Christina Hale (D) to interrupt her promising elective career (and open a marginal seat) and apply, but Rep. Hale i s viewed as a potential 2016 lieutenant governor candidate, and may look instea d in that direction rather than continue her bipartisan legislative work on energy issues in a new forum. Former Rep. Win Moses (D), a former utility committee chair is another obvious choice \u2014 but not necessarily for a Republican g overnor \u2014 and his work in founding the Citizens Action Coalition may prove to be too much of a potential conflict. Still, he's someone who would i nterview well with the nominating commission (in fact, he's a member of tha t very panel, and would presumably have to step down to apply), and would pas s muster with organized labor representatives. Former Rep. Jeb Bardon (D) of Indianapolis, who serve d in the House with Atterholt, is the kind of \"reasonable\" Democrat who s hould be acceptable to the folks in 206, even though he didn't focus on energy issues. One who did deal with utility matters is former Rep. Kreg Battles (D) of Vincennes (you'll begin to notice a pattern here), a moderate now serv ing on the Indiana Charter School Board, who worked closely with Rep. Eric Koch (R) (and other Republicans) on energy issues during his tenure as vi ce chair of the Committee on Commerce, Energy, Technology & Utilities. Organized labor may push for one of its own, former Rep. Russ Stilwell (D) of Boonville. Long associated with the United Mine Workers, he and the Pence Administration (and electric utilities) might find s ignificant common ground on coal issues. Former Rep. Mike Dvorak (D) of South Bend, who didn't seek re-election after several terms as St. Joseph County prosecutor, could be interested and would be an interesting out-of-the box c hoice . . . particularly with his son, Rep. Ryan Dvorak (D), leading House D e nvironmental efforts. Another name that has popped up on the radar screen: former Rep. Bob Kuzman (D), whose ties to Lake County industry may be just as important as his current work as the Central Region customer affa irs director for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). For more, please see the following page . . . Weighty issue for truckers Ag, heavy industry unite vs. new BMV reg The Bureau of Motor Vehicles encounters some significant industry pushback against a new regulation that quietly became effective on January 1. Seeking to improve the safety of the Hoosier populace traveling on Indiana roads, BMV promulgated an increased point value for commercial motor vehicle weight violations that was implemented at the beginning of the year. Until 2016, no points against an individual's driving record were assessed to a driver cited for a non-permitted overweight commercial motor vehicle. The new penalty, however, assigns four points to the truck driver's motor vehicle record, the same amount as for a violation for driving 16 \u2014 25 MPH over the speed limit. This is a major burden to a driver trying to maintain a clean Commercial Driver's License record. Commercial trucking and agricultural interests also express concern because weight limits may vary based upon state or local routes, the number of axles on a given vehicle, or by type of special permits. The Indiana Farm Bureau, in particular, is in arms because what it refers to as \"a recent unexpected change\" in federal law also means that vehicles carrying fluid milk products are non-divisible loads. As a result, the Indian Department of Transportation is no longer able to issue overweight commodity permits for these vehicles. Vehicles carrying fluid milk products with a gross vehicle weight greater than 80,000 pounds must obtain standard overweight permits for travel in Indiana (the load characteristics may also require the vehicle to be permitted as oversize). Indiana Farm Bureau, some major industrial producers in Northwest Indiana who must truck in and out heavy loads, and other industry partners and the trucking industry are combining forces to try to amend the point value back to the previous standard of zero points for a violation. Expect lawmakers to catch an earful from constituents about the change in the point regulations as they campaign in the primary and general elections . . . and to pass along their own concerns. April 18, 2016/2 Given the lack of representation on the Commission from Southwestern Indiana (the theme re-emerges!), home t o coal mines, and many electric plants and proposed projec ts, the Guv may look to encourage an application from any o ne of four moderate former Democratic senators: Bob Deig (D) of Posey County; Mark Blade (D) of Terre Haute; Lindel H ume (D) of Princeton; or Maurice Doll (D) of Vincennes (who also practices law in Newburgh). There also seems to be talk of former IURC commission er Jeff Golc, who served on the Indianapolis-Marion County C ity- County Council and was a deputy commissioner for bot h the Department of Workforce Development and the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, being a potential pick, and there is precedent for appointments to interrupted terms. A pair of former IURC executive directors might also be interested in returning. Some may want to see either of two people close to the expected Democratic gubernatoria l nominee apply for the post. One is a former Democra tic House member from Southwest Indiana who could be draf ted to leave the lobby after 25 years, while the other is a statewide office nominee from the 1990s with strong military expe rience. You may look at a small pool of former Democratic m ayors, or perhaps a policy wonk like Mike Claytor, the for mer deputy state examiner who was the 2014 Democratic nomi nee for state auditor. Another name bandied about: former ProLiance Energy governmental and community affairs leader Tom Morton, a Southwest Indiana native with lengthy local government and legislative experience. While it may not seem so at a glance, there may be a potentially large field of Democrats interested, al though many may be turned off by having to formally indicate thei r intentions and potentially offend a current employe r by going through the nominating commission process (vs. a str aight gubernatorial appointment, as with a traditional age ncy director post) . . . and for former lawmakers or state staffers who are now in more lucrative positions, the potent ial boost to state pension payments from a larger end-of-tenure salary may be too sweet a deal to pass up. And one final thought: while the Commission has seem ed to concentrate on electric utility rate and generating plant construction issues in recent years, that emphasis may see a change as concerns grow about aging pipelines (among other older infrastructure); lead water pipes; decommissi oning of facilities and attendant issues like coal-ash ponds ; and cyber- and physical security threats to utilities \u2014 the la tter a top priority of departing Commissioner Mays-Medley in na tional regulatory community circles. This generational change in priorities (recall how few years ago the hot-button issues of local measured service and lifeline service in land-line telephone rate deliberations dom inated Commission attemtion and resources) may cause the nominating panel to look differently at who it migh t want to serve on the Commission. IN Politics Federal Office Races . . . ! The U.S. Senate race parrying continues between U.S. Re ps. Marlin Stutzman (R) and Todd Young (R) and you should expect polling late this week to show about one-third of likely GOPrimary voters \u2014 as if any pollster could really figure out who is likely to vote this year \u2014 calling themselve s \"undecided\"). In an email seeking campaign cash, Rep. Stutzman con tinues to separate himself from Senate Republican leadership, d espite seeking to become a Republican in that body. He writes, \"Hoosiers are facing one of the biggest showdowns bet ween the establishment and the grassroots in some time! Mitch McConnell is publicly backing Todd Young. This news has ticked off conservatives in Indiana big time!! The p olitical establishment has now spoken. I'm asking that all Ho osiers stick to their values and understand what is happen ing. The DC establishment thinks that they can buy your vote. They have chosen Todd Young to play as their puppet in this u pcoming election. It is now up to you and I to defeat them. Now more than ever Hoosiers must unite together to defeat th e political establishment [and] defeat establishment pick Todd Yo ung.\" In a follow-up email, Rep. Stutzman adds, \"I know what M itch McConnell is up to. He plans to elect Todd Young an d use him to vote for all of his terrible bills that he knows I would not vote for.\" Rep. Young has had his own televison spot in heavy rotation that criticizes Rep. Stutzman for a series of actions that question his conservative credentials, including ha ving been \"a career politician\" since he was just 26 years old; l eaving Indiana to move to a large home near D.C. after promising not to; pocketing almost $1 million in federal subsidies that he claims to oppose; voting to practically double his pay when in the Indiana General Assembly; and voting for the largest tax hike on business in history. Internet ads serve to reinfor ce the broadcast message. A new Stutzman spot debuted Friday t elling voters \"Say no to Congressman Young. We don't need another sellout in Washington\" . . . the Indiana Right to Life Political Action Committee endorses both Reps. Stutzman and Youn g in the Senate . . . Rep. Stutzman picks up endorsemen ts from U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) \u2014 who is causing grumbling by making waves of his own in seeking a seat at the Se nate GOP leadership table and undercutting Leader McConnell w ith the Stutzman nod \u2014 and from former presidential candid ate Carly Fiorina (R). The former HP exec says that \"As a farmer, Marl in ... understands how incompetent government bureaucracy destroys jobs and crushes family-owned businesses. A ti reless fighter for the Constitution and the rights of the unborn, Marlin is an unapologetic conservative \u2014 and isn't afraid to stand tough against the political class of both part ies when our values are under attack\" . . . the Stutzman Victory Fu nd files a federal termination report Wednesday, and Marlin PAC reports no Q1 contributions or receipts, and cash-on-hand of $11,085. ! Hoosiers for Common Sense is a new joint fundrais ing committee filed by Indiana Democrats late last week with the Federal Election Commission to allow Baron Hill for Indiana and the Indiana Democratic Congressional Victory Co mmittee to team up to raise cash. Sherrianne Standley is the treasurer. Copying, FAXing, or e-mailing without written publisher's permission violates federal law! INDIANA DAILY INSIGHT www.ingrouponline.com April 18, 2016/3 ! At a time when we're widely led to believe that Hoo siers are fed up with federal regulations, and, in particular , are not pleased with proposed U.S. Environmental Protection Ag ency clean air rules that would impact coal-powered elect ric plants and raise utility rates, former U.S. Rep. Baron Hill (D) takes a contrary stance \u2014 and seems to even double down o n it in advance of Earth Day. In not just one \u2014 but a pair of email fundraising missives for his U.S. Senate campaign \u2014 Hill reminds supporters that \"our country has stalled on climate action -- because, surprise, extremists in Congress c ontinue to be a roadblock. In fact, most GOP members deny that cl imate change is caused by humans, despite the agreement of nearly every climate scientist, NASA, and the U.S. military on this point. True to form, my right-wing opponents have vot ed repeatedly against taking action on the climate. Thi s is the height of irresponsibility. The longer we fail to ac t on climate change, the more dangerous it becomes for our future . I want to leave my children and grandchildren a world they can live in.\" He plans to use the campaign to point out that \"Republicans in Congress [need to] to stop denying cl imate science and act on climate change,\" writing that \"we deserve elected officials who respect scientific consensus and are honest about the evidence that humans are changing o ur climate. If we're serious about protecting our count ry and our future, we need to take action on this immediately.\" ! The open seat CD 03 campaign of Dr. Pam Galloway (R) has only attracted $116,961 in contributions while still ow ing $200,000 to the candidate for loans. The campaign will show a $51,310 cash-on-hand balance as of March 31 . . . Indiana Farm Bureau ELECT, the political action committee assoc iated with Indiana Farm Bureau, has chosen not to endorse in the CD 03 primary, even with major agricultural entrepre neur Kip Tom (R), seventh-generation farmer, a candidate in the rac e. ! In CD 09, Indiana Jobs Now, the mysterious Super PAC with yet-to-be disclosed donors backing Trey Hollingswo rth (R) purports to have commissioned a National Research poll (03/23-23; 400 likely R primary voters; margin of error \u00b1 4.9%) that shows newcomer Hollingsworth, after several mo nths of unanswered television advertising, leading the five -candidate field with 28% of the vote over Attorney General Greg Zoeller (R) (whom the Super PAC has targeted with negative ad s) at 16%, and Sens. Erin Houchin (R) at nine percent and Brent Waltz (R) with eight percent lingering in the high single -digits, while the sole candidate from Monroe County, Tea Par ty- favored Bob Hall (R), tallies just three percent . . . Indiana Jobs Now makes a new independent expenditure under w hich it adds the Louisville television market to its fli ght of spots slamming General Zoeller for his squishiness on amn esty (at the same time as Hollingsworth spots trumpet the \"B uild a Wall\" message, screaming \"No Amnesty/No How/No Way\") . Disclosed late in the day on Saturday, April 9, the $121,091 expenditure brings the PAC's spending on behalf of Hollingsworth to $420,287 . . . \"This is not how Hoosier conservatives conduct themselves, though I wouldn't expect Trey to know that, given he only moved to Indiana a few months ago to try to buy this seat in Congress,\" Sen. Houchin said of the high-profile challenger, on top of earli er comments about funding for the newcomer's efforts. Add Sen. Walt z to the chorus of Hollingsworth criticism already voice d by the leading candidates. \"I frankly kind of resent the f act that he would come up here and just presume that out of the 740,000 Hoosiers that make up the Indiana ninth district th at none of us are capable of governing ourselves, and need him to help us out with that,\" a disappointed Sen. Waltz tells WXIN -TV Fox59 in Indianapolis. State Office Races . . . ! The March 31 $50,000 contribution to the Mike Pence Committee by the Republican Governors Association's po litical action committee was the sole RGA Right Direction PAC contribution to a candidate during the quarter, a fa ct into which you can read many things. The Barnes & Thornbur g Political Action Committee reported last week that i t had contributed $10,000 to RGA in February. ! Attorney General hopeful Curtis Hill (R) reports another $30,000 in large contributions on April 15. Legislative Races . . . ! With the challenger from the right finding little traction in his SD 16 face-off against Senate President Pro Tem David Long (R) (a common core mailer this month didn't generate much for him), brace yourself for the prospect of th e so-called \"bathroom\" issue being raised soon in paid media. ! Former Rep. Linda Henderson (D) signs on Ethan Horvath as her full-time campaign manager in open seat SD 44.

Casey Cox (D), a new dad who is beleaguered in part due to his role as father of HEA 1337-2016. IN Presidential Race . . . ! A POLITICO.com article on Saturday, April 9, generated lots of attention. \"Trump's getting trounced in Indiana,\" screamed the headline, which added, \"The state hasn't even vot ed and convention delegates are already lined up against t he front-runner.\" The article itself started by noting th at \"Indiana hasn't cast its ballots for president yet, but Donald Trump is already losing,\" as \"Republican Party insiders in the state\" select half (27) of the delegates to the Republican National Convention, and \"Trump is assured to be nearly shut out of support .... Anti-Trump sentiment runs hot among GOP leadership in Indiana, and it's driving a virulent rejection of the mogul among likely delegates.\" While the Indiana pro cess allows selection of a chunk of those who will serve as delegate before the primary or state convention, they will st ill be bound on the first ballot based upon primary results \u2014 so a ll this could be for naught . . . but are freed for a second ballot, an d Hoosier GOP insiders \"are working to engineer slates of del egates ... that will turn their backs on Trump\" if there is a second ballot or beyond in Cleveland. By Thursday, Hoosiers learned th at one of the delegates selected was Trump's Indiana chair , Rex Early . . . but the remainder of the delegate list read like a party insider who's who.

INDIANA DAILY INSIGHT www.ingrouponline.com April 18, 2016/4 Q The New York Times observed earlier this month that \"As Americans flock this year to outsider candidates, th ey are suddenly waking up to the reality that the process for picking the parties' nominees involves ordinary voters in o nly an indirect way,\" and this disconnect poses a risk for both parties and candidates who may not be the popular picks \u2014 as well as their benefactors. The POLITICO.com article led to as sorted emails to some \"party insiders\" in the article purp ortedly from anonymous Trump supporters that were written in a m anner that recipients took them as threats and turned the m over to (unimpressed) law enforcement authorities for inves tigation. Of course, in the general election setting \u2014 if not much, much earlier \u2014 the major parties must directly address u nhappy voters of all shapes and sizes (their own who see t heir parties being sidestepped \u2014 or sideswiped \u2014 by outsiders lik e Sanders or Trump, and those new to a party courtesy of the outsiders, but disillusioned by parties not accepting the will of the people). !

You may have thought that the litigation between t he Office of the Attorney General and Patriotic Veteran s, Inc. had long gone by the wayside after the last round effect ively won by the State of Indiana a few years ago, but Patriotic Veterans Inc. v. State of Indiana, et al. , No. 1:10-cv-723-WTL-MP is back. Q The controversy re-emerged this month in the form of an entry by Judge William T. Lawrence of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on the parties ' cross\u2014motions for summary judgment. Patriotic Veter ans, Inc., an Illinois-based political action committee, brought the current challenge to Indiana's Automated Dialing Mac hine Statute after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seven th Circuit ruled against the entity in a 2013 ruling that held In diana's law was not preempted by the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act. \"If the IADMS did not exist, the Plai ntiff has indicated that it would place automated phone calls related to its mission to Indiana Veterans and voters,\" Judge L awrence explains, but \"Attorney General Greg Zoeller has declined to exempt political calls from enforcement under the I ADMS2 and would seek fines and injunctive relief against the Plaintiff if it placed automated political calls to Indiana r esidents.\" Q In a 12-page ruling, Judge Lawrence grants summary judgment to the State, finding that Patriotic Veter ans, Inc. failed to show that its First Amendment rights were v iolated under the law. He finds that Indiana's autodial ban \"is content neutral and is a valid time, place, or manner restric tion on speech, and, accordingly, it does not violate the Fir st Amendment.\" The judge concludes that \"The IADMS is narrowly tailored to reach the Government's interes ts,\" and goes on to knock down the group's other arguments. \"Contrary to the Plaintiff's claim, the [Indiana law] does no t 'eliminate[ ] their ability to have a voice in the marketplace of ideas when elections, votes, or other dialogue of political im portance occurs,' \" Judge Lawrence writes. While Patriotic Vet erans complains that live operator calls may be as much as eight times more expensive \"and that calls cannot always be made fast enough for the messages to be delivered in the time allotted,\" the organization still \"has ample other means with which to deliver its message, including live telephone calls , consented to robocalls, radio and television advertising and inte rviews, debates, door-to-door visits, mailings, flyers, poster s, billboards, bumper stickers, e-mail, blogs, internet advertisement s, Twitter feeds, YouTube videos, and Facebook postings.

D uring the Copying, FAXing, or e-mailing without written publisher's permission violates federal law! INDIANA DAILY INSIGHT www.ingrouponline.com April 18, 2016/5 hearing, Sen. Coats observed that the IRS is ignoring notifications from the Social Security Administratio n that names and numbers do not match, and is processing ta x returns with false W-2 information, issuing \"refunds as if they were routine tax returns.\" Following the hearing, age ncy officials informed Sen. Coats that the IRS has chang ed its policy and will now notify victims of employment-rel ated identity theft. However, Sen. Coats said there are sti ll many other steps that need to be taken to fully protect v ictims . . . Sen. Coats Tuesday joined members of the Senate Comm ittee on Finance in a bipartisan call on U.S. Trade Represent ative Michael Froman and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker to work to address global overcapacities in steel, aluminum and other commodities and to ensure that t he nation's international trading partners are followi ng the rule of law. In a letter to the duo signed by just as man y Democrats as Republicans, the senators highlighted the challeng es of global overcapacity for American industries and marke ts and pressed the Obama Administration to enforce U.S. trade laws, including the bipartisan Customs legislation that wa s enacted into law earlier this year. \"Global overcapacities i n steel, aluminum, and other basic commodities are significan tly impacting global production, consumption, and trade flows of those products,\" wrote the senators. \"Much of this g lobal overcapacity stems from foreign government subsidies and other market-distorting policies that are creating c hallenges for companies and workers across the United States and abroad.\" The senators urged the Obama Administration to \"take all appropriate action to address global overcapacity an d related challenges. In particular, we urge you to accelerate efforts to address global overcapacity through multilateral and bilateral fora. We also urge you to enforce U.S. trade laws, i ncluding the recently enacted Trade Facilitation and Trade Enf orcement Act of 2015 and American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act\" . . . in his weekly \"Waste of the Week\" speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Coats highlighted documented abus e of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutriti on Assistance Program (SNAP), once referred to as the fo od stamp program. Sen. Coats said that a major vulnerability within SNAP is frequent requests for electronic benefits tra nsfer (EBT) card replacements. While some families simply lose the card and need a replacement, many individuals are r egularly placing multiple requests for new cards. The Govern ment Accountability Office (GAO) investigated this and both the timing of requests \u2014 such as when SNAP funds had been replenished \u2014 and the amount of replacement cards households requested, and found that in just three states selected for review that more than 7,500 households rec eiving SNAP benefits had suspicious transactions and were is sued four or more EBT cards in a year during key times, su ch as when cards were credited with benefits. These 7,500 households accounted for more than $26 million in sus picious transactions. \"Calculating the same proportion of S NAP households as the 7,500 identified by GAO across the coun try, the potential fraud amounts to roughly $3.2 billion in waste over 10 years.\" He cited clear cases of EBT fraud foun d on Craigslist, including the resale of an EBT card with $1,300 in benefits for $300 in which the seller stated, \"I have ar ound 1,300 in food stamps and have no need for it all.\" Coat s discussed another Craigslist example in which an in dividual stated that he or she would accept EBT cards as paym ents for Beyonc\u00e9 concert tickets. \"This kind of fraud is shameful,\" s aid Coats. \"This assistance should only go to those who absolutely need it, for its intended purpose. States are alrea dy required to track households that request four or more replacem ent EBT cards within a year. But if they adopt GAO's methodo logy of tracking both the number of recipients that receive f our or more EBT cards at specific times of the year and tho se with suspicious transactions, much of this abuse could be eliminated.\" ! U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D) spoke on the floor of the Senate Wednesday about the crisis facing America's steel ind ustry \u2014 \"a crisis more severe than the one experienced nearly two decades ago,\" he told his colleagues, and largely due to \"th e impact of illegally-traded steel flooding our market.\" Sen. Don nelly explained that \"Congress and the Obama Administration must work together to not only prevent further job losse s, but work to allow the steel industry to grow .... Strict enforc ement of the law is necessary to protect the domestic industry n ow and to deter bad actors from abusing the system in the futur e.\" He added that \"We must double-down on our efforts to com bat the illegally-traded steel coming into our markets.\" ! U.S. Sens. Dan Coats (R) and Joe Donnelly (D) team with U.S. Sens. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Gary Peters (D-MI) in a letter to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development asking HUD to adopt a new definition of recreation vehicles that is clear and easy to apply . Earlier this year, HUD published a proposed rule for public commen t that would revise the definition of an RV as \"designed on ly for recreational use and not as a primary residence or for permanent occupancy.\" This definition, which would re place an outdated one adopted more than three decades ago, wo uld ensure that RVs are not subject to \"a new policy that many stakeholders believed reversed 15 years of practice a nd changed how certain RVs are measured\" using manufactured hou sing regulations, and instead are treated as vehicles su bject to U.S. Department of Transportation regulations. In their letter, the four senators encourage HUD to adopt this proposed rule that would \"effectively make clear that the Office of Ma nufactured Housing (OMH) has no regulatory authority over RVs d ue to their exemption from the manufactured housing code,\" and do so without inappropriate regulation of fifth wheel or \"other forms of recreational vehicles.\" \"We strongly oppos e HUD's OMH exercising regulatory authority over Fifth Wheel RVs, or any RV .... Fifth Wheels are not permanent housing, and HUD should not create regulations that run counter to t his reality. We do not agree that Fifth Wheel vehicle trailers me et the statutory and regulatory definitions of a 'manufact ured home.' They are RVs and, like other RVs, should be excluded from HUD regulation\" . . . Sens. Coats and Donnelly also co llaborate on a letter to the chair of the Government Publishin g Office (GPO) Style Board, asking the panel to change the d esignation of Indiana natives to \"Hoosiers\" beginning with the 2016 edition of the GPO Style Manual .

Roemer, who later served as U.S. ambassador to India, tells CBS \"it's time to let everyone know wha t's in the top secret documents. 'Look, the Saudis have even s aid they're for declassifying it. We should declassify it,' he t ells Kroft. 'Is it sensitive...a bit of a can of worms or some snakes c rawling out of there? Yes,' says Roemer.\" ! U.S. Rep. Larry Bucshon (R) sees legislation that he had introduced to reform and improve the treatment for opioid addiction highlighted in a national op-ed by House Ma jority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) as a linchpin to the House's effort to combat the opioid addiction epidemic. Rep. McCarthy says that committee work on Dr. Bucshon's bill (look for it in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health on which Dr. Bucshon serves) should be complete this month, and he plans to bring it to a vote on the House floor in May. Given that the GOP floor leader also announced that the House would no t consider the bipartisan Senate bill to combat heroin a nd opioid abuse (which took a long time to be crafted an d passed 94-1), this increases the focus on and importance of th e Bucshon bill. The Washington Post writes that some Senate Republicans believe that House Republicans are playing politics over the opioid issue, something which the paper turns to Rep. Bucshon to address: \" 'Could there be pitfall s where for political reasons, people are bantering around a nd worried about who's getting credit, and it stops it up? I'm a little worried about that because it's a front-page issue and everybody's talking about it,' Bucshon said, declining to name parties or names of who might pose a problem. 'It do esn't do us any good to be working on legislation that's ulti mately not going to end up on the president's desk,' he added.\" ! U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita (R) is an original cosponsor of H.R. 4923, the \"American Manufacturer Competitiveness Act of 2016,\" legislation introduced Wednesday by House Committee on Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady (R-TX) that would restore a process allowing American manuf acturers to request waivers on tariffs for products not foun d or produced in the United States for which there is no domestically available counterpart. Any products consi dered for tariff waivers will need to be vetted by the Inte rnational Trade Commission and made publicly available for rev iew before being considered by Congress. Rep. Rokita calls this \"an important step to restoring the competitiveness of Hoosier manufacturers\" and would provide \"Indiana businesses and job creators with needed tax relief. This bill would p rotect industries like textiles, pharmaceuticals, and manu facturing from $750 million in onerous annual taxes that other n ations are already waiving,\" and level the playing field. ! U.S. Rep. Pete Visclosky (D) testified at a Tuesday hearing of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U .S. Department of Commerce, and other government agenci es on the global steel industry situation and its impact o n the U.S. steel industry and market. He praised the domestic s teel industry to the officials: \"We are innovative. We ar e environmentally responsible. We are making a high qua lity product better than anyone else in the world,\" he sai d, yet, \"We also are faced with an obscene level of global overca pacity, and this steel has no place to be dumped except on our s hores, in blatant violation of all norms of international comm erce. This has caused businesses to idle and workers to be fired . To address this growing problem, Congress passed two critical pi eces of legislation in the past year that will improve the enforcement of our trade laws. The Trade Preferences and Extensio n Act of 2015 improves the ability of the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission to consider real world factors when investigating trade violations, and th e Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection to investigate allega tions of trade law evasion. I urge ... the administration to urgently enforce existing trade laws as well as these new la ws to the fullest extent possible.\" ! U.S. Rep. Susan Brooks (R) takes aim at the bipartisan Senate bill addressing the opioid and heroin abuse pr oblem in a Washington Post story Wednesday. The bill was authored by U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) \"one of the most vulnerable members of his party this election cycle, and from on e of the states hardest hit by drug-overdose deaths\" and U.S. S en. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). The Post notes that \"it took years to craft and pass the Senate bill on opioid and hero in abuse [that] survived a floor test last month not only mo stly intact but with an almost unheard-of endorsement from the u sually fractious body, passing by a vote of 94 to 1.\" But \"Ther e are some House Republicans voicing complaints about the Se nate legislation. Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), who said the o pioid crisis had become 'very personal' after her years wo rking in the legal system and witnessing the worsening crisis in Indiana, authored a bill setting up a federal task force to c ome up with best practices for reducing opioid prescriptions. Sh e said the Senate bill is flawed because it relies too much on g rant programs and is difficult to find a way to pay for, while the House, she expected, would produce something with f ewer grant-based initiatives. 'There are certainly a lot o f ways to tackle the problem without adding a lot of new grant programs,' Brooks said.

Long. He writes that \" I was concern ed that the creation of the committee could be punitive in natur e. Now that we have received the agenda for the first meet ing, those concerns have been confirmed given the background of the individuals who have been called upon to provide 'ex pert' testimony on these matters. I am also concerned tha t a lack of consideration for all stakeholders will be set by all owing meetings to become a sounding-board for anti-immigrati on rhetoric. Additionally, the repeated use of the term 'illegal aliens' within the subject matter for consideration is offensive to many members of our Latino community, and further elevates contention surrounding the purpose of this committee.\" Sen. Lanane continues, \"There very well may be a need to study the issue of reasonable immigration reforms, and I am certain the intention behind creating this committee is to obtain objective and factual information. I am also certain that the committee will want to ensure a bal anced, realistic and compassionate approach to this issue.\" Accordingly, he asks for assurance that organizatio ns Senate Democrats work with through their Latino Roundtable a re welcome to testify, and proposes that \"various init iatives that members of our caucus have proposed in past sessions \" be included in panel discussions, including C Resident tuition for undocumented Hoosier students C Drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants C Cultural competency standards in health services C Implementation of the U-Visa Q \"Finally,\" writes Lanane to Long, \"in my experience, this is the first time I can remember a select committee bein g appointed within the Senate, outside the scope of t he standing interim study committees and process adopted by the General Assembly in 2014.

In the J anuary 2016 construction update published March 3, 2016, it was stated that it will not be realistically possible to meet th e current substantial completion date of Oct. 31, 2016 and that I-69 DP, IFA and design-build contractor had agreed to a revise d substantial completion date of June 28, 2017, reflecting a n eight-month delay to the original substantial complet ion date and just four months ahead of the project's longsto p completion date. Reasons for the construction delay s primarily relate to obtaining necessary rail road permits as w ell as the updating and modification of 404 other permits requir ed for works at multiple locations. Such permitting issues have held up construction start as well as the flow of the wo rk. Fitch understands that all material permits relating to t he project have now been received and that construction is prog ressing in accordance with the revised schedule. They also r eflect geotechnical issues faced by the project at two site s as a result of the discovery of unexpected karst features, for which Fitch understands the project company has requested a rel ief event.\" ! Purdue University agricultural economist Chris Hurt is concerned farmers have reacted to global markets by p lanting too much corn \u2014 both nationally and in Indiana. He f inds that farmers intend to plant six percent more acres of c orn in 2016 than last year. Indiana farmers indicate they would plant 5.8 million acres of corn in 2016, up by three percent from 5.65 million acres last year. This could add to abundant supplies of corn . . . and lower prices, Hurt believes. Adding to th e problem: an expectation that China will begin selling off its large corn stockpiles. \"The bottom line is that 93.6 mill ion acres is too much corn acreage that with normal yie lds will cause further building of already-large corn inventor ies,\" Hurt explains. \"Production would be expected to move above 14 billion bushels, with corn prices at harvest falling to the lower $3 per bushel.\" He's pitching soybeans as the better alt ernative. With stock supplies about 40 million bushels lower than expected \u2014 and smaller acreage nationally \u2014 Hurt ex pects that soybeans could fetch about $9 per bushel this year. ! Peabody Energy Corporation, the nation's largest coa l miner, finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorga nization Wednesday, and that means we need to remind you of concerns we recently brought to your attention that the major coal producer has about $775 million in self-bonding obligation s in Indiana, Colorado, Illinois, and New Mexico, raisin g questions about whether taxpayers could end up being \"responsibl e for billions in reclamation costs should a wave of coal-m ine closures come to pass,\" as the Washington Post notes. \"Self-bonding allows coal companies to open their boo ks to regulators and promise to pay for mine cleanup in l ieu of posting bond for mine reclamation up front.\" Q Peabody employs more than 1,000 workers at six mines in Gibson, Warrick, and Sullivan counties (and it opera tes more mines in Indiana than in any other state), and admin istrative offices in Evansville.

What is the impact of substance abuse on family members who do not abuse substances? Setting goals of keeping substance abuse from moving from one generation to another Family members come to the facility for workshops with the offender who is in treatment and they meet to work through these problems together in a neutral forum so that the whole family unit is better prepared for the offender's release date to meet their goals together.

Thanks! NOT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 1, 2016 Contact: Kara Brooks kbrooks@gov.in.gov Standard and Poor's Reaffirms Indiana's AAA Credit Rating Indianapolis - In a report released yesterday, Standard and Poor's reaffirmed the state of Indiana's AAA credit rating. Indiana has held AAA ratings with all three agencies, Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings, since April of 2010. The AAA rating is the highest possible rating of the state's finances. It signals to families and businesses already in Indiana or thinking of moving here that Indiana is a strong and stable environment for investment, growth, and keeping more of what they earn. \"Our record of passing honestly balanced budgets, maintaining sufficient reserves while cutting taxes for working Hoosiers and employers has once again been affirmed as the way to grow a more prosperous Indiana,\" said Governor Mike Pence. \"In just the last few years, our state has added nearly 140,000 new jobs; our labor force participation rates continue to outpace national averages; and, more Hoosiers are working than ever before. Rest assured that this administration will continue to advance policies that demonstrate responsible fiscal leadership and make appropriate investments in areas like workforce, education and infrastructure. That is what makes Indiana a state that works.\" Regarding Standard and Poor's issuer credit rating (ICR), the report states, \"The AAA ICR on Indiana reflects our view of the state's proven commitment to and significant focus on strengthening the budget through extensive use of management controls that have led to maintenance of structural balance, growth in reserve levels, and continued funding of long-term liabilities.\" The report in full can be found attached. ### Scott.A.Milkey From: Gilson, Katie Pence KGilson@gov.in.gov Phone: (317) 232-1198 Fax: (317) 232-3443 March 25, 2016 HPI Daily Wire, sponsored by Associated Builders & Contractors Friday, March 25, 2016 8:26 AM PENCE SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION BILL: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed a controversial abortion bill Thursday that, among other things, would ban the procedure if it is sought because the fetus was diagnosed with a disability or defect such as Down syndrome ( Washington Post) . Shortly before his deadline to act on the sweeping measure, Pence called the law \"a comprehensive pro -life measure that affirms the value of all human life,\" according to the Associated Press. The law, which was passed by the legislature earlier this month, would make In diana the second state in the nation, after North Dakota, to ban abortion in cases where a fetal anomaly is detected. It also would bar the procedure in instances where the decision is based on the sex or race of the fetus. And it could make Indiana the fi rst state in the country to require that fetal remains be buried or cremated, rather than treated like medical waste. Among the critics of the measure were several Republican women in the state House, who said they considered themselves \"pro -life\" but thou ght this bill went too far. Still, the signing of the law by Pence \u2014 a staunch opponent of abortion who is in a tight race for reelection \u2014 was fully expected. Pence's Democratic opponent in the gubernatorial race, John Gregg, quickly reacted to the signin g. \"While I am personally pro-life, this legislation was not well thought out or properly vetted,\" he said in a statement. \"If I was in the legislature I would have voted against it, and if I were governor today, I would have vetoed it.\" ANDERSON DEMOCRAT S BASH ABORTION BILL: The three Democrats who represent Madison County in the Indiana General Assembly were critical of Gov. Mike Pence signing into law legislation that further restricts access to abortions (de la Bastide, A nderson Herald -Bulletin ). Gov. Pence signed the bill Thursday to prohibit a woman from getting an abortion if the fetus has possible birth defects are on the basis of race or gender. During the final Third House session Thursday evening at the Anderson Public Library, hosted by the Madi son County League of Women Voters and Madison County Chamber of Commerce, the three Democrats raised concerns about the measure. \"This is another hot button issue that divides us,\" Sen. Tim Lanane said. \"We spent four hours debating the bill, time we could have spent trying to solve some other issues.\" Lanane said there are people in the Legislature with an agenda. \"I call it the sore loser agenda,\" he said. \"Agree or not, abortion is legal in the United States. They're trying to make it as difficult as pos sible.\" Rep. Terri Austin said everyone has different feelings about reproductive rights and abortion. She said the bill is probably unconstitutional. \"Are taxpayers getting a good use of their tax dollars?\" Austin asked. \"One more time Indiana gets into t he national spotlight.\" Rep. Melanie Wright said the bill never was heard in a Senate committee and was never presented on the floor of the Senate for second reading amendments. She said the legislation didn't follow the normal procedures of the Legislatur e and was not a good precedent to set. \"We're making rules about women, and it's critical we hear from women,\" Wright said. PENCE VETOES IDEM 'NO MORE STRINGENT' BILL: Gov. Mike Pence vetoed House Enrolled Act 1082, known as the \"no more stringent\" bill, which would have prevented environmental standards or rules put forth by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management that impose a restriction or requirement more stringent than federal law from going into effect until after adjournment sine die of the next General Assembly ( Howey Politics Indiana ). \"In recent months, public concern over clean and safe drinking water has grown as a result of the situation in Flint, Michigan,\" said Governor Pence. \"Our Indiana Department of Environmental Management is vigilant about requiring regular testing of water systems across the state for lead and working with any systems that are out of compliance to implement plans that will return the water to safe levels. IDEM must have the necessary flexibility to take act ion to protect Hoosiers. House Enrolled Act 1082 restricts IDEM's ability to act and imposes unnecessary delay in its rulemaking process. At a time when we must do all that we can to enhance public trust in the agencies charged with protecting our enviro nment, this bill moves in the wrong direction and will therefore receive my veto. With this veto, Hoosiers can be assured that we will continue to have the necessary discretion and flexibility to create Indiana solutions at the state level and act in a ti mely way to protect our drinking water.\" TRUMP WILDLY UNPOPULAR WITH WOMEN: Donald Trump's controversial attacks on Heidi Cruz are spotlighting what could be one of his biggest vulnerabilities in the general election: his poll numbers with women ( The Hi ll). The GOP front -runner has faced accusations of sexism throughout the presidential race, with members of both parties denouncing remarks he has made about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina. A new CNN poll re leased Thursday, taken before the spat with rival Ted Cruz over his wife, found that 73 percent of registered female voters in the United States had an unfavorable view of Trump. That's in line with a Reuters poll from last week that found more than half o f American women hold a \"very unfavorable\" view of the billionaire. \"That gives him a huge number of voters he has to make up from somewhere,\" said American University political science professor Karen O'Connor. \"And I don't know where they will come from. \" Opposition to Trump among women also extends to the GOP. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 47 percent of Republican women could not see themselves supporting Trump, a number significantly higher than for any other GOP candidate. BLOOMBER G POLL: CLINTON 54, TRUMP 36: In Bloomberg Poll general -election match -ups, Bernie Sanders holds a 24 -point edge over Donald Trump, a 12 -point lead over Ted Cruz, and a 4 -point advantage over John Kasich among likely general -election voters. Hillary Clinto n, by contrast, trails Kasich by 4 percentage points. She would carry a sizable lead into a contest against Cruz, where she holds a 9 -point advantage, and Trump, whom she beats by 18 points, 54 -36%. CRUZ, TRUMP WIFE FEUD FREAKING OUT GOP: A nasty feud tha t escalated Thursday between Donald Trump and his chief Republican rival over their wives set off a new wave of alarm among establishment Republicans, who fear that the GOP front - runner would drive away female voters in a general -election fight with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ( Washington Post). Trump's gender problem flared again this week as he and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas traded insults while Cruz's wife, Heidi, became the target of vitriol on social media from Trump and his supporters. At on e point, the real estate mogul retweeted an unflattering image contrasting Heidi Cruz's appearance with his wife, Melania, a retired model. \"The images are worth a thousand words,\" read the caption on the photo that Trump retweeted to his 7.2 million follo wers. That message and others have prompted an outcry among Republicans and Democrats alike, while Cruz said Thursday that \"real men don't bully women.\" \"Our spouses and our children are off -bounds,\" Cruz told reporters while campaigning in Dane, Wis. \"It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife. It is not acceptable for him to make insults, to send nasty tweets.\" A screen grab of a tweet showing Heidi Cruz, left, and Melania Trump, right, that was retweeted by Donald Trump on Wedn esday. He added: \"Donald, you're a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.\" ROKITA WILL BACK TRUMP IF NOMINATED: If Trump wins the Republican nomination, U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita, who previously endorsed Marco Rubio, said he would support the candidat e despite his controversial statements on Muslims and immigration policy (Myers, K okomo Tribune) . \"I think that's better than supporting a likely, if not potential, criminal, and it's better than endorsing a socialist,\" said Rokita, referencing Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. \"Words are words and it's not my cup of tea. It's not how I conduct myself, hopefully you see that. But in terms of working with someone to get to these issues, I think I have a better chance of getting that d one for us with Trump, far more than either one of the two Democrats, especially these two Democrats.\" INDIANA POPULATION GAINS DECREASE: Statewide, Indiana added 21,800 residents in 2015. That's Indiana second -smallest population gain since 1989 ( Indiana Public Media ). More than half of Indiana's 92 counties experienced a decrease in population in 2015, according to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau Thursday. Most of the remaining counties saw one of the slowest population growths in decades. The In diana Business Research Center analyzed the census data, which shows similar problems across the Midwest. \"It's kind of difficult for Indiana to outperform its context,\" says Matt Kinghorn, analyst with the IBRC. \"Still growing faster than its neighbors, b ut it's not growing anywhere near as fast as states in the south or in the west.\" Sluggish growth has become the norm over the past six or seven years. A major cause is people moving to other parts of the country. But, Kinghorn says the economic downturn i s a big factor as well. Young people are less likely to buy a house and settle down with a family, and the birth rate has gone down. Kinghorn says they were expecting population growth to increase a bit since the economy seems to be doing better. \"At some point I would think that would translate into a little bit of a population growth rebound, but it just hasn't happened yet,\" Kinghorn says. \"Sluggish growth has become the norm over the past six or seven years.\" PERU PD WANTS STOLEN DILLINGER TOMMY GUN BA CK: There's a Colt Thompson submachine gun on display inside the police department of Tucson, Arizona. Officials there say it belonged to John Dillinger, one of the most infamous gangsters in U.S. history who was deemed Public Enemy No. 1 by the FBI (Gerbe r, Kokomo Tribune ). But according to city officials in Peru, there's just one problem: The gun didn't belong to Dillinger, and it doesn't belong to the Tucson Police Department. They say it belongs to Peru. Josh Sigler, administrative assistant to Peru May or Gabe Greer, said after conducting extensive research, he's convinced Dillinger brazenly stole the gun from the Peru Police Department in October 1933, along with other weapons and police equipment. When Dillinger was finally apprehended by Tucson police three months later in January 1934, they confiscated the submachine gun, commonly referred to as a Tommy gun. They kept it, and have never given it back, Sigler said. The proof? He said it's the serial number on the gun, which is 5878. According to a noti ce issued by the Peru police chief after the robbery, that was the serial number on the weapon stolen by Dillinger. That's been confirmed by research completed by Gordon Herigstad, who published a book called \"Colt Thompson Submachine Gun Serial Numbers & Histories.\" The book details the narrative of every submachine gun that was ever manufactured outside of wartime production - all 15,000 of them. According the book, Tommy gun 5878 was purchased and shipped to the Peru Police Department in 1929, along with a second Tommy gun with the serial number 7117. Dillinger and his gangster accomplice, Harry Pierpont, robbed the police station, stole the Tommy gun, and then used it to hold up the First National Bank of East Chicago on Jan. 15, 1934, according to the book. The gun was captured with Dillinger in Tucson on Jan. 25, 1934. Peru Police Chief Mike Meeks said it will likely take a good, long while before the issue is resolved, but he hopes it works out in Peru's favor. \"It's a part of Peru's history,\" he said. \"I think it's important for us to have since it belonged to us. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out.\" HPI DAILY ANALYSIS: Final thoughts for the week ... I'm calling on the Tucson Police Department to return the tommy gun John Dillinger stole to my home town of Peru. Second: Gov. Pence lost 18% of female support between our September 2012 Howey/DePauw Battleground Poll and the election. Hoosier Republicans should be deeply, deeply concerned about new polling showing Trump's impact on female voters. Third: Joe Scarborough was scathing in his assessment of President Obama going to the Cuba v. Tampa Bay game following the terror at tack in Brussels. It was misguided criticism for several reasons. Does the President drop everything every time ISIS sets off a bomb somewhere? Isn't that what they want? Why would a bombing in Brussels prompt POTUS to drop everything, but not the one in A nkara a few weeks ago? ISIS wants us to be fearful. We need to be strong, vigilante and positive. Fourth: Good luck to IU and Notre Dame tonight in Philly. Hope to see a rematch on Easter Sunday. Have a great holiday this weekend, folks, and thanks for sub scribing. - Brian A.

Presidential 2016 GALLUP FINDS GOP CONFIDENCE PLUMMETS: Republicans' confidence that the election process is working as it should has dropped precipitously over the last two months, according to the latest Gallup survey data released Friday ( Politico ). Compared to January, when 46 percent of Republicans and Republican -leaning independents said the way the presidential campaign is being conducted makes them feel as though the election process is working as it should, just 30 percent said they f elt the same way this month. The findings also represent an 11 -point drop from February alone, when 41 percent of Republicans and Republican -leaning independents said the process was working. Among all adults surveyed, 30 percent in March also said the ele ction process is working, down three points from February and seven points since January. Among registered voters, 29 percent said things are working as they should, while 69 percent said they are not. For Democrats and Democratic -leaning independents, con fidence in the process was only slightly higher, at 32 percent, roughly the same level as previous months. CLINTON SANDERS DEADLOCKED IN BLOOMBERG POLL: More than halfway through a nomination race that she entered as the clear favorite, Hillary Clinton fi nds herself deadlocked with Bernie Sanders among Democrats ( Bloomberg News) . Even after more than two dozen primaries and caucuses in which Clinton's amassed a commanding lead in votes and in delegates needed to win the nomination, a Bloomberg Politics nat ional poll found that Sanders is the first choice of 49 percent of those who have voted or plan to vote in this year's Democratic contests, while the former secretary of state is preferred by 48 percent. TRUMP PREPARES CONVENTION STRATEGY: On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has a clear answer to questions about a contested convention in Cleveland \u2014 it's not happening. \"I know the press likes to talk about the brokered convention,\" he told NBCthis week, \"but I think we're doing really well.\" The dealmaker, however, is not leaving anything to chance. While Trump publicly dismisses talk of a battle in Cleveland, he is quietly assembling a team of seasoned operatives to manage a contested convention. Their strategy, NBC has learned, is to convert delegates in the crucial 40 days between the end of the primaries and the convention - while girding for a floor fight in Cleveland if necessary. The outreach is already underway. \"We are talking to tons of delegates,\" says Barry Bennett, a former Ben Carson campaign m anager now leading the delegate strategy for Trump. WALKER PREDICTS CONVENTION DARK HORSE: A contested Republican National Convention in July could lead to a GOP nominee who's not currently running for president, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker predicted Thu rsday (CBS News). \"I think if it's an open convention, it's very likely it would be someone who's not currently running,\" Walker told reporters Thursday, according to The Capital Times newspaper in Madison, Wisconsin. \"I mean, who knows,\" he added. \"I thin k any of us who comment on this election have to qualify that almost every prediction's been off, so it's hard to predict anything.\" UTAH GOP SCRAMBLES TO SAVE MIA LOVE CD SEAT: Rep. Mia Love was a rising star two years ago when she became the first black Republican woman ever elected to Congress \u2014 as well as a symbol of the more diverse, inclusive party that GOP leaders said they needed to build (Politico ). But now, the prospect of Donald Trump leading the Republican ticket has Utah Democrats hopeful they can reclaim Love's conservative House seat in November. And the local GOP is already working on secret plan to keep its voters motivated even if Trump, whom GOP activists decisively rejected at Tuesday's caucuses, is the presidential nominee in November. \"We're calling it Plan T,\" said James Evans, the GOP state party chairman. The party is preparing for a statewide get -out- the-vote effort to remind Republicans who don't want to back Trump that the presidential race isn't the only contest on the ballot. Ut ah is typically inhospitable territory for Democrats, but it's plenty bad for Trump, too: On Tuesday, he won only 14 percent of the GOP vote in the state, his worst showing in the 30 states that have held primaries and caucuses so far. He did just as badly in Salt Lake County, which is home to most of the voters in Love's 4th District. WHOOPI PRESSES CARSON ON TRUMP: Ben Carson spent the majority of his time on the set of \"The View\" on Thursday defending Donald Trump and his endorsement of the Republican p residential front -runner, who at one point compared Carson to a child molester ( Politico ). \"Sir, I hate to ask this question, but you have aligned yourself with the man who has bashed women, made countless racist remarks, and you're Ben Carson; why would y ou align yourself with that?\" co -host Whoopi Goldberg asked the retired neurosurgeon. Carson responded, saying on multiple occasions that \"there is no perfect person\" but that Trump has a history of inclusion, referring specifically to his allowing African -Americans and Jews into his Palm Beach clubs. \"He insisted on Jews and blacks and helped to break that open,\" Carson said, as Goldberg chuckled incredulously. \"So has he said some things that I wouldn't say or that you wouldn't say? Of course,\" Carson sai d. State GOVERNOR: PENCE SIGNS BMV BILL - Gov.

The Governor signed the bill in a public ceremony at the Greenwood BMV ( Howey Politics I ndiana ). \"I challenged the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ensure the back office works as well as the front office, and today we've made great progress in doing just that as we sign into law House Enrolled Act 1087,\" said Governor Pence. \"My administration ha s always made cutting red tape and improving government efficiency a priority. True to that mission, I'm proud to sign this bill into law today to cut 163 user fees and streamline operations to better serve Hoosiers across the state. Today, we're turning a new corner at the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles.\" This legislation simplifies the provisions of Indiana Code that govern the BMV, streamlines registrations and driver's licenses and reduces complexity within the overall fee structure. When these laws g o into effect on January 1, customers will notice the following changes, among others: Reduction or elimination of 163 fees. Reduction of ways to register a vehicle from 191 to 23. A consolidation of vehicle - related weight classes from 21 to 8. Establishme nt of a one -time fee for a motorcycle endorsement that never has to be renewed, saving Hoosier riders money. GOVERNOR: PENCE SIGNS FEMALE LEADERS BILL - Gov. Mike Pence this evening signed into law House Enrolled Act (HEA) 1173, which replaces male -specif ic pronouns within Title 4 of the Indiana Code with gender neutral pronouns ( Howey Politics Indiana ). \"Throughout Indiana Code, there are references to 'he' when we clearly have qualified and accomplished women serving in office,\" said Governor Pence. \"As a father, I cannot help but think about my daughters when I see references like these and the message it sends not only to them, but to young women across our state. The enactment of House Enrolled Act 1173 recognizes the incalculable leadership provided b y women leaders throughout state government. I'm proud to sign it into law and hope it serves as a source of encouragement for future generations of women leaders here in Indiana.\" \"I applaud the Governor and Indiana General Assembly for sending an empower ing message to women with the passage and signing of House Enrolled Act 1173,\" said State Auditor Suzanne Crouch. \"In Indiana, women have an opportunity to carry the torch and write the next chapter of our State's history. As more women participate in our government and in the marketplace of ideas, they can help resolve complex issues with thoughtful solutions, ultimately taking our state further than it's ever been. HEA 1173 brings us closer to that goal.\" GOVERNOR: BILLS SIGNED BY PENCE - Bills that wou ld have sheltered private college police departments from many state public records law requirements and restricted the authority of the state's environmental agency were vetoed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. It was the Republican's final day to take action on measures approved by the General Assembly during its session that ended two weeks ago. Among measures that Pence signed into law were bills boosting a planned development at Indiana Dunes State Park and streamlining the fees charged by the Indiana Burea u of Motor Vehicles. Here's a look at the governor's actions: Private college police : The bill would have required less disclosure of crime records by the 11 private college police agencies around Indiana, which have the same arrest authority as state, co unty, city and public university police departments. The University of Notre Dame is in a court fight with ESPN after the school refused a request for records of crime investigations involving student -athletes. While the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled last week in favor of ESPN, saying the Notre Dame police are subject to the state public records law, the school plans to appeal that decision to the state Supreme Court. \"Limiting access to police records in a situation where private university police departm ents perform a government function is a disservice to the public and an unnecessary barrier to transparency,\" Pence said Thursday in a veto statement. Indiana dunes project: An embattled privatization deal that would bring restaurants, a rooftop bar and a banquet center to Indiana Dunes State Park will get a boost under a bill signed by Pence. The measure will allow politically connected developer Chuck Williams of Valparaiso to sell alcohol at the planned development along the Lake Michigan beachfront. It circumvents county and state alcohol boards, which both denied Williams a permit. Opponents have argued that Williams received favorable lease terms from the state parks syst em. Auto license fees: Pence signed into law a measure aimed at reducing the complexity of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles' fee structure, which came after an audit last year found the agency had overcharged motorists more than $60 million since 2013. Steps included in the bill include paring down the BMV's current 191 classifications for registering vehicles to about two dozen. The bill also reduces or eliminates 163 fees. The changes will go into effect in January. Environmental regulations: The governor r ejected a bill that would have required the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to report to the Legislature before implementing new pollution or waste management regulations. It was a diluted version of a proposal that would have banned IDEM fr om creating environmental rules that were more stringent than federal regulations and blocked most new rules from taking effect until a legislative session had occurred, giving lawmakers a chance to intervene. Pence cited the public concerns over lead cont amination of tap water in Flint, Michigan, as a factor in his veto decision, saying the bill imposed \"unnecessary delay\" in the rulemaking process. Fantasy sports Pence signed a bill giving the Indiana Gaming Commission authority to regulate daily fantasy sports companies. The bill includes requirements that players be at least 18 years old, prohibits contests based on college or high school sports and sets an initial licensing fee of $50,000 for companies. About 20 states are considering bills to regulate the industry, in which players pay to compete online for cash prizes by picking teams of real -life athletes and racking up fantasy points based on how they perform. Malpractice compensation: Medical malpractice victims will be eligible for more compensati on as Pence signed into law a bill increasing the payment cap for the first time since the 1990s. The cap would increase from the current $1.25 million limit to $1.65 million next year and then to $1.8 million in 2019. Supporters say the increase was neede d to protect the cap from court chal lenges since it hasn't been raised for so long. Some medical groups opposed the size of the cap increase, saying doctors would not be able to absorb jumps in malpractice insurance premiums. GOVERNOR: HOLCOMB RESPONDS T O KRONE JOBS - Lt. Governor Eric Holcomb, who serves as Indiana's Secretary of Agriculture, issued the following statement about the Krone North America announcement ( Howey Politics Indiana ): \"Indiana has long been synonymous with a strong and innovative a griculture industry, and I am pleased to welcome Krone North America to the Hoosier family. Announcements like this one affirm our state's strategy of creating an environment conducive to economic growth, from our tax and regulatory policies to the way in which we have enhanced local and state roads and infrastructure. Coupled with an unrivaled quality of life in Indiana's small and large communities alike, it is easy to understand why our state has become a magnet for new jobs and new investments in 21st c entury agriculture.\" BICENTENNIAL: TORCH RELAY ANNOUNCED - Lt. Governor Eric Holcomb recently joined the Indiana Office of Tourism Development (IOTD) to unveil the statewide route the Indiana Bicentennial Torch Relay will travel this fall. The Indiana Bic entennial Torch Relay will start in Corydon on September 9 and travel over 3,200 miles as nearly 2,000 torchbearers will carry the torch through each of Indiana's 92 counties. The route showcases locations of natural beauty, local interest and historic sig nificance to the state (H owey Politics Indiana) . A map and schedule of the statewide torch relay are now available as well as route maps for each of the 92 counties on the Bicentennial Torch Relay webpage. \"The Indiana Bicentennial Torch Relay is not only the premier event of our state's Bicentennial Celebration, but it is also an opportunity for Hoosiers from counties large and small to showcase all that makes Indiana unique,\" said Holcomb. \"The torch route was designed to highlight the state's cultural fa bric, our history and values, and the spirit of Hoosier ingenuity, igniting generations to come.\" BICENTENNIAL: TORCH RELAY ROUTE - The Indiana Bicentennial Torch Relay route touches: 260 cities and towns. 17 state and national parks, including Indiana Dunes, Turkey Run, Falls of the Ohio and Abraham Lincoln's Boyhood Home. Nine lakes and rivers, including the Ohio and Wabash Rivers. 27 national, state and local sites of historic significance including the Levi Coffin House, Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site and Lanier Mansion. 22 colleges and universities.

STATEHOUSE: DOCTOR'S LICENSE SUSPENDED - The Indiana Medical Licensing Board today voted to immediately suspend the license of Dr. Michael Cozzi, owner and operator of FW Interventional Pain Management in Fort Wayne, for allegations of dangerous prescribing of controlled substances ( Howey Politics Indiana) . A Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigation revealed that Cozzi prescribed more controlled substances than any other prescriber in Indiana from January 2014 to February 2016, including 2 million doses of Oxycodone and 1.2 million doses of hydrocodone. In one month, he prescribed controlled substances to about 1,700 patients, seeing 90 to 100 patients per day. According to the Attorney General's petition to suspend his license f iled Tuesday, three of Cozzi's patients died due to complications of this drug use. During a licensing hearing today in Indianapolis, the Medical Licensing Board approved the Attorney General's emergency suspension petition, suspending Cozzi's license to p ractice medicine in the State of Indiana for at least 90 days until the AG's Office completes its investigation into these allegations and files a formal licensing complaint. Once a formal complaint is filed, the Board would determine any further disciplin ary action, such as further license suspension, revocation or fines. MEDIA: EXODUS FROM WISH -TV CONTINUES - An award -winning field reporter at WISH -TV Channel 8 has announced her departure, joining a growing list of on -air personalities to leave the sta tion over the past 18 months (IBJ). Teresa Mackin will leave WISH in mid -April to take a communications job at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business on the IUPUI campus. Since joining WISH in early 2012, Mackin has been a reporter during evening a nd morning newscasts, most recently working on WISH's Daybreak morning news. She also occasionally filled in on the anchor desk. Mackin's departure comes on the heels of WISH's loss last month of popular meteorologist Robb Ellis, who left to take a job in his hometown of South Carolina, and sportscaster Amanda Maynard, who left the station to move to Oregon for personal reasons. In the last 18 months, WISH also has parted ways with anchor Eric Halvorson, news director Steve Bray, investigative reporters Kar en Hensel and Troy Kehoe, meteorologist Pamela Gardener, and reporters and back-up anchors Dustin Grove, Jessica Hayes and Daniel Miller. General Assembly BAUER CRITICAL OF PENCE VETO: State Rep. B. Patrick Bauer (D -South Bend) has issued the following statement in the wake of Gov. Mike Pence's decision to veto House Enrolled Act 1022: \"I am greatly disappointed that Gov. Mike Pence vetoed Ho use Enrolled Act 1022 (HEA 1022), which would have created greater transparency for private university police records. HEA 1022 concerns the records of criminal acts, not accidental claims. In particular, HEA 1022 would have helped victims of rape as well as sexual assault and battery. It was never intended to influence the ESPN lawsuit against the University of Notre Dame. The Indiana Court of Appeals recently ruled in favor of ESPN. The case will next go before the Indiana Supreme Court. If the court upho lds the appellate court decision, then the new law would naturally have had to be reviewed to ensure it complies with the high court's decision. HEA 1022 had unanimous, bipartisan support with only one vote against it during its entire journey through the Indiana House and Senate. Legislators in both chambers carefully examined the issue in public hearings and in both chambers. Unfortunately, most of the special interests who opposed the bill did not attend those committee hearings nor witness the debates o n the bill in both the House and Senate. Yet, those same individuals claim the bill places greater restrictions on access to public records. DELPH CALLS FOR SECURITY ASSESSMENT: State Sen. Mike Delph (R -Carmel) authored a resolution this session calling for a study of the state's infrastructure and communication vulnerabilities. \"With the high level of terrorist activity around the world, Indiana needs to be a leader in ensuring t he safety of its citizens,\" Sen. Delph said. \"It is imperative that we look at our vulnerabilities, as this helps determine possible targets in the state while allowing for the necessary changes and upgrades to be made to these vital assets. This study wil l allow us to understand, mitigate and prevent the types of attacks we have seen in Paris, San Bernadino and most recently this week in Brussels.\" Specifically, Senate Resolution 29 calls for the study to look at how state resources might be vulnerable to a terrorist attack. Because such an attack could have a widespread negative impact on Hoosiers, Sen. Delph said it's important for the state to assess potential threats. Sen. Delph added that the study would include whether persons linked to terrorism shou ld be prohibited from using cellular services and social media outlets. Congress POLLS SHOW SUPPORT FOR OBAMA SCOTUS NOMINEE: President Barack Obama and not his successor elected in November should be the one who gets to nominate the next Supreme Court j ustice, according to the results of a national CNN/ORC poll released Friday ( Politico ). Nearly six -in-10 \u2014 57 percent \u2014 said Obama should be able to make the pick, which he did on March 16, sending the nomination of D.C. Circuit chief judge Merrick Garland to the Senate. Another 40 percent said the next president elected in November and taking office in January should be the person to tap the potential justice to fill the vacancy. In line with other recent national polling on the issue, 64 percent to 31 per cent said Senate Republicans should hold hearings on Garland's nomination, while only 37 percent said opposition to Garland's nomination would be justified on the mere basis that he was appointed by the current president and not his successor, compared to 58 percent who said it would not be. A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday found that 62 percent to 33 percent of registered voters said the Senate should consider Garland's nomination, and a CBS News/New York Times poll suggested that 53 percent of Americans would like the Senate to vote on his nomination. CARSON AUTHORS FOOD DESERT BILL: There's a new plan to potentially bring more grocery stores and markets in and around Indianapolis ( WRTV) . It would be a way to get rid of food deserts that pre vent people from having access to fresh food, fruits and vegetables. U.S. Rep. Andre Carson unveiled the Food Deserts Act during a stop at the Edna Martin Christian Center on the east side Thursday. Someone, profit or non-profit, would get a low -interest l oan or financial break through the Department of Agriculture to put a grocery store into a neighborhood, like those in Indianapolis that lost their Double 8 Foods grocery stores. BROOKS URGES ENGAGEMENT OVERSEAS: U.S. Rep. Susan Brooks (R -IN) and Lieuten ant General Carol Mutter, joined the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition to discuss how America's engagement abroad spurs economic growth here in Indiana and promotes our national security ( Howey Politics Indiana ). \"From countering terrorism to stopping globa l pandemics, now is not the time for our nation to pull back. It's vital that we continue to strengthen our nation's investments in development and diplomacy alongside a strong defense,\" said U.S. Rep. Susan Brooks. \"American leadership around the world is more critical than ever for our national security and Indiana's economic prosperity.\" This discussion comes as Senator Richard Lugar and Representative Lee Hamilton launched the new USGLC Indiana Advisory Committee in an op -ed in the Indianapolis Star, wr iting \"The truth is that while our international affairs programs make up a mere 1 percent of the federal budget, they save us an immeasurable amount in taxpayer dollars and, most importantly, the lives of our service members.\" The Indiana Advisory Committ ee is comprised of 61 leaders from across the state, including elected officials, veterans, former ambassadors, and leading academics who believe that our nation benefits when America leads in the world. WALORSKI WANTS GUANTANAMO BRIEFING: After admitting yesterday that released detainees from Guantanamo Bay have in fact killed Americans, U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski (IN -02) today requested a classified briefing from Paul Lewis, the Pentagon's special envoy for Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility (Howey Politic s Indiana). The letter read, \"I write with significant concerns following your testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on March 23, 2016. While I understand your mission as the Department of Defense's Special Envoy for Guantanamo Bay follo ws the Executive Orders issued by the Obama administration, I am deeply troubled by an answer you gave at yesterday's hearing. ...You indicated that Americans have, in fact, lost their lives at the hands of detainees who were released from the Detention Faci lity at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. However, despite this alarming claim, you defended the administration's position that the risk posed by keeping Guantanamo Bay open is higher than if it were closed because of its role as a recruitment vehicle. As recent eve nts in Paris, San Bernardino, Brussels, and elsewhere tragically highlight, these terrorist radicals will carry out unspeakable violence with or without the presence of Guantanamo Bay.\" ROKITA BACKS SCOTUS DELAY: In reference to the controversy surroundin g the United State Supreme Court following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita said he thinks this year's presidential race should determine who chooses Scalia's replacement ( Kokomo Tribune ). President Barack Obama has nominated Judg e Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy, but many Senate Republicans have vowed to not consider the nominee. \"You saw it here in this room a little bit today, the divided nature of this county and of the electorate and which way they're going to go,\" he said . \"I think it's reasonable to let the people speak, and depending on how this comes out in the presidential election, then take up the consent process after the people have spoken. \"Is the Senate being reasonable in withholding their consent at this partic ular time? I don't think they're unreasonable,\" he added later when addressing a question about whether the people have already spoken by electing Obama to a second term. Nation WHITE HOUSE: KERRY SAYS ISIS IS FALTERING - The Islamic State is desperately lashing out in Europe because its base in the Middle East is rapidly eroding, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday in Brussels, where he traveled to demonstrate the United States' support for Belgium three days after bombs killed 31 people, including at least two Americans (New York Times). \"We will not be intimidated, we will not be deterred,\" Mr. Kerry said, standing next to Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, addressing Islamic State militants. \"We will come back with greater res olve, with greater strength, and we will not rest until we have eliminated your nihilistic beliefs and cowardice from the face of this death.\" Mr. Kerry said that 66 nations, including Belgium, had joined a coalition devoted to fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. \"The very reason that Daesh is resorting to actions outside of the Middle East is because their fantasy of a caliphate is collapsing before their eyes,\" he said, using the Arabic acronym for the organization. \"Its territories a re shrinking, its leadership has been decimated by coalition attacks, its cash flow is drying up, and its fighters are fleeing,\" he said. WHITE HOUSE: INDY PART OF TECH PROGRAM - The need is clear: Indianapolis' tech industry is expected to blossom in the next decade, calling for an additional 51,500 workers by 2025 (IndyStar). To help the city on its way to a computing -based future, the White House designated Indianapolis as a TechHire city this month. The program prepares low -skilled workers for high -paying tech jobs. \"It's exciting because it will help inspire employers to understand that great talent doesn't have to come out of a four - year university,\" said Sally Reasoner, director of talent initiatives at TechPoint, a group that works to accelerate the growth of Indiana's tech community. \"There are other training pathways to scale up talent in the state.\" TERROR: 2 AMERICANS KILLED IN BRUSSELS - At least two American citizens have been confirmed killed in this week's attacks in Brussels, a U.S. officia l says, as Secretary of State John Kerry is visiting the city to express his condolences to the Belgian people (Associated Press). Speaking after meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, Kerry said the \"United States is praying and grieving with you for the loved ones of those cruelly taken from us, including Americans, and for the many who were injured in these despicable attacks.\" He did not give a specific number, but a senior official said the families of two Americans had been informed of th eir deaths in Tuesday's attacks. ILLINOIS: COOK COUNTY LOSES 10K POPULATION - Cook County lost more than 10,000 residents in 2015, the largest number of any county in the nation, according to data released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau (Chicago Sun -Times). Overall, the Chicago area \u2014 which the census defines as including the city, suburbs and parts of southern Wisconsin and northwest Indiana \u2014 had a net loss of more than 12,000 people, the first year -to-year population decline for the region in a deca de. NORTH CAROLINA: BATHROOM BILL SIGNED - North Carolina legislators decided to rein in local governments by approving a bill Wednesday that prevents cities and counties from passing their own anti -discrimination rules ( Fox News ). Gov. Pat McCrory later signed the legislation, which dealt a blow to the LGBT movement after success with protections in cities across the country. The Republican -controlled General Assembly took action after Charlotte city leaders last month approved a broad anti - discrimination measure. Critics focused on language in the ordinance that allowed transgender people to use the restroom aligned with their gender identity. McCrory, who was the mayor of Charlotte for 14 years and had criticized the local ordin ance, signed the legislation Wednesday night that he said was \"passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette.\" Although 12 House Democrats joined all Republicans present in voting for the bill in the afternoon, later al l Senate Democrats in attendance walked off their chamber floor during the debate in protest. Remaining Senate Republicans gave the legislation unanimous approval. \"We choose not to participate in this farce,\" Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue of Raleigh sai d after he left the chamber. NORTH CAROLINA: NBA THREATENS TO PULL ALL -STAR GAME - The National Basketball Association issued a veiled threat Thursday to pull its planned 2017 All -Star Game from North Carolina's largest city after the state's governor sig ned a bill prohibiting municipalities from passing their own anti -discrimination ordinances ( Fox News) . In a Tweet issued from the NBA's verified Twitter account late Thursday, the association expressed \"concern that this discriminatory law runs counter to our guiding principles of equality and mutual respect.\" \"[We] do not yet know what impact it will have on our ability to successfully host the 2017 All -Star Game in Charlotte,\" the statement read. World KARADZIC GUILTY OF GENOCIDE: A U.N. war crimes co urt convicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic of genocide and nine other charges Thursday for orchestrating a campaign of terror that left 100,000 people dead during the 1992 -95 war in Bosnia, the worst carnage in Europe since World War II ( Associated Press ). Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role in Serb atrocities that included the Srebrenica massacre in which 8,000 Muslim men and boys were slaughtered in Europe's worst mass murder since the Holocaust, and for directing the nearly four -year siege of Sarajevo. In pronouncing the verdict, presiding Judge O -Gon Kwon said Karadzic and his military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, intended \"that every able - bodied Bosnian Muslim male from Srebrenica be killed.\" Local CITIES: SPENCER GIRL DEAD, ARREST MADE - The one -year-old girl who went missing from her father and gra ndmother's house early Wednesday in Owen County was found dead Thursday, state police said in a press conference Thursday night. Shaylyn Ammerman's body was found in a rural area in Gosport, just after 6 p.m. (WIBC). Police arrested Kyle Parker, 22, in her disappearance. Parker lives in Spencer, but police were not saying much more, including what charges he may face. CITIES: KENNEDY PROBE COULD TAKE MONTHS - It could be at least two months before details are released regarding an Indiana State Police inve stigation into allegations of political misconduct by former City Clerk Sandy Kennedy (Fort Wayne Journal Gazette). \"The investigation is ongoing and the Indiana State Police do not comment on active investigations,\" state police Sgt. Richard Myers said in an email this month. \"I can advise you that when the investigation is complete, which is anticipated to be within 60 to 75 days, the findings will be submitted to the Allen County Prosecutor's Office for review and any further action that office may deem necessary.\" CITIES: ALCOA CLOSES DOWN SMELTER - Aluminum manufacturing has officially ceased at Alcoa Warrick Operations (Orr, Evansville Courier & Press ). Thursday marked the final day of production for the Warrick County plant's smelter, which had been in operation since 1960. Alcoa first announced the shutdown in January, saying that the Warrick smelter was no longer competitive because of a drop in aluminum prices. Affected employees will be paid through April 7. Some 600 people worked at Alcoa's smelt er, but Alcoa said earlier this month that only about 325 employees would actually be laid off. The other workers either found employment elsewhere or accepted severance or retirement package offers. CITIES: JAIL FOR FORMER BLOOMINGTON OFFICIAL - Former B loomington Parks Department office manager Judith Seigle will spend 18 months in federal prison despite her lawyer's request that Seigle be spared incarceration so she can continue caring for her wheelchair -bound husband, who suffers from muscular dystroph y (Lane, Bloomington Herald -Times). Seigle, 53, pleaded guilty to stealing more than $400,000 from the city parks foundation charity and to taking another $30,000 or so from the department's operating funds. She testified during her two -hour sentencing hearing Wednesday that her life was so difficult that she shopped to bring herself comfort, eating out and buying things for her daughter, friends, family members and herself. \"I knew it was wrong ... but I couldn't stop the cycle,\" she said. She admitted embezzling money from 2001 until she was fired in October 2015. Using scissors, small pieces of paper and glue, she would doctor bank statements to fool her superiors and members of the parks foundation board. COUNTIES: CARROLL AUDITOR RESIGNS - Carroll Coun ty auditor Vicky Snipes resigned Thursday morning during a special meeting of the Carroll County Board of Commissioners ( Lafayette Journal & Courier ). Snipes is the third auditor in the last three years to resign from the position. She was elected by preci nct committeemen nearly a year ago after her predecessor \"walked out on the job,\" according to Snipes. Snipes, who has accepted a job with an Indianapolis -based firm, cited negative treatment by some members of Carroll County board members in her resignati on letter. \"There is a lot of turmoil between county boards. It's a very unhealthy environment to work in,\" Snipes said. \"There is a lot of micromanaging and conflict between the commissioners and our council.\" March 28, 2016 HPI Daily Wire, sponsored by Associated Builders & Contractors Monday, March 28, 2016 7:28 AM STATE LEAVING COUNTIES ON THEIR OWN WITH NEEDLE EXCHANGES: One of Indiana's four legal needle exchange programs operates out of a cramped 10 foot - by-10 foot office in the basement of the local courthouse in Fayette County, which is struggling with a hepatitis C outbreak amid the state's growing opioid -abuse crisis (Callahan, Associated Press ). Though just seven intravenous drug users addicted to heroin are enrolled in the program, Paula Maupin, Fayette County's public health nurse, expects that to grow to 75 to 100 participants in the next year or so. The problem is, lawmakers banned state funding for the exchanges when they legalized them last year, even as Indiana's worst -ever HIV outbreak struck in another county. The four counties \u2014 Fayette, Madison, Monroe and Scott \u2014 that won state approval for their exchanges after that law took effect last May are cash -strapped and in largely rural areas. They had to scramble to find money from nonprofits, foundations, donations or county coffers to run the programs, which provide intravenous drug users with clean syringes and collect used ones to reduce needle -sharing and prevent the spread of HIV, hepatitis C and other diseases. But local officials are hoping federal funding can give them a boost. Fayette County turned to the Comer Family Foundation and the Washington - based advocacy group AIDS United, which provided $23,000. Although its exchange won state appr oval in August, it didn't open in Connersville, about 50 miles east of Indianapolis, until November. \"What we've got, it's fine for now,\" said Maupin, who on Thursday had one exchange participant drop by to collect a fresh supply of syringes in the tiny of fice lined with baskets of packaged cotton balls, clean water and other program supplies. \"But when we have the amount of people I'm expecting, we're going to burn through that money pretty quick.\" State Rep. Ed Clere, a New Albany Republican, acknowledged that the state funding ban is \"a real barrier\" that counties must overcome, but that it was necessary to win the votes of lawmakers. \"Without the change in law, syringe exchanges wouldn't have been possible, period,\" he said of the legislation he authored , which requires the state health commissioner to review and either approve or reject the creation of exchanges for counties that seek them. NEEDLE EXCHANGE STOPPED SCOTT COUNTY HIV IN ITS TRACKS: Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentuck y, was at the heart of the HIV outbreak that spurred the change in Indiana's law. It's operated its exchange since April 2015 \u2014 initially under an executive order signed by Gov. Mike Pence and later under the new law. Two hundred people are actively partic ipating in the county's exchange, public health nurse Brittany Combs said, and nearly 400 have signed up to take part (Associated Press ). Combs said the HIV outbreak \u2014 the worst in Indiana history with nearly 190 people infected and driven largely by peopl e abusing a liquefied form of the prescription painkiller Opana \u2014 has \"definitely been stopped\" by the needle exchange and robust local education efforts targeting IV drug users. It has remained afloat with grants and donations from several groups, includi ng $10,000 from the Indiana Family Health Council, but will need much more in the years ahead. She hopes federal dollars can arrive sometime this year to boost the county's efforts. \"That would really be great. We're kind of in a waiting game right now,\" C ombs said. DRUG ABUSE, OVERDOSES RISE IN WABASH VALLEY: \"I turned 18 in here, I turned 19 in here, I turned 20 in here.\" Kyle has been in and out of the Sullivan County Jail so many times, he calls one of the officers \"mom.\" Behind bars is where he feels safest. It's away from the environment fueling an addiction to bath salts (Hedrick, Terre Haute Tribune -Star). Days away from completing a three -month sentence, he's scared to death of freedom. Family has told him to stay away. He's afraid to visit his ba by daughter, who he's only seen through photos. The only place he can go after being released, he said, is his dealer's house. And he knows the cycle will start again. \"There's no doubt in my mind that I'll be back ... if I can't get away from this,\" said Kyle, who declined to give his last name. Kyle is a face behind the statistics of the ever -growing substance abuse problem in the Wabash Valley and statewide. Sullivan County is one of the Valley's hardest hit areas, according to figures from Connect2Help2 11, a referral organization for substance abuse counseling, treatment and other social services. From 2014 to 2015, there was a 200 percent or more surge in requests for substance abuse help in Sullivan County, the organization said in its latest community report. Over that same period, overdose deaths increased by 15 to 29 percent, according to the report. Vermillion County inquiries also surged 200 percent or more from 2014 -2015, according to the community report. Unlike the Sullivan area, however, the nu mber of overdose deaths decreased or did not change over the same period. Meth, crystal meth and heroin are the three most serious drug problems the county is facing, Sheriff Mike Phelps told the Tribune -Star. WAYNE COUNTY DRUG TREATMENT CENTERS DELAYED: Two drug rehabilitation facilities have had their Wayne County plans delayed, but both still plan to open this year (Emery, Richmond Palladium -Item). Recovery of Indiana, an outpatient treatment option, expects to open first, likely in May, at the former Perfect Circle Credit Union building at 650 Progress Drive. Optimistically, Recovery of Indiana had hoped to begin operating in January, but Keith Vukasinovich, whose company, Cornerstone, operates addiction treatment facilities in Ohio, said Indiana's lic ensing process has delayed the opening. Recovery Works, a residential detoxification facility, hoped to open during the first quarter of 2016, but Jennifer Mooney, the center's media relations spokesperson, said the facility will open later this year at a site northwest of the Indiana 1 and Interstate 70 interchange. \"We are going to be open by the end of the year,\" she said. \"We are committed to it.\" Wayne County does not currently have a detoxification facility. The average residential treatment length is 21 to 28 days with a cost of $12,000, Joe Pritchard, chief executive officer of Pinnacle, said at the groundbreaking. Recovery Works would use Methadone and Suboxone, synthetic opioid replacement drugs, in the residential setting but is not a maintenance program that provides daily doses to outpatient clients, Pritchard said. Recovery of Indiana, on the other hand, will utilize Vivitrol, a monthly shot that blocks the enjoyment of opioids, and will provide individual counseling, family counseling and medic al management, said Vukasinovich. He said Indiana's licensing procedures for key employees who will debut Recovery of Indiana, including himself, have delayed the opening. He said Indiana's strict stance against clinics that dole out pills toughens the pro cess. \"Ohio talks tough about pill mills,\" he said. \"Indiana does things.\" U.S. KILLS ISIS 2ND IN COMMAND: The United States last week killed a top Islamic State commander in Syria as part of a spate of military actions targeting the terrorist group's leadership and explosives caches, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said on Friday ( New York Times ). The killi ng of a top commander, Abd al -Rahman Mustafa al -Qaduli, who is also known by other names, comes as the United States is having increased success targeting the Islamic State's leadership. Last week, Defense Department officials concluded that American strik es had killed the group's minister of war, Omar al -Shishani. \"We are systematically eliminating ISIL's cabinet,\" Mr. Carter said at a news conference, using an acronym for the group. But he made clear that the challenge was not that simple. \"Striking leade rship is necessary,\" he said, \"but as you know it's far from sufficient. As you know leaders can be replaced. These leaders have been around for a long time \u2014 they are senior and experienced and eliminating them is an important objective and result. They w ill be replaced and we will continue to go after their leadership.\" Mr. Carter said Mr. Qaduli was the Islamic State's finance minister and was responsible for planning some of its attacks abroad. Mr. Carter said he did not know whether he had played a rol e in the bombings this week in Brussels. \"The removal of this ISIL leader will hamper the organization's ability for them to conduct operations both inside and outside of Iraq and Syria,\" he said. DOCTORS GRAPPLING WITH NEW INDIANA ABORTION LAW: One day after Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed a controversial bill blocking women from seeking abortions based on medical diagnoses, doctors grappled with how the measure might affect their patients ( Washington Post ). The law, which takes effect July 1, bans th e procedure if, among other restrictions, a woman requests it \"solely\" because a fetus has Down syndrome or any other disorder. She could legally obtain an abortion, however, in the event of a lethal fetal illness \u2014 but would have to inform the state that she chose to terminate her pregnancy. A doctor, meanwhile, could face a wrongful -death lawsuit if an abortion is granted to a woman who requests it after learning about a pregnancy complication. Brownsyne Tucker -Edmonds, an Indianapolis gynecologist, said in a statement Friday that the law could dissuade physicians from performing a legal medical procedure and, by doing so, imperil their patients' health. \"It will require a woman, during one of the most devastating times in her life after learning of a feta l anomaly, to prolong her pregnancy even if against her wishes, and to potentially assume the greater health risks associated with doing so,\" Tucker -Edmonds wrote. Some women have \"cases in which the risk of death during a full -term pregnancy is more than 14 times higher than for a termination of pregnancy.\" Hal Lawrence, chief executive of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group strongly opposes the law because it could encourage a patient to withhold information from her d octor. A woman who, for example, learned her fetus carried a severe disability may pursue an abortion from an out -of-state provider and then, out of fear, skip follow -up care from her regular doctor. \"She shouldn't be under legal duress when she came back to where she lived,\" Lawrence said. \"Patients need postpartum or postoperative care. They need to be counseled for contraception. Discouraging that is highly destructive.\" NOT ENOUGH ROAD MONEY FOR LOCALS: Despite dumping more than $500 million into loca l roads, lawmakers might not have done enough to this session to ensure counties, cities and towns have adequate funds for infrastructure (Osowski, Evansville Courier & Press ). On the very last day of the session, the Indiana General Assembly approved a massive roads bill that set up a matching account for local road and bridge projects with $186 million in funding and sent another $420 million in excess local income tax to mu nicipalities. At least 75 percent of the income tax money must be spent on roads but local leaders in Southwest Indiana say they plan to use most of the money on roads, and that still might not be enough. Vanderburgh County Commissioner Joe Keifer said the $3.1 million his county is expected to receive must go strictly to repair work. \"We're so far behind as far as maintenance, there's not much new work we can do with this money,\" Keifer said. Keifer said the county is constantly sealing old roads, playing catch up on potholes and degradation, which leaves it with no time or money to do new paving on roads. \"What the people of Indiana got was an election year band -aid, and will result in our mailboxes being flooded with messaging from the House and Senate in cumbents running for re -election on how they 'increased' infrastructure funding,\" Monroe County Commissioner Patrick Stoffers said (Rollins, Bloomington Herald -Times ). \"It can be argued that this was a good start. Perhaps. But I would describe it as uninsp ired and minimalist.\" TRUMP AND WOMEN CONCERN GOP: Senator Ted Cruz may have urged Donald J. Trump to leave his wife, Heidi, \"the hell alone,\" but there is one group that is quietly hoping Mr. Trump's attacks on his rival's spouse and other women will co ntinue indefinitely: Democrats ( New York Times ). As Hillary Clinton turns her attention to a general election campaign, Mr. Trump's nasty skirmish with Mr. Cruz, including his warning to \"spill the beans\" about Mrs. Cruz, without offering specifics, and hi s reposting of a message that mocked her looks, have played into a crucial Democratic strategy to defeat Mr. Trump in November: to portray him as an unabashed sexist. Mrs. Clinton's allies hope to sway suburban and independent women, who will play an outsize role in deciding the fall election, to support her candidacy by pushing this theme. These Democrats say the matchup would be historic: one pitting the first female nominee of a major political party against a rival who has repeatedly dismissed and disparaged women and their looks. \"I want Donald Trump to talk every single day for the rest of this election,\" said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. \"He just needs to keep spewing what he has been spewing.\" Although Mrs. Clinton will present herself as a protector of women, the political strategy is more about math than morality. Mr. Trump has shown a particular weakness among female voters, who favored Mrs. Clinton 55 percent to 35 percent in a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week, twice the gender gap of the 2012 presidential election, when President Obama defeated Mitt Romney. And 31 percent of Republican women said they would be upset if Mr. Trump were the party's nominee, acc ording to the most recent CNN/ORC poll. \"Suburban women have been a critical swing group in the past, and there's a lot about Donald Trump that is offensive to them,\" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who served as a chief strategist to Mrs. Clinton in 2008. \"It's going to be a major factor\" in November, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who works for an anti -Trump super PAC, Our Principles PAC. \"This guy comes across as a brash bully, and that is not very well received.\" SANDERS WINS 3 WESTERN C AUCUSES: Sen. Bernie Sanders scored victories in the Democratic caucuses in Washington, Alaska and Hawaii on Saturday, three Western -states contests that the independent senator from Vermont had been favored to win ( Washington Post ). During an address in W isconsin, Sanders thanked Alaska for \"a resounding victory.\" He claimed strong momentum in Washington state. \"We knew things would begin to improve when we moved west,\" a smiling Sanders said to huge applause. The Washington results came in as he spoke, an d he drew a deafening cheer when he read the news aloud. The delegates he captured in the sweep dented but did not seriously damage front -runner Hillary Clinton's lead in the race for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. Winning all three states , however, buoyed his insurgent challenge, as the contest moves back to large, delegate -rich states in the Midwest and Northeast. Clinton's campaign conceded that Sanders had the edge in all three contests Saturday, but it claimed that even the largest pri ze, Washington, will make little difference in the dynamics of a primary contest that she has long been favored to win. Clinton campaigned in Washington for one day last week, whereas Sanders spent several days there. Neither candidate campaigned in person in Hawaii and Alaska. CLINTON EMAIL PROBE ENTERING NEW PHASE: Federal prosecutors investigating the possible mishandling of classified materials on Hillary Clinton's private email server have begun the process of setting up formal interviews with some o f her longtime and closest aides, according to two people familiar with the probe, an indication that the inquiry is moving into its final phases ( Los Angeles Times) . Those interviews and the final review of the case, however, could still take many weeks, all but guaranteeing that the investigation will continue to dog Clinton's presidential campaign through most, if not all, of the remaining presidential primaries. No dates have been set for questioning the advisors, but a federal prosecutor in recent week s has called their lawyers to alert them that he would soon be doing so, the sources said. Prosecutors also are expected to seek an interview with Clinton herself, though the timing remains unclear. The interviews by FBI agents and prosecutors will play a significant role in helping them better understand whether Clinton or her aides knowingly or negligently discussed classified government secrets over a non -secure email system when she served as secretary of State. HPI DAILY ANALYSIS: The state is fallin g down in the fight against HIV through what the AP is describing as impoverished needle exchange programs. Why are poor, rural counties scrambling for private funds to deal with a \"public health crisis ?\" - Brian A. Howey Presidential 2016 TRUMP'S BIZARRE FOREIGN POLICY STANCES: Republican presidential front - runner Donald Trump suggested that he would destroy oil fields in the Middle East, saying that they're a primary source of income for terrorist groups such as ISIS (NBC News). In an interview with the New York Times publishe d online Saturday, the billionaire businessman argued that even though he was against the Iraq War, the government could have used that opportunity to seize the oil refineries. His call to \"take the oil\" now would require deploying U.S. troops on the groun d, a move Trump is not in favor of. \"I would say knock the hell out of the oil and do it because it's a primary source of money for ISIS,\" said Trump. \"We have to destroy the oil. We should've taken it and we would've have it.\" If elected, Trump told the T imes he might also halt the purchase of oil from Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies because they've been unwilling to send their troops in on the ground to fight against ISIS despite efforts by President Barack Obama to have them join a U.S. -led coalition. Hours after the interview was published, the former head of Obama's Auto Task Force, Steven Rattner, tweeted that Trump \"has no idea how oil market works. We take only about 10% of what Saudi Arabia produces.\" SECURITY EXPERTS SLAM CRUZ ON MUSLIM PLAN: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has called for increased surveillance in Muslim communities in the United States in the wake of last week's terrorist attacks in Brussels --and two national security experts, including a Republican member of Congress, were critical of th e GOP hopeful's plan ( CBS News ). \"To send inflammatory messages could actually have an unintended consequence,\" said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R -Texas). He added that Muslim communities are situated very differently in Euro pe, noting that they tend to be more segregated and thus easier for members of those communities to become radicalized. \"In Europe it's very segregated, and you have the diasporas in Belgium that I saw,\" he said. \"And they're being radicalized because they 're not assimilated with the culture. I don't think we have that same situation in the United States.\" John Miller, the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism for the New York Police Department, also criticized Cruz's plan. \"When you have people campaigning through fear and using that as leverage, and then giving advice to police to be the cudgel of that fear, that's not the direction American policing should be taking in a democracy,\" he said. HOW GOP ELITES LOST THE BASE: In dozens of interviews, Republican lawmakers, donors, activists and others described \u2014 some with resignation, some with anger \u2014 a party that paved the way for a Trump -like figure to steal its base, as it lost touch with less affluent voters and misunderstood their gro wing anguish ( New York Times). \"This is absolutely a crisis for the party elite \u2014 and beyond the party elite, for elected officials, and for the way people have been raised as Republicans in the power structure for a generation,\" said Ari Fleischer, who se rved as press secretary for President George W. Bush. \"If Donald Trump wins, he will change what it means to be a Republican.\" Many trace the rupture to the country's economic crisis eight years ago: While Americans grew more skeptical of the banking indus try in the aftermath, some Republicans played down the frustrations of their own voters. While wages declined and workers grew anxious about retirement, Republicans offered an economic program still centered on tax cuts for the affluent and the curtailing of popular entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. And where working -class voters saw immigrants filling their schools and competing against them for jobs, Republican leaders saw an emerging pool of voters to court. \"They have to come to terms with what they created,\" said Laura Ingraham, a conservative activist and talk -radio host. \"They'll talk about everything except the fact that their policies are unpopular.\" \"These voters would have loved someone to stand up and say, 'We should put someone in jail,'\" said Matthew Dowd, a political consultant and former adviser to President Bush. While jobs in places like Buffalo were vanishing, Washington was coming to resemble a gilded city of lobbyists, contractors and lawmakers. In 2014, the median wealth of members of Congress reached $1 million, about 18 times that of the typical American household, according to disclosures tabulated by the Center for Responsive Politics. During the same year, real hourly wages remained flat or fell for nearly all American workers. GOP ELITES SLOW TO EMBRACE CRUZ: As Sen. Ted. Cruz seeks to unite the disparate factions of the Republican Party that are bonded only by their dead -set opposition to Donald J. Trump, a high -wire act is required: welcoming the top ranks of the sa me establishment he has spent years excoriating while not abandoning the hard - line conservatives who like him in part because of his attacks on party leaders ( New York Times). While the Romney and Bush endorsements drew headlines, what has been just as str iking is the sound of silence from the vast majority of Republican elected officials and leading donors. Nearly two weeks after Senator Marco Rubio dropped out of the race, there has been no mass rush to Mr. Cruz, even as he appears to be the last line of defense against a Trump nomination. The decision by so many leading Republicans to remain on the sidelines is all the more notable because it appears inversely proportional to the scale of concern about Mr. Trump. His recent attacks on Mr. Cruz's wife and soaring unpopularity among women, minorities and college - educated voters have left many in the party more convinced than ever that, with Mr. Trump as their standard -bearer, they are churning toward a political iceberg this fall. \"They're afraid of Trump's voters and they hate Cruz,\" explained Senator Lindsey Graham, who has tried to rally his colleagues behind Mr. Cruz. \"But if I can swallow my pride, they can, too.\" CRUZ DENIES AFFAIRS: Sen. Ted Cruz on Friday vehemently denied a story in the National Enquirer that accused him of extramarital affairs and blamed rival Donald Trump for planting \"complete and utter lies\" in the tabloid ( Washington Post ). Cruz accused Trump and his associates of hawking a false story that the married Texas senator had sexual relationships with five unidentified women. The allegations come amid a nasty feud between the two candidates over their wives that has dominated the Republican presidential race this week . \"Let me be clear, this National Enquirer story is garbage,\" Cruz told reporters after a rally at a parking -cone factory here, bringing up the subject himself. \"It is complete and utter lies. It is a tabloid smear, and it is a smear that has come from Don ald Trump and his henchmen.\" Trump, in a statement, said he had \"no idea\" whether the story was true and said he had nothing to do with it. \"Ted Cruz's problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O.J. Simpson, J ohn Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin' Ted Cruz,\" Trump wrote. DNC CHAIR CALLS TRUMP MOST 'MYSOGYNISTIC CANDIDATE': Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Sunday blamed the Republican Party for the rise of its front -runner Donald Trump, calling him the most \"misogynistic candidate in modern times\" ( The Hill). \"This is an unprecedented political campaign for president, I've never seen anything like it,\" she said in a radio interview with John Catsimatidis. \"We have a race unfolding on the other side that has been complete and utter chaos. You know, the Republicans have been criticizing Donald Trump and some suggesting he hijacked their party.\" SANDERS TAKES AIM AT WISCONSIN, NY: In a mathemat ical squeeze to make up ground in the Democratic presidential race, Bernie Sanders is preparing to ratchet up his attacks on Hillary Clinton ahead of a New York showdown that could establish how easily the party can pull itself back together for the genera l election ( Washington Post ). The Empire State's April 19 primary looms as potentially determinative: A win by Clinton, who is favored, would further narrow Sanders's path, while a loss in the state she represented as a senator would embarrass her and hand Sanders a rationale to continue campaigning until the final votes are cast in June. Clinton had a lead of roughly 300 in pledged delegates, but Sanders narrowed the gap Saturday with a sweep of three Western caucuses. In one of the most successful days of his campaign, the senator from Vermont easily won in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state. To capitalize on his fresh momentum, Sanders plans an aggressive push in New York, modeled after his come -from-behind victory a few weeks ago in Michigan. TRUMP LE ADS IN CALIFORNIA POLL: Donald Trump leads the Republican field in California more than two months before the state's primary, according to a new statewide poll of Republicans (Politico). Trump leads with 37 percent among registered Republicans in Californ ia, according to a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released Sunday. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz follows with 30 percent, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich trails with 12 percent. CLINTON TO TAKE AIM AT GRASSLEY ON SCOTUS: Hillary Clinton on Monday will make an old f oe the center of a new battle ( Poiitico ). In a speech about the Supreme Court that Clinton is scheduled to deliver at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the Democratic front -runner is expected to single out Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and challenge him t o hold hearings on the nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated last month by the death of Antonin Scalia, according to a campaign official. Singling out Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in particular, pits old antagonists against each other again. Grassley has lead the Senate investigation into Clinton's use of a personal email server at the State Department. Sunday Talk TRUMP CALLS GOP A 'DISGRACE': Republican presidential front -runner Donald Trump in an interview Sunday blasted reports that rival Ted Cruz will pick up extra delegates in Louisiana ( The Hill ). \"Welcome to the Republican Party,\" he said on ABC's \"This Week. \"What's going on in the Republ ican Party is a disgrace.\" The Wall Street Journal reported that Cruz could end up getting 10 more delegates from Louisiana than Trump despite the businessman winning the state's primary. Cruz is likely to pick up the five delegates left behind when Marco Rubio ended his campaign, the newspaper reported, as well as the state's five unbound delegates who can back a candidate of their choosing. \"I won Louisiana and now I hear he's trying to steal delegates,\" Trump said Sunday. TRUMP SAYS NATIONAL ENQUIRER H AS 'GOOD RECORD': Republican presidential front -runner Donald Trump on Sunday said he \"totally\" guarantees that no one tied to his campaign had anything to do with a tabloid report targeting rival Ted Cruz ( The Hill). \"I had nothing to do with it,\" Trump s aid on ABC's \"This Week. \"The campaign had absolutely nothing to do with it. \"He's got a problem with The National Enquirer. I have no control over The National Enquirer. I didn't even know about the story. I just got it last night. Somebody sent it to me over to read, so I could at least see what it said.\" Trump said it was \"disgraceful\" that Cruz would say the billionaire had anything to do with it. CRUZ CALLS TRUMP SPOUSE ATTACK 'DISGUSTING': GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz in an interview Sunday sla mmed Donald Trump's attacks on the Texas senator's wife, saying they have \"no place in politics\" ( The Hill). \"Attacking spouses and children is off -limits,\" Cruz said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"It has no place in politics...its frankly disgusting to see a cand idate attacking the spouse of another.\" Last week, the front-runner threatened to \"spill the beans\" on Cruz's wife in response to an ad from an anti-Trump super -PAC that featured of a photo of Trump's wife, Melania, posing nude. Trump then shared a tweet t he next day which included an image of his wife, a former model, and Cruz's wife next to one another with the statement \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\" Cruz shot back at Trump and told him to leave his wife out of the campaign. Cruz denied on Sunday knowing anything about the ad featuring Trump's wife, and called it \"deplorable.\" \"As soon as I saw it I denounced it and said it was wrong,\" he said. \"There are a whole lot of people in America who disagree with Donald Trump.\" KASICH SAYS FAMILIES SHOU LD BE OFF LIMITS: Republican presidential hopeful John Kasich in an interview broadcast Sunday bemoaned the state of the 2016 GOP race, saying \"families have to be off -limits\" ( The Hill). \"I mean, you cannot get these attacks on families,\" the Ohio governo r said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"If this becomes the order of the day, what kind of people are we going to have in the future that are going to run for public office?\" Kasich asked. Kasich's comments follow a week during which GOP rivals Donald Trump and Ted Cruz attacked each other over their wives as the race turned even nastier. SANDERS CLAIMS MOMENTUM: After three big wins out west, Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said he thinks many of the party's superdelegates who have pledged to r ival Hillary Clinton will switch to his side ( The Hill). \"I think the momentum is with us,\" Sanders said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" with Jake Tapper on Sunday. \"A lot of these superdelegates may rethink their positions with Secretary Clinton.\" KERRY CONCERNED ABOUT MORE ATTACKS: Less than a week after deadly bombings in Brussels claimed over 30 lives, including at least two Americans, and left hundreds more injured, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed fears that more terror attacks coul d threaten Europe in the future. In an interview with CBS' \"Face the Nation\" scheduled to air Sunday, Kerry was asked by moderator John Dickerson how worried he was about another terrorist strike. \"Well, I think everybody is concerned,\" Kerry said. \"Becaus e for several years now, foreign fighters have been returning from Syria or from other locations and implanting themselves in the communities. And this is the threat that we've all been aware of.\" KERRY CALLS MUSLIM CAMPAIGN RHETORIC 'EMBARRASSING': Secretary of State John Kerry said the rhetoric on the 2016 campaign trail about Muslim immigration and torture are an \"embarrassment\" to the United States. As world leaders watch the U.S. presidential election, Kerry said, \"I think it is fair to say that they 're shocked,\" he said Saturday in an interview on CBS' \" Face the Nation.\" \"It upsets people's sense of equilibrium about our steadiness, about our reliability, and to some degree I must say to you, some of the questions the way they're posed to me it's cle ar to me that what's happening is an embarrassment to our country.\" Though he didn't mention anyone by name, Kerry may have been referring to GOP front -runner Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, both of whom have called for greater surveillance of Muslim communities in the United States. Trump has also called for a halt on Muslim immigration to the U.S. KERRY SAYS TERRORIST WON'T SET OBAMA SCHEDULE: Responding to critics of President Obama's decision to attend a baseball game in Cuba shortly after Tuesday's terror attacks in Brussels, Secretary of State John Kerry borrowed the words of conservative writer Charles Krauthammer, declaring, \"The president of the United States' schedule is not set by terrorists\" ( CBS News ). Mr. Obama was on the second full day of his historic visit to Cuba when ISIS -affiliated terrorists bombed several sites in Brussels, killing at least 31 people and injuring over 300. The president addressed the attacks shortly after they occurred, but he decided to maintain his prearranged plan to go to a baseball game with Cuban President Raul Castro. And on Wednesday, during a visit to Argentina, the president accepted an invitation to dance a tango during a state dinner. KASICH SAYS HE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO BASEBALL GAME: Republican presidential hopeful John Kasich in an interview broadcast early Sunday ramped up his criticism of President Obama's trip to a baseball game in Cuba hours after the \"slaughter\" in \"the heart of Europe\" ( The Hill ). \"If I were president, I'm just telling you what I would do. I wouldn't have gone to a baseball game in Cuba,\" Kasich said on NBC's \" Meet the Press .\" \"I would have come home. \"I would have called a ll the world leaders. I would have gathered my intelligence and military experts. And I would have sent them to Europe to sit down, to assess our vulnerabilities,\" the Ohio governor said. \"I mean, I'm not overreacting here. But you also can't underreact,\" he added. General Assembly STOOPS, ELLINGTON ON ROAD FUNDING: District 62 state Rep. Jeff Ellington, R - Bloomington, said more money will go to local governments for road and bridge projects, and said that within his district, which is made up of most o f Greene County and portions of Monroe, Martin and Daviess counties, 32 percent of bridges are either deficient or obsolete (Bloomington Herald -Times). He said this will help local governments start on projects sooner rather than later. The next step will be determining how to keep this type of funding going on a yearly basis, Ellington said. \"For what we got in a short session, this was a good deal,\" Ellington said. State Sen. Mark Stoops, D -Bloomington, said 90 percent of the roads in Indiana are local ro ads, and the funding is a step forward. He said the maintenance deficit in the state on local roads is about $500 million a year. \"It's about time we identified the problem with our road and bridge infrastructure,\" Stoops said. \"Even though this is a short -term fix, it is better than nothing.\" SEN. ROGERS CALLS FOR SCHOOL BUS SEATBELTS: Calls for seatbelts on Indiana's school buses are growing after a bus carrying a high school basketball team overturned in a crash ( Associated Press ). The Griffith team wa s traveling to a state tournament game March 19 when police say the bus was sideswiped by a car and rolled over into a ditch near DeMotte. An assistant coach was hospitalized with non -life- threatening injuries, while the other 26 players and staff members on the bus were treated and released. Like most states, Indiana doesn't require seatbelts on school buses. Two bills in the Legislature calling for school bus seatbelts to be required didn't receive committee hearings this year. State Sen. Earline Rogers o f Gary has sent a letter to legislators asking for the issue to be put on a legislative study committee's agenda. WINNECKE WILL USE WHEEL TAX: Under House Bill 1001, cities with a population of more than 10,000 can now enact their own wheel tax. Up until now, wheel taxes were strictly a county option (Osowski, Evansville Courier & Press ). \"At this time I would not support creating a city wheel tax,\" Mayor Lloyd Winnecke said. \"However, we appreciate knowing that option is available.\" Evansville currently gets $1 million a year from Vanderburgh County's wheel tax, Winnecke said. Gibson and Warrick counties also have some form of wheel tax, although the amounts vary. Unless lawmakers come back next year with a different, sustainable revenue stream for local roads, all counties could be looking at needing to up the wheel tax. Although all local government units, from towns to townships, will get some money, the bigger units, like the counties and Evansville, get more of the money. Evansville is set to bring in $3.7 million, which Winnecke said will go toward his new \"Municipal Moves\" project. \"We have every intention of using the income tax money for streets, roads and bridges,\" Winnecke said. \"It's a nice infusion into our budget.\" SUPPORT FOR HEA1337: Indiana is once again at the center of a heated national debate after Governor Mike Pence signed a controversial abortion bill Friday. Pence said in a statement the legislation protects the unborn while allowing an exception for the life of the mother (Bro sher, Indiana Public Media ). The wide -ranging legislation prohibits abortions under certain conditions and requires aborted or miscarried fetuses to be buried or cremated.The happiness on 8 -year-old Tommy O'Callaghan's face reflects the impact he has on hi s family's life. When we're using fear and misinformation to make judgements about the worth of a life, then to me that's prejudice. \u2014Mary O'Callaghan, Supports abortion ban \"If you talk to most families who have a child with Down syndrome they'll tell you the child is a joy in their life,\" says his mother Mary O'Callaghan. Tommy is the youngest of five children and the only one living with Down syndrome. But to O'Callaghan, he's just like the rest of her kids. That's why she's in favor of House Enrolled Ac t 1337 which, among other things, bans abortions solely because of the fetus' race, sex or disability. \"There was something probably about the immediacy of holding this sweet baby in my arms who was so beautiful. And I was really just frankly heartbroken t o contemplate the enormous loss of lives of children who looked just like him in our country,\" O'Callaghan says. OPPOSITION TO HEA1337: While supporters of the bill say it will prevent discrimination, opponents argue it does the opposite ( Indiana Public Media ). \"It is more likely in case of race and sex bans that pregnant people of color are the ones who will be most targeted by these bans because it is those stereotypes against these communities that will play out in the doctor's office as those patients try to explain themselves and the doctor tries to determine whether or not these people are telling the truth,\" says Harmony Glenn, an Indy Feminists board member. Glenn and dozens of women from the grassroots group delivered petitions to the statehouse l ast week asking Governor Mike Pence to veto the legislation. They're unhappy with how, among other things, legislators handled the issue. After a senate bill focusing on the abortion ban failed to get a hearing in the house, lawmakers added the measure to a house bill focusing on the disposal of fetal remains. \"We're dealing with mandates that, rather than supporting people at a time when they most need accurate information, compassionate support, are designed to shame, demean, coerce, for no reason at all other to attempt to discourage people from accessing what is a safe and legal procedure,\" Glenn says. State GOVERNOR: PENCE STATEMENT ON HEA1337: Gov. Mike Pence issued the following statement after signing House Enrolled Act (HEA) 1337 ( Howey Politics Indiana ): \"Throughout my public career, I have stood for the sanctity of life. HEA 1337 is a comprehensive pro -life measure that affirms the value of all human life, which is why I signed it into law today. I believe that a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable \u2014the aged, the infirm, the disabled and the unborn. HEA 1337 will ensure the dignified final treatment of the unborn and prohibits abortions that a re based only on the unborn child's sex, race, color, national origin, ancestry, or disability, including Down syndrome. Some of my most precious moments as Governor have been with families of children with disabilities, especially those raising children w ith Down syndrome. These Hoosiers never fail to inspire me with their compassion and these special children never fail to move me with their love and joy. By enacting this legislation, we take an important step in protecting the unborn, while still providi ng an exception for the life of the mother. I sign this legislation with a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families.\" GOVERNOR: FICHTER PRAISES PENCE ON HEA1337 - Indiana Right to Life commends Gov. Mike Pence for signing the dignity for the unborn bill (House Enrolled Act 1337) ( Howey Politics Indiana ). \"Gov. Pence has long been a champion for the unborn and their mothers,\" said Mike Fichter, President and CEO o f Indiana Right to Life. \"By signing the dignity for the unborn bill, Gov. Pence has again signified his commitment to protecting life. We are pleased that our state values life no matter an individual's potential disability, gender or race. We also believ e that the other measures in the bill are positive steps forward for providing dignity and compassion.\" GOVERNOR: DGA BLASTS HEA1337 - The Democratic Governors Association released the following statement after Gov. Mike Pence signed a bill making Indian a the second state to ban abortions in the case of genetic fetal abnormalities (Howey Politics Indiana). \"Mike Pence has shown yet again that his priorities are out of step with Indiana,\" said DGA Communications Director Jared Leopold. \"While Indiana falls behind on job creation, Governor Pence has led the way on a reckless social agenda that has harmed Indiana's economy. Hoosier voters are tired of Mike Pence's misplaced priorities, and they're ready for a change in November.\" Pence signed the bill over th e objections of numerous Republican pro -life lawmakers who argued the bill was too extreme. \"I feel this is government overreaching,\" said Republican Rep. Cindy Kirchhofer when voting against the measure. \"The bill does nothing to save innocent lives. Ther e's no education, there's no funding. It's just penalties,\" said Republican Rep. Sharon Negele. Pence also bucked the calls of editorial boards that asked him set aside his own ideology and veto the bill: \"We would urge Gov. Mike Pence to veto this hastily passed, constitutionally dubious and morally muddled bill on behalf of the people he represents - all Hoosiers, not just those who share his personal beliefs,\" wrote the Fort Wayne Journal -Gazette editorial board. ECONOMY: JOBLESS RATE UP TO 4.7% - The state's unemployment rate ticked up last month as more than 20,000 Hoosiers entered the labor force for a second consecutive month, the Indiana Department of Workforce Development announced Friday morning ( IBJ). Indiana's seasonally adjusted unemployme nt rate rose to 4.7 percent in February, up from 4.6 percent the previous two months, the DWD said. The agency said 43,708 Hoosiers entered the labor force in January and February, boosting Indiana's labor force participation rate to 64.6 percent, well ahe ad of the national average of 62.9 percent. Almost 82 percent, or 35,682, of those entering the Indiana labor force in the past two months found employment, the state said, but the increased size of the labor force resulted in the higher unemployment rate. \"In the past two months, more than 35,000 Hoosiers rejoined the labor force and found employment due to the strong Hoosier economy,\" said Indiana Department of Workforce Development Commissioner Steven Braun in a written statement. \"This growth is even more impressive when compared to the 11,376 individuals who joined the labor force in January and February of 2015.\" EDUCATION: NEXT ISTEP FACES POLITICAL HURDLES - Gov. Mike Pence dealt the final blow to Indiana's ISTEP student test last week, signing int o law a repeal of the controversial exam after mounting concerns over computer glitches, lengthier tests and tougher learning standards. That was the easy part ( IndyStar ). Now state education officials will undertake the heavy lift of determining a replace ment for the Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress \u2014 a fixture for Hoosier schoolchildren in one form or another for nearly 30 years and a source of increasing frustration for teachers. In doing so, the state will dump a testing brand it has s pent hundreds of millions of dollars to build and find a replacement under a quick timeline. A panel has until Dec. 1 to recommend a new standardized test Hoosier students will begin taking in the 2017 - 18 school year. Any new test likely will resemble the ISTEP \u2014 at least in its content. Unknown is how far educators will go in altering the test. Will they undertake robust revisions? Or will they simply change the name and keep the exam the same? The future of the state's testing program is now in the hands of a 23 -member panel whose design has already sparked a political fight. Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Glenda Ritz and her supporters are mad the Republican -controlled General Assembly didn't appoint her to lead the group. Instead, Pence, wh o has butted heads with Ritz over education policy, will name the chairperson. Ritz, a Democrat, has blasted the Republican governor, saying the head of the panel will be a \"political appointee of the most political person in the state.\" Responding to thos e claims, Pence argued the panel is \"very well balanced,\" with an emphasis on teachers and school administrators serving as members. Politics seem to creep into every education policy discussion in Indiana, said Betsy Wiley, CEO of Institute for Quality Ed ucation. But Wiley said the panel could take on a different tone. \"I think during an election year it will be very difficult to turn that corner, but perhaps with the large makeup of the board we can get past that a little bit and focus on the policy, whic h is where I think we need to be,\" Wiley said. MEDICAID: KAISER SURVEYS HIP2.0 - Reginald Rogers owes his dentist a debt of gratitude for his new dentures, but no money (NWI Times). Indiana's Medicaid program has them covered, a godsend for the almost to othless former steelworker who hasn't held a steady job for years and lives in his daughter's basement. \"I just need to get my smile back,\" Rogers, 59, told his dentist at a clinic here recently. \"I can't get a job unless I can smile.\" Rogers is among the more than 240,000 low -income people who gained health coverage in the past year when Indiana expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. Rogers pays $1 a month \u2014 a fee that is a hallmark of the state's controversial plan. Healthy Indiana pushes M edicaid's traditional boundaries, which is why it has the attention of other conservative states. The plan demands something from all enrollees, even those below the poverty line. Since Indiana's expansion began in February 2015, more than 235,000 previous ly uninsured able -bodied adults have signed up. As of late February, the plan covered more than 370,000 people total, many with extremely low incomes. Another 190,000 adults are eligible but not enrolled, according to state estimates, though some who are a bove the poverty line may be in subsidized private plans. Michelle Stoughton, senior director of government relations for Anthem, says the response to date represents success. Anthem is one of three private insurers providing coverage under Healthy Indiana . \"What we heard for years ... is that these people won't pay and don't have the ability to pay,\" Stoughton said. \"But this has turned those arguments around and been able to show that people do want to be engaged.\" EDUCATION: JAZZ GREAT DAVID BAKER DIES - David Baker, a prolific jazz composer and musician who founded the jazz studies program at Indiana University, died Saturday at age 84, the school said in a statement ( Associated Press ). The university said Baker died at his home in Bloomington. It did no t disclose a cause of death. He wrote more than 2,000 pieces of music and was nominated for a Grammy in 1979 and a Pulitzer Prize in 1973. In 2000 he was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, the country's highest jazz honor. Baker's love of jazz was cultivated in 1940s Indianapolis, where he grew up. Nation WHITE HOUSE: OBAMA REJECTS MUSLIM STIGMATISM - With at least one Republican candidate for the White House endorsing patrols of U.S. Muslim neighborhoods in the wake of this week's deadly bombings in Brussels, President Obama is cautioning against such approaches, saying any such proposals would \"stigmatize\" Muslim -Americans ( CBS News). \"As we move forward in this fight, we have to wield another weapon alongside our airstrikes, our military, our counterterrorism work and our diplomacy,\" the president said in a video released Saturday. \"That's the power of our example.\" Mr. Obama called on the U.S. to \"reject any attempt to stigmatize Muslim -Americans, and their enormous contributions to our country and our way of life.\" \"Such attempts are contrary to our character, to our values and to our history as a nation built around the idea of religious freedom,\" he said. ILLINOIS: EMANUEL REJECTS PD CHIEF CHOICES - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has reportedly turned down three finalists in search for the city's new police chief and will choose his own top cop. The Chicago Sun -Times reported Saturday that Emanuel asked Eddie Johnson, the city's chief of patrol, to become Chicago's next police chief in an effort to boost officers' morale and restore trust with the community. Emanuel spurned the Police Board's three r ecommended finalists to replace superintendent Garry McCarthy who was fired in December after officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with murder in the shooting death of black teenager Laquan McDonald. According to the Sun -Times, the law requires Emanuel to pi ck from the finalists the Police Board had recommended. Emanuel plans to reject the three names and appoint Johnson to replace interim superintendent John Escalante, following the law. Emanuel will then ask the Police Board to conduct a second search for c andidates. World SYRIANS DRIVE ISIS OUT OF PALMYERA: Syrian government forces backed by Russian airstrikes drove Islamic State fighters from Palmyra on Sunday, ending the group's 10 -month reign of terror over a town whose famed 2,000 -year-old ruins onc e drew tens of thousands of visitors each year ( Associated Press ). Government forces had been on the offensive for nearly three weeks to try to retake the central town, known among Syrians as the \"Bride of the Desert,\" which fell to the extremists last May . Their advance marks the latest in a series of setbacks for IS, which has come under mounting pressure on several fronts in Iraq and Syria in recent months. In comments reported on state TV, President Bashar Assad described the Palmyra operation as a \"sig nificant achievement\" offering \"new evidence of the effectiveness of the strategy espoused by the Syrian army and its allies in the war against terrorism.\" Local CITIES: JEFFERSONVILLE COUNCIL CANDIDATE WINS ELECTION APPEAL - A Clark County judge on Friday confirmed the appeal of a candidate challenging the outcome of the recount in the Jeffersonville City Council At -large race (Rickerts, News & Tribune ). On election night in November, Democrat Joshua Rodriquez was in third place out of six candidates vying for three sets on the council. After a recount petitioned by Republican Steve Webb \u2014 who was in fifth place with votes tallied election night \u2014 Webb was shown to have won the final seat. Clark County Circuit Court No. 2 Judge Andrew Adams' ruling Friday states that Rodriquez presented evidence showing \"procedural defects by the recount commission that affected the outcome of the recount.\" It further st ates that there was sufficient evidence to support that the recount commission tallied votes incorrectly and that sufficient evidence was shown by Rodriquez that the recount commission's procedures \"substantially undermined the reliability of the election and the trustworthiness of the outcome,\" quoted from the 2004 Indiana Supreme Court case Pabey v. Pastrick. A hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. April 11 for Adams to further explain his findings and decide the next step. CITIES: MICHIGAN CITY POISED FOR REVIVAL - According to city officials, things are on the cusp of changing dramatically with the area of Ind. 212 and U.S 12 being primed for industrial development and more upscale housing growth (Maddux , NWI Times) . A new hotel near the lakefront is being eyed as the city's downtown continues its revitalization with eight new restaurants the past 18 months. Test scores in the schools are also up as part of the strategy being closely followed to upgrade the quality of the lo cal workforce. The city also is continuing to demolish blighted properties for redevelopment, and millions of dollars have been invested on upgrading and beautifying U.S 35 to spur new investment in a long -struggling area. In addition, millions of more dollars are earmarked for additional improvements around Blue Chip Casino and the lakefront to enhance the gains in tourism achieved the past decade. So far, the strategies for rebuilding the city's tax base seem to be paying off most noticeably, perhaps, in the downtown with just a few remaining empty storefronts. \"I think the future of Michigan City is definitely bright,\" said Clarence Hulse, executive director of the Economic Development Corp. of Michigan City. CITIES: LOGANSPORT, CASS IN UTILITY DISPUTE - Logansport officials are considering repealing a measure passed by their predecessors establishing utilities dominance outside the city (Kirk , Logansport Pharos -Tribune ). City council passed an ordinance in 2014 setting up a water and sanitary sewage ser vice area within a 4 -mile fringe surrounding Logansport's corporate boundaries. It makes Logansport Municipal Utilities the exclusive provider of water and sanitary sewage service along with service for potable water, non -potable water and water for fire p rotection in that area. The ordinance affected Cass County government's plans to bring fire protection utilities to businesses in Clymers and the Cass County Hoosier Heartland Business Park southwest of Logansport on Ind. 25. Logansport went to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission seeking approval of the ordinance while Cass County went to the commission seeking disapproval of the ordinance. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on attorneys' fees over the months that followed. COUNTIES: KOONTZ SERVICES BEGIN TODAY - Two days of services are set to begin for an Indiana sheriff's deputy who was fatally wounded during a gunfight while trying to arrest a man ( Associated Press ). Visitation for Howard County Deputy Carl Koontz begins Monday afternoon at the high school where he was assigned part -time for the past two years. The 27 -year-old deputy's funeral will be Tuesday at Northwestern High School near Kokomo, with organizers expecting hundreds of police officers in attendance.

HOWEY INDIANAPOLIS - With the General Assembly leaving the capital city today, at - tention now turns to three Senate races, two of which will test leadership of the majority caucus. In two cases, social conservative allies of Gov. Mike Pence are seeking to take out Sen - ate leadership at the very time the governor and those leaders have forged a united front against the House Republican road plan. It comes when rampant anger is fueling the rise of presidential candidates Donald Trump and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders, though this dynamic has yet to take out a single congres - sional incumbent or governor to this point. Trump & P .T . Barnum By BRIAN A. HOWEY INDIANAPOLIS - Donald Trump? Meet my good friend P.T. Barnum. For much of the 19th Century, Barnum delighted and confounded patrons on two continents with a circus and a freak show filled with amazing characters. The phrase \"There's a sucker born every minute\" is often attributed to Barnum, though some speculate it was actually uttered by David Hannum. It is an apt description of Barnum and his customers. On Tuesday night, fresh off victories in John Kasich's neighboring Michigan and Ted Cruz's neighboring Mississippi, Donald Trump added to the pro - Continued on page 3 Senate Appropriations Chairman Luke Kenley and Senate President David Long will now attempt to fend off primary challengers in the May 3 primary.

It capped a week where Trump flip-flopped on torture, whether his national security team even ex - isted, and his penchant for making his crowds take an oath of allegiance, the optics of which had some comparing him to Adolf Hitler at Nuremburg. We witnessed Hoosier supporters forc - ibly remove a black woman from his rally in Louisville. It came after 2012 nominee Mitt Romney tried to derail the Trump circus, calling him a \"fraud\" and a \"phony.\" Trump responded by suggesting that Romney would have performed a sexual act on his knees to get his endorsement four years ago. Fellatio sure spiced up the Clinton presidency, so why not invoke it now? Trump's victory speech at Trump National Golf Club Jupiter was a stunning piece of narcissism. It is a place of luxury where 95 percent of the blue-collared, angry, white Ameri - cans voting for Trump will never get a chance to plant a flip-flop, let alone sink a putt. Trump was in his ele - ment and it was all about him and his products. In a speech worthy of a K- Tel commercial, Trump cited his array of business successes: Trump vodka, Trump steaks, Trump water, Trump magazine. I could not find a count of how many times he used the word \"I\" or \"me.\" The only flaw was that Trump didn't bring enough steaks, vodka, water and magazines for everyone in the room. Or, as Mr. Barnum would say, \"I believe hugely in advertising and blowing my own trumpet, beating the gongs, drums, etc., to attract attention to a show; but I never believed that any amount of advertising or energy would make a spurious article perma - nently successful.\" Trump explained, \"Mitt got up and he really shouldn't have done it. It wasn't very becoming. He talked about the water company. Well there's the water company.\" Trump then pointed at a table offstage. \"I mean, we sell water. And it's a very success - ful, you know it's a private little water company, and I supply the water for all my places and it's good. \"I have very successful com - panies. I filed with the Federal Elec - tions [Commission] 100 pages almost, 100 pages that many of the press have gone down and seen and they were all very, very impressed. I built a great, great company. I have very low debt, I have assets like this, owned 100 percent by me with no debt.\" Or as Mr. Barnum once put it, \"Nobody ever lost a dollar by under - estimating the taste of the American public.\" Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer watched as the networks stayed transfixed even as Hillary Clinton spoke, observing on Fox Page 2 News, \"I don't think I've seen such a stream of disconnected ideas since I quit psychiatry 30 years ago.\" Trump then played an attack TV ad aimed at him that featured dozens of \"bleeped\" cuss words from an array of his speeches. The 30-second spot by the American Future Fund Political Action run - ning in Florida ahead of the crucial March 15 primary has Trump say - ing: n \"Listen you mother------.\" n \"He gets the nomination, they're gonna sue his a--\" n \"She said he's a p-----.\" n \"We'll beat the sh-- out of them.\" And Trump pronounced it all good as he continued to scoop up evangelical support. Mr. Barnum once observed, \"Never cater to the baser instincts of humanity, strive as I have always done to elevate the moral tone of amusements, and always remember that the children have ever been our best patrons. I would rather hear the pleased laugh of a child over some feature of my exhibition than receive as I did the flattering compliments of the Prince of Wales.\" At one point dur - ing his infomercial, Trump said, \"Advertising is not as important as competence.\" Tuesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Mika Brzezinski asked if Trump had formed a national security advisory committee, something that former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers had been urging contenders to do for more than a year now during this, the age of ISIS. Trump responded, \"Yes, there is a team.\" He then quickly reversed him - self, saying, \"There's not a team. I'm going to be forming a team. I've met with far more than three people, and I'll be forming a team at the appropriate time.\" Mr. Barnum once said , \"You know I had rather be laughed at than not to be noticed at all...\" So it's been a stunning week in American politics. Unless John Kasich can defeat Trump in his home state of Ohio on March 15 (CNN/ORC has Trump leading Kasich 41-35%) or Marco \"Bambi\" Rubio can salvage his home state of Florida (CNN/ORC has Trump leading Rubio 40- 24% there), Donald Trump will be well on his way to the Republican presidential nomination. Or, as Mr. Barnum once said, \"Never give a sucker an even break.\" vPage 3 Challengers, from page 1 off a Westfield businessman Scott Willis, in SD20. State Sen. Pete Miller is facing an aggressive challenge from John Crane in SD24. At this point, it doesn't appear that Long and Kenley are in as much danger as Senate Finance Chairman Larry Borst was at this point in 2004 and Senate President Robert Garton was in 2006. Borst and Garton were vulnerable to pro-life and pro-right-to-work forces. Garton had also aroused populist anger with his 2002 legislator health care for life deal. Long has angered social con - servatives and family advocacy groups for attempting to find a compromise on LGBT civil rights expansion. Both Long and Kenley were cognizant of the com -ing challenges and began preparing months ago. Sen - ate Majority Caucus sources tell HPI that internal polling shows both to have strong reelect and favorable numbers. Having said that, primary challenges of this type find a more conservative, activist voter than in general elections, and since 2002 more GOP senators - Borst, Gar - ton, Steve Johnson in 2002 and John Waterman in 2014 - have lost in primaries than in general elections. Factor in unusual nature of this cycle and outsider pique at estab - lishment Republicans, and there is a wildcard dynamic in place. So these races could develop late and merit atten - tion. Long and Miller are facing challenges fueled by the family advocacy groups with social issues the key issue, most specifically the recent LGBT civil rights expansion. Kenley's challenge appears to be coming from the educa - tion realm. Long ($678,000) and Kenley ($253,000) have the protection of huge war chests, while Miller was sitting on $48,000 at the beginning of the year. With the General Assembly out of session, all three can begin to add or Sen. Pete Millerreplenish. Last week, the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette reported that the American Family Association headed by Micah Clark had sent out \"scathing\" direct mail titled, \"Liar Liar Politicians on Fire.\" It was in response to radio and cable TV buys by Long in which he defended his role in legislation that attempted to expand civil rights to LGB groups. Clark is accusing Long of bowing to the \"homo - sexual lobby.\" The Journal Gazette also reported that while Long has a 95% pro-life voting record with Indiana Right to Life, he has killed pro-life bills behind the scenes. One example was a proposed bill this year to make it illegal to abort a baby if a heartbeat was detectable. That legislation was assigned to committee and didn't get a hearing. And Clark claims Long had to be persuaded to allow an amend - ment to defund Planned Parenthood several years ago. When asked about the email, Long told the Journal Gazette's Brian Francisco, \"I don't pay attention to Micah Clark, so I have no comment on that.\" In addition to Clark, Tea Party activist Monica Boyer has joined the fray, pushing her network to support Kes - sler, who was recruited for the challenge in the week prior to the Feb. 5 filing deadline. The Kes - sler campaign has some money and has begun grassroots organizing. On March 5, Boyer posted on her Facebook page about the LGBT legislation: \"They tried to allow this in Indiana this year. Now, Senator David Long and Senator Holdman tried to fix this conundrum in SB 100 by saying this man had to wait a year and live as a woman or man before coming into the bathroom of the opposite sex. (All the ladies say whaaaaat?!!??) Thank goodness cooler heads prevailed and they were forced to scrap that bill for another that also did not pass, but Senator Long promised the issue would be back next year. He must be replaced.\" Boyer told HPI on Tuesday, \"I knew there was an effort to find a conservative to run against Sen. Long, but I did not have the privilege to get to know Prof. Kes - sler prior to his filing for this campaign. When I met him... wow! I found that not only does he support the issue so near and dear to my heart, his knowledge of the economy and the sanctity of life are outstanding. He really is a well- rounded conservative candidate. I decided that day that I would not only support him, but that my family would be willing to sacrifice our time and finances for him.\" Boyer added, \"I think this could be the most impactful primary in the state this year. That impact is felt statewide. We have a tremendous ground game. There are volunteers and donations coming from all over the state. I believe he will have the money to do the things we need to do to win. Sen. Long is extremely vulnerable because of the general anti-incumbency sentiment, the fact that Long has a voting track record that puts him at odds with his constituents on a broad array of issues. How do our boots on the ground beat the establishment money? We win by simply informing the public of Sen. Long's record. Door by door...\" \"It's something we're watching closely,\" said Matt Zapfe, who heads the Senate Majority Campaign Committee. \"I can't quantify what it's going to look like.\" He described Kessler as a relative newcomer, and someone who \"has not been on the front lines\" of Boyer's political operations that were, in part, responsible for the 2014 primary defeats of State Reps. Kathy Heuer in a district that over - laps Long's, and Rebecca Kubacki. Zapfe said that Long had antici - pated a primary challenge after he and State Sen. Travis Holdman unveiled LGBT expansion legislation in November. \"Sen. Long has been staffing up and has been preparing for this since December.\" Long has been advertising on WOWO on the re - ligious freedom issue. Boyer said that once the ad began running, \"I got phone calls from people I didn't even know, asking me how a politician can so easily lie on the radio. People are not fooled by this kind of thing.\" Zapfe and the SMCC are keenly aware of dynamic in place that has been fueling the campaigns of Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side. The Long campaign knows that this could change quickly and that Trump has the potential to bring out new voters. It is something Marlin Stutzman's U.S. Senate campaign has acknowledged. Whether a Trump voters will vote on down ballot races is a key question with no answer at this point. Kenley's challenger, Scott Willis, is not com - ing from the social conservative right. He has articulated education funding issues. There has been some specula - tion that the Indiana building trades groups are preparing to spend money against Kenley for his role in blocking HB1001, the House Republican road plan. Zapfe is monitoring negative robocalls coming into the district on behalf of Willis, who had not filed a cam - paign committee by the end of 2015 reporting deadline, making it impossible at this point to know of his financial wherewithall. There are also reports that some veterans groups are targeting Kenley. Zapfe said that internal polling shows strong reelects with Long and Kenley. \"We don't see any weaken - ing,\" he said. Kenley's numbers are weaker in the Westfield portion of his district where he is running for the first time Page 4 IPFW Prof. John Kessler (left) is challenging Senate President David Long and Westfield businessman Scott Willis is challenging Sen. Luke Kenley.since reapportionment. But, he added, Kenley is still \"running surprisingly strong\" there. Both will need strong ground games and both senators are aware of the unusual climate they face. Like Long, Sen. Miller's challenger is being fueled by family advocacy groups, in this case Curt Smith of the Indiana Family Institute. Smith, who has been promising primary challengers to those supporting civil rights expansion, observed, \"John Crane is a leader of ex - traordinary vision and integrity. His principled, practical understanding of the issues facing Indiana make him an ideal Hoosier to represent our views and values as a common-sense voice in the Legislature. And as we all know too well, common-sense in public life is actually quite rare these days.\" Smith and Clark view select primary challenges as a way to instill future discipline on issues such as civil rights expansion. An upset of either Long, Kenley or Miller would capture the attention of the entire caucus.Page 5 Crane's campaign is focused on social issues. He says that \"marriage, as designed by our Creator, is to be between a man and a woman. And social science has repeatedly con - firmed that the ideal scenario for a child's well-being is to be raised in a home where both biological parents are present and lovingly invested in their upbringing.\" Crane says he will \"protect human life at every stage of the human life cycle.\" And, Crane said , \"The current erosion of these bedrock constitu - tional principles creates a crack in our societal foundation that, if left un - checked, will be the cause of our own undoing.\" Zapfe believes that the Crane campaign could benefit from \"some overlap\" with the Stutzman U.S. Sen - ate campaign. Miller was appointed to this seat in 2012 and is up for his first reelection bid. He is running ads on cable TV for the past week. HPI Horse Race Status: Likely Long and Ken - ley; Leans Miller. v Republican John Crane, from a video on his Facebook page, as he takes on State Sen. Pete Miller. Click on this adSupreme process differs, but politics remain By BRIAN A. HOWEY ZIONSVILLE - Here in the emerging Trumpian era of the rant and the screed, I had one of my own in Mon - day's HPI Daily Wire. It went like this: \"Nationally, U.S. Senate Republicans with the sup - port of Sen. Dan Coats have said that the decision on se - lecting the next U.S. Supreme Court justice should be held off until after the November election, and should be made by the voters with the nomination coming from the next president. Taking this logic, shouldn't the same dynamic be in effect here in Indiana, where we have an open Supreme Court seat? Shouldn't the voters and the next governor make this decision? Gov. Pence and Sen. Coats owe us a detailed explanation on why such a consistent approach shouldn't be applied in Indiana. And, if there is compel - ling reason to proceed on the state vacancy, but not the national one, we need to have a greater understanding of the difference. We need to know whether political consid - erations have the potential to permeate the state process and what safeguards are in place if that has yet to occur.\" Both the offices of Sen. Dan Coats and Gov. Mike Pence responded, pointing out a huge difference between the state and federal processes. Indi - ana officials are compelled to make an appointment within 60 days of the Judicial Nominating Commission recommendation of three candidates. And this process is intended to take the politics out of the equation. At the federal level, there is no such mechanism to compel senators to do their jobs. Political decisions are made and there is a strong likelihood of a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy extending another 18 months or so until President Trump or President H.R. Clinton (frontrunners at this point) takes the oath and declares a choice. Matt Lahr, communications director for Sen. Coats explains: \"While the U.S. Supreme Court and the Indiana Supreme Court both currently have vacancies, the similarities between the two situations end there. On the federal level, the executive and legislative branches of our federal government are separate but equal. While the Constitution grants the President the power to nominate Supreme Court justices, the Senate must give its \"advice and consent.\" During presidential election years, there is substantial precedent to let the American people weigh in on their next Supreme Court justice by casting their votes. In the past, senators such as Joe Biden have argued that the Senate should not act on a presidential nomination during an election year. In fact, 1888 was the last time a justice was nominated to the Supreme Court in a presiden - tial election year and confirmed by a Senate controlled by the opposing political party. Lahr continues: \"At the state level, a vacancy on the Indiana Supreme Court prompts the Judicial Nominat - ing Commission to urge the public to apply for the posi - tion. Under this process, which was inserted in the Indiana Constitution in 1970, the governor is not involved in the initial vetting and selection of applicants, and the state legislature has no role in the confirmation or selection of judges. Only once the Judicial Nominating Commission selects three finalists does the governor have a chance to weigh in. The governor must choose one of these finalists within 60 days of the commission's announcement. If he does not, the chief justice makes the selection. This entire process is part of Indiana state law. Lahr adds, \"At the federal level, there are no commissions to vet potential Supreme Court nominations. Further, the President not only vets potential judges, he also makes the nomination. The federal process differs significantly from Indiana's commission-centric system, in which the governor is only involved at the final step. Finally, the Indiana State Legislature plays no role in Indiana's process, while the U.S. Senate is a coequal branch of government that may provide its 'advice and consent' in the manner it so chooses.\" That doesn't mean that politics has been removed from the Indiana equation. Sources are telling Howey Politics Indiana that various family advocacy groups are weighing in with the Pence administration on who is acceptable and who isn't and weilding considerable clout. The governor also appoints three of the seven Judicial Nominating Commission seats. At the March 3 swearing in of Lt. Gov. Eric Hol - comb, Geoffrey Slaughter, 53, now an attorney at the Indianapolis firm of Taft, Stettinius and Hollister, was being introduced by Curt Smith of the Indiana Family Institute. Slaughter, along with St. Joseph Superior Judge Steven Hostetler and Boone Superior Court Judge Matthew Kin - caid, were named the finalists by the Judicial Nominating Commission later that afternoon. The optics of this were revealing. Asked if there were litmus tests that Gov. Pence has involving the selec - tion and whether he is being lobbied, Deputy Chief of Staff Matt Lloyd begged off, saying he had been out of the of - fice with the flu for the past few days. Indiana will have a new Supreme Court justice by May. The U.S. Supreme Court will function with eight justices until sometime in mid- to late-2017, and perhaps beyond, depending on the caliber and political attributes of the person President Trump or President Clinton nomi - nates. And, as we've pointed out before, the untimely death of another of the octogenarian justice could double the dynamic. vPage 6 Page 7 Hollingsworth a 'scam artist' charges Zoeller By BRIAN A. HOWEY JEFFERSONVILLE - After weeks of Trey Holling - sworth taking aim at Attorney General Greg Zoeller, defin - ing him as a \"career politician,\" Zoeller took the gloves off Wednesday. Zoeller called Hollingsworth and his Super PAC, Indiana Jobs Now, for being \"political scam artists.\" \"One of my most important roles as Indiana's at - torney general is to protect people against scam artists,\" said Zoeller. \"In doing so, over the years I've warned Hoosiers of the 'red flags' of a scam artist: 1. Someone who suddenly appears that you don't know. 2. Someone, such as an out-of-state salesman, without references that can be checked. 3. Someone who makes claims that are either too good to be true or too bad to be believable. \"I think the people of the 9th District know a scam artist when they see one and these ads are the product of political scam artists.\" He went on to refute, point by point, the false claims made in the most recent ad produced and aired by Trey Holling - sworth's super PAC, Indiana Jobs Now, an ad the India - napolis Star says is \"stretching the truth.\" Zoeller said, \"It's easy in this political environ - ment for negativity to take root and for false accusations to quickly spread and be perceived to be true. So I believe it's important to stand here and take these charges head- on and to do the worst thing you can do to a scam artist: expose them and tell the truth.\" False Charge: Hollingsworth charged that Zoeller supported the Gang of 8 Immigration Bill. Truth: \"For years, I have advocated that Congress finally do its jobs and pass legislation that fixes our im - migration problem...I never once endorsed their bill, their specific proposal, or amnesty. I oppose amnesty.\" False Charge: Hollingsworth maintains that Zoeller refused to challenge President Obama's executive order on immigration Truth: \"I did not refuse to have Indiana join the challenge...what I did was to provide for outside counsel to challenge the president's executive order on immigration because of my ongoing efforts alongside other attorneys general to encourage Congress to do their job.\" In addition, Zoeller pointed out the ironic choice of using a photograph of him standing behind President Obama in the ad. \"It has absolutely nothing to do with immigration. Nothing at all. In fact, it's from a press con - ference at the White House announcing an historic settle - ment between the nation's largest banks and government to provide mortgage holders, including thousands of Hoo - siers. The work of my office resulted in Hoosiers receiving $145 million. It was one of the proudest moments of my tenure as attorney general.\" Zoeller added, \"This is one thing I thank the politi - cal scam artists for: highlighting my record of results on behalf of Hoosiers.\" Young, Stutzman diverge on Lugar Bipartisan index By MARK SCHOEFF JR. WASHINGTON - The two Republicans running for the GOP Senate nomination in the May primary diverge widely on their willingness to work with Democrats on legislation, the latest analysis by a former Hoosier senator shows. Rep. Todd Young, R-9th CD, ranked 138 among House members in the number of bills he co-sponsored with Democrats in 2015, while Marlin Stutzman, R-3rd CD, ranked 435, according to the Bipartisan Index released on March 7 by the Lugar Center and the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy. The Lugar Center is a think tank run by former Sen. Richard Lugar. The latest iteration of the index also shows that GOP Rep. Susan Brooks, at 35, was the Hoosier House member who most often worked across the aisle, while Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly ranked 2nd in the Senate. Retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coats, whom Young and Stutzman are trying to replace, came in at 75. Young and Stutzman, who are engaged in a heated and divisive battle for the GOP nomination, are leg - islating in ways that are influenced by their constituents, according to aides. Young is \"conservative...[who] puts Hoosiers first when he votes or offers legislation,\" campaign manager Trevor Foughty said in a statement. He went on to cite one Young bill that draws little Democratic support, a measure that requires congressional approval of major regulations, and one that has garnered Democratic backing - legislation that would define full- time work as 40 hours per week under the health care reform law. Stutzman \"is proud of his conservative voting re - cord that reflects the priorities and values of the Hoosiers Page 8 he represents in Congress,\" spokeswoman Kelsey Knight said in a statement. \"More often than not, Republicans have the preferred solutions to getting Washington off the backs of Hoosier businesses and to help drive economic growth.\" In a statement, Donnelly referred to himself as \"the hired help\" who must \"get things done\" in the Senate. \"That responsibility has nothing to do with party affilia - tion and everything to do with supporting the best ideas, regardless of whether the idea comes from a Republican or a Democrat,\" Donnelly said. The Bipartisan Index quantifies how frequently legislators sign on to bills originated by the other party and attract members from the opposite side to bills they write. \"Lawmakers with strong ideological views can still find common ground with members across the aisle if they make an effort to do so,\" Lugar, who served for 36 years in the Senate, said in a statement. \"Some members of Con - gress have embraced this challenge, despite the intensely partisan political culture exemplified in the national presi - dential campaigns.\" Democrat Baron Hill for Indiana Campaign Man - ager Luke Quandt called out Marlin Stutzman for being ranked last in the Lugar Center's 2015 Bipartisan Index. \"Marlin Stutzman puts his radical right-wing ideology ahead of working Hoosier families,\" said Hill campaign manager Luke Quandt. \"He would rather shut down the government than fix problems like stagnant wages and making college affordable for our students. Indiana has a long history of electing moderate, bipartisan senators like Richard Lugar and Joe Donnelly who understand doing what's best for Indiana comes before ideology. That is the kind of leader Baron Hill will be.\" New Stutzman ad The Stutzman campaign is running a new TV ad outlining key votes that speak to his record of providing principled leadership. Stutzman's campaign manager made the following statement about the TV Spot, \"We felt it was important to point out that Marlin is the authentic con - servative in the race for U.S. Senate here in Indiana. There are a lot of election year con - servatives who say one thing on the campaign trail but lack the backbone to actually stand up to the establishment in Washington. We hear from Hoosiers every day who want conservative leaders who will stand strong on principle in Washington, not sellout the American people by cutting deals with liberal democrats like Barack Obama and Harry Reid. Marlin will continue to stand strong on principle in the face of pressure from party leadership because he knows when Republicans bend America breaks.\" Hill endorsed by Senatorial committee Baron Hill has secured the endorsement of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (Bloomington Herald-Times). Hill is the only Democrat in the running for the Senate seat from which U.S. Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., is retiring. \"Indiana deserves someone who will fight for issues that are important to Hoosiers like growing small businesses and making college more affordable, and that leader is Baron Hill,\" said Sen. Jon Tester, chair of the DSCC, in a press release. \"Over the years, Baron has prov - en he is committed to fighting for Indiana's middle class families, and we are proud to endorse him in Indiana's Senate race. We look forward to supporting his campaign and welcoming him to the Senate next fall.\" 2nd CD Tom begins second TV ad Farmer and businessman Kip Tom today released the second television advertisement of his campaign for Congress in Indiana's 3rd district. Featuring Kip's dad, Everett, the ad highlights the importance of electing an outsider with the business experience to clean up the mess in Washington created by career politicians (Howey Politics Indiana). \"There's no one whose support I value more than my dad's. He engrained in me the work ethic and commonsense conservative values that are so sorely lacking in Washington today,\" Tom said. He went on, \"If we want to change Washington, we need to change the people we send there. I'm the only candidate in this race with 40 years of business experience and not a day in elected office.\" Don Villwock, the long-serving former president of the Indiana Farm Bureau, endorsed Tom for Congress. \"I am proud to endorse my long time friend, Kip Tom, in his run for the U.S. Congress,\" Villwock said. \"Kip's passion to bring posi - tive reforms, combined with his common sense solutions and can-do track record is just what our country needs at this critical time in our na - tion's history.\" v Rep. Marlin Stutzman's new TV unveiled this week talks of how he bucked the GOP House leadership.Chaos and the Republican Party By MARK SOUDER FORT WAYNE - People have long considered the Republicans as the more conservative party, in style and substance. Republicans have long considered the Constitu - tion a historic model for the world, something with fixed principles that are adjusted over time but within the gener - al context, not some moldable piece of parchment that can be re-shaped every election. With the rise of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Rea - gan, the conservative move - ment built an ever-expanding network of what the Clintons called the \"vast right-wing conspiracy.\" The eastern liberal establishment was vanquished. Yet in just a few months an eastern establishment billion - aire insider, who funded the very liberal leaders whom conservatives have fought, has seemingly laid waste to 50 years of conservative network building. Donald Trump has mocked, demeaned and embar - rassed almost all the traditional conservative publications, taken on and smeared leading talk radio hosts and Fox News personalities, and has not demonstrated that he's ever read a single conservative book. Trump has slandered senators, governors and congressmen whom the move - ment had elected to defeat the liberals. He has peddled the message that they sold out. To whom? Him? He is the epitome of the establishment. Trump has eviscerated and embarrassed the pro-life, NRA, libertarian and evangelical movements as well as making the Tea Party nearly totally irrel - evant by demonstrating that a plurality of Re - publicans don't priori - tize those philosophical concerns. He flip-flops on issues at will, stresses \"deal-making\" which supposedly conserva - tives find worrisome at a minimum, and turns constitutionalism on its head. American's found - ing fathers didn't want America to become France; no king, no mob rule, and no Napoleon. Trump, basically, wants to use mobs to make him something between a king and Napoleon. Everything is \"I\" this and \"I\" that. There is no \"I will, along with the House and Senate, the courts, 50 governors and state legislatures, thousands of mayors and councils\" approach to government. Trust the Donald. He will fix it. Or punish those who oppose him until they show how weak they are under his might. Certainly some of his appeal is economic popu - lism. I can relate to that; in my career, more than most other Republicans, I crusaded against communist China, unfair trade and how it hurt the steel and auto industry, and Wall Street domination of the economy. Those sup - porting most-favored-nation status for China spent a mini- fortune failing to move me. Eventually the coalition head, the president of Boeing, came into my office. He acknowl - edged that he wouldn't persuade me, nor did he have any influence with me, but said he was told that unless he could understand my conservative economic arguments on the issue, they would never prevail. My point is this: A conservative argument can be made for some of Trump's positions, but he doesn't bother, or apparently even know, what they are. He throws out some \"red meat\" simpleton phrases, then returns to de - meaning his opponents. One would think he is running for president of reality shows or perhaps a fake university, not president of the United States. On moral/social issues his exploitation has been even more skillful. I argued for years in multiple settings with social conservative leaders that the political strategy of just relying on abortion, homosexual issues, pornogra - phy and prayer was not sufficient to deal with the nuances of the evangelical movement. But the sudden collapse of a \"values voter\" consensus stunned even me. The so-called \"name it and claim it\" movement has always been a part of the landscape of America, but seldom manifests itself politically. Those increasingly left behind in the economic split - largely anchored in the fact that \"knowledge\" skills pay better - have become more desperate. Growth in gambling, always skewed toward those who don't understand math, is merely one area of seeking gains separated from work. Preachers who promise financial gain for money are merely an - other \"short-cut\" long-shot hope for monetary gain. The fact is, just because someone is a Christian, doesn't mean that materialism (i.e. economic success) isn't more important in personal behavior than theoretical positions on political moral issues. Greed, another form of lust or covet - ousness anchored in personal Page 9 pride, always lurks in our sinful bodies. The Bible warns of this tendency over and over. Trump, astoundingly, gets away with mocking his evangelical followers publicly when he states that \"they like me better when I carry a Bible.\" Even his flippant dismissal of Holy Communion is ignored because of anger and/or materialism. This is more of a warning about what is happening in Christianity than it is about politics. Sin will always exist; public mocking of God and His Word is a totally different, and disastrous, trend. Then there is the race card. Whenever Cruz and Rubio start to gain, Trump reminds everyone that they are brown people, possibly not even eligible to be president. He used the wall with Mexico and deportation of brown people as a race-polarizing issue. His proposal to ban every Muslim is certainly a way to isolate Middle East - ern and Asian Muslims. His China bashing covers the other Asians. Trump even used two African-American women as a warm-up act in the South. They were pretty typical of the Jim Crow-style humor that would have appealed to white racists in an era that seemed long past. In the South and around the country many leaders in the conservative movement and in politics are stand - ing up. They continue to do so, even though many voters seem to hate anyone who has actually done anything. Can Trump be stopped? Florida and Ohio likely hold that deci - sion in their hands. The picture of Marco Rubio in South Carolina with Gov. Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Trey Gowdy is how the future of conservatism and the Republican Party (if that is to be the long-term vehicle of conservatism) will look. The process may be take a while, and the Democrats may hold power for a long time if the last gasps of the Trump faction last for more than one election. But buf - foons don't last long-term. Trump's campaign is only about him, and almost all incumbents are winning every primary at every other level. The changeover is not a question of \"if\" but merely of \"when.\" American demographics have irrevoca - bly changed. v Souder is a former Republican congressman.

The deal received approval by both majority caucuses in the Indiana House and Senate and a final vote is expected today. The bill will include $42 million for a third Regional Cities program and $10 million for Speaker Brian Bosma's teacher scholarship bill, which will both come out of Gov. Mike Pence's tax amnesty program. Both Bosma and Senate Leader David Long, R-Fort Wayne, said the money for roads will come from state re - serves and the state taking an extra 1.5 cents of the sales tax on gas out of the General Fund and into the state's road and bridge fund. The excess local option income tax included in Senate Bill 67 will also be absorbed into the roads package, bringing more than $400 million to local efforts. The House Republican's push for a more perma - nent funding source via a hike in Indiana's fuel and ciga - rette tax is over for now. The tax increases are not includ - ed in the agreement. Instead, the task force advocated for by Sen. Luke Kenley, R-Noblesville, will be created to look for a permanent solution next year. Bosma said the deal takes care of some issues the state is facing currently and makes sure the problem will be tackled when the General Assembly passes the 2017-18 budget. \"It addresses immediate needs, it meets some of our long-term goals and ensures that everyone is at the table in the budget session to work on the long-term is - sue,\" Bosma said. The specific dollar breakdowns by year and the state and local split will be revealed Thursday during the conference committee discussion. Bosma did say part of the money will be spent during fiscal year 2017, which begins in June. Over $1 billion. quite a bit of it is going to locals. no tax hikes. all regional cities fully funding. \"I'm happy,\" said state Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso (Carden, NWI knew we weren't going to get it all.\" \"We're confident that we've done the best that we can with the current funds available, while ensuring that we will have a deep discussion of long-term road funding and bridge funding needs in the coming (2017) session,\" said Bosma. \"Governor Pence couldn't be more grateful that leaders of the House and Senate have agreed to invest more than $1 billion in Indiana's roads and bridges and fully fund the Regional Cities Initiative,\" said Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Pence (Cook, IndyStar). Pence, leadership met 4 straight days The road deal came after Gov. Pence and legisla - tive leaders met for four straight days in the governor's office. A Pence administration source described the meet - ings to Howey Politics Indiana as \"all very civil,\" dispel - ling reports that there had been a \"knockdown, dragout\" episode. \"The governor brought everybody to the table and they got it done,\" the Pence source said. \"He said he wasn't going to sign a tax hike. There was no way a tax hike wasn't going to get through Senate. Long made that clear. And the governor wasn't going to sign a tax hike.\" Meth bill still unresolved Still unresolved on the final day of the session is methamphetamine legislation. State Rep. Ben Smaltz tells Howey Politics Indiana this morning: \"So interesting. The hallway, which worked so hard to stop the original HB1390 language that was (inserted) into SB80 when we sent it over, are now trying to get Sen. Head to concur on that version as opposed to Sen. Head working on passing the Concurrent Resolution. The question now is which ver - sion has the votes? Since the concurrence died, I stopped counting and was only counting votes on the CCR and it had the support as of yesterday.\" Legislative sources tell HPI that the hallway pharma lobby is making a last ditch effort to get the Drug Enforcement Agency involved. The DEA has a history of deeming all PSE products a meth risk and they are trying to backdoor a way of preventing those PSE formulations from have a retail advantage over traditional products. Controversial abor - tion bill advances A controversial bill re - stricting the reasons a woman can have an abor - tion is now heading to Gov. Mike Pence after the Indi - ana House concurred with changes made in the Senate (Osowski, Evansville Courier & Press). The concurrence Gov. Mike Pence meets with General Assembly leadership that ulti - mately forged a comrpomise on the road bill.Page 12 on House Bill 1337 passed out of the House 60-40 after emotional testimony from both sides of the aisle. The final tally showed 11 House Republicans voted with the 29 Democrats either out of concerns with the changes the Senate made or because of the process by which the bill was pushed through. When it left the House, HB 1337 just contained language regulating the disposal of fetal remains, either from an abortion or a miscarriage. The Senate added language relating to abortions after a similar Senate bill died in the House. The language states a physi - cian can't perform an abortion if the mother tells him the reason for an abortion is because of the baby's gender, ethnicity or a diagnosed developmental disorder such as Down syndrome. Because the bill was amended in the Senate and author Rep. Casey Cox, R-Fort Wayne, con - curred with the changes, the abortion language was never discussed in the House, which rankled some members. Rep. Holli Sullivan, R-Evansville, said none of the women in her district got to discuss or testify on HB 1337. \"I feel that my constituents are worthy of their input in the process,\" Sullivan said. \"Female legislators in the House, they also didn't get a chance to vet, amend or make the Senate addition to the bill better.\" Both Sullivan and Rep. Wendy McNamara, R-Mount Vernon, voted against the bill despite a strong history of being pro-life. Both of them said they couldn't vote for the bill because of the lack of a vetting process. Teacher pay bill still alive Language that would allow school districts to give teacher's bonuses outside of their negotiations with a teacher union made its way back into legislation during the final days of the 2016 legislative session (McInerny, StateImpact). Two earlier bills would have given teach - ers supplemental pay outside of collective bargaining. Both died after criticism from teacher unions and educa - tors. But a new conference committee report for HB 1005 includes language that gives advanced placement teach - ers the opportunity to earn a raise outside of collective bargaining. It aims to do something slightly different from the plans in the two previous bills. Those bills allowed schools to negotiate pay increases for teachers in hard to fill positions without engaging teachers unions. Teachers and educators argued that separate negotiating processes might pit teachers against one another. Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, says including language that gives ad - vanced placement teachers the opportunity to earn a raise outside of collective bargaining isn't a sneaky way to bring that language back. \"What is 1005 is exactly the same language that passed the General Assembly for dual credit teachers. We're just aligning the both of them together,\" he says. ISTEP bill still with conferees In an effort to address delays in the release of the 2015 ISTEP results, which were finalized in January, state representatives introduced a bill that would require results to be submitted to the state board of education by July of the same year the test is taken (Slagter, Kokomo Tribune). The same bill, HB 1359, suggests dropping the ISTEP on July 1, 2017, and establishing a panel to study alternative assessments in the meantime. The bill passed the House 86-11, with support from local Reps. Mike Karickhoff and Heath VanNatter. The Senate amended and then passed it 38-10, with support from Sen. Jim Buck, but the House did not support the Senate's amendments. As of March 3, the bill had been assigned to a conference committee, and the legislative session is expected to end today. Opiod dependence bill passes A bill creating new addiction treatment options in an effort to combat Indiana's opioid epidemic has been approved by the legislature (Smith, Indiana Public Media). Right now, if someone seeking addiction treatment goes to a methadone clinic, their only option for medication as - sisted treatment is methadone. But under SB 297, which is currently making its way to Gov. Mike Pence, patients who show up to a treatment center will get assessed and hope - fully put on the best treatment plan for them. That could mean methadone, or it could mean a different medica - tion, such as Suboxone or Vivitrol\u2014other drugs that can help fight addiction. Steve McCaffrey, president and CEO of Mental Health America of Indiana, says the guidelines under the bill could improve the state's ability to combat its opioid epidemic. \"We know that when you do disjointed treatment like we've done historically, the success rate of about 10 to 20 percent,\" he says. \"We know that when you do it in a comprehensive way, it jumps up to over 60 percent. \" House honors Rep. Dermody The House interrupted its regular business for more than an hour Wednesday to honor a Region law - maker, respected on both sides of the aisle, who is not seeking re-election this year (Carden, NWI Times). State Rep. Tom Dermody, R-LaPorte, the chairman of the House Public Policy Committee, repeatedly teared up as his colleagues recalled their adventures, both inside and outside the Statehouse, during his 10 years representing Northwest Indiana. \"We're losing a very, very independent and thoughtful legislator,\" said state Rep. Sean Eberhart, R-Shelbyville, Dermody's office- and seatmate. \"My best friend is leaving.\" Republicans and Democrats praised Der - mody as a loyal team player, ornery at times, but someone who always would have your back. \"He's a great lawmaker, but he's an even better person,\" said House Democratic Leader Scott Pelath, D-Michigan City. \"Except when he gets on the basketball court.\" In his final speech, Dermody warned his soon-to-be former colleagues that he'll be call - ing them on Saturday nights when he's at the store buying wine for Sunday dinner, since they never approved his proposals to legalize Sunday take-home alcohol sales. vRepublican lessons from Constantinople By CRAIG DUNN KOKOMO - In the wee small hours of Tuesday, May 29, 1453, the people of Constantinople were shocked from their sleep by a beating of drums, the blaring of trumpets and clanging of cymbals accompanied by the bloodcurdling battle cries of 80,000 Ottoman soldiers ap - proaching the walls of the great city. The noise was no accident. The Ottomans were skilled in using psychological warfare to unnerve their opponents prior to battle. The battle this time was for no less than the final conquest of the Byzantium Empire. The terror of the sounds of the advancing Otto - mans was enhanced by Sultan Mehmet II's decree that his army would be rewarded for their victory with three days of unrestricted rape and pillage. The 7,000 soldiers defending the walls of Constantinople were under no illusions as to their fate should the sultan's army be successful at breeching the thick walls of the city. The bells of every church in the city rang out to sound the alarm and call the defenders to the wall. They were joined by some women and nuns who understood the des - perate nature of their plight. In spite of the imminent peril, a large number of able-bodied men refused to take part in the fighting. They were furious that Emperor Constantine, in a desperate strategy to save the last remains of Byzan - tium, had reaffirmed the union of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the Church of Rome. Many of the Orthodox priests feared or detested the pope more than they did the Ottomans and showed their contempt by denouncing Emperor Constantine and refusing to offer from their massive treasuries any financial support for the defense of Constantinople. The words of defiance were best summed up by the Grand Duke Nota - ras who decreed, \"Better the turban of the Sultan than the tiara of the Pope in Constantinople.\" Such is the similar state of affairs in the Repub - lican Party and its historically unprecedented presidential sweepstakes. It seems like a majority of the party has decided that it has an unrelenting dislike of each of the top three Republican candidates. Currently, large segments of the party have been quite verbal about their ultimate refusal to back any eventual candidate but their own. This would all be quite interesting if it wasn't just so darn scary. The reality of presidential primaries is that, gener - ally, the most philosophically committed people are the ones who turn out to vote in caucuses and primaries. This has pretty much been true in both political parties. These voters have their preconceived litmus tests that they apply to the candidates and they usually show no sense of compromise, waffling or equivocation. You are either philosophically pure in my book or hit the road. The Republican Party began rebuilding its brand after the disastrous results of the 1964 presidential elec - tion by looking for a strategy to expand the political tent. Political strategist and author Kevin B. Phillips created a strategy to turn the south and the west into Republican bastions. He ably detailed this strategy in his seminal work, \"The Emerging Republican Majority.\" The strategy called for developing a conser - vative philosophy and support of issues that would cleave the southern states from the Democratic Party and bring this sizable block of voters to the Republican Party. His strategy also involved focusing on philosophies that ap - pealed to the independent spirit of the growing western states. In fact, it was Phillips who coined the term, \"Sun - belt.\" Finally, Phillips realized that there was a huge base of conservative religious people who placed family and the sanctity of life ahead of all else. Many of these people were Catholics and Southern Baptists. The strategy also appealed to the Hispanic voters of the time, who were hard-working and placed family above all else. Phillips' strategy was successful in 1968 and brought Richard Nixon into the White House. Over the nearly 50 years that Republicans have pursued this strat - egy, the party of strong economic and strong national de - fense philosophies has morphed into a purveyor of a litany of hot-button issues that appeal to the current cobbled together coalition that calls itself the modern Republican Party. Since 1968, the Republican Party has increasingly relied on an uncompromising devotion to issues such as abortion, gun ownership, cutting taxes, establishing a narrow definition of marriage, school choice, demoniza - tion of government involvement in our lives, and a fight against anything Obama, to forge electoral majorities. This strategy has largely been successful in both raising tons of election cash and winning elections. But the seeds of this strategy are now yielding some bitter fruit. The Republican presidential field has now been winnowed down from 15 to 4 candidates. It has been an amazing, embarrassing and increasingly ugly process. Donald Trump has preyed on the fears and anger of a large number of the Republican electorate who are simply fed up with the status quo and have turned to a man with a populist message that resonates. Never mind the flip- flopping views, past devoted support of Democrats and their causes, the rude juvenile mocking and name calling, the trashing of a war hero and the verbal abuse of anyone who steps in his way; Trump's supporters are solidly in his corner and they are neither prone to compromise or for - giveness. Either their man wins and the \"establishment\" is vanquished or they will take their marbles and go home. Ted Cruz has presented himself as the unwaver -Page 13 Page 14 ing Christian conservative constitutionalist in the election. He offers his supporters an evangelical zeal and a promise to not only save our U. S. Constitution, but to promote his faith through a variety of issues. His faithful love Jesus, the Bible and promoting Christian causes through govern - ment. They are fervent supporters and will not compro - mise. After all, how can you compromise with the devil? If their man does not win the nomination, they will willingly sacrifice themselves and our country by staying home in the fall. Doubt this? Explain why Mitt Romney received 5 million fewer votes in 2012 than John McCain received in 2008. Romney's crime to the evangelicals was his Mormon - ism and they just couldn't forgive someone whom they perceived as belonging to an impure cult. Marco Rubio, a religious conservative who has demonstrated a command of the issues and a traditional economic and defense oriented conservatism, has his adherents who both support him and who pledge to never vote for the bully Donald Trump or the inflexible evangeliz - ing Ted Cruz. Many of Rubio's supporters long for the days when the enemy was the Democrat Party and not their fellow Republicans. John Kasich has definitely been the adult in the room and the debates over the last several months. He has received the least amount of air time to make his case in the debates. He is experienced, respectful and thought - ful. Unfortunately, we live in a world of absolutes and entertainment. Make no mistake about it, John Kasich will never compete with Kim Kardashian for twitter time. Fifty years ago, a guy with Kasich's credentials would have been a shoo-in. His limited supporters are patiently waiting for lightning to strike in Ohio and for a contested Republican Convention to turn to a reliable conservative who hasn't yet called anyone a short, small-fingered, lily-livered liberal doo doo head. It remains to be seen whether any of the current Republican field can unite the disparate voters against the common demon, Hillary Clinton. You would think that a common hate of all things Clinton would allow Republicans to let bygones be bygones. You would think it, but history tells us that the nobility of self-immolation for a cause is all-powerful. For me, I will work my hardest to help field a candidate who has the best chance of winning in Novem - ber. Against Hillary Clinton, there is no substitute for vic - tory. If my first choice doesn't get nominated, I will suck it up and support the eventual nominee. I don't believe that anyone could be worse for our country than Hillary Clinton. And what of our Byzantine friends who hud - dled in the Eastern Orthodox churches refusing to defend Constantinople, preferring the turban of the Sultan to the tiara of the Pope? The Ottomans eventually breeched the walls of Constantinople and beheaded every last man, woman and child, except for the few young children of the priests who Sultan Mehmet II kept as sex slaves.

By LARRY SABATO, KYLE KONDIK and GEOFFREY SKELLEY CHARLOTTSVILLE, Va. - In the spring of 1976, the Republican Party seemingly stood in peril. It had been drubbed in the post-Watergate elections of 1974. And now it experienced an increasingly abrasive fight between moderate and conservative factions over its impending presidential nomination. Conservatives, in fact, hoped to replace sitting Republican President Gerald Ford. Thus, pundits like Lou Cannon and David Broder suggested that the party hovered near its death-bed. And on several oc - casions that spring, Maryland's moderate Republican Sen. Charles Mathias warned that unless his party mended its ways, it would \"go the way of the Whigs.\" This was a dire forecast indeed. The political home of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and even Abraham Lincoln, the Whig Party had competed on reasonably even terms with Democrats between 1834 and 1852. After that year, however, the party suffered a rancorous sectional rupture, institutional implosion, and abandonment by virtually all of its one-time adherents, leaders and followers alike. By the end of the decade it was, as many one-time Whigs them - selves lamented, \"dead and buried.\" As we know, Republicans did not suffer that fate in 1976 or in the four subsequent decades. But what about now, when the increasingly rancorous battle between insider and outsider forces within the party grows more brutal and ugly every day, and each threatens to boycott the others' candidates should they win the presidential nomination? Does the Whigs' sorry story provide a tem - plate pointing to what might become the GOP's fate now? There are striking similarities, but also some crucial differences, between what befell the Whigs in the 1850s and Republicans' fractious situation today. The Whigs' final national convention in 1852, for example, was seriously split over the platform and among three contend - ers for the presidential nomination: Incumbent President Millard Fillmore, southern Whigs' decided favorite; his Sec - retary of State, Daniel Webster, backed almost exclusively by New Englanders; and Mexican War hero Gen. Winfield Scott, the choice of most northern Whigs. Fillmore, Web - ster, and their supporters insisted that the Whig platform declare the Compromise of 1850 a final, unamendable set - tlement of all slavery questions. Most northern Whigs, hav - ing resisted passage of the compromise in Congress and denounced its proslavery concessions after its passage, opposed that commitment. Together, the pro-compromise men had a majority at the convention and prevailed in the platform fight. But for 53 consecutive roll call votes over three days (Yep, 53 ballots!), they divided their support between Fillmore and Webster rather than combining behind either man, allowing Scott, whom most southern Whigs mistakenly distrusted as anti-compromise, to snatch the nomination. The upshot: Northern Whigs publicly repudiated the platform while southern Whigs publicly repudiated the candidate. Indeed, upon the convention's adjournment, nine sitting southern Whig congressmen immediately issued a public letter vowing that they would never vote for Scott. (Sound familiar?) Aware that the Deep South was hopelessly lost, the Whigs' campaign for Scott clumsily and unsuccessfully focused on winning over naturalized Catholic immigrants, who had traditionally supported Democrats and whose numbers in northern states were soaring. The result was disaster. Southern Whigs abstained in droves; so did normally Whig, Catholic-hating Presbyterians and Method - ists in key northern states; and the northern Democratic vote surged with the infusion of new immigrant voters. The hapless Whigs carried only four of 31 states with a mere 14% of the electoral votes in what Whigs themselves pronounced a \"Waterloo defeat.\" To boot, they had man - aged to permanently alienate nativist Protestants, who vowed to look elsewhere for a new political home because they no longer trusted establishment Whig leaders. This 1852 result -- a Whig rout attributable to shrunken turnout for their party and a swollen turnout by immigrants for the Democratic enemy -- is, of course, precisely what many establishment Republicans fear their party will duplicate in 2016 should Donald Trump or Ted Cruz be their nominee. Yet this defeat in a presidential election was NOT what killed the Whig Party. Rather it died because its voters decamped to new, non-Whig, anti-Democratic parties in the local, congressional, and state elections of 1853, 1854, and 1855 before the next presidential elec - tion in 1856. By that election, the Whig Party was already a hollowed-out shell. A host of splinter parties arose in those off-year contests, but two were most important. Of these, the more well-known is the Republican Party, which emerged in the North to protest enactment of Democrats' Kansas-Nebraska Act in May 1854. Reaction to that law split northern and southern Whigs against each other, dec - imated northern Democratic congressional candidates in 1854 and 1855, and caused the majority of northern vot - ers to coalesce gradually behind the overtly anti-southern, anti-slavery-extension Republican Party, a process substan - tially, but not yet fully, completed by the 1856 presidential election. The rise of the Republican Party depended upon, even as it helped cause, the death of the Whig Party. But it has little relevance to the situation of today's Republican Party. Far more parallel to the contemporary situation was the rise of notorious Know-Nothing Party, which in fact did far more to gut the Whig Party before 1856 than did Republicans' exploitation of anti-southern hostility. Economic dislocation that destroyed blue-collar jobs, un - employment during a severe recession in 1854 and 1855, and the palpable growth of both the foreign-born popu - lation and the Catholic Church, which in precisely those years demanded that local governments divide local tax Translating today's political lingo By JACK COLWELL SOUTH BEND - With political lingo more crude and rude this year, it's time to update my translation of what candidates really mean when they say what they say.

Know-Nothings allowed angry voters to vent more than religious and ethnic prejudices. They also al - lowed them to smite established Whig and Democratic leaders who had betrayed them by groveling so overtly for Catholic and immigrant support. A genuinely spontane - ous, populist grassroots revolt of angry working- and lower middle-class dissidents, Know-Nothings initially pledged that they would never support any candidate who had ever held or previously sought public office. All profes - sional politicians, they ranted, were the enemy. In their oft-repeated phrase, they exclusively sought candidates \"fresh from the ranks of the people.\" In its causes and expression, in sum, the Know- Nothing uprising of the 1850s comes as close to preview - ing today's Trump phenomenon as one can imagine. Yet it took a different form than the Trump crusade, and that is the all-important difference between then and now. vWeak data short circuits tax policy By MORTON MARCUS INDIANAPOLIS - When last we visited Boss Bosco of the Indiana General Assembly he was sleeping off his eggnog. Today he is fresh and frisky. \"Over here, son,\" he calls in his legislative baritone. \"Boss,\" I ask anxiously, \"did you bring your spread - sheet showing your plan to return sales tax to Indiana counties?\" \"Right here,\" has says, unfolding a set of papers. \"It's all here. In 2014, the Indiana Department of Revenue (DOR) collected $6.3 billion in sales taxes or $953 for each of the 6.6 mil - lion Hoosiers.\" \"I understand you would allow lo - cal governments to raise the sales tax within their jurisdictions,\" I say. \"No,\" he replies. \"Sober, I see it would only in - crease competition between communities while confusing consumers and businesses. Let's just increase the state sales tax by a penny and give all that new revenue back to the counties.\" \"How much will that be?\" I ask. \"Based on the 2014 data from DOR, I estimate $900 million,\" he says. \"That equals an added $136 per person for local schools and other government services.\" \"And how would the money be distributed to each county? By population? By where the dollars are collect - ed?\" I push for clarity. \"Yes and yes,\" the Boss replies. \"But first, you do know all this is subject to getting more accurate data from the DOR?\" \"What,\" I gasp. \"We can't trust DOR numbers?\" \"They do as best they can,\" the Boss says, \"but they warn us not to take their numbers seriously for any meaningful purpose. That's because their total of collec - tions in each county accounts for just 53 percent of state - wide sales tax collections. \"Our kindly legislature,\" he continues, \"still allows firms to send in consolidated reports lumping coun - ties together. Therefore, we don't know where 47 percent of the sales taxes originate.\" \"In this day and age of computers?\" I explode. \"My boy,\" the Boss calms me, \"our beloved Gener - al Assembly is not of this day and age, and a few compa - nies of considerable influence may resist detailed reporting for what they claim are competitive reasons.\" \"All right,\" I acknowledge, \"let's see the results based on the imperfect DOR information. Who's going to get how much of those $900 million?\" \"If,\" he says, \"we give equal weight to population and place of collection, Marion County gets $169 million (18.8 percent of the $900) and Lake gets $76 million (8.4 percent). See for yourself.\" I look at the spreadsheet. Only 11 Indiana coun - ties have higher percentages of retail sales tax collections than they do percentages of population. In the other 81 counties, population out-weighs retail sales. It's easy to understand that Vanderburgh County (Evansville) is a shopping center (5.6 percent of sales tax revenue as reported vs. just 2.8 percent of popu - lation. But why aren't Allen, Howard and Johnson counties retail centers? Is it because companies operating in those counties report from headquarters elsewhere in Indiana? \"What will it take to end this gross distortion in the DOR data?\" I ask. Boss Bosco just smiles, shrugs his shoulders, and walks away. v Mr. Marcus is an economist, writer, and speaker who may be reached at mortonjmarcus@yahoo. com. Page 17 Manufacturing jobs, production & snake oil By MICHAEL HICKS MUNCIE - The Department of Commerce data have just been released, and 2015 was another record year for manufacturing production in the United States, as I expect will be the case for Indiana when those num - bers come out. Simply put, when you adjust for inflation, American manufacturing firms are making more goods altogether than at any other time in history. This is not some slick sta - tistical artifice. We made more cars here in Indiana and across the U.S. in 2015 than in any other year in his - tory. American manufacturing has never been stronger, yet the airwaves are cluttered with snake oil purvey - ors who tell us otherwise. They rely on widespread fear and anger, with which I understand. But, these demagogues also prey on our ignorance, for which there is no excuse. Employment in American manufacturing has been growing since 2010, the longest period of growth since the 1994-2000 stretch, right after NAFTA. While these small periods of growth tell us something about the effects of international trade, they are only transient. Indi - ana has been losing manufacturing employment for a half century and the nation as a whole has for 40 years. The readily knowable fact is that for the past half century American manufacturing production has been booming, while manufacturing employment has been in Mark Becker could be Ferguson's gain By RICH JAMES MERRILLVILLE - Mark Becker isn't a bad sort for a Cheesehead. Yeah, the Wisconsin native is a diehard Green Bay Packers fan. He's also a pretty bright guy; he's sarcastic and his dry sense of humor makes deserts seem damp. He is so straight that he has been a guest lecturer on ethics in law enforcement at Calumet College of St. Joseph. And, he knows cops and what makes them tick. And he knows what com - munity policing is all about. That's why he's a finalist for the Ferguson, Mo., police chief's job. Ferguson is the city that still is struggling with civil unrest after a white police officer fatally shot a black youth. Should he get the Fer - guson job, it will be Missouri's gain and Northwest Indiana's loss. I first met Becker almost three decades ago in the FBI office in Merrillville. He pretty much was spending his time investigating white-collar crime. Becker came to prominence in 1991 when he was a key part of a multi- jurisdictional task force that investigated and caught the so-called \"shotgun killer,\" who was responsible for seven random killings and five attacks during 11 incidents. Becker found his niche in the 1990s when he led the newly formed Gary Response Investigative Team that had two primary goals - put gang members in jail and reduce the city's homicide rate. Gary at the time was the \"murder capital\" of America based on the number of homicides per 100,000 residents. Becker's team worked the streets of Gary for 20 years, helping the city shed the murder capital label as the number of homicides was cut in half. Shortly after retiring from the FBI in 2007, Becker was named police chief by Portage Mayor Olga Velasquez. Becker brought the police department up to speed to help it handle the challenges of a changing city. Unfortunately for Portage, when James Snyder defeated Velasquez four years later, the new mayor fired Becker for purely political reasons. That might not have been all bad since new Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson inherited a city with a multitude of crime problems and a police department that had been riddled with politics for decades. No one knew Gary and its problems better than Becker, who wanted the chief's job in the worst way. But, Freeman-Wilson refused to hire a chief who either didn't live in Gary or rejected the idea of moving into the city. So Freeman-Wilson turned down the best chief she could have hired. And crime re - mains Gary's primary problem. While Gary lost out, East Chicago turned out to be the winner. East Chicago Mayor Anthony Copeland named Becker chief of police. Becker promised Copeland three years and gave him four. And in the process, Becker turned what might have been the most corrupt police department in the state into a respected organization. For the first time in history, police officers advanced through merit promotions, not politics. Becker left the East Chicago Police Department a week ago and was named a finalist for the Ferguson job. Wouldn't it be something if Becker got the job in Missouri, especially in light of the fact that Freeman-Wilson rejected him for Gary? v Rich James has been writing about state and local government and politics for more than 30 years. He is a columnist for The Times of Northwest Indiana. Page 18 decline. The reason for this is that Americans businesses are very good at manufacturing, thus able to produce more with far fewer workers. It is really that simple. Trade also has grown, and our imports minus exports now account for 3 percent of GDP. My research, published in 2014, says that about 13 percent of lost jobs over the past decade are due to this widening trade gap. Most economists calculate a much smaller figure, but there's no need to quibble on the big picture. The huge loss of manufacturing jobs at a time when manufacturing production is at record levels cannot be explained away by a 3 percent trade gap. I write these things not simply because facts and truth matter, but because demagogues in both parties wish to convince voters that globalization is a proximal cause of their own woes. That is an attractive falsehood. It appeals to ignorance and cowardice, of which we should be collec -tively embarrassed. The illusion of damage from free trade also appeals to the eyes. We can see stores full of Chinese made goods and shuttered factories across the Midwest. But, these eyes deceive us. They also tell us the earth is flat. Our public debate ought to be about what steps we can take to help workers who have lost their jobs, whether to machines or foreign labor. Instead of bashing workers abroad, we should look to our city and county leaders to make our neighborhoods and schools stronger. Our problems and our solutions are domestic, and have always been thus. These truths are unappealing. It is far more popu - lar to sell false cures for globalization that pander to the fears and insecurities of the most ill-informed and myopic among us. I know we can do better. I am not sure we deserve to. vVi Simpson, Howey Politics Indiana: This week, as our nation kicks off Women's History Month, Indiana made history of a different kind. The third woman to hold the position of lieutenant governor stepped down. A man, who is lockstep with Gov. Mike Pence on his ideological world view, takes her place. Somehow, I don't think this transition will be highlighted in our state's coming bicen - tennial celebrations. Lt. Gov. Sue Ellspermann brought a diverse background in manufacturing, aca - demics and consulting to state government, where she also served in the General Assem - bly. She continued the good work of former Lt. Govs. Kathy Davis and Becky Skillman in revitalizing Indiana communities, and was a strong surrogate for Gov. Pence. Regardless of the reason, Gov. Pence's decision to replace the able and accomplished Sue Ellspermann with Eric Holcomb speaks volumes about what he values in the person who is literally a heartbeat away from the governor's office. What lesson we can learn from Lt. Gov. Ellspermann's early departure is clear. We still have a great deal of work ahead to move women forward in our state, and we need positive leader - ship at the Statehouse, not obstructionism. v Thomas Friedman, New York Times: Donald Trump is a walking political science course. His meteoric rise is lesson No. 1 on leadership: Most voters do not listen through their ears. They listen through their stomachs. If a leader can connect with them on a gut level, their response is: \"Don't bother me with the details. I trust your instincts.\" If a leader can't connect on a gut level, he or she can't show them enough particulars. Democrats take Trump lightly at their peril. He is still sitting with three aces that he hasn't played yet. They could all come out in the general election. One ace is that if he wins the nomination he will have no problem moving to the center to appeal to independents and minorities. He will have no problem playing the moderate unifier \u2014 and plenty of people will buy it, saying: \"Why not give him a chance? He says he can make us winners.\" His second ace is that given the position he staked out on terrorism, if, God forbid, there is a major terrorist attack on our soil between now and Election Day, Trump will reap enormous political benefits. Watch out. I've seen how one well-timed terrorist attack tilted an Israeli election. His third ace is that he will indeed go after Hillary Clinton in ways you never heard before and that will delight and bring back a lot of disaffected Republi - cans, whose hatred of Hillary knows no bounds. v James Downie, Washington Post: For months, political observers said over and over that the GOP front- runner wouldn't win the nomination. But after accumu - lating seven more victories on Super Tuesday, bringing his total to 11 of the first 15 states, Donald Trump has destroyed that conventional wisdom and looks likely to be Hillary Clinton's opponent in the fall. Let's dispense with the notion that Trump has a real shot at winning in No - vember. Start with the basic electoral math. At the national level, Trump trails Clinton by more than three percentage points in the RealClearPolitics polling average, and she has led him in 15 of 17 national polls since December. Trump clearly does the worst against her of the possible Republi - can nominees. His unfavorables are historically high for a general election nominee. And if \"more than three points\" doesn't sound impressive, note that Barack Obama rarely led Mitt Romney by more than three points in the polling averages \u2014 and he won easily. What state polling we have suggests that Clinton, like Obama, will start with 220 or 230 electoral votes safe or close to that amount, leaving Trump little room for error. Breaking the numbers down demographically makes Trump's path look even steeper. In 2012, Romney easily won the non-Hispanic white vote, but it wasn't nearly enough to overcome his poor showing among Hispanics, who broke 71 to 27 percent for Obama. A recent Post-Univision News poll found that 80 percent of Hispanics have an unfavorable view of Trump. Given that the electorate is expected to be less white than it was in 2012, Trump would have to win an unprecedented share of the white vote to stand a chance. Some have suggested that record turnout in the Republican primaries bodes ill for the Democrats come November. In 1980 and 1988, mil - lions more people voted in the Democratic primaries than in the Republican contests \u2014 and Democrats lost in the fall. In 2000, Republicans had the edge, and the GOP lost the popular vote. v Bob Kravitz, WTHR-TV: You didn't just throw pass - es and win games in Indianapolis; you left a footprint. You became the athletic standard bearer for this commu - nity. Reggie Miller was great, Tamika Catchings is a civic blessing who is too often under-valued, but I think we can all agree, you were the most impactful athlete and civic citizen ever to come through these parts. And folks around here, they never forgot. Even after you went to the Denver Broncos, Indianapolis fans followed. When you won the most recent Super Bowl, people around here felt proud and proprietary, even if you were wearing Bronco orange. The truth is, you've never stopped being one of us. From a football standpoint, these things almost go without say - ing: Without you, the Colts are probably in Los Angeles. Without you, Lucas Oil Stadium never gets built. Without you, high school football doesn't become a prime recruit - ing ground for big-time programs. Without you, we don't have about 10,000 little Peytons, boys and girls, walking around this town. We all know you will be a first-ballot Hall of Famer and a soon-to-be member of the Colts Ring of Honor, but I'd take it a step further: I firmly believe there should be a Peyton Manning statue outside of Lucas Oil Stadium.

You changed the game, the NFL game. vPage 19 Kasich leads in Ohio Fox poll WASHINGTON \u2014 Ohio Gover - nor John Kasich bests Donald Trump among Buckeye Republicans by a 34 to 29 percent margin. Ted Cruz is third with 19 percent. Marco Rubio trails with just 7 percent. That's accord - ing to a new Fox News poll of Ohio likely Republican primary voters. The governor's edge is within the poll's margin of sampling error. Kasich is bolstered by positive evaluations of his job performance as governor. He has a sky high 79 percent approval rating among the Ohio party faithful. Even so, nearly one quarter of Kasich supporters say they could end up voting for another candidate (23 percent). For Trump supporters, 19 percent say they may change their mind. Who would they pick? Kasich (21 percent) and Rubio (19 percent) top the \"second-choice\" list, with Cruz close behind (17 percent). Trump is the second choice for only 12 percent. Nearly half of Ohio GOP voters are evangelical Christians, and they prefer Kasich over Trump and Cruz (32-27- 23 percent). Home-state preference seems to be at work: Fox News exit polls of 2016 Republican contests held so far have found either Cruz or Trump always winning the evangelical bloc. Trump trouncing Rubio in Florida WASHINGTON \u2014 Less than a week until the first winner-take-all Republican primaries, Donald Trump is trouncing Marco Rubio on his home turf, according to a new Fox News poll. In the race for the Republican nomination, Trump receives 43 per - cent among Florida likely GOP primary voters. Rubio is a distant second with 20 percent, closely followed by Ted Cruz at 16 percent. John Kasich comes in fourth with 10 percent. Here is what's driving the vote: a 63-per - cent majority of likely Republican primary voters feels \"betrayed\" by politicians in their party -- and they go heavily for Trump over Cruz (49-18 percent), with Rubio and Kasich way behind (12 percent and 11 percent respectively). In addition, just 48 percent of Sunshine State GOPers approve of the job Rubio is doing as senator, while 38 percent disapprove. Clinton, Sanders in for a long grind MIAMI \u2014 Democrats got a taste Wednesday night of where their nominating contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders could be heading \u2014 toward a grueling and in - creasingly contentious battle that could continue until the primaries end in June (Balz, Washington Post). A few days ago, Wednesday's debate here appeared as if it might be an anticlimax as Clinton rolled toward the nomination. Instead, Sanders arrived reenergized and rein - vigorated after his surprising victory in Michigan. Rather than questions about Sanders's viability, Clinton faced ques - tions about what had gone wrong with her campaign. The two squabbled at length over immigration. They traded charges over bailing out the automo - bile industry. They argued again over health care and about how to combat climate change. A quiet start turned into a spirited and at times tense series of exchanges that highlighted their differences and the state of their competition. Final chapter for Caveat Emptor BLOOMINGTON \u2014 The way Janis Starcs, owner of Caveat Emp - tor, talks about the history of central Eurasian studies soon may be the way his customers talk about the established secondhand bookstore in downtown Bloomington as it enters its final chapter this August. \"You learn that history is never over,\" said Starcs, one of five book-lovers who opened the store in 1971. \"The past is never 'always the past,' and the things that happened hundreds of years ago can still be remembered. They're still very much alive.\" It's a literary map of Starcs' varied interests over the years, and when the store's lease expires this August, they may soon become the interests of another intellectual. If Starcs doesn't find a buyer for the business and his gargantuan inven - tory, he says the store probably will reduce its hours and have what he calls an epic sale.

I'm glad to hear of the progress that has been made through the Task Forces, and especially eager to hear updates on this issue from folks back home. Senator Coats wants to stay highly engaged in this area, and recently worked with Senator Blumenthal to introduce a bill to expand access to prescription drug monitoring programs. The provision has been included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (S.524), which we believe will be considered by the full Senate in the near future. There's a few resources that come to mind in this area. First, have you had occasion to meet Dave Murtaugh? Dave was a Senior Advisor for Senator Coats for a number of years, and now heads up the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute , which is the State Administering Agency for distribution of federal funds related to criminal justice. I've cc'ed him here - he might be best equipped to point you in the right direction for specific available grant opportunities. Second, the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs compiles a list of available funding opportunities here. In particular, this grant on \"Smart Supervision\" from the Bureau of Justice Assistance looks like it would go toward your second point on the need for resources for court ordered community supervision. Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) could be a good place to look for drug treatment grants, but I'm less familiar with their particular offerings. If I come across any additional information I'll be sure to pass it along - hope this is helpful. Please keep us in the loop as you continue to address this crisis, and thank you for the work you do! Best, Jon Jonathan R. Foltz | Counsel | Senator Dan Coats | SR-493 | 202-224-5623 jon_foltz@coats.senate.gov From: Wendy Davis [ mailto:Wendy.Davis@allensuperiorcourt.us Thursday, February 18, 2016 12:57 PM To: Foltz, Jon (Coats) < Jon_Foltz@coats.senate.gov > Cc: Hingson, Dean (Coats) < Dean_Hingson@coats.senate.gov > Subject: IN Drug crisis in the judicial system Good afternoon, Jon - I hope all is well in D.C. I am writing to look for a bit of guidance and also to explore any further avenues to partner with federal organizations and/or funding in regards to low level drug offenders in Indiana. As we discussed briefly during our meeting when I was in Washington in the fall, with the emergence and implementation of the new Criminal Code, Judges are looking for effective ways to supervise offenders in our local communities. Additionally, Gov. Pence has appointed me to the Indiana Task Force on Drug Enforcement, Treatment and Prevention, which has been meeting each month. We are really making some strides in Indiana to make solid recommendations to the Governor. I am also a part of a local Drug Task Force, put into place by Dr. McMahan (our Health Commissioner) trying to connect private providers with the criminal justice system. It is all good stuff; however, we still have a lot of work to do. To that end, I am meeting with many stakeholders locally (the Sheriff, Prosecutor, Community Corrections ED and Chief Probation Officer) to try and implement Vivitrol as a part of our court ordered treatment plan for high risk (low level) drug offenders, especially those on HOPE, Drug Court and Vet Court programs. Obviously, we are having some challenges with the funding piece. Many of the offenders I release on court ordered programs are indigent and without health care. I am working with Dr. McMahan to try and get navigators for Medicaid, HIPP 2.0 and Recovery Works in order to connect the offenders to medically assisted treatment plans as they are released from custody and in need of this type of service to begin their programs through Probation, Allen County Community Corrections and Work Release. Lastly, one of the biggest needs in Fort Wayne and Allen county is bed space and half way houses. As a judge presiding over drug cases, it is hard to release an offender back to the same community they committed drug related crimes. It only sets the offender up for a violation. The offenders that are graduating from HOPE or other problem solving court programs do best when they are placed in half way houses or safe housing while participating in court ordered programs. Accordingly, I am writing you to ask you two questions: 1. Is there funding available to assist local criminal justice programming of drug treatment; specifically, medically assisted court ordered programs? 2. Is there federal funding available to create more bed space or half-way houses to place offenders on court ordered community supervision? Thank you for your time. Let me know if you have any further thoughts regarding any of the above. Wendy Judge Wendy W. Davis Allen Superior Court - Criminal Division 715 S.

Exercise caution. DO NOT open attachments or click links from unknown senders or unexpected email. **** To add to this update, I still have not received from ICJI information on the past uses and current status of the State Drug Free Communities Fund. The last correspondence from Sonya was that she \"was working with the State Board of Accounts to get the information.\" That was on January 8, after I had made an inquiry in December, for which there was no response until my follow up. The text of my request in December follows. The first paragraph is in response to an earlier request, which Sonya must have thought I wanted the statutory references to the fund. Sonya, I am sorry that I was not clear in the information I am seeking. I am seeking information on how the monies have been used according to IC5:2-10. As I read the statutes, the fund is \"established to promote comprehensive alcohol and drug abuse prevention initiatives by supplementing state and federal funding for the coordination and provision of treatment, education, prevention, and criminal justice efforts.\" The status of \"the fund\" is non-reverting, which means, since the inception of that fund,in 1988, unused monies should remain in that fund. I am aware that during the early years, those funds not used directly for Commission administration were distributed back to LCC's to support their plans. I am not familiar with the reasoning behind the fixed amount of $1,288,000 deposited semi- annually in the State User Fee Fund, since the collections of fees state-wide is not fixed, but even under that formula, it appears that $578,827 a year is deposited into the State Drug Free Communities Fund, I suspect more than needed to operate the Commission at the operational levels for many, many years. What I am seeking is how that money has been used, what non-reverting fund balances there have been, and the current status of the fund, at least through the end of the most recent state fiscal year. Please be assured that I am not inquiring for any other reason than exploring every opportunity for support of our local plans. I have a strong bias toward complete transparency in stewardship responsibilities for public funds and I am confident that our current administration shares that value. I recommend that this information be distributed to all LCCs. In just a short time, I have discovered that several of my counterparts know absolutely nothing about this fund, its use and its potential. You may not have all of this information. When I was there, I received a report regularly on the status of the fund, but that may have changed, since the Commission was brought under ICJI. If this information has to be obtained elsewhere, I would appreciate your assistance in directing me to the correct place or person.

Dan Coats has sided with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell against acting on an U.S. Supreme Court nominee made by President Obama this year (Howey Politics Indiana ). \"Our country is in the middle of a highly consequential presidential elect ion. The American people should determine their next Supreme Court justice by their votes in November,\" Coats said in a statement on Monday, which, ironically, was President's Day. \"I believe our nation will be best served by a justice who holds the Consti tution in the same high regard as Justice Scalia did throughout his distinguished tenure on the Supreme Court.\" DONNELLY WANTS SENATE TO HEAR SCOTUS NOMINEE: Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly said Monday the Senate should have the opportunity to weigh in on President Obama's nominee to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia (Vandenack, Elkhart Truth ). But in light of strong opposition by many Senate Republicans to letting Obama name a replacement, he acknowledges that may not happen. \"I pla n to do my job. I'm hopeful we have a chance to vote. I don't know that we will,\" Donnelly said during a meeting with The Elkhart Truth's editorial board. He was critical of some GOP calls to put off consideration of replacements until after a new presiden t takes office early next year. \"I think that's a dereliction of duty. I think that's what we were hired to do,\" said Donnelly. He also spoke ruefully of the possibility of the GOP-controlled Senate simply stalling on the issue. \"They can likely do that. I 'm hopeful they won't,\" Donnelly said. \"I'm hopeful that they look at this in a serious way, but I can't make others do their job.\" Donnelly said it's the president's obligation to put forward a nominee, but that he hopes the nominee is not someone extreme ly political. \"Whoever's a president during their term, I think it would be a dereliction of duty if President Obama didn't put forward a name,\" Donnelly said. \"And I'm very hopeful that whoever he puts forward is not on either extreme. I think that's the last thing that the country needs is somebody all the way to the right or somebody all the way to the left.\" BROOKS TO HEAD YOUNG'S ELECTION BOARD LEGAl TEAM: Indianapolis attorney David Brooks, who recently won a DuBois County recount case on behalf of Republican Jasper Mayor Terry Seitz, will take the lead role in keeping U.S. Rep. Todd Young on the Republican U.S. Senate primary ballot ( Howey Politics Indiana ). Indiana Democrats and U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman are challenging Young's 1st CD signatures, which they believe fall two or three short of the necessary threshold to qualify for the ballot. Stutzman is Young's sole Republican primary rival and would win the nomination if Young is forced off the ballot. Brooks is a renown election law expert and is the husband of U.S. Rep. Susan Brooks. Sources close to the Young campaign express confidence that the Bloomington congressman had more than enough signatures in Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties to qualify for the ballot. The Indiana Election Board compos ed of two Democrats and two Republicans will hear the challenge to Young's candidacy as well as those of Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and General Assembly candidates Jeff Embry challenging Rep. Tom Saunders and Danny Ball wh o is challenging Rep. Cindy Ziemke. The Indiana Election Commission will convene a public meeting at 1:30 p.m. EST on Friday at Indiana Government Center South Conference Center Room A. Republican members include Chairman Bryce Bennett and Zachary Klutz, w hile Democrat members include Anthony Long and Suzannah Wilson Overholt. The Young campaign expects a decision on the Senate race will be made on Friday. BALLARD EXPECTED TO APPLY FOR IVY TECH PRESIDENCY: Lt. Gov. Sue Ellsperman could have some serious c ompetition in applying to be the next president of Ivy Tech Community College (Cook & Schneider, IndyStar ). Former Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard and at least one member of Indiana's Congressional delegation have expressed interest in applying, said Micha el Dora, an Ivy Tech Board of Trustees member and chair of the search committee. Ballard just finished his final term as the Republican mayor of Indianapolis. As mayor he oversaw a growing network of charter schools, whose combined enrollment ranks among o ne of the largest school districts in Marion County. With his deep political connections and experience, Ballard could give Ellspermann stiff competition for the job. Ballard declined to comment, but a source close to the former mayor said he had not forma lly applied for the job. \"I am told that he will,\" Dora said. \"I look for him to put his letter in and his resume. I've been told he's considering it.\" Dora declined to provide any details about a possible congressional candidate. \"I've only heard that a c ongressperson is interested,\" he said. Some sources have speculated that U.S. Rep. Susan Brooks, a former general counsel for Ivy Tech, could be interested. A spokesperson for Brooks said the congresswoman has not applied for the job. Dora said he expects between 40 to 50 people to apply for the job. The search committee will then drill down the resumes to the top 10 applicants, and then further narrow the list to two or three finalists. The university is paying a national higher education consulting firm $ 120,000 to assist with the search. ZOELLER COMMENDS FEDERAL CALL ON OPIODS: As co -chair of Indiana's Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Task Force, Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said he commends the recent federal proposal to expand funding for a ddiction treatment programs targeting prescription drug and heroin abuse ( Howey Politics Indiana) . Zoeller met with Office of National Drug Control Policy Director Michael Botticelli in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, just days after the proposal was announc ed, to express his support of this effort and demonstrate Indiana's need for more resources to combat opioid abuse and its many ramifications. Director Botticelli was the keynote speaker at Zoeller's sixth -annual Prescription Drug Abuse Symposium in Octobe r 2015. The federal proposal is calling for $1.1 billion in new funding over the next two years to address the opioid abuse epidemic. The proposal includes funding to expand addiction treatment services and support overdose prevention programs at the state level, including efforts to increase availability of the opioid overdose antidote naloxone. \"The opioid addiction crisis destroying lives and tearing families apart demands more action and better results,\" Zoeller said. \"The crisis will get much worse thi s year as we crack down on the oversupply that fuels the abuse, and we must direct our efforts to meaningful treatment options. The devastating drug abuse and disease spread occurring in Scott County puts a face on this issue and underscores Indiana's need for more state and federal support to get people help and save lives. We simply do not have enough treatment facilities to address the alarming need.\" LACK OF SCALIA AUTOPSY SEEDING CONSPIRACY: Two days after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died su ddenly in remote West Texas, a former D.C. homicide commander is raising questions about how the death was handled by local and federal authorities ( Washington Post ). \"As a former homicide commander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Sca lia,\" William O. Ritchie, former head of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday. Scalia was found dead in his room at a luxury hunting resort in the state's Big Bend region by the resort's owner. It took hours for au thorities to find a justice of the peace, who pronounced him dead of natural causes without seeing the body \u2014 which is permissible under Texas law \u2014 and without ordering an autopsy. On Sunday, the U.S. Marshals Service, which provides security for Supreme Court justices, said that Scalia had declined a security detail while at the ranch, so marshals were not present when he died. When the marshals were notified, deputy marshals from the Western District of Texas went to the scene, the service said in a stat ement. Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara said she declared Scalia dead based on information from law enforcement officials on the scene, who assured her that \"there were no signs of foul play.\" She also spoke to Scalia's doctor, who told her that the justice had been to see him Wednesday and Thursday last week for a shoulder injury and that he had ordered an MRI for Scalia, according to WFAA -TV in Dallas. The 79 -year-old justice also suffered from several chronic conditions, Guevara said. She said she was awaiting a statement from the physician to complete Scalia's death certificate. The manager of the El Paso funeral home that handled Scalia's body said Scalia's family insisted against an autopsy. But the decision has spawned a host of conspiracy theo ries online, as well as skeptical questions from law enforcement experts such as Ritchie. SANDERS TAKES AIM AT SUPER DELEGATES: Bernie Sanders lost by a hair in Iowa and won by a landslide in New Hampshire. Yet Hillary Clinton has amassed an enormous 350 -delegate advantage over the Vermont senator after just two states (Politico ). Outraged by that disconnect - which is fueled by Clinton's huge advantage with Democratic superdelegates, who are not bound by voting results - Sanders supporters are fighting b ack. Pro -Sanders threads on Reddit have been burning up with calls for action, with some supporters even reaching out to superdelegates (who are typically Democratic governors, members of Congress, and top state and national party leaders) to lobby them on the Vermont senator's behalf. Progressive groups are also taking a stand: There are currently two petition campaigns designed to urge superdelegates to reflect the popular vote, rather than the sentiment of party elites. In one of them, MoveOn.org activis ts are targeting undecided and committed Hillary Clinton superdelegates with a clear message: wait until all the votes are counted before throwing support behind a candidate. REFUGEE CASE HEARD; RULING LATER THIS MONTH : In federal court Friday, Indiana o fficials defended the state's right to withhold money from groups helping resettle Syrian refugees (Smith, WBAA ). One of those resettlement groups is suing the state over the policy Governor Mike Pence put into effect in December. Indiana Solicitor General Thomas Fischer says that's because FBI officials testified before Congress, and said the federal government do esn't have access to sufficient information for background checks of those refugees. But ACLU Indiana legal director Ken Falk, who represents Exodus Refugee Immigration, says other federal officials, including the head of immigration, say the background ch ecks are more than sufficient. \"You don't pick and choose on what you'd like to hear,\" he says. \"We live in a system where the federal government is supreme in certain areas.\" Exodus Refugee Immigration has brought in four Syrian refugees since Pence issue d his order. Fisher emphasizes the state will provide those refugees with direct benefits they are owed, including food stamps and Medicaid. Only dollars to reimburse Exodus for other expenses are withheld. A federal judge says she expects to issue a rulin g by the end of the month. HPI DAILY ANALYSIS: It is disappointing that here in the twilight of his career, Sen. Coats has taken a blatantly political stance with regards to replacing Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. His position against acting on a replacement means SCOTUS will not be fully functional for, perhaps, a year and a half or more. There are also several other justices in their 80s, meaning that other vacancies could open up during the final 11 months of President Obama's term. Coats makes the case that the votes of the American people this November will determine the next associate justice. So, essentially, he is negating the votes cast in 2012 for president as well as a third of the Senate, who are charged with specific duties when SCOTUS vacancies occur. The idea that a president's last 11 months shouldn't count is dangerous. Coats is making the case that voters in November will be selecting a president and a Supreme Court justice, when the Founding Fathers envisioned no such duality. It ignores the notion that because the Senate is controlled by Republicans, Obama would be wise to select a moderate nominee who has been approved in the past by wide bipartisan margins. The other problem with Coats' reasoning is Obama's use of executive orde rs on issues such as gun reform, climate and immigration. But with Congress refusing to, as Scalia has famously said, \"pass a law\" and act, this president and others in the future facing similar gridlock due to political polarization and endemic gerrymande ring will resort to executive order. Certainly the preferred course is for Congress to address the issues of the day, or as Sen. Donnelly says, \"do my job\" as opposed to the political cowardice and polarization we see in this era. And, it is worth noting, the McConnell/Coats position could backfire in epic fashion. It could be Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump selecting the next justice, to be approved by, potentially, a Democrat controlled Senate. Instead of a moderate justice clearing the Senate in 2016, a 2 017 selection could be an avowed liberal. Sen. Coats needs to take a deep breath and revisit positions taken earlier in his career when justices were chosen for their character and professional competence and not some ideological litmus test. - Brian A. Ho wey Campaigns EDUCATOR TO CHALLENGE REP. KARICKHOFF: A Howard County educator and political newcomer announced last week her decision to challenge one of the area's most familiar representatives (Myers, Kokomo Tribune ). Democrat Natalie Guest, who previously taught at Northwestern High School and currently owns Organic Tan, will challenge incumbent Republican Mike Karickhoff for the District 30 seat in the Indiana House of Representatives during this year's general election. Karickhoff, the House Deputy Speaker Pro Tempore, has held the position since 2010. Despite Karickhoff's reputation as an established political representative - first on Kokomo's Common Council before moving to the statehouse - Guest said she isn't apprehensive about running for the position. \"I am not intimidated in the slightest,\" said Guest, who, along with Karickhoff, doesn't have a primary election challenger. \"I am just hoping to bring us back to the issues that are important to Hoosiers. ... I am going up against someone who has been in office for quite some time, but hasn't accomplished anything meaningful.\" In general, we have a wide focus with what we are going for. I don't want the focus on the campaign or within my platform to solely be education,\" she said. \"Being an educato r, I am extremely passionate about the issues. I have seen how changes in funding have affected my school, my students ... But I am also focused in terms of infrastructure and working on our roads and bridges. \"The Democrats have proposed a plan, and [Republ icans] are not willing to talk about any issues on the other side of the table,\" she continued. Guest went on to accuse Republicans, including Karickhoff, of placing legislative focus on divisive social issues while taking away any chance at meaningful gov ernance. In a press release, Guest criticized Gov. Mike Pence and other statehouse conservatives of giving Indiana a hostile reputation, specifically in relation to the issue of LGBT civil rights. \"Mike Pence and the [Republican -led] statehouse have embar rassed our state, time and again,\" she said. Presidential 2016 PPP POLL SHOULS BIG TRUMP SC LEAD: Behind Trump, who has 35 percent support in the poll, U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas are tied for second place \u2014 at 18 percent each, according to a Public Policy Polling survey released exclusively Monday to The State ( Hotair ). Ohi o Gov. John Kasich is in forth at 10 percent support, followed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, tied with 7 percent support each. Public Policy interviewed 897 likely GOP primary voters Sunday and Monday - the first look at how after Saturday night's Republican presidential debate affected the race. The poll has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points. The GOP poll suggests Trump's debate performance - in which he criticized former President George W. Bush for the 9/11 attacks - may not be hurting the frontrunner in a state that has deep ties to the Bush family. W. STUMPS FOR JEB: Making his first campaign appearance on his brother's behalf, George W. Bush didn't engage directly with Donald Trump, who's spent the last 72 hours baiting the former president with blistering criticism blaming him for the Iraq War and 9/11 ( Politico ). Bush didn't even say Trump's name. But every word of his 20 - minute speech to roughly 3,000 people here Monday night was intended to make voters reconsider supporting Trump and his inflammatory, brash brand of politics that is so alien \u2014 and confounding \u2014 their own. \"I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated but we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our frustrations,\" the former president said, campaigning for his brother in advance of Saturday's Republican primary. \"We need someone who can fix the problems and calms our anger and that's Jeb Bush. CHENEY SAYS TRUMP SOUNDS LIKE A LIBERAL: Former Vice President Dick Cheney blasted Donald Trump as sounding like a \"liberal Democrat\" on Monday evening, as the Republican pres idential candidate continued to defend and expand upon his attacks of George W. Bush's administration and its failure to prevent the 9/11 attacks ( Politico ). Appearing on Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier,\" Cheney listened to the anchor read a list of the candidate's recent comments about Bush and 9/11 earlier in the day and during Saturday night's debate, including Trump's assertion that Bush and Cheney \"lied\" about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as an impetus to invade the country in 2003. \"H e sounds like a liberal Democrat to me, Bret. He's wrong, and he's I think, deliberately promoting those views in order to advance his political interests,\" Cheney responded. \"The question of WMD charge that the administration lied, that was thoroughly inv estigated by the Robb -Silberman Commission. They found absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support that.\" (That commission, however, was not charged with investigating \"the use of intelligence by policymakers,\" according to co -chair Laurence Silberman.) TRUMP CALLS CRUZ 'UNSTABLE': GOP presidential front -runner Donald Trump on Monday threatened rival Ted Cruz with legal action if the Texas senator does not \"take down his false ads and retract his lies\" ( The Hill ). \"Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individu al,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He is the single biggest liar I've ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous.\" BUSH SAYS SENATE SHOULD REJECT OBAMA S COTUS NOMINEE : Jeb Bush said he fully expects President Barack Obama to send a Supreme Court nominee to the Senate. And he expects the Senate to reject that nominee (CNN). \"That's his prerogative, he has every right to do it,\" Bush told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" about Obama's power to nominate a replacement for the conservative justice. \"The Senate has every right not to confirm that person ... Given his choices of Supreme Court justices in the past, the Senate of the United States should not confirm someone who is out of the mainstream.\" Bush stopped short of saying Republicans should use procedural maneuvers to block an Obama nominee. \"It's up to Mitch McConnell. It is not important to me,\" Bush said, referring to the Senate majority leader, who schedules votes. CRUZ AD FEATURES TRUMP ON SCOTUS: It took less than 48 hours for the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia to make its way into an attack ad in the 2016 election, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz warning that businessman Donald Trump cannot be trusted to nominate Scalia's replacement ( CBS News ). In a new television ad entitled \"Supreme Trust,\" a narrator ticks off a list of issues that have come before the Supreme Court. \"Life, marriage, religious liberty, the Second Amendment. We're just one Supreme Court justice away from losing them it all,\" the narrator says. The ad then cuts to footage from Donald Trump's interview on \"Meet the Press\" in 1999 where he says, \"I'm very pro -choice\" and says he would not ban partial -birth abortions. \" We cannot trust Donald Trump with these serious decisions,\" the narrator warns. ]]] CLINTON EXPECTS VETTED SCOTUS NOMINEE: Hillary Clinton said Monday in Elko, Nevada, that she is confident that President Barack Obama would nominate a Supreme Court justi ce who has gone through a confirmation process before, making it harder for Republicans to block the nomination ( CNN). During the question and answer portion of her event in a rural town in northern Nevada, the Democratic presidential candidate also tipped her hand on people Obama would consider. \"I think the President's going to look for somebody who has a record that is gonna be hard for the Republicans to be against,\" said Obama's first -term secretary of state. \"Somebody who is a sensible person with a g ood record and maybe somebody who's already been confirmed by the Senate.\" \"We've got some judges on the courts of appeals, they were confirmed 99 to nothing,\" Clinton said. \"So there people who have already gone through the process.\" General Assembly DEMOCRATS TRY LGBT AMENDMENTS; RULED DOWN: House Democrats continued efforts Monday to attach civil rights protections for LGBT Hoosiers to other legislation moving through the process, while a business group urged the Indiana House to address the issue (K elly, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). Senate Republicans last week killed a bill banning discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations against gay Hoosiers. Committee chairmen three times last Thursday turned down amendments offered by Democ rats. \"I'm going to rule the amendment out of order,\" House Education Chairman Robert Behning said last week. \"It's creative the way you have put this language together. I truly believe the issue you are bringing in front of us really belongs in Judiciary Committee.\" So the caucus tried instead Monday to put amend a bill on second reading -- when the whole body considers the proposal. Republican Speaker Brian Bosma ruled the amendment out of order. Specifically he said one was not related to the underlying bill. \"The bill deals with distribution of school funding to charter schools and the amendment deals with non -substantive related matters,\" he said. Rep. Matt Pierce, D -Bloomington, said charter schools receive public tax dollars and it's a simple connecti on that they should not be able to discriminate with those dollars. The body voted to uphold Bosma's ruling, which meant there was no vote on the amendment itself. ADOPTION RECORDS BILL PASSES HOUSE JUDICIARY: Indiana's adult adoptees have achieved yet a nother victory on their path to equal access to birth records. The House Judiciary Committee voted 11 -2 in favor of Senate Bill 91, which if passed would give adult adoptees from Indiana's \"closed records\" period access to their original birth certificate and adoption records ( Howey Politics Indiana ). Advocates from Hoosiers for Equal Access to Records (HEAR), a non -profit formed to push for adult adoptee access legislation in Indiana, applauded the committee for hearing the concerns of adoptees. \"We thank the House Judiciary Committee members for their commitment to providing equal access to personal information for all adoptees,\" said Pam Kroskie, president of HEAR. Under current law, Hoosiers adopted after 1994 have access to their records. Those adopted between 1941 and 1993 during Indiana's \"closed records\" period are forced to use a difficult and expensive intermediary system for getting their records \u2014 causing many to quit their search in frustration, or never start. The new law will equalize access to i nformation for all adoptees. \"SB 91 will finally allow adoptees to find the closure they desperately seek, uncover vital answers about their medical history and cure administrative headaches that come from having an amended birth certificate,\" Kroskie said . CHANGES COMING IN FENCED DEER LEGISLATION: Legislation imposing rules and restrictions on Indiana's high -fenced deer hunting facilities looks likely to pass through the House. But industry opponents are still lobbying for stricter language (Smith, Indiana Public Media ). Environmental and conservation organizations have long opposed high -fenced deer hunting, an industry left unregulated by the courts last year. The likelihood of the General Assembly banning the industry outright this session is essentially zero, but th e opposition groups hope to strengthen proposed rules and restrictions. One of those is fence height - the bill mandates a single fence of at least eight feet. American Humane Society's Erin Huang says that's not enough. \"A single eight-foot fence is not high enough to keep wild deer out and captive deer in,\" Huang says. \"We know that you can spread chronic wasting disease through nose -to-nose transmission at the fence line.\" But deer farmer Gary Jacobsen, who heads a group advocating for the industry, say s he's had experience using an eight -foot fence. \"It was a wild deer from the outside trying to get in and repeatedly jumping at the eight -foot fence - couldn't get in,\" Jacobsen says. High -fenced hunting opponents also want to raise the facility license f ees. The bill currently sets those at $300. EDUCATION BILLS CONCERN LANANE, AUSTIN: A bill allowing out -of-state teachers to work in Indiana needs to guarantee protections for students, an area lawmaker said Monday (de la Bastide, Anderson Herald -Bulleti n). Three state legislators voiced concerns about proposed state legislation involving education during the Third House legislative session at the Anderson Public Library. Sen. Tim Lanane and Reps. Terri Austin and Melanie Wright addressed bills being cons idered by the General Assembly. Austin, D -Anderson, said she is concerned about legislation that would allow school systems to hire up to 10 percent of teachers who have a degree only in the subject they will be teaching. She said the legislation will allo w teachers from another state to teach in Indiana if they have credentials and pass a criminal background check. \"They could have serious problems with unethical conduct in another state with students,\" Austin said. \"The Department of Education should make sure there are no pending criminal or personnel issues.\" TOUGH DRUG SENTENCE BILL TO BE HEARD: A proposal to mandate tougher sentences for some convicted drug dealers is set for consideration by an Indiana Senate committee ( Associated Press ). The propos al that was approved by the Indiana House last month comes two years after the Legislature approved a sweeping overhaul of the state's criminal sentencing laws. The Senate criminal law committee is scheduled to hear testimony Tuesday on the bill, which wou ld require judges to impose prison sentences of at least 10 years for those dealing more than 10 grams of illegal drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine. Bill sponsor Rep. Greg Steuerwald, a Republican from Avon, says the changes are needed to keep dange rous drug dealers off Indiana's streets. ANTI -TOBACCO ADVOCATES URGE CIG TAX HIKE: Advocates from major public health organizations across the state gathered at the Indiana Statehouse today to call on the General Assembly to make tobacco control a priori ty (Howey Politics Indiana ). The visit was part of Tobacco Free Indiana's (TFI) Day at the Capitol, in which advocates met with lawmakers and urged them to reduce Indiana's tobacco burden. Specifically, volunteers asked members of the State Senate to suppo rt the House of Representatives' proposal to raise the state's cigarette tax by $1. \"Raising the price of cigarettes by $1 would prompt 39,000 Hoosiers to quit smoking, prevent 32,400 kids from ever starting and save 20,400 lives from premature, smoking -caused death,\" said Monique French, chair of TFI. \"Right now, Indiana spends nearly $3 billion on tobacco - related health -care every year, which boils down to $920 per household. A cigarette tax increase means fewer expenses for our state and, most importantl y, more lives saved.\" INDIANA COMPETES CONTINUES TO PRESS LGBT ISSUES: A coalition of more than 475 Hoosier businesses and associations delivered a letter to the Statehouse Monday that calls for an end to the legal discrimination against the LGBT community (Indiana Public Media ). In the letter, Indiana Competes says providing civil rights protections to the LGBT community is critical to the state's economy: \"Indiana has the 16th largest economy in the United States, but permitting legal discrimination harms our state's ability to grow a talented workforce, attract entrepreneur ial innovation, and build a thriving tourism industry. To continue our economic growth, we must have the tools necessary to recruit and retain the best talent to live and work for us here, in Indiana. The people we recruit must know that they, their family and their friends are welcome here.\" Despite the failures of Senate Bills 100 and 344, the Indiana Competes insists there is time left in the legislative session to address the critical issue. Congress SENATORS BACKING McCONNELL OVER SCOTUS DELAY: GOP Sens. Rob Portman and Pat Toomey joined a growing list of vulnerable Senate incumbents calling to delay a new Supreme Court confirmation until next year, as more Republicans line up behind an election -year strategy of blocking a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia (Politico). Portman of Ohio and Toomey of Pennsylvania join Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin in taking a hard line against anyone President Barack Obama might pick to fill the vacancy, a striking mo ve in states that Obama won in his presidential elections. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose election year sales pitch emphasizes Republicans' ability to govern, came out against filling the vacancy within hours of Scalia's death. State GOVERNOR: PENCE OUTLINES CARRIER RESPONSE - Gov. Mike Pence outlined the State of Indiana's actions that began last week as soon as news broke that Carrier Corporation and United Technologies would relocate jobs and operations to Mexico. Neither Carrier nor U nited Technologies provided any advance notification to the State of Indiana that they were moving operations ( Howey Politics Indiana ). \"As governor, I was profoundly disappointed to learn that Carrier Corporation and United Technologies would relocate job s and operations to Mexico, costing hardworking Hoosiers more than 2,100 jobs. My heart goes out to all the families and communities that are affected by this news.\" \"From the moment our administration learned of this announcement, our Department of Workf orce Development reached out to employees of both companies to offer job -seeking, training and education resources,\" said Pence. \"I also instructed the Indiana Economic Development Corporation to review all incentive contracts previously offered to Carrier and United Technologies to evaluate options available to recover taxpayer investments,\" Pence continued. All incentives provided by the IEDC are performance -based, meaning that a company must comply with the expansion or job creation commitments agreed to in their contract with the IEDC in order to be eligible for tax credits and training grants. The IEDC has existing contracts to provide training grants to both Carrier Corporation and United Technologies. If the companies are found to be non -compliant wit h those terms, the IEDC will seek to recapture those grants to the maximum extent permitted by the agreement in order to protect Hoosier taxpayers. The IEDC entered a contract with Carrier Corporation in 2013 to provide up to $200,000 in training grants ba sed on the company's job creation plans. A majority ($197,815.76) of that contract has been awarded. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CARRIER ASSISTANCE: The Indiana Department of Workforce Development has been offering immediate Rapid Response services including, but not limited to: Immediate onsite contact with employer and employee union representatives; Assessment of worker job function and skills; Matching employee skills with open positions in local community; Providing training as necessary to impacted employ ees to help them gain new employment; Assisting in the application for additional benefits (federal Trade Adjustment Assistance - TAA); Career counseling and individual case management for each employee. Any affected Hoosier can visit www.workoneworks.com to find their nearest WorkOne location. \"With thousands of positions currently open across Indiana right now and an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, employers are vigorously competing to fill jobs. In tandem with job creators and local communities, the st ate is working to ensure quality employment for those affected as quickly as possible,\" said DWD Commissioner Steve Braun. GOVERNOR: PENCE, BRAUN TO ANNOUNCE GRANTS - Governor Mike Pence and Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Commissioner Steve Braun will announce recipients of the roughly $11 million in Skill UP Indiana grant funds on February 17 at 1:30 p.m. in the History Reference Room of the Indiana State Library (Howey Politics Indiana ). The Skill Up Indiana grant program provides fun ding to community partnerships to develop training and education programs that align with employer needs. Awardees will use grant funds to equip Hoosiers with the skills necessary to fill the one million jobs projected to be available over the next decade. GOVERNOR: PENCE TO ANNOUNCE RETURNING ADULTS PROGRAM - Indiana Governor Mike Pence and Commissioner for Higher Education Teresa Lubbers will join with Columbus Mayor Jim Lienhoop and Comcast to launch Indiana's \"You Can. Go Back.\" program at the Indiana Statehouse at 2 p.m. EST, Tuesday, February 16, 2016 (Howey Politics Indiana ). There are approximately 750,000 Hoosiers who previously earned college credit but have yet to complete a degree. \"You Can. Go Back.\" is Indiana's statewide effort to encourage these adults to return and finish a postsecondary degree or credential. JUDICIARY: SUPREME COURT INTERVIEWS SCHEDULED - The committee that will recommend to Gov. Mike Pence three finalists to succeed retiring Indiana Supreme Court Justice Brent Dickson w ill begin interviewing candidates on Wednesday (Associated Press ). The Judicial Nominating Commission will interview nine people on Wednesday, 12 on Thursday and nine on Friday. Among the 30 candidates are state Solicitor General Thomas Fisher, Magistrate Judge Paul Cherry of U.S. District Court in Hammond and 11 county judges. A second round of interviews is scheduled for March 3 -4. The interviews are open to the public and will take place at the Indiana State House. EDUCATION: PURDUE STAFFER QUITS - With Purdue University officials demanding an apology and hours before students planned to rally outside Hovde Hall to demand his firing for social media comments that pro -life groups took as rape threats, Jamie Newman left his job Monday morning (Bangert, Lafayette Journal & Courier ). \"Yeah, I just quit,\" Newman, an accompanist in Purdue's Division of Dance, wrote in an email to the J&C. \"Tell the world.\" Purdue confirmed that Newman had submitted his resignation Monday, effective immediately. \"The University has accepted the resignation and believes this is the appropriate outcome,\" said Julie Rosa, a Purdue spokeswoman. The move followed a week of turmoil on campus, with students, parents and alumni pressing Purdue to sanction Newman for a series of social m edia posts on a national pro-life news site, dealing with rape and abortion. Those comments were tied back to earlier, critical comments Newman made on the Facebook page of Purdue Students for Life and that group's \"Hands Up, Don't Abort\" fliers put up aro und the Purdue Black Cultural Center earlier this month. All along, Newman said allegations that he somehow threatened to rape Purdue students was a stretch and amounted to defamation of character. A Purdue University Police Department investigation, launc hed after students filed a report, found no criminal intent. And Purdue University, citing free speech policies, found no grounds to discipline or fire Newman. CHILDREN: 5% OF INDIANA KIDS HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES - The Indiana Youth Institute's annual Kids Count report highlights mental health issues facing Indiana's youngest ( Indiana Public Media ). In Indiana, 5 percent of kids have been diagnosed with serious behavioral problems, 4 percent with anxiety and 3 percent with depression. All those rates ar e higher than the national average. 40 percent of mental health problems are first diagnosed in adolescence, and Indiana Youth Institute's Interim President and CEO Glen Augustine says access to psychiatric care is a major problem for many young Hoosiers. \"If you look at children ages 12 -17, one in ten of them are having at least one depressive episode a year but only a third of them are getting the help they need,\" Augustine says. Indiana averages one mental health provider for every 750 people. And in som e counties, the ratio is one for every 14,000 residents. ABORTION: RTL PRESSER PR FETAL DISPOSAL - Indiana Right to Life will host a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 pm at the Indiana Statehouse to disclose new information regarding the disposal of abor ted babies in the state of Indiana (Howey Politics Indiana). Indiana Right to Life President and CEO Mike Fichter will present the information at the press conference and is expected to be joined by several legislators. Nation JUDICIARY: BOPP FAVORS DELAYING SCALIA SUCCESSOR - As the nation is stunned by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the question is what it will mean for the Supreme Court. This as they have an unusually large number of cases on controversial issues ( WTHI -TV). James Bopp Jr. has argued cases before the Sup reme Court and knew Scalia and his wife. \"It was shocking and heartbreaking, it really was, so it was a great loss to our country,\" said Bopp. Now a political fight looms over who will decide Scalia's replacement on the bench. Some state representatives ar e calling for the spot to be filled after Barack Obama's presidency ends. \"The first thing is, of course, the President has the right to nominate somebody to fill the vacancy of the U.S. Supreme Court. These are really decisions that the people should make by the next election, and not by a lifetime appointment by a president who is on the way out the door,\" said Bopp. \"By replacing one of the strong conservatives with a strong liberal you would have a radical change in the court and how the cases will turn out, but in this time of uncertainty Bopp said there's one thing he knows for sure. \"Somebody has very big shoes to fill.\" Local CITIES: FORT WAYNE COUNCIL, MAYOR ON COLLISION COURSE - n his 36 years on the Fort Wayne City Council, Don Schmidt can't t hink of a time when the council and city administration went to court over an ordinance (Gong, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). Neither can Allen County Superior Court Judge Stanley Levine, who served as City Council attorney from 1984 to 1995, or Mark GiaQui nta, who was a councilman from 1979 to 1995. Schmidt served from 1971 to 2007. But that's what could happen if tonight's council meeting goes the way some City Council Republicans want it to go. The council is expected to debate a bill, sponsored by Counci lmen Paul Ensley, R -1st, and John Crawford, R -at large, that would eliminate the city's public safety director position. \"I can't recall any instance where the city administration went to court against something that the City Council did or didn't do,\" Le vine said last week. Former Police Chief Rusty York was appointed to the position in 2013, a year when Fort Wayne saw a record number of homicides. He is the first person to hold the position after former Mayor Graham Richard eliminated it in 2000. The la st public safety director was Payne Brown, who left the position to become a deputy Allen County prosecutor. Proponents of eliminating the position say York's salary of $160,961 would be better used elsewhere in the city's public safety budget. Those oppos ed - including Mayor Tom Henry, Councilman Glynn Hines, D -6th, and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association - argue that mid -February isn't the proper time to make the cut. CITIES: EVANSVILLE TO GET HOUSING FUNDS - More than 40 Indiana cities, including Ev ansville, are sharing in $22.5 million in federal funding to modernize their public housing ( Evansville Courier & Press ). The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's grants for 41 Indiana communities will allow housing authorities to replace roo fs, replace old plumbing and electrical systems and make other improvements to aging housing. Evansville will receive more than $1.2 million, according a news release from HUD. Henderson, Kentucky, is slated to receive just more than $570,000. COUNTIES: MADISON COMPANIES TO BOYCOTT CARRIER - Companies in Madison County who manufacture heating and air conditioning equipment are now boycotting Carrier. The boycott comes after the company announced it was moving from Indianapolis to Mexico. The Kokomo Tribun e reports several companies in Anderson are upset to hear that those jobs will now be heading out of the United States. Carrier says about 1,400 jobs here in the Indianapolis area will be lost in the move.

Scalia, 79, was found dead at a hunting resort in Texas after he did not appear for breakfast, law enforcement officials said. A cause of death was not immediately reported. President Obama, who disagreed with Scalia's jurisprudenc e, nevertheless praised him as \"a larger -than-life presence on the bench\" and a \"brilliant legal mind [who] influenced a generation of judges, lawyers and students, and profoundly shaped the legal landscape.\" Obama said he would nominate a successor, even though the Senate's Republican leadership and its presidential candidates said an election -year confirmation was out of the question. Scalia's sudden death casts a cloud of uncertainty over a Supreme Court term filled with some of the most controversial issues facing the nation: abortion, affirmative action, the rights of religious objectors to the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act, and the president's powers on immigration and deportation. An eight -member court could split on all of those is sues. It would seem to assure that the Supreme Court, often far down the list of voters' concern when choosing a president, would become a prominent issue in the campaign. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, soon to be 83, is the oldest member of the cour t, while Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is the same age as Scalia. OBAMA WILL NOMINATE SUCCESSOR; McCONNELL VOWS TO BLOCK: President Barack Obama on Saturday said he intends to nominate a new Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia ( Politico) . \"I pla n to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time,\" Obama said, delivering remarks from Omni Rancho Las Palmas in Rancho Mirage, California. Scalia, 79, died Saturday in Texas. His death leaves the Supreme Court with an ev en split of Republican and Democratic appointees during an election year. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called on Obama to leave the nomination for Scalia's replacement to the next president. \"The American people should have a voice in the selecti on of their next Supreme Court Justice,\" he said in a statement. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid expressed opposition to leaving Scalia's seat unfilled for so long. The next pr esident won't be inaugurated until January 2017. COATS PAYS TRIBUTE TO SCALIA: U.S. Sen. Dan Coats paid tribute to Justice Scalia, citing his \"brilliant legal mind\" ( Howey Politics Indiana ). Coats said, \"The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a great loss for our nation. Justice Scalia possessed a brilliant legal mind and loyally served our country throughout his distinguished career. His unwavering commitment to the Constitution is the model by which all Supreme Court justices should be mea sured. Justice Scalia leaves a remarkable legacy, and I offer my deepest condolences to the Scalia family.\" GOV. WHITCOMB HAILED AT MEMORIAL SERVICE: Former Indiana Gov. Edgar Whitcomb was remembered Friday as a patriot and a hero during a Statehouse memorial service that recalled his service during World War II and his escape from a Japanese prisoner camp as much as his time as the state's top executive ( Associated Press) . Many current and former state officials were among the crowd of a few hundred people in the Statehouse rotunda for the ceremony after Whitcomb's flag -draped casket arrived on a horse -drawn caisson in a military procession. Speakers talked about Whitcomb's full life, from growing up in the small southern Indiana town of Hayden to his Arm y Air Corps and political service that culminated with his term as governor from 1969 to 1973. They also recalled Whitcomb's around -the-world solo sailing trip in his 70s and then his retirement to a cabin overlooking the Ohio River where he died Feb. 4 at the age of 98. Whitcomb was a man who \"lived big,\" said Ed Simcox, who was Indiana's secretary of state in the 1980s and got his political start working on Whitcomb's Republican campaigns. Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma held up a copy of Whitcomb's 195 8 memoir \"Escape from Corregidor \" that he said he read as a child. In it, Whitcomb told of escaping from a prisoner -of-war camp on an island and swimming overnight more than two miles to another island only to be recaptured days later. \"Ed Whitcomb is a r emarkable story because he was simply a remarkable man,\" Bosma said. U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly, former Gov. Joe Kernan and former Indiana first lady Judy O'Bannon were among those attending the service, which concluded with military honors and a 19 -round cann on salute from the Statehouse lawn signifying Indiana's status as the 19th state to join the union. \"His life of service, courage and adventure inspired generations,\" Gov. Mike Pence said. \"... We will never fail to be inspired by your life.\" YOUNG, STUT ZMAN SPAR IN EVANSVILLE: A young Republican vying for the U.S. Senate finds himself in a political battle he couldn't predict (TriState ). \"It's politics and things like this happen,\" said Indiana 9th District Congressman Todd Young. Young visits the River City for the Annual Republican Lincoln Day Dinner. His campaign for Senate is not yet eight months old, but it's a number much greater gaining the attention of rivals. \"He came up short. We counted and we came up with 497,\" said Congressman Marlin Stutzman . \"So, we're waiting to see what the election board is going to decide.\" Young's opponents say he did not get enough petition signatures needed to appear on the ballot. Democratic leaders filed paperwork earlier this week saying Young is three names short of 500 needed in one Congressional district. \"This sends the wrong signal,\" said Young. \"This is not what Hoosiers are all about, certainly not what conservatives or republicans ought to be all about.\" Marlin Stutzman, a Republcian running against Young, s ays his campaign counted the signatures and came up with 497. \"My rule of thumb is if you need 500, you collect 1000 at least,\" said Young. Young says he's taking the challenge personally, especially from members of his own party. \"What's really sad about this is my Republican colleague, Marlin Stutzman, has decided to jump on the pile and join this effort to try to get me off the ballot,\" said Young, \"because he too doesn't want to face me.\" \"We have to make sure we are all doing our part to maintain the l aw,\" said Stutzman. MONROE GOP CHAIR ENDORSES YOUNG, BLASTS STUTZMAN: Monroe County Republican Chairman William Ellis endorsed Todd Young's Senate bid over the weekend, blasting Marlin Stutzman in a Facebook posting for \"siding with Democrats\" on the ballot access episode ( Howey Politics Indiana ). Ellis said, \"A few days ago, the Democratic Party made a challenge to the candidacy of Congressman Todd Young in his bid to become the next US Senator from Indiana. They are challenging his signatures in Distric t One, and claim, after certification and after Young was put on the ballot, that he is 2 or 3 signatures short. This is petty partisanship at its worst, and a desperate attempt to wrest away choices from the voters of Indiana. It is an equally desperate attempt to meddle with the Republican primary race for US Senate. None of this surprises me, however. It's been done before, and it is standard operating procedure of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to take out GOP candidates they do not want to face in November. They did it in 2012 in Missouri and in 2010 in Nevada. It will happen again, and I'm confident, like most others, Congressman Todd Young will be on the ballot in May. The winner will then get my full support. Yet what is surprising is that some Re publicans have decided to side with the Democratic Party. This disappoints me tremendously. When we let the Democratic Party dictate our strategy, especially when it has the potential to disenfranchise voters, sitting on the sidelines is not an option. The Monroe County Republican Party has a policy of not endorsing candidates in the primary, but because of the outrageous attack by the Democrats on Todd Young, I feel I have no choice to make a public declaration of endorsement for Congressman Todd Young in his bid for US Senate. I make this announcement as chairman of the Monroe County Republican Party but others can decide their choices, choices the Democrats should also let happen.\" MUNSTER PREPARING TO PASS HUMAN RIGHTS ORDINANCE: The Town Council has g otten its first look at a proposed human rights ordinance that would forbid discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and others (Wilds, NWI Times ). The proposed ordinance, closely modeled on one adopted by the city of Car mel, Indiana, would make it illegal to discriminate against anyone on the basis of race, sexual preference, disability or gender identity. The council did not vote on the ordinance when it was presented at its last meeting. Its introduction by Council President John Reed was for informational purposes only. The soonest the council might take it up is the Feb. 22 meeting. In the informational packet were letters of support from some of the town's major employers, including Community Hospital, the School Town of Munster, South Shore Arts and Miss Print. If passed, the ordinance \"would send a clear message that the town of Munster\" does not allow discrimination, Reed said. The proposed ordinance would make it illegal to obstruct someone from entering a business , entering into a contract, obtaining and maintaining employment or participating in any type of program or service available to the public based on the classifications cited. Religious worship, clergy while engaged in religious activities, not - for-profit clubs organized exclusively for religious purposes and private gatherings not open to the public would be excluded from the ordinance. The city Hammond passed a similar ordinance last April. BIG CLINTON, TRUMP LEADS IN SC IN CBS TRACKER: The CBS News Battleground Tracker poll shows that Donald Trump keeps a large lead in South Carolina, bolstered by support from conservatives and also from evangelical voters, who make up a large share of the electorate here. Trump has 42%, Cruz 20%, Rubio 15%, Kasich 9% and Bush 6%. For Trump voters, who have been relatively steadfast in their support over the last few months, the percentage who say they've firmly decided on Trump has increased. Trump's lead among evangelicals is up from January, and he has widened his lead among conservatives, too. In a contest marked by divisions among so - called \"insiders\" and \"outsiders,\" South Carolina Republicans show a strong preference for campaigns running as the latter, and this poll helps illustrate why. By four to one , South Carolina Republicans describe the \"establishment\" as a bad thing, and few describe it as a group that knows how to get things done. Hillary Clinton keeps her large lead in South Carolina, 59 -40% which has narrowed only slightly from last month, and she is bolstered by strong support from the African American voters who comprise most of the Democratic electorate here. TRUMP CITES CARRIER IN DEBATE: Donald Trump is weighing in on the news that Carrier is moving from Indianapolis to Mexico ( WRTV ). 1,400 workers at the heating, cooling, air conditioning, and refrigeration company got word Wednesday that the plant was being relocated to Monterrey. Trump says it wouldn't happen if he was president. Trump spoke to Brietbart News about the Carrier losses a nd the news that Ford is doubling production at a factory in Mexico instead of expanding in the U.S. He says we'll see more of the same if he's not elected president. HPI DAILY ANALYSIS: The notion that President Obama's last 11 months in the presidency don't really count and that he should pass on naming a successor to the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia is wrong, dangerous and smacks of a new level of partisan politics. By leaving the appointment to the \"next president,\" (which could be either Don ald Trump, Ted Cruz, or Democrats Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders) means that the U.S. Supreme Court won't be a full nine -member strength for up to 18 months. With significant issues on the docket, this means the Court won't be at full strength to perfor m its constitutional duties. Republicans control the U.S. Senate and must approve any Obama appointee. Obama will have to appoint a moderate who has already passed the Senate in bipartisan fashion. The U.S. Senate should do its job. - Brian A. Howey Camp aigns STUTZMAN AIDE FILES BALLOT COMPLAINT V. YOUNG: Republican Todd Young is facing a second challenge to his right to be on the ballot for Indiana's Senate race \u2014 this time from fellow GOP Senate candidate Marlin Stutzman ( IndyStar) . A Stutzman campaig n aide Friday filed a challenge similar to the Democratic Party's contention that Young did not collect enough signatures from registered voters. The Indiana Election Board will consider both challenges to the May primary ballot at a Feb. 19 hearing. By filing a separate challenge, the Stutzman campaign can make its own arguments to the board for why Young, the only other Republican in the race, should not be on the ballot. After Democrats filed their challenge Wednesday, IndyStar reviewed the petitions submitted to the secretary of state by county clerks and counted 497 verified signatures. That's the number Jodi Lohrman, outreach coordinator for Stutzman's campaign, included on her challenge filed right before Friday's deadline. DuBOIS GOP CHAIRMAN TALKS ABOUT ELLSPERMANN: As chairman of the Dubois County Republican Party, Don Hayes has had some pretty easy access to the statehouse the last few years (Grant, Washington Times Herald ). Hayes had a long history with Lieutenant Governor Sue Ellspermann of Hun tingburg, and on Friday Governor Mike Pence and his new Lieutenant Governor running mate Eric Holcomb were on the phone talking with Hayes. \"I think it's a case that Sue was shown an opportunity and not a case where she was shown the door,\" said Hayes. \"Th e governor seemed so upbeat in our conversation about the message he and Eric have. This General Assembly is going to produce some good programs. The governor and Eric appeared to be in a good mood and in a good place.\" Hayes and Ellspermann have plenty of history. \"I was one of the people that encouraged her to run for the state Legislature,\" said Hayes. \"She was a treasure as lieutenant governor. She is marvelous, bright, and creative. Her specialty was problem solving.\" Ellspermann is believed to be a front runner to become the next president of Ivy Tech. The college is in the process of a national search, but Hayes is convinced his friend will wind up with the job. \"This is a wonderful opportunity for Sue at Ivy Tech,\" he said. \"Sometimes the timing in l ife can be difficult. I just know educating people and helping build the workforce is right up her alley.\" The timing issue may be more complicated than it appears. Ivy Tech officials say they do not intend to name a new president no sooner than their meet ing in April. The Indiana General Assembly is now in session and scheduled to wrap up on March 14. The General Assembly is required to approve a new lieutenant governor and House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate President David Long are both part of the disc ussion on when the transition will come. \"I believe Sue will resign in the next week or so,\" said Hayes. YOUNG LASHES OUT AT STUTZMAN OVER BALLOT: Republican U.S. Rep. Todd Young has struck back at political foes in both parties who allege he failed to meet Indiana's ballot requirements in his bid for U.S. Senate ( Associated Press ). Young's campaign on Friday accused U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, his GO P rival, of embracing the \"Chicago -style\" tactics that President Barack Obama used to beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary. Democrats recently challenged Young's ballot placement, arguing he lacks the required number of signatures to run in the May primary. Stutzman later piled on. State law requires Senate candidates to submit signatures from 500 registered voters in each of Indiana's nine congressional districts. Both Stutzman and Democrats say Young is three signatures shy in northwest Ind iana's 1st Congressional District. Stuzman's campaign says the state election laws must be followed. HOLCOMB A UNITER, OR HATCHET MAN? As Gov. Mike Pence prepared to debate Democrat John Gregg during his 2012 campaign, he needed a sparring partner who could effectively pose as his opponent in debate practice (Cook & Schneider, IndyStar ). It had to be someone who knew Gregg intimately, who could recite his policy positions and voting record from memory, who could even imitate his mannerisms and down - home v ernacular. Pence chose Eric Holcomb. Now, facing a rematch with John Gregg after a surprisingly narrow victory four years ago, Pence is turning to the longtime Republican operative once again - this time to be his running mate and Indiana's next lieutenant governor. Pence's decision to tap Holcomb last week suggests that he sees a tough re -election campaign ahead. Despite bruising battles over same -sex marriage, a religious freedom law and gay rights, Pence has resisted a departure from his long -held conser vative positions on those issues. The result: A divided Republican Party and a rare opening for Democrats in a red state. To win, Pence will have to unite the GOP behind him and fend off body blows from Gregg and his national allies, who smell blood in the water. It's not the same kind of campaign Pence ran four years ago, when Gregg launched few direct attacks and Pence had broad GOP support. This one will be much fiercer. And Pence can't afford to have disaffected Republicans who are angry with him about social issues stay home on Election Day. In Holcomb, Pence has a running mate who cut his political teeth as a socially conservative brawler in rural Knox County - Gregg's home turf. Former State Rep. John Frenz, a restaurant owner who lost a subsequent el ection, said that if Pence is looking for a hatchet man, he has one in Holcomb. \"If that's what the role is, he'll definitely be able to fill that,\" he said. \"I think what I bring,\" Holcomb said, \"is I've been out on the road for much of the last decade, so I bring a lot of cultivated relationships. I've got relationships I can add to the equation that are based on work - not on campaigning, but on getting things done. So I bring that to compliment his Rolodex.\" OESTERLE, SMITH DEPART ON HOLCOMB: The ques tions is: Can Holcomb be a coalition builder for a fairly unbendable governor? Curt Smith, the conservative lobbyist, thinks he can. He called Holcomb's nomination \"an inspired choice\" (IndyStar). \"Eric knows a whole lot about John Gregg and is going to be a great campaigner for the governor and the ticket this fall,\" he said. \"He makes the campaign much more able to respond to John Gregg's charges and challenges, which we all know are forthcoming... I think he boosts the odds of re -election significantly.\" Bill Oesterle's response, however, raises some doubts. The former Daniels campaign manager called Holcomb's decision to team with Pence \"the most severe case of professional betrayal that I've enco untered in my career.\" \"Unfortunately, Eric is returning to his roots. In the name of personal gain, Eric has cast his lot with the side of religious zealotry,\" he said. \"You can't - in this environment - satisfy those disparate interests and he's made his choice. I think it's going to serve to heighten the divides in the party. There was no way this move is going to unite the party. It has the appearance of a gimmick.\" YOUNG CAMPAIGN DONORS: Weight -loss maven Jenny Craig, golfer Frank \"Fuzzy\" Zoeller and professional wrestling moguls Vincent and Linda McMahon have given money to the U.S. Senate campaign of Rep. Todd Young, R -9th (Francisco , Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). Such high -profile donors helped Young raise more than $749,000 in campaign contribution s during the fourth quarter of 2015, pushing his total donations for the election cycle past $2.9 million, according to the latest finance report his campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission. Young's financial backers in the fourth quarter inclu ded former Kansas senator and 1996 GOP presidential candidate Robert Dole; Henry R. Perot Jr., the son of billionaire H. Ross Perot, who ran for president as an independent in 1992 and as the Reform Party candidate in 1996; and John Menard Jr., owner of th e Menards chain of home improvement stores. Northeast Indiana residents who gave money to Young's campaign included Robert Taylor, chief executive officer of the Do it Best chain of hardware stores, and Tobias Buck, chief executive officer of Paragon Medic al, which manufactures orthopedic devices. Young entered this year with nearly $2.64 million in cash on hand, compared with nearly $1.1 million for Stutzman and about $382,000 for Hill. STUTZMAN DONORS: Fourth -quarter donors to Marlin Stutzman's campaign included Corydon resident Forest Lucas, chief executive officer of Lucas Oil Co.; Fort Wayne resident Charles Surack, president of musical equipment seller Sweetwater; and Peter Eshelman, owner of the upscale Roanoke restaurant Joseph Decuis ( Fort Wayne J ournal Gazette ). Other Stutzman contributors included the three brothers who run Fort Wayne - based Lassus Brothers Oil; Steuben County businessman and philanthropist Ralph Trine; Fort Wayne resident Stan Ziherl, president of beer wholesaler Five Star Distributing; and Portland resident Ronald Freeman, president of Jay Petroleum Inc. HILL DONORS: Baron Hill's fourth -quarter contributors included Richard Waterfield, managing member of Waterfield Capital in Fort Wayne; former U.S. Rep. Jill Long Thompson of A rgos; two daughters of the late shopping mall developer Melvin Simon; Bloomington resident Thomas Forbes, CEO of the Indiana University Alumni Association; and the re -election committee of Fort Wayne Mayor Tom Henry. Both Hill and Stutzman received individ ual contributions that were bundled by political advocacy organizations supporting the candidates - ActBlue for Hill and the Club for Growth and the Senate Conservatives Fund for Stutzman. Hill also collected nearly $105,000 from political action committee s in the fourth quarter, compared with nearly $72,000 for Young and $18,500 for Stutzman. Hill's donors included PACs representing teachers, carpenters, machinists, communications workers and air -traffic controllers ( Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). Presidential 2016 FEISTY DEBATE FOR REPUBLICANS IN SC: Republican White House hopefuls insisted that President Barack Obama step aside and let his successor nominate the next Supreme Court justice, in a raucous Saturday night debate that also featured harshly personal jousting over immigrati on and foreign policy ( Associated Press ). The debate was shaken by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia hours before the candidates took the stage. Among the contenders, only Jeb Bush said Obama had \"every right\" to nominate a justice during his final year in office. The former Flo rida governor said the presidency must be a strong office - though he added that he didn't expect Obama to pick a candidate who could win consensus support. The five other candidates on the stage urged the Republican -led Senate to block any attempts by the president to get his third nominee on the court. \"It's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it,\" Donald Trump said. \"It's called delay, delay, delay.\" A debate that began with a somber moment of silence for Scalia devolved quickly into fightin g between Trump and Bush, then between Trump and Cruz. The exchanges highlighted the bad blood between the billionaire businessman and his rivals as the race turns to South Carolina, a state known for rough -and-tumble politics, where the next Republican primary will take place in one week. Trump, repeatedly interrupting his rivals, lashed out at Cruz after the Texas senator challenged his conservative credentials, calling him the \"single -biggest liar\" and a \"nasty guy.\" The real estate mogul also accused Bu sh of lying about Trump's business record and said Bush's brother - former President George W. Bush - lied to the public about the Iraq war. Bush, who has been among the most aggressive Republican candidates in taking on Trump, said that while he didn't mi nd the businessman criticizing him - \"It's blood sport for him\" - he was \"sick and tired of him going after my family.\" Trump was jeered lustily by the audience in Greenville, South Carolina, a state where the Bush family is popular with Republicans. KASICH'S WARNING: Ohio Gov. John Kasich sought to inject the election's high stakes into the discussion in the midst of the fiery exchanges between his competitors. \"I think we're fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don't stop this,\" Kasich said (The Hill). CRUZ SAYS TRUMP WOULD APPOINT LIBERAL: Ted Cruz attacked rival Donald Trump's conservative bona fides during the GOP presidential debate Saturday night, arguing that the real estate mogul would appoint a liberal to the Supreme Court if he were elected president. Cruz and Trump sparred intensely more than halfway through the debate in South Carolina, with the Texas senator going after the businessman's past positions on partial -birth abortion and gun control. \"If Donald Trump is president, he will appoint liberals,\" Cruz stated, trying to speak over the businessman, who repeatedly attempted to interrupt as the crowd grew louder in the debate hall. Cruz added that under Trump, \"your Second Amendment will go away.\" Trump shot back that Cruz \"w anted John Roberts on the Supreme Court,\" noting that the chief justice twice voted in favor of upholding President Obama's namesake healthcare law, which is unpopular on the right. \"I did not nominate John Roberts, I would not nominate John Roberts,\" Cruz retorted before suggesting that Trump was acting childish by interrupting him. CANDIDATES WANT TO WAIT ON SCALIA REPLACEMENT: The death of Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday thrust the Supreme Court to the center of the already - volatile Republican pres idential race, with the party's candidates asserting that President Obama should not nominate a successor as they sought to court conservatives who have driven the party's discourse in the current campaign (Politico). With Senator Ted Cruz and Donald J. Tr ump riding a wave of voter anger to victory in the first two nominating states, the issue was one of rare unanimity in a field in which the candidates showed again in the debate Saturday night that they diverged on much else. Their opposition to Mr. Obama coming forward with a nomination highlighted how the candidates were ever mindful of the party's hard -line base, particularly as the contest moves to the Southern states (New York Times). \"I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it: I t's called delay, delay, delay,\" Mr. Trump said at the debate, referring to the Senate Republican leader, winning booming applause from the audience in a state where polls show he enjoys a lead ahead of the primary this week.d Mr. Cruz warned that, given M r. Scalia's death, \"two branches of government hang in the balance, not just the presidency, but the Supreme Court,\" citing future decisions on guns, abortion and same -sex marriage. BAD DEBATE FOR TRUMP: There is widespread consensus that Donald Trump ha d a very bad night in Greenville. The question is whether that will cause lasting damage, or if he continues to be coated in Teflon ( Washington Post ). One of the problems for leaders of the chattering class is that they have been so wrong about Trump so ma ny times for so many months that everyone is gun -shy about predicting his impending decline. The billionaire was flustered and cranky. Not only was he thrown off his game by sustained boos from the crowd and a pile -on by his rivals, but he often sounded more like a Democrat than a Republican. He didn't just call George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq a disaster - which he has done before - but he blamed him for 9/11 and said that the former president \"lied\" about the presence of weapons of mass destructio n as a pretext for war. \"Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake,\" the frontrunner said at the Peace Center. \"George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.\" Trump again defended Planned Parenthood, as everyone else promised to defund it. \"It does wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion,\" he said. \"Wonderful things that have to do with women's health.\" CRUZ STARES DOWN MODERATOR: Presidential contender Ted Cruz stared down CBS News host John Dickerson during the GOP primary debate Saturday night as the moderator corrected the Texas senator on past nominations for the Supreme Court (The Hill ). \"We have 80 years of precedent of not conf irming Supreme Court justices in an election year,\" Cruz started, arguing President Obama shouldn't appoint a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Saturday. \"I'm sorry to interrupt - were any appointed in an election year?\" Dickerso n interjected, before Cruz acknowledged he meant to say there was lengthy precedent of \"not confirming\" in an election year. \"But Kennedy was confirmed in '88,\" Dickerson said. \"Kennedy was confirmed in '87,\" Cruz shot \"He was appointed in '87, confi rmed in '88. That's question: Is it appointing or confirming,\" Dickerson said. \"In this case, it's both. But if I could answer the question?\" Cruz asked. \"I just wanted to get the facts straight for the audience,\" Dickerson added. Cruz paused for seve ral seconds and stared at the moderator, apparently weighing whether to launch an attack on the media as he's done in previous events, before the audience starting booing. \"Justice Scalia was a legal giant. He was someone I knew for 20 years,\" he said in r emembering the late justice. GILMORE SUSPENDS CAMPAIGN: Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore has decided to suspend his campaign ( Politico ). Gilmore's decision on Friday ends a campaign that failed to gain any traction at all, even among some of the lowest -polling candidates among the GOP primary when it was at its largest. Sunday Talk RUBIO SAYS SENATE WON'T APPROVE SCALIA REPLACEMENT: Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said Sunday morning that President Obama should not appoint a successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia ( The Hil l). And even if the president does appoint a replacement, the Florida said that the Senate will \"not move forward on a Supreme Court nominee until after the election.\" \"Mitch McConnell last night was very clear,\" Rubio said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Scalia, 79, died Saturday during a hunting vacation in Texas. Rubio said on Sunday that the Supreme Court can function with eight justices during Obama's last year in office. \"There'll be an election in November and we're going to have a debate about what kind of justice should replace Scalia and the voters are going to get to vote for a new president.\" He said the president can nominate whomever he wants, but \"it's pretty clear,\" that the Senate is not going to act. \"We're not moving forward on it, period,\" he said. RUBIO CALLS CRUZ A LIAR: Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio on Sunday accused primary rival Ted Cruz of lying in trying about the Florida senator's positions on abortion and gay marriage ( The Hill ). \"And the bottom line is there's been this disturbing pattern over the last couple of weeks from Ted Cruz of just saying things that are not true,\" Rubio said on CNN's \"State of the Union .\" \"Just in the last week he's lied about my record on marriage, he's lied about my record on Planned Parenthood, of course he lied about Ben Carson in Iowa.\" He also said Cruz is not the \"purist\" on immig ration that he portrays himself to be. \"And then he also is not telling the truth about immigration,\" Rubio said of Cruz. \"I mean, he goes around portraying himself as this purist, you know, 'Ted Cruz the purist on immigration.'\" BUSH DEFENDS CJ ROBERTS SELECTION: Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush on Sunday said his brother's nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court can be \"defended,\" despite several decisions upholding ObamaCare that have irked conservatives ( The Hil l). \"John Roberts, I think, can be a defended choice for sure,\" Bush said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"The ObamaCare decision, I was disappointed in, but he's made some really good rulings beyond that.\" \"Here's the deal, I think the lesson learned is yo u pick someone with a proven, longstanding record, a history you can point to when he wasn't considered or she wasn't being considered for the nomination of the Supreme Court, when he or she was doing their work, and the consistency of their rulings is wha t mattered,\" he added. \"That's the Scalia approach.\" SANDERS SAYS WALL STREET INFLUENCES CLINTON: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday that Wall Street is influencing rival Hillary Clinton with millions of dollars in campaign dona tions and speaking fees (The Hill ). \"Obviously, I don't think there's any debate,\" he said on \" Fox News Sunday ,\" in response to a question about whether Wall Street donations have influenced the former secretary of State. \"She's obviously not the only cand idate out there,\" he said. \"Many Republicans are raising huge amounts of money from Wall Street as well.\" He added that every candidate says that the donations from Wall Street and the fossil fuel industry don't impact their decisions. \"Every candidate say s that. Well the question that we ask: Is Wall Street and all of these other billionaires and wealthy individuals, are they really so dumb? Why are they contributing to much money?\" \"I'll let the American people make that decision,\" he said. SANDERS COUR TS BLACKS: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said on Sunday that black voters should choose him over rival Hillary Clinton because he is focusing on an agenda \"that works for all Americans\" ( The Hill) . \"But especially for those who were hard est hurt, hardest hit economically,\" he said on \" Fox News Sunday .\" Sanders outlined his agenda, which includes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next several years, achieving pay equity for women, creation millions of decent -paying jobs and rebuilding the \"crumbling infrastructure.\" \"We are talking about focusing on the outrageously high rate of youth unemployment in the African American community. We are talking about having the United States join the rest of the industrialized world guarant eeing healthcare for all, making tuition at public colleges and universities free so all of our kids regardless of income can get the higher education,\" he said. TRUMP WON'T SAY BUSH43 SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMPEACHED: GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trum p on Sunday refused to acknowledge past comments that former President George W. Bush \"absolutely\" should have been impeached over the Iraq War ( The Hill). \"I didn't endorse anything,\" Trump said on ABC's \"This Week,\" before attacking rival Jeb Bush. \"I th ink he did a terrible thing when he went into Iraq and we can all be nice and we can be politically correct and we can say how wonderful -- and Jeb Bush, his brother, took him five days before he even understood how to answer the question.\" Trump said he w as the \"only one on the stage\" to say that invading Iraq would destabilize the Middle East. \"I was against the war even though I'm the most militaristic person there is,\" he said. \"I said don't go on this stage, don't go on the -- don't do this war. If you do this war, you're going to destabilize the entire Middle East. That's exactly what happened. That's why we have the migration and all of the other problems that we have right now in the Middle East.\" TRUMP SEES STOCK BUBBLE: Republican presidential ca ndidate Donald Trump suggested during a recent interview with \" Face the Nation \" that the recent turbulence in the stock market could spell trouble for the U.S. economy (CBS News ). \"I think we're in a bubble, and I've been saying - I said it to you the last time I spoke to you before the markets - we're too reliant on China and Asia and other places, and I told you that the last time you interviewed me,\" Trump said. \"And I've so far been very right.\" \"I've been right about a lot of things actually,\" he added . \"I've been right about take the oil, hit the oil. But we are in a bubble. We're in a very bad bubble. We are very tied to China and to Asia. It's not a good thing.\" Justice Scalia 1936 -2016 CONFLICTING REPORTS, CONFUSION SURROUND DEATH: Inside the cl oistered chambers of the Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia's days were highly regulated and predictable. He met with clerks, wrote opinions and appeared for arguments in the august courtroom on a schedule set years in advance. Yet as details of his su dden death trickled in Sunday, it appeared that the hours afterward were anything but orderly ( Washington Post ). The man known for his elegant legal opinions and profound intellect was found dead in his room at a hunting resort, either by a housekeeper or the ranch owner, according to conflicting reports. It then took hours for authorities in remote West Texas to find a Justice of the Peace, officials said Sunday. When they did, she pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body and decide d not to order an autopsy. A second Justice of the Peace, who was called but couldn't get to Scalia's body in time, said she would have ordered an autopsy. \"If it had been me...I would want to know,'' Juanita Bishop, a Justice of the Peace in Presidio, Tex ., told The Washington Post in an interview Sunday about the chaotic hours after Scalia's death at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury compound less than an hour from the Mexican border. In a statement Sunday, the U.S. Marshals Service, which provides securit y for Supreme Court justices, said that Scalia had declined a security detail while at the ranch, so marshals were not present when he died. \"Deputy U.S. Marshals from the Western District of Texas responded immediately upon notification of Justice Scalia' s passing,\" the statement said. SCALIA'S DEATH ALTERS COMING TERM: Justice Antonin Scalia's death will complicate the work of the Supreme Court's eight remaining justices for the rest of the court's term, probably change the outcomes of some major cases and, for the most part, amplify the power of its four -member liberal wing ( New York Times ). It takes five votes to accomplish most things at the Supreme Court, and until Saturday, that meant Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was in control when the court's four -member liberal and conservative blocs lined up against each other. But with three remainin g conservatives, only the liberal side can command a majority if it attracts Justice Kennedy's vote. And if it does not, the result is a 4 -to-4 deadlock. If that happens, the court can automatically affirm the decision under review without giving reasons a nd without setting a Supreme Court precedent. Or it can set the case down for re -argument in the term that starts in October in the hope that it will be decided by a full court. \"It has been an extraordinarily long time since the Supreme Court has been for ced to deal with a departure that occurs in the middle of the term, as the court does here with Justice Scalia's death,\" said Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Chicago. \"This event almost certainly throws many cases that had been tentativ ely decided by 5 -4 margins into grave doubt, and will likely require the justices to reassess many opinions.\" 6 BIG CASES ON DOCKET: Six big cases are on the court's docket this term \u2014 on abortion, contraception, unions, voting rights, affirmative action and immigration \u2014 and Justice Scalia's death may affect all of them ( New York Times). The clearest impact is likely to be in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, No. 14 -915, on the power of public unions. When the case was argued in January, it seemed clear that the court was headed toward a closely divided decision in which the conservative majority would rule that workers who chose not to join public unions could not be made to pay for the union's collective bargaining work. The likely outcome now is a 4 -to-4 split that would leave in place a decision from the federal appeals court in California upholding the mandatory payments. That would be a major victory for the liberal justices and public unions. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS REACTS: \"On behalf o f the Court and retired Justices, I am saddened to report that our colleague Justice Antonin Scalia has passed away. He was an extraordinary individual and jurist, admired and treasured by his colleagues. His passing is a great loss to the Court and the co untry he so loyally served. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Maureen and his family.\" - Chief Justice John G. Roberts, reacting to the death of Associated Justice Antonin Scalia, 79, described as the intellectual cornerstone of the court's mod ern conservative wing. PENCE ORDERS FLAGS LOWERED: In accordance with a presidential proclamation issued late yesterday evening, Gov. Mike Pence has directed that flags at state facilities statewide be flown at half -staff to honor the service of United S tates Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away yesterday (Howey Politics Indiana). Flags should be flown at half -staff beginning immediately until sunset on the day of interment. Gov. Pence also asks businesses and residents to lower their fla gs to half - staff to honor Justice Scalia for his service to the United States. ZOELLER REACTS: Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller reacted, \"Those of us who defend against an expansive interpretation of the written Constitution and those who argue for limitations upon the federal government have lost an advocate in Justice Scalia.\" YOUNG REACT S: U.S. Rep. Todd Young reacted: \"The Constitution lost one of its fiercest defenders today. Justice Scalia was a towering figure for generations of rising conservatives, and his unrelenting dedication to our Nation's founding principles will be among his great legacies. With his passing we mourn the loss of a powerful legal mind and pray his successor will similarly commit to restoring constitutional limits in an age of lax liberalism that has eroded the rule of law.\" BROOKS REACTS: U.S. Rep. Susan W. Br ooks (R -IN) today issued the following statement regarding the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia: \"Justice Antonin Scalia was a brilliant jurist and legal mind whose three decades of service on the Supreme Court have left an enduring legacy for our country. His conservative voice and passionate defense of the Constitution will be greatly missed, and I join the nation in mourning. My thoughts and prayers are with Justice Scalia's family and friends.\" WALORSKI REACTS: Rep. Jackie Walorski react s, \"Today, Americans mourn the loss of Justice Scalia, a true patriot and one of the greatest defenders of the Constitution and conservative values. Dean and I send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, family, and friends.\" ROKITA REACTS: U.S. Rep. Tod d Rokita issued the following statement on the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. \"Today we mourn the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia was a true defender of the Constitution and the God -given rights it enshrin es. During his time on the court, he championed limited government, strict constructionism, and American Exceptionalism. A small group of Congressman and I had dinner with him occasionally. He was a great man who cared more deeply about the state of the n ation than most will ever know or some would ever care to admit. I tried to glean as much as I could from each encounter. Like me, he clearly worried whether we were going to be able keep alive the unique gift the Founders had given us, but at the end of each conversation he was always optimistic that Americans would lead the way through it all and that our country would remain the beacon of hope for the world and the envy of world history. The American judicial system, America itself, and the world were all well -served with Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court.\" SEN. BROWN REACTS: State Sen. Liz Brown reacted: \"The family of Justice Antonin Scalia is in my prayers as we learn of this remarkable man's death. Justice Scalia was a fierce defender of the Con stitution and his presence on the highest court of the land will be greatly missed. His death leaves a major void on the Supreme Court.\" CARDWELL REACTS: Indiana Republican Party Chairman Jeff Cardwell reacted: \"We are deeply saddened by the sudden loss of Justice Scalia. With his nomination from President Ronald Reagan, he fought tirelessly for conservative values and defended our U.S. Constitution with a passion and fervor that is rarely seen today. He will be forever remembered for not only his thought provoking oral and written argument style, but also for his dedication to our country. This is a great loss for America. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this time.\" JEB BUSH REACTS: Jeb Bush reacts: \"Today we lost a great man whose p rincipled service left our nation vastly better off. This afternoon at Mass, Columba and I prayed for Justice Scalia, who was devout in faith and has been brought home to God in heaven. Our prayers are also with his wife, Maureen, his children and his 28 grandchildren. Justice Scalia was a brilliant defender of the rule of law --his logic and wit were unparalleled, and his decisions were models of clarity and good sense. I often said he was my favorite justice, because he took the Constitution, and the respo nsibility of judges to interpret it correctly, with the utmost seriousness. Now it is up to all of us to fight for the principles Justice Scalia espoused and carry forth his legacy.\" RUBIO REACTS: Sen. Marco Rubio reacted, \"Today, our nation has suffered a deep loss. Justice Scalia was one of the most consequential Americans in our history and a brilliant legal mind who served with only one objective: to interpret and defend the Constitution as written. One of the greatest honors in my life was to attend oral arguments during Town of Greece v. Galloway and see Justice Scalia eloquently defend religious freedom. I will hold that memory forever. The next president must nominate a justice who will continue Justice Scalia's unwavering belief in the founding pr inciples that we hold dear. Jeanette and I mourn the loss of Justice Scalia, and our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Maureen and his family.\" SCALIA APPEARED 3 TIMES AT NOTRE DAME: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was renowned by conservatives for his originalist interpretation of the Constitution, and he visited the University of Notre Dame to talk about his views at least twice during his nearly 30 -year tenure on the court (Sheckler, South Bend Tribune ). Scalia first visited Notre Dame in February 1997, when he gave a speech on interpreting the Constitution before a standing -room-only audience at DeBartolo Hall, and again in 2007, when he talked about the separation of fede ral powers in an unpublicized appearance at the university's law school. The Constitution \"means what it says and it says what it means,\" Scalia said in the 1997 speech, summing up the theory that emphasizes the original intent of the document's 18th centu ry architects. \"No more, no less.\" In October 2007, Scalia appeared at a conference for Notre Dame law students on the separation of powers, opening the conference with a lecture on constitutional interpretation. He spoke about the judiciary's role in the government, analyzed several cases that had come before the Supreme Court and answered questions before mingling with students, Notre Dame's student newspaper, the Observer, reported. POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS: After news broke Saturday of Antonin Scalia's d eath, President Obama swiftly put an end to the question of whether he would nominate someone to fill Scalia's vacant seat on the Supreme Court ( CBS News). Here's a quick overview of potential names on the Supreme Court short list: Merrick Garland, the chi ef judge of the D.C. Circuit court. Originally appointed by Clinton to the D.C. circuit, Garland had been floated previously for a Supreme Court seat after Justice John Paul Stevens retired in 2010. His neutral record on the bench, in particular, has earne d him praise from both liberals and conservatives. Patricia Millett, another D.C. Circuit court judge. Like her colleague Garland, Millett has also been considered for a seat on the highest court in the past. She was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit court in 2013 with a vote of 56 -38, after Senate Republicans had initially mounted a long, drawn -out filibuster to her nomination. Before that, Millett served as a partner at Akin Gump. Sri Srinivasan, also a D.C. Circuit judge. His bipartisan resume -- clerking fo r Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (appointed under Ronald Reagan), working in George W. Bush's Justice Department, and most recently serving as principal deputy solicitor general in President Obama's DOJ -- makes Srinivasan an attractive choice t o appease both liberals and conservatives. He was also approved by the Senate to the D.C. circuit court by a unanimous 97 -0 vote, after an almost year -long wait from his nomination in June 2012 to his confirmation in May 2013. General Assembly EARLY CONCLUSION: Sources in the Pence administration a re telling Howey Politics Indiana that the likely sine die of this session will occur on Tuesday March 8. Other legislative sources are telling HPI that the likely conclusion will come on Thursday March 10. PHARMACISTS EYE METH BILLS: Pharmacists say there are tell -tale signs that a customer is buying cold medicine to make methamphetamine: They peer behind the pharmacy counter, ask for the highest dosage and make multiple purchases in the same hour (Chokey, Associated Press ). But despit e pharmacists' confidence in identifying such people, some pharmacy chains fear that proposed legal changes in Indiana that would leave it to pharmacists to decide whether to reject suspected meth makers outright or require them to get a prescription for s uch medicines could lead to confrontations and put them in danger. \"We definitely don't want for our pharmacists to be in the position of law enforcement,\" said Heather Willey, a lobbyist for CVS Pharmacy. The bills, which have been passed by the chambers where they originated, are meant to help address the methamphetamine problem in Indiana, which led the nation in meth lab busts for a third straight year in 2015. A House bill by Rep. Ben Smaltz, an Auburn Republican, would allow pharmacists to require a p rescription from suspicious customers if they refuse versions of cold medicines that are tamper resistant or that contain lower doses of pseudoephedrine, an essential component in the making of meth. Speaker Brian Bosma and House Minority Leader Scott Pela th both backed the measure. A Senate proposal by Randy Head, a Logansport Republican, would require pharmacists to screen customers and allow them to deny sales outright. LEGISLATORS TALK ABOUT DRUG REMEDIES: Local legislators met to discuss important t opics in Indiana Saturday morning. It's part of the Third House Legislative Forum at Indiana State University ( WTHI -TV). The presence of drugs in Indiana continues to be a concerning topic among residents and legislators. \"Our populations within the prison s and jails has increased and our drug problem has not been solved,\" said Rep. Alan Morrison, District 42. \"It's a scourge on our communities, it upsets families, it upsets school systems,\" said Rep. Clyde Kersey, District 43. \"It's something that we need to take a look at very seriously, and I think that's what we're doing with several bills there in the statehouse now,\" said Rep. Bob Heaton, District 46. \"It's not going to be an easy task, there's all sorts of things I think that lead into the drug proble ms we have,\" said Senator Eric Bassler, District 39. Bassler says Indiana is spending too much time penalizing drug users and not providing enough rehabilitation. He says one way to help with the drug issue is to crack down on the drug dealers. \"The people that are selling the meth, or any drug for that matter, to our young people,\" said Bassler, \"They're the ones that we need to try to incarcerate for longer periods of time in order to maybe cut off that pipeline of drugs as much as we possibly can.\" ENVIRONMENTAL REG BILL UP TODAY: Environmental activists are set to present arguments before a Senate committee on a bill to limit rules that Indiana can place on environmental regulation ( WRTV). The bill due to discussed Monday already passed the House. It w ould restrict the state from enacting environmental rules that are tougher than federal laws. Opponents of the bill have argued that it is important for the state to retain its rights to make laws specific for Indiana. But bill author Republican Rep. David Wolkins of Winona Lake has argued the measure would prevent Indiana lawmakers from overreaching and stifling economic development. Congress MESSER REACTS TO CINCINNATI V.A. ABUSE: U.S. Rep. Luke Messer (IN -06) released the following statement after ne ws broke of alleged misconduct at the Cincinnati Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( Howey Politics Indiana ): \"It's sad the Department of Veterans Affairs is once again making headlines for alleged misconduct,\" said Congressman Messer. \"Many Hoosier veterans in my district rely on the Cincinnati VA for care, yet so far, the VA has been very cryptic and given my office few details about what's going on. Our veterans deserve better. They deserve an honest assessment of exactly what's happening at the Cincinn ati VA, and anyone involved in misconduct must be held accountable.\" RYAN LAYS OUT STARK BUDGET CHOICES: House Republicans can do three things with the 2017 budget: pass it, punt on it or just give up ( Politico) . That's the message Speaker Paul Ryan (R -Wisconsin) delivered to his conference Friday morning during a prolonged meeting in the Capitol that was described by attendances as an airing of grievances about the funding blueprint before the House. The top -line numbers for the budget, which were agreed to last year, have met a familiar roadblock with conservative lawmakers who question why spending levels were increased for 2017 as part of an omnibus debate with Democrats. Ryan opened the Republican meeting by describing the realities of tackling a budg et, stressing there was an opportunity to act on a conservative agenda if the House can move past the current budget stalemate. But lawmakers need to act, Ryan said. He asked whether Republicans were willing to give up on the appropriations process and a p otential chance at entitlement reform over a relatively small funding increase. State CRIME: SHARP HOMICIDE JUMP FOR KIDS, TEENS - Indiana saw a sharp increase in homicides among children and teenagers in 2013, and homicide was the leading cause of dea th for blacks ages 15 to 24, according to a report released Monday by a group that tracks such statistics (Coyne , Associated Press ). The Indiana Youth Institute, a nonprofit that works to improve child development, says homicide deaths for those younger th an 20 jumped from 35 in 2012 to 65 in 2013, which was the most recent year for which data was available. Of those 65 homicides, about 73 percent occurred in Marion, Lake and Allen counties, which are the state's most populous, the report says. \"That's an a larming statistic,\" said Glenn Augustine, the institute's interim CEO and president. \"Any time we see juveniles involved in violent crime, that's an alarming statistic.\" Homicide was the top cause of death among blacks ages 15 to 24, with 105. Accidents we re next, with 32, followed by suicide, with 10, and death by a law enforcement officer, with four. BUSINESS: CARRIER RECEIVED $5M IN STIMULUS FUNDS - Carrier, the company that announced it will move 1,400 jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico, received more t han $5 million for its Indianapolis facility from President Obama's stimulus plan (WRTV) . The Department of Energy awarded Carrier $5.1 million in clean energy tax credits in December 2013. The announcement said the money would allow Carrier to \"expand pro duction at its Indianapolis facility to meet increasing demand for its eco - friendly condensing gas furnace product line.\" HOUSING: STATE GETS $22M - More than 40 Indiana cities are sharing in $22.5 million in federal funding to modernize their public hou sing (Associated Press ). The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's grants for 41 Indiana communities will allow housing authorities to replace roofs, replace old plumbing and electrical systems and make other improvements to aging housing. An independent study HUD released in 2011 found the nation's 1.1 million public housing units face an estimated $25.6 billion in large -scale repairs. The city of Gary's housing authority is getting the largest of Indiana's grants, more than $3.5 million, foll owing by the Indianapolis Housing Agency, which will receive $2.6 million. Five other cities will receive more than $1 million each for housing upgrades. The northeastern Indiana community of Fremont is getting the smallest sum, about $39,000. Nation KENTUCKY: GOV. BEVIN BACKS I -69 - Local advocates for a new Interstate 69 bridge say they no longer have to argue the project's merits in Indianapolis or Frankfort (Evansville Courier & Press ). But any lingering doubt of state leaders' overall commitment w as quashed when Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin stood before lawmakers and a live television audience last month for his first State of the Commonwealth address. \"During the campaign, he came to the visit the BridgeLink board of directors to learn more about the project and hear our thoughts,\" said Brad Schneider, director of Kyndle, an economic development vehicle for Henderson and three other Northwest Kentucky counties. After being elected in November, Bevin met again with BridgeLink leaders and a Madisonville group of I -69 backers. Then, in his address, Bevin said: \"We are going to accelerate forward into this road plan the things that will allow us to look at the bridge in Henderson. These things you will see. We are going to start to study these; we are going to invest in this (I -69) highway because it goes from Canada to Mexico. It is the only north -south run this side of the Rockies that does so. This is the kind of thing we need to invest in because it is going to open up Western Kentucky in extraordinary ways.\" KENTUCKY: BILL WOULD REQUIRE SPOUSE APPROVAL FOR VIAGRA - Tired of what she considers the government inserting itself into women's private lives, a Kentucky lawmaker has decided to return the favor ( Washington Post ). Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, a Louisv ille Democrat, has introduced a bill that would force men who want to use erectile dysfunction drugs to jump through a series of humiliating hoops beforehand, such as visiting a doctor twice and getting notes from their wives. \"I want to protect these men from themselves,\" Marzian, who is a nurse, told the Courier - Journal. \"This is about family values,\" she added. Mazian told Fox affiliate WDRB that House Bill 396 would also require that someone seeking Viagra, Cialis, Levitra or Avanafil \"make a sworn stat ement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse.\" \"I started thinking, 'How would this body of men feel if the government was injecting [itself] in to their private medical decisions,' \" she added. World MEDVEDEV SEES NEW COLD WAR: Russia's prime minister accused NATO on Saturday of restarting the Cold War amid increased military maneuvers and troop deployments to countries neighboring Russia, moves the alliance's top official defended as a necessary response to aggression from Mosco w (Associated Press). Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told a meeting of top defense officials, diplomats and national leaders that sanctions imposed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and new moves by NATO \"only aggravate\" tensions. \"NATO's po licies related to Russia remain unfriendly and opaque -- one could go so far as to say we have slid back to a new Cold War,\" Medvedev said. \"On almost a daily basis, we're called one of the most terrible threats either to NATO as a whole, or Europe, or to the United States.\" Local EVANSVILLE COUNCIL TO UPDATE CIVIL RIGHTS ORDINANCE: After state lawmakers debated granting civil rights protections for sexual orientation, local policymakers aren't waiting (Martin, Evansville Courier & Press ). Evansville code has offered \"symbolic\" anti -discrimination protections for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community for more than four years. But the symbolic protection is unenforceable, city officials and advocates say. Days after similar state legislation failed, the City Council is considering whether to strengthen the city's human rights ordinance by \"giving teeth\" to a city commission to further protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The or dinance the City Council will consider Feb. 22 is short and simple: delete one provision of the Human Relations Commission section from the city code, effective immediately. The section was added in 2011, with the addition of the protections to sexual orie ntation and gender identity. While small, it includes one word that makes the 2011 human rights ordinance measure symbolic: voluntary. City code states \"the commission's authority shall be limited to power to accept such complaints, notify respondents of t he complaint(s) and attempt voluntary investigation(s) and voluntary mediation(s).\" \"It's small in words but has a lot of punch to it,\" said City Council attorney Josh Claybourn. \"By removing that provision, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientatio n and gender identity is then treated the same as discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color etc.\" CITIES: BLOOMINGTON RECOVERS STOLEN FUNDS - Mayor John Hamilton on Friday called the receipt of two state reports the end of a long, hard road for the city (Banta, Bloomington Herald -Times). Hamilton referred to two special investigations reports by the Indiana State Board of Accounts, which the city received Thursday, that detail the theft of approximately $464,500 from the city by two former employees , Judith Seigle and Justin Wykoff. \"This report, along with Mr. Wykoff's incarceration and Ms. Seigle's upcoming sentencing, marks the end of what has been a long and difficult chain of events for our residents and employees,\" Hamilton said in a statement Friday afternoon. \"We work daily to be sure the likes of it are never repeated.\" CITIES: INDY FACES FORFEITURE LAWSUIT - Indianapolis city and law enforcement officials face a lawsuit alleging misuse of money and property seized during investigations. Th e lawsuit was filed in Marion County court by the national nonprofit Institute for Justice on behalf of six parties. The Indianapolis Star reports that the suit aims to invalidate a state law allowing police and prosecutors to deduct law enforcement costs from forfeited funds as a type of reimbursement, with any remainder going to a fund used to build schools. An attorney for the group argues that the statute violates the Indiana Constitution, which says that all, not some, forfeited funds must be deposited into the school fund. Court records show forfeited funds are divided between the law enforcement agency and the prosecutor's office in Marion County. COUNTIES: HAMILTON COUNCILMAN BELDEN DIES - Beloved Hamilton County Councilman and Indiana Football Hal l of Fame coach Jim Belden has died ( IndyStar) . Steve Dillinger, a Hamilton County commissioner and Belden's best friend of nearly 40 years, told IndyStar the legendary coach died Sunday surrounded by loved ones at his Carmel home after battling a serious illness. He was 77 years old. After decades of serving as both a coach and an elected official in Hamilton County, Belden's impact and presence will not soon be forgotten. \"He is a legacy in Hamilton County. He truly is,\" Dillinger said. \"There are a lot o f young men that he mentored and I'm sure they're going to be devastated. His first coaching job came in 1964 when he turned around a struggling Westfield football program. In 1967, he made the move to Noblesville to lead the Millers. COUNTIES: PORTER SP ENT $9M ON CONSULTANTS - Porter County government spent just more than $9 million last year on contractual and consultant services from a budget of nearly $74.5 million ( NWI Times ). The total is nearly 4 percent more than the year prior, according to figur es obtained from the Porter County auditor's office. \"I haven't seen any misuses of it,\" Porter County Commissioner Laura Blaney, D -South, said of the spending. \"I think we're doing a good job keeping costs in line.\" About a third of the contractual and co nsultant spending last year was composed of the county's $3.5 million annual dues to the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority. Another $1.3 million was paid to Correct Care Solutions for the improved inmate medical care services at the county j ail, according to county records. The improved service provides 24 -hour health care and mental heath treatment for the first time to inmates. COUNTIES: EX -DELAWARE DEPUTY CHARGED - The FBI says a now -retired sheriff's deputy in Delaware County sold more than $8,000 in county -owned ammunition. Arlan Johnson is a 29 -year veteran of the department. The Muncie Star Press reports that the theft charge against him comes from federal prosecutors because the sheriff's department gets federal funding. Authorities allege he sold the ammunition between January 2012 and last August, a month before he retired. They say that during a time that he racked up more than $100,000 in gambling losses. According to the FBI, Johnson sold the ammunition to colleagues in the sheri ff's office, two friends and the owner of a gun store in Muncie. COUNTIES: TAX RATE APPROVED FOR FLOYD - The Department of Local Government Finance certified Floyd County's 2016 budget order and tax rates Thursday, paving the way for on -time property tax bills ( News & Tribune). The budget certification puts the county in a position to have taxes due May 10. \"The certification of the budget order allows local governments to better plan for their operations for 2016 based on the approved budget and anticipa ted revenue figures. In addition, the certification of the budget order and tax rates sets the stage nicely for on -time property tax bills, which is important for the predictable administration of the property tax system,\" DLGF Commissioner Courtney L. Sch aafsma said in a press release. \"A tremendous amount of collaboration between local and state officials is required to ensure property tax bills go out on time, and it is rewarding to see all the efforts pay off.\" Scott.A.Milkey From: Seigel, Jane Council-February 19 @ 10:00 a.m. Attachments: Justice Reinvestment Advisory Council draft agenda 2-19-16.docx **** This is an EXTERNAL email.

The connection between drug abuse and crime is well known. One -half to two -thirds of inmates in jails and State and Federal prisons meet standard diagnostic criteria (DSM -IV) for alcohol/drug dependence or abuse . (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2011) Opioid abuse has been identified as a major health concern in the state of Massachusetts, including Barnstable County. Opioid addiction puts individuals at risk for engaging in criminal behavior resulting in incarceration at Barnstable County Correctional Facility. From May 2013 - May 2014 , 46.5 % of the inmates entering Barnstable County Correctional Facility r eported an addiction to opioids , and 41% reported an addiction to alcohol. Combining prison -based treatment with community -based treatment upon release reduce s an offender's risk of recidivism, decreases substance abuse, improves prospects for employment, and increases pro -social behavior. (NIDA, 2011) Purpose The purpose of the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot P rogram is to examine the usefulness of a new Pre- and Post -release treatment program for opioid -addicted inmates at Barnstable County Correctional Facility (BCCF) . This Pilot program involves prison -based treatment and collaboration with community -based clinics to continue to provide treatment post -release . The program employs a multi -faceted approa ch to treatment; including the u se of the medication VIVITROL , counseling, and continued treatment with community -based providers. Mission To explore the efficacy of implementing a Pre -and Post -release treatment program addressing substance abuse. The program will be determined effective if it proves to encourage retention in substance abuse treatment and decrease rates of recidivism. Operational Definitions Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) - A record o f all criminal court appearances in Massachusetts for a particular individual, including arrests, convictions, dismissals, and serious 4 | B C C F V i v i t r o l P r e -R e l e a s e P i l o t P r o g r a m -J e s s i c a L B u r g e s s violations. The Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (DCJIS) is the state agency in charge of the criminal justice information system, including CORI services, for Massachusetts. Level of Service/ Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI) - A validated , evidence -based risk/needs assessment. The tool focuses on assessing eight criminogenic needs. Criminogenic needs ar e factors that contribute to criminal behavior according to research. The eight criminogenic needs are Patterns. The LS/CMI generates a numerical value, ranging from 0 to 40, indicating a risk level of: Low; Medium; High; and Very High. Medication -Assisted Recovery - A substance -abuse treatment approach made possible by physicia n-prescribed and monitored medications, along with other recovery supports, e.g., counseling and peer support. Naltrexone - (Revia) An oral/tablet used for opioid and alcohol dependence . Common dosage for treating alcohol and/or opioid dependence is 50mg da ily. Personal Contact - An individual designated by the inmate as an alternate contact outside of the facility. Naming of this individual is intended for purposes of data collection. VIVITROL - (naltrexone for extended -release inject able suspension) is the injectable form of Naltrexone. The medication is indicated for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL's purpose is to reduce the cravings for and block the effects of ingested opioi ds and alcohol. The recommended dose of VIVITROL is 380 mg delivered intramuscularly every 4 weeks or once a month. VIVITROL is contraindicated in patients that are actively using opioids and patients with acute hepatitis or liver failure. The most common side effect of the medication is injection site tenderness. VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program Outline The VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program at Barnstable County Correctional Facilit y (BCCF) began in April 2012. Dissemination of Knowledge Regarding Medica tion Assisted Recovery In June of 2012, education pertaining to medication -assisted recovery was added to the Programs Department curriculum. In June of 2012, Jessica Burgess , Director of Health Services, in collaboration with Roger Allen, Director of Inmate Services, trained all Programs Department staff to educate inmates on medication -assisted recovery. The education provided to inmates is objective information pertaining to Methadone, Suboxone, VIVITRO L, and other medications 5 | B C C F V i v i t r o l P r e -R e l e a s e P i l o t P r o g r a m -J e s s i c a L B u r g e s s used to treat addiction. Inmates learn of the importance of also participating in non-medicinal treatment methods, such as counseling and addiction meetings. Education on medication - assisted recovery is offered to male inmates by Joseph Trabucco and Sharon Day, both Treatment Specialists. Meagan Pavao , Treatment Specialist provides education to the female inmates. Education on medication -assisted recovery is presented to inmates in M -Pod every eight weeks. In Pods A, E, H, J, K , and L, education is presented approximately every six weeks. Inmates interested in participating in medication -assisted recovery will be asked to submit an \"Inmate Request Form\" to Jessica Burgess or Gail Dufault , Transitional Healthcare Coordinator, approximately t hree months prior to relea se. Participant Selection The VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program will be available to sentenced inmates only. No inmate will be coerced or pressured into receiving treatment in the VIVITROL program. In order to participate in the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program, an inmate must initiate contact and express interest to the Medical/Programs Department staff. Inmates will then receive the VIVITROL Program Inmate Letter (Appendix A). This letter informs inmates of t heir responsibilities in planning for treatment in the VIVITROL program , including requesting insurance enrollment, and reporting exact release date . All sentenced inmates that are determined medically appropriate , and agree to participate in comprehensiv e treatment , will be eligible for treatment in the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program. Un-sentenced inmates that request treatment with Vivitrol will be provided with information so that they may independently seek treatment upon release. Due to their unde termined release date, we are unable to schedule outpatient treatment, thus disqualifying pre -sentenced inmates from participation in the Vivitrol program. Drug Court Involvement As stated above, pre -sentenced inmates are disqualified from participation in the Vivitrol Program. The only exceptions made to this rule are in response to referrals from the Drug Court Judge of Barnstable District Court Judge John M Julian. In these case s, Judge Julian informs us of the referral by email and/or by a note on the mittimus . Judge Julian will refer the inmate for \"assessment of appropriateness for Vivitrol treatment\". In these cases, the course of treatment begins at the \"Vivitrol medical me eting\" (please see below). If the pre -sentenced inmate is interested in receiving Vivitrol treatment, Judge Julian will hold the individual at BCCF until treatment initiation and planning is complete. Judge Julian communicates an anticipated 6 | B C C F V i v i t r o l P r e -R e l e a s e P i l o t P r o g r a m -J e s s i c a L B u r g e s s release date f or the inmate so that BCCF's Transitional Healthcare Coordinator may schedule post -release appointments for the continuation of Vivitrol treatment appropriately. Insurance Inmates are asked to submit a request to be enrolled in Mass Health Insurance approximately three months prior to release. It is important for insurance coverage to be established prior to release to ensure access to post -release treatment . Inmates are instructed to submit an Inmate Request Form to Gail Dufault to apply for Mass He alth. VIVITROL Medical Meeting The first meeting with the interested inmate will occur approximately one month prior to inmate's release date. The first assessment will be completed by Gail Dufault , Transitional Healthcare Coordinator, or Jessica Burgess , Director of Health Services. At this time, the inmate will receive additional information about the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program. The medical provider and the inmate will discuss whether VIVITROL treatment is appropriat e. If it is determined that the inmate is appropriate for participation in the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program, data is collected pertaining to the inmate's substa nce abuse hist ory and plans for post -release (Appendix B). The inmate will be asked to sig n two Release s of Information (Appendix C) allowing BCCF to exchange information with: t he designated post -release treatment provider; and a designated \"Personal Contact\" . The inma te will also be asked to sign a consent for BCCF to run a CORI report quarte rly for data collection purposes after inmate is released. The medical provider and the inmate will review the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program Consent Form (Appendix D) together to ensure full understanding. If the inmate agrees to the information outli ned on this form, he/she and the medical provider will sign the consent. Medical Clearance All inmates planning to participate in the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program will require medical clearance by Dr. Steven Descoteaux. Medical Clearance will incl ude an assessment of overall health and Liver Function Tests (Blood Lab). Assessments/Data Collection Inmates participating in the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program will be evaluated using a validated assessment tool . 7 | B C C F V i v i t r o l P r e -R e l e a s e P i l o t P r o g r a m -J e s s i c a L B u r g e s s An inmate's risk level will be assessed using the Level of Service/ Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI). Roger Allen will conduct risk assessments on inmates in the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program approximately one month prior to release. An inmate's motivation for treatment w ill be assessed by their participation in available groups/classes during incarceration. Pre-Release Motivational Counseling Inmates in the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program will receive two individual counseling sessions prior to treatment with VIVITROL. The 30-45 minute counseling sessions will be provided during the last month of incarceration. A licensed mental health counselor will conduct these 1:1 sessions. The t wo sessions will focus on three main themes: 1) An assessment of motivational state and commitment to treatment . 2) Psychological education appropriate to the inmate's readiness for change . 3) Supportive and reinforcing counseling intended to strengthen commitment to recovery. Naltrexone Tolerance Trial Inmates participating in the VIVITROL Pre -Release Pilot Program will be prescribed Naltrexone 50 mg daily for 1 -3 days prior to beginning VIVITROL therapy . The purpose of this trial of Naltrexone is to assess for any adverse effects of the medication. Initiation of VIVITROL Treatment Inmates participating in the VIVTROL Pre -Release Pilot Program will receive the first injection of VIVITROL appro ximately 7 days prior to their release. A facility medical pro vider will prescribe the medication for appropriate inmates. Alkermes, the manufacturer of VIVITROL, has agreed to donate injections of the medication to BCCF's medical department for use in the Pre -Release Pilot Program. There is no cost incurred by BCCF for the medication. Alkermes' State Government Relations Manager Pamela O'Sullivan will work with Jessica Burgess, Director of Health Services, to schedule delivery o f the medication to BCCF. The medication wil l be delivered in increments of 12 injections as needed. VIVITROL injections will be stored in the refrigerator in the medical department. Doses of the medication will be carefully recorded in a log book as each dosing kit contains a hypodermic needle.

(Appendix E & F) This survey will be administered approximately thirty days prior to release , inquiring of cravings experienced during the week prior. The survey will then be administered again the day before release from incarceration. This is intended to assess the effect of the pre -release treatments on cravings to use substances . Medication Administration Trained medical staff members at BCCF will admin ister the medication. All Full -Time nurses at BCCF were trained on proper method of administration for VIVITROL on April 19, 2012 by Alkermes' Addiction R ecovery Associate James Squires .

To address myths and misinformation surrounding medication-assisted treatment. Outline of Presentation What is Medication-Assisted BCCFMedication-Assisted Treatment The use of medications, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a whole-patient approach to the treatment of substance use disorders. + = Medications used to treat substance abuse........ what do they do? Detox a person/prevent withdrawal Reduce cravings Block the feeling of being \"high\" To provide protection from impulsive use Alcohol Dependence Alcohol Misuse : When a person continues to drink alcohol even though it causes significant problems in their life. If alcohol misuse continues over a period of time, it can lead to..... Alcohol Dependence: A physical and emotional addiction to alcohol which disrupts health and relationships, and can result in neglecting responsibilities, or legal problems. 2Medications Used to Treat Alcohol Dependence Antabuse (Disulfiram) A prescription medication that causes a bad reaction (nausea, vomiting, and anxiety)if people drink alcohol while taking it. Knowing that it will make them ill if they drink, it helps them not to drink. Antabuse is a non-addictive medication. *Only works if the person takes their medication Medications Used to Treat Alcohol Dependence (Cont.) Campral (Acamprosate Calcium) A prescription medication, usually taken 3 times daily, that helps reduce the cravings to drink alcohol. Campral is a non-addictive medication. Medications Used to Treat Alcohol Dependence (Cont.) Revia(Naltrexone) A prescription medication that is used to reduce cravings for alcohol, and also reduces the pleasurable \"buzz\" obtained from alcohol. Naltrexone is a non-addictive medication. Medications Used to Treat Alcohol Dependence (Cont.) Vivitrol(Long-Acting form of Naltrexone) A prescription medication that is administered as a once-monthly injection. Used to reduce cravings for alcohol (and opioids), and also block the pleasurable \"buzz\" obtained from alcohol. Opioid Dependence Frequently Abused Opioids: Percocet Vicodin Methadone Heroin All can be administered by mouth, snorted, or injected intravenously (IV)Opioid Abuse in Massachusetts In the state of Massachusetts, in 2007,Opioid overdose was the leading cause of injury death. It was the third leading cause of death in general, only under heart disease and cancer. During the first two weeks after release from prison, the risk of dying from an accidental drug overdose is up to 50 times higher compared to the population as a whole.3Opioid Addiction A medical condition caused by changes in the brain. Continued use actually changes the brain, worsening the addiction. It can take months or years for the brain to repair itself.Medications Used to Treat Opioid Addiction Methadone Medically monitored, long-acting synthetic narcotic used to stop cravings. Full -Agonist. Pill or liquid form. Obtained at the Methadone Clinic, often daily dosing with possibility of \"take home\" doses. If dose consistently remains reasonably low, the person can function normally and not feel \"high\" Choice treatment for opioid-addicted Pregnant women Medications Used to Treat Opioid Addiction Suboxone (Buprenorphine) A prescribed medication that helps to reduce cravings and partially block the \"high\" of opioids. Partial-Agonist. Sub- lingual tablet or film form. Can be prescribed at a waivered doctor's office for home dosing Can cause \"precipitated withdrawal\" if taken too soon after an opioid Methadone and Suboxone are addictive medications, isn't that just substituting one drug with another? Why Methadone and Suboxone are Different Prescribed and controlled by a doctor legally If prescribed correctly, will not make person \"high\" These medications assist with controlling cravings so that the person can concentrate on changing addiction behaviorsMedications Used to Naltrexone) Non-addictive reduce cravings and block the drug's effects. Non-Narcotic. Must be detoxed BEFORE taking Naltrexone or will cause precipitated withdrawal Naltrexone comes in pill form or the injectable form, Vivitrol, that lasts for 30 days Also used to treat alcohol dependence4Who is Appropriate for Vivitrol Treatment at BCCF Must have a desire to abstain from using alcohol and opiates. Must be willing to participate in counseling and other recovery-support methods at a community clinic after release. Must be medically cleared by the doctor to be on the medication Vivitrol. Vivitrol Treatment : How does it happen at BCCF? Inmate requests treatment/information on Vivitrol treatment by writing to the medical department. Transitional Healthcare Coordinator meets one on one with inmate to determine if Vivitrol is the appropriate treatment for individual. Medical Clearance is obtained by Medical Director Inmate meets with a member of the Programs staff to complete an LS/CMI Assessment Vivitrol Treatment : How does it happen at BCCF? (Cont.) Inmate receives two counseling sessions with Mental Health Staff to discuss planning for recovery Naltrexone pill form is given for 3 days Vivitrol is administered 3 days prior to release Mass Health Insurance initiated Follow-up treatment at community clinic scheduled prior to releaseInterested in learning more about receiving these treatments upon release? Please write to the medical department Thank you for your attention! Questions? BBCF Vivitrol Program Update March 18, 2015 Jessica Burgess, MSN, RN : Director of Health Services Gail Dufault, LPN : Transitional Healthcare Coordinator Vivitrol Program began in April of 2012. As of March 18, 2015: 138 people treated in program Participant Statistics as of February 1, 2015: Average age: 31 27% participants female 70% of Inmates treated in program report a drop in cravings to use alcohol/opiates on pre-and post- treatment surveys. 78% of our inmates treated with Vivitrol have willingly shown up for their first post-release treatment appointment in the community. Sometimes, half the battle is getting inmates to follow through with their treatment after release, so we think these are great odds. Average length of treatment with Vivitrol after release is 5 months among our inmates treated. Approximately 40-45% of these inmates treated remains in treatment in the community, or has completed treatment and remains sober, some for almost 3 years now. We think this result is a positive one, as national statistics show that relapse rates for opioid addiction are over 85%. 82% of those treated with at been re-incarcerated.

It was an impressive group of community leaders and medical professionals. Myself and the Chief Probation Officer, Eric Zimmerman, were asked to be a part of the group. Accordingly, from this local task force, the judicial system was connected with many private providers that are willing to work with the courts and our Adult Probation Office and Community Corrections ED to begin talks of utilizing Vivitrol - and other new ways to tackle the emerging drug crisis. As seen below, I will be assembling all the local stakeholders to begin discussions regarding the use of medically assisted treatment in the criminal justice system when appropriate. On a positive note, all the below has been a result of the Governor's state-wide Task Force. I thought you would like to know that real change is in the air due to the work of the state wide Task Force. As you know, I have been working with Veronica regarding the agenda for our March meeting.

New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that opioids\u2014a class of drugs that include prescription pain medications and heroin\u2014were involved in 28,648 deaths in 2014. In particular, CDC found a continued sharp increase in heroin-involved deaths and an emerging increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. The President has made clear that addressing the opioid overdose epidemic is a priority for his Administration and has highlighted tools that are effective in reducing drug use and overdose, like evidence-based prevention programs, prescription drug monitoring, prescription drug take-back events, medication-assisted treatment and the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Under the Affordable Care Act, substance use disorder services are essential health benefits that are required to be covered by health plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace. The law also required that covered substance use disorder benefits are comparable to medical and surgical benefits. The President's FY 2017 Budget takes a two-pronged approach to address this epidemic. First, it includes $1 billion in new mandatory funding over two years to expand access to treatment for prescription drug abuse and heroin use. This funding will boost efforts to help individuals with an opioid use disorder seek treatment, successfully complete treatment, and sustain recovery. This funding includes: $920 million to support cooperative agreements with States to expand access to medication- assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. States will receive funds based on the severity of the epidemic and on the strength of their strategy to respond to it. States can use these funds to expand treatment capacity and make services more affordable. $50 million in National Health Service Corps funding to expand access to substance use treatment providers. This funding will help support approximately 700 providers able to provide substance use disorder treatment services, including medication-as sisted treatment, in areas across the country most in need of behavioral health providers. $30 million to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment programs employing medication- assisted treatment under real-world conditions and help identify opportunities to improve treatment for patients with opioid use disorders. This investment, combined with other efforts underway to reduce barriers to treatment for substance use disorders, will help ensure that every American who wants treatment can access it and get the help they need. Second, the President's Budget includes approximately $500 million -- an increase of more than $90 million -- to continue and build on current efforts across the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand state-level prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, increase the availability of medication-assisted treatment programs, improve access to the overdose- reversal drug naloxone, and support targeted enforcement activities. A portion of this funding is directed specifically to rural areas, where rates of overdose and opioid use are particularly high. To help further expand access to treatment, the Budget includes an HHS pilot project for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder treatment, where allowed by state law. Building on Actions to Address the Opioid Epidemic In October 2015, the President announced a number of new public and private sector actions to address this issue, including a Presidential Memorandum on prescriber training and opioid use disorder treatment. He also announced a commitment by more than 40 provider groups that more than 540,000 health care providers will complete training on appropriate opioid prescribing in the next two years. After just over three months, these groups reported that more than 66,000 providers have completed prescriber training to date, putting them on target to meet their goal. In December, the President signed a bipartisan budget agreement with more than $400 million in funding specifically to address the opioid epidemic, an increase of more than $100 million over the previous year. The agreement also revised a longstanding ban on using federal funds to support syringe service programs, which can help reduce the transmission of HIV and viral hepatitis by confronting one major source of the outbreaks: injection drug use, including opioids. These actions build on efforts that began in 2010 when the President released his first National Drug Control Strategy, which emphasized the need for action to address opioid use disorders and overdose while ensuring that individuals with pain receive safe, effective treatment. In 2011, the White House released its national Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan , which outlined goals for addressing prescription drug abuse and overdose. Since then, the Administration has supported and expanded efforts to prevent drug use, pursue \"smart on crime\" approaches to drug enforcement, improve prescribing practices for pain medication, increase access to treatment, work to reduce overdose deaths, and support the millions of Americans in recovery: Community Prevention and Overdose Response The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), in collaboration with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), supports local Drug-Free Communities coalitions to reduce youth substance use through evidence-based prevention. In recent years, hundreds of these coalitions have specifically focused on prescription drug misuse issues in their areas. With support from the Administration, prescriber education programs have been developed to teach medical professionals skills such as how to start a conversation with patients about their substance use; managing pain appropriately; and treating patients using opioids more safely. In response to a Presidential Memorandum, federal agencies are leading the way by making certain that their workforce is properly trained. In addition, ten states have passed legislation requiring training for prescribers. In FY 2016, HHS will implement the $10 million Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs to raise awareness about the dangers of misusing prescribed medications and to work with pharmacy and medical communities to address the risks of overprescribing to young adults. The FY 2017 Budget continues this effort. With support from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and other funders, 49 states have established Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs to help prescribers identify potential opioid misuse issues\u2014up from 30 states at the start of the Administration. The federal government is expanding access to prescription drug monitoring program data throughout federal agencies. The Department of Defense's (DoD) Pharmacy Data Transaction Service automatically screens all new medication orders against a patient's computerized medication history and permits DoD physicians to monitor for concerning drug usage patterns. The Indian Health Service has successfully piloted integrating this data into their electronic systems, and a pilot to integrate data into the workflow of physicians in the DoD health system is slated to launch in 2016. Through the National Take Back Days to remove unused prescription drugs from communities, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has collected more than 5.5 million pounds of medication. DEA also finalized a new rule making it easier for communities to establish ongoing drug take-back programs. ONDCP has worked with federal, state, and local government agencies and other stakeholders to expand access to the lifesaving opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone, including equipping first responders. Today, hundreds of law enforcement agencies across the country carry and are trained to administer naloxone. Additionally, prior to 2012, just six states had any laws that expanded access to naloxone or limited criminal liability for persons who took steps to assist an overdose victim. Today, 46 states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes that expand access to naloxone or provide \"Good Samaritan\" protections for possession of a control led substance if emergency assistance is sought for a victim of an opioid overdose. The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) supports the Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone distribution program to help Veterans at risk of an opioid overdose. This program is a key objective of VA's safety initiatives. In the less than two years since the program was implemented, over 12,000 Veterans have received a naloxone kit, and there have been 141 reported reversals as of December 2015. In September 2015, CDC launched a $20 million Prescription Drug Overdose: Prevention for States initiative in 16 states to expand their capacity to put prevention into action in communities nationwide and encourage education of providers and patients about the risk of prescription drug overdose. In 2016, the initiative received a further increase of $50 million dollars to expand these state prevention activities to a national scale. The DOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance released a Law Enforcement Naloxone Toolkit to support law enforcement agencies in establishing naloxone programs. The toolkit has been downloaded more than 2,200 times in the last year. DOD is ensuring that opioid overdose reversal kits and training are available to every first responder on military bases or other areas under its control. In 2016, SAMHSA will provide a total of $12 million specifically to increase use of the overdose reversal drug naloxone. States can use these funds to purchase naloxone, equip first responders with naloxone, and provide training on other overdose death prevention strategies. The FY 2017 Budget will continue these investments and includes an additional $10 million to address opioid overdose in rural areas, including through expanding access to naloxone. In November 2015, the President signed bipartisan legislation, the Protecting Our Infants Act , to help identify evidence- based approaches to care for mothers and their newborns affected by the opioid epidemic. In December 2015, the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs announced a new partnership to reduce opioid-related overdoses among American Indians and Alaska Natives. In 2016, the more than 90 IHS pharmacies will dispense naloxone to as many as 500 BIA Office of Justice Services officers and will train these first responders to administer emergency treatment to people experiencing an opioid overdose. Using the most recent scientific evidence, the CDC has been working with clinical experts and other stakeholders to develop guidelines on prescribing opioids for chronic pain. The guidelines will be used to help improve the way opioids are prescribed and help providers offer safer, more effective chronic pain treatment, while reducing opioid misuse, abuse and overdose. Using its fast-track and priority review systems, FDA recently approved for the first time a nasal spray version of naloxone hydrochloride, providing an easy to administer way to deliver this lifesaving drug. The National Institute on Drug Abuse helped develop this product through a partnership to apply new technology towards developing interventions for opioid overdose. Treatment In FY 2016, SAMHSA will support grants to 22 States to support medication- assisted treatment for opioid use disorders in high need communities. The FY 2017 Budget will expand the number of States that will receive funding to 45. In 2016, the Health Resources and Services Administration will award up to $100 million to Health Centers across the country to improve and expand the delivery of substance use disorder services, with a focus on medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. HHS Secretary Burwell announced that the Department will engage in rulemaking related to the prescribing of buprenorphine-containing products approved by the FDA for treatment of opioid dependence to expand access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. HHS will take a strategic approach in order to minimize diversion and ensure evidence-based treatment. In conjunction with the Budget rollout, HHS also will release Medicaid guidance to States on best practices for addressing the opioid epidemic focused on Medicaid pharmacy benefit management strategies to manage and monitor prescription opioid prescribing, cover medication-assisted treatment, and increase the use of the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Enforcement and Supply Reduction The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program is funding an unprecedented network of public health and law enforcement partnerships to address the heroin threat across 15 states. DEA has deployed a 360 Strategy targeting the opioid epidemic through coordinated law enforcement operations, diversion control and partnerships with community organizations following enforcement operations. DOJ's enforcement efforts include targeting the illegal opioid supply chain, thwarting doctor- shopping attempts, and disrupting so-called \"pill mills.\" DOJ has cracked down on those who use the Internet to illegally buy and sell controlled substances. DEA agents and investigators are integrating with other federal, state, and local law enforcement officers in 66 Tactical Diversion Squads stationed across 41 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Outcomes of this effort include the largest pharmaceutical- related takedown in the DEA's history in an operation that resulted in 280 arrests. Since 2007, through the Merida Initiative, the Department of State has been working with the Government of Mexico to help build the capacity of Mexico's law enforcement and justice sector institutions to disrupt drug trafficking organizations and to stop the flow of illicit drugs including heroin from Mexico to the United States.

In the less than two years since the program was implemented, over 12,000 Veterans have received a naloxone kit, and there have been 141 reported reversals as of December 2015. In September 2015, CDC launched a $20 million Prescription Drug Overdose: Prevention for States initiative in 16 states to expand their capacity to put prevention into action in communities nationwide and encourage education of providers and patients about the risk of prescription drug overdose. In 2016, the initiative received a further increase of $50 million dollars to expand these state prevention activities to a national scale. The DOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance released a Law Enforcement Naloxone Toolkit to support law enforcement agencies in establishing naloxone programs. The toolkit has been downloaded more than 2,200 times in the last year. DOD is ensuring that opioid overdose reversal kits and training are available to every first responder on military bases or other areas under its control. In 2016, SAMHSA will provide a total of $12 million specifically to increase use of the overdose reversal drug naloxone. States can use these funds to purchase naloxone, equip first responders with naloxone, and provide training on other overdose death prevention strategies. The FY 2017 Budget will continue these investments and includes an additional $10 million to address opioid overdose in rural areas, including through expanding access to naloxone. In November 2015, the President signed bipartisan legislation, the Protecting Our Infants Act , to help identify evidence- based approaches to care for mothers and their newborns affected by the opioid epidemic. In December 2015, the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs announced a new partnership to reduce opioid-related overdoses among American Indians and Alaska Natives. In 2016, the more than 90 IHS pharmacies will dispense naloxone to as many as 500 BIA Office of Justice Services officers and will train these first responders to administer emergency treatment to people experiencing an opioid overdose. Using the most recent scientific evidence, the CDC has been working with clinical experts and other stakeholders to develop guidelines on prescribing opioids for chronic pain. The guidelines will be used to help improve the way opioids are prescribed and help providers offer safer, more effective chronic pain treatment, while reducing opioid misuse, abuse and overdose. Using its fast-track and priority review systems, FDA recently approved for the first time a nasal spray version of naloxone hydrochloride, providing an easy to administer way to deliver this lifesaving drug. The National Institute on Drug Abuse helped develop this product through a partnership to apply new technology towards developing interventions for opioid overdose. Treatment In FY 2016, SAMHSA will support grants to 22 States to support medication- assisted treatment for opioid use disorders in high need communities. The FY 2017 Budget will expand the number of States that will receive funding to 45. In 2016, the Health Resources and Services Administration will award up to $100 million to Health Centers across the country to improve and expand the delivery of substance use disorder services, with a focus on medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. HHS Secretary Burwell announced that the Department will engage in rulemaking related to the prescribing of buprenorphine-containing products approved by the FDA for treatment of opioid dependence to expand access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. HHS will take a strategic approach in order to minimize diversion and ensure evidence-based treatment. In conjunction with the Budget rollout, HHS also will release Medicaid guidance to States on best practices for addressing the opioid epidemic focused on Medicaid pharmacy benefit management strategies to manage and monitor prescription opioid prescribing, cover medication-assisted treatment, and increase the use of the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Enforcement and Supply Reduction The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program is funding an unprecedented network of public health and law enforcement partnerships to address the heroin threat across 15 states. DEA has deployed a 360 Strategy targeting the opioid epidemic through coordinated law enforcement operations, diversion control and partnerships with community organizations following enforcement operations. DOJ's enforcement efforts include targeting the illegal opioid supply chain, thwarting doctor- shopping attempts, and disrupting so-called \"pill mills.\" DOJ has cracked down on those who use the Internet to illegally buy and sell controlled substances. DEA agents and investigators are integrating with other federal, state, and local law enforcement officers in 66 Tactical Diversion Squads stationed across 41 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Outcomes of this effort include the largest pharmaceutical- related takedown in the DEA's history in an operation that resulted in 280 arrests. Since 2007, through the Merida Initiative, the Department of State has been working with the Government of Mexico to help build the capacity of Mexico's law enforcement and justice sector institutions to disrupt drug trafficking organizations and to stop the flow of illicit drugs including heroin from Mexico to the United States.

More Americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do in moto r vehicle crashes. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that opioids \u2014a class of drugs that include prescrip tion pain medications and heroin \u2014were involved in 28,648 deaths in 2014 . In particular, CDC found a continued sharp increase in heroin -involved deaths and an emerging increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. The President has mad e clear that addressing the opioid overdose epidemic is a priority for his Administration and has highlighted tools that are effective in reducing drug use and overdose, like evidence -based prevention programs, prescription drug monitoring, prescription dr ug take - back events, medication -assisted treatment and the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Under the Affordable Care Act, substance use disorder services are essential health benefits that are required to be covered by health plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace. The law also required that covered substance use disorder benefits are comparable t o medical and surgical benefits. The President's FY 2017 Budget takes a two -pronged approach to address this epidemic. First, it includes $1 billion in new mandatory funding over two years to expand access to treatment for prescription drug abuse and her oin use . This funding will boost efforts to help individuals with an opioid use disorder seek treatment, successfully complete treatment, and sustain recovery. This funding includes: $920 million to support cooperative agreements with States to expand a ccess to medication -assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. States will receive funds based on the severity of the epidemic and on the strength of their strategy to respond to it. States can use these funds to expand treatment capacity and make services more affordable. $50 million in National Health Service Cor ps funding to expand access to substance use treatment providers. This funding will help support approximately 700 providers able to provide substance use disorder treatment services , including medication -assisted treatment, in areas across the country most in need of behavioral health providers. $30 million to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment programs employing medication - assisted treatment under real -world conditions and help identify opportunities to improve treatment for patients with opioid use disorders . This investment, combined with other efforts underway to reduce barriers to treatment for substance use disorders, will help ensure that every American who wants treatment can access it and get the help they need. EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00PM EST, Tuesday, February 2 , 2016 Second, the Presiden t's Budget includes approximately $500 million -- an increase of more than $90 million -- to continue and build on current efforts across the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand state -level prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, increase the availability of medication -assisted treatment programs, improve access to the overdose -reversal drug naloxone , and support targeted enforcement activities . A portion of this funding is directed specifically to rural area s, where rates of overdose and opi oid use are particularly high. To help further expand access to treatment , the Budget includes an HHS pilot project for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder treat ment, where allowed by state law. Building on Actions to Address the Opioid Epidemic In October 2015, the President announced a number of new public and private sect or actions to address this issue , including a Presidential Memorandum on prescriber training an d opioid use disorder treatment . He also announced a commitment by more than 40 provider groups that more than 540,000 health care providers will complete training on appropriate opioid prescrib ing in the next two years. After just over three months, these groups reported that more than 66,000 providers h ave completed prescriber training to date , putting them on target to meet their goal . In December, the President signed a bipartisan budget agreement with more than $400 million in funding specifically to address the opioid epidemic, an increase of more than $100 million over the previous year. The agreement also revised a longstanding ban on using federal funds to support syringe service pr ograms, which can help reduce the transmission of HIV and viral hepatitis by confronting one major source of the outbreaks: injection drug use, including opioids. These actions build on efforts that began in 2010 when the President released his first National Drug Control Strategy, which emphasized the need for action to address opi oid use disorders and overdose while ensuring that individuals with pain receive safe, effective t reatment. In 2011 , the White House released its national Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan , which outline d goals for addressing prescription d rug abu se and overdose . Since then, the Administration has supported and expanded efforts to prevent drug use, pursue \"smart on crime \" approaches to drug enforcement, improve prescribing practices for pain medication, increase access to treatment, work to reduce overdose deaths, and support the millions of Americans in recovery : Community Prevention and Overdose Response The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) , in collaboration with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), supports local Drug -Free Communities coalitions to reduce youth substance use through evidence -based prevention. In recent years, hundreds of these coalitions have specifically focused on prescription drug misuse issues in their a reas. With support from the Administration, prescriber education programs have been developed to teach medical professionals skills such as how to start a conversation with patients about their substance use; managing pain appropriately; and treating patie nts EMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00PM EST, Tuesday, February 2 , 2016 using opioids more safely. In response to a Presidential Memorandum, federal agencies are leading the way by making certain that their workforce is properly trained. In addition, ten states have passed legislation requiring training for prescribers. In FY 2016, HHS will implement the $10 million Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs to raise awareness about the dangers of misusing prescribed medications and to work with pharmac y and medical communities to address the risks of overprescribing to young adults. The FY 2017 Budget continues this effort. With support from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and other funders, 49 states have established Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs to help prescribers identify potential opioid mis use issues \u2014up from 30 states at the start of the Administration . The federal government is expanding access to prescription drug monitoring program data throughout federal agencies. The Department of Defense's ( DoD ) Pharmacy Data Transaction Service automa tically screens all new medication orders against a patient's computerized medication history and permits DoD physicians to monitor for concerning drug usage patterns. The Indian Health Service has successfully piloted integrating this data into their elec tronic systems, and a pilot to integrate data into the workflow of physicians in the DoD health system is slated to launch in 2016. Through the National Take Back Days to remove unused prescription drugs from communities , the Drug Enforcement Administratio n (DEA) has collected more than 5.5 million pounds of medication. DEA also finalized a new rule making it easier for communities to establish ongoing drug take -back programs. ONDCP has worked with federal, state, and local government agencies and other stakeholders to expand access to the lifesaving opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone, including equipping first responders. Today, hundreds of law enforcement agencies across the country carry and are trained to administer naloxone. Additionally, prior to 2012, just six states had any laws that expanded access to naloxone or limited criminal liability for persons who took steps to assist an overdose victim. Today, 46 states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes that expand access to naloxone or provide \"Good Samaritan\" protections for possession of a controlled substance if emergency assistance is sought for a victim of an opioid overdose.

Lyons (508) 563-4449 Sheriff's Office continues to lead the way with opiate-blocker Vivitrol BOURNE, Massachusetts - The Barnstable County Sheriff's Office watches year-end 2015 approach in the same position it occupied in January, as the nation's leader in the pioneering use of the opiate- and alcohol-blocker drug Vivitrol. Since April of 2012, when the first departing inmate received the inaugural shot, 178 have received an injection upon leaving the sheriff's correctional facility in Bourne. That's more than their counterparts at any other prison or detention center in the world. The most recent compilation of figures found that that 82% had not been re-incarcerated at BCCF, the Barnstable County Correctional Facility. This as compared to national statistics that show only about 15% of opioid addicts do not relapse. Other findings for what is at once the homegrown and the world's largest sample of Vivitrol inmates: 70% at BCCF reported a drop in cravings, which is the drug's goal. (Unlike other blocker drugs, Vivitrol cannot induce a high. So it has neither a street value nor an unwanted place on law enforcement's list of controlled substances.) Four of five BCCF inmates showed up for their first post-release injection. The average length of time in post-release treatment is five months. When surveyed, between 40 and 45 percent of those released in the program's first three years were found to have remained sober. The average age for Vivitrol inmates is thirty-one and 27% are female. (Women generally represent about 15% of the BCCF population.) The sheriff's office standing as \"expert in chief,\" meanwhile, continues apace. In the 44 months since program kickoff, dozens of jails, community clinics, court systems, and treatment organizations have tapped the sheriff's office as a resource. In many cases, the combination of a copious written packet and follow-up consultation has led to some variation of the program Sheriff James Cummings runs in Barnstable County being adopted elsewhere.

From there, the Sheriff's advisory reach extends into states large and small, among them Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Sheriff Cummings even provided extensive information to a worldwide conference on the subject in London, and his office was mentioned favorably in a White House report issued in 2014 by its Office of National Drug Control Strategy. The Sheriff has also appeared before interested constituency groups, among them the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, the National Foundation for Women Legislators, the National Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Council, and the Florida sheriffs' Smart Justice Summit.

(Women generally represent about 15% of the BCCF population.) The sheriff's office standing as \"expert in chief,\" meanwhile, continues apace. In the 44 months since program kickoff, dozens of jails, community clinics, court systems, and treatment organizations have tapped the sheriff's office as a resource. In many cases, the combination of a copious written packet and follow-up consultation has led to some variation of the program Sheriff James Cummings runs in Barnstable County being adopted elsewhere. The list of groups mentored starts at home with fellow sheriffs in Massachusetts, along with the state Corrections Department. From there, the Sheriff's advisory reach extends into states large and small, among them Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Sheriff Cummings even provided extensive information to a worldwide conference on the subject in London, and his office was mentioned favorably in a White House report issued in 2014 by its Office of National Drug Control Strategy. The Sheriff has also appeared before interested constituency groups, among them the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, the National Foundation for Women Legislators, the National Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Council, and the Florida sheriffs' Smart Justice Summit. Finally, the word has gone forth in news stories, columns, and editorials. In additional to his local Cape Cod media, the sheriff has reached statewide and national markets via National Sheriff's magazine, Reuters and Associated Press wire stories, the Huffington Post, The Boston Globe, and The Boston Business Journal. Broadcast coverage has included WBUR radio in Boston, New England Cable News, and Channels 5 (Boston) and Fox 25 (Dedham). Another major national piece is being prepared now by the media arm of the PEW Research Center, a respected national think tank. The Sheriff's Office will feature prominently in that as well. Concluded Sheriff Cummings: \"The results continue to look promising, more so than I had anticipated going in. We'll keep our fingers crossed and keep spreading the word. Meanwhile, our battle against opiate addiction must continue, on this and other fronts as well.\" Right-click here to download pictures.

Scott.A.Milkey From: Govother <govother-bounces@lists.in.gov> on behalf of Clift, Mckenzie C Friday, January 29, 2016 3:18 PM Subject: What they're saying after year one of HIP 2.0 Attachments: ATT00001.txt FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 29, 2016 Contact: Kara Brooks kbrooks@gov.in.gov What they're saying after year one of HIP 2.0 Indianapolis - One year after the landmark approval of the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) 2.0 waiver, HIP members and representatives from the health care community are lauding its success. *** Tunde Sotunde, M.D., MBA President, North Region, Medicaid Government Business Division Anthem, Inc. \"Without a doubt, there is no other program - again, no other program - like the HIP 2.0 program. One that is designed to drive member responsibility by providing individuals a stake in their health care purchasing decisions. \" \"There is no doubt in my mind that the HIP 2.0 program has been game-changing and innovative in how we think about and how we approach the delivery of meaningful healthcare coverage to individuals that need it the most and, in just one year, has delivered very compelling results that have made a positive difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers across the state and has driven outcomes that, frankly speaking, have even exceeded my own expectations.\" \"On the heels of the original HIP 1.0 program, we always had the confidence and the belief that with the payment innovations, the capabilities and the enhancements that were built into the current program, that our members would not only get more engaged with their health care decision making and health care choices, but would also be satisfied with the results and the outcomes of those choices.\" \"Someday in the future when our children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren are reading the history books on the evolution of the healthcare delivery system here in the United States, prominent mention will be made of Governor Pence and the Administration with regards to starting the revolution in how we think about and how we approach the delivery of meaningful coverage to those individuals that need it the most in order to drive the outcomes that we all desire.\" \"Clearly, individuals are getting more engaged in their health care decision making, they're more satisfied in the outcomes of those decisions, and they're taking responsibility in the choices they make.\" --- Jay Height, Executive Director of Shepherd Community Center \"It's empowering to those in poverty to be able to say, 'I can choose what's best for me, and for my family, for my kids, and for my spouse.'\" --- Doug Leonard, President of the Indiana Hospital Association \"It's been a wonderful year for the health of our state. Since HIP 2.0 was implemented, Indiana hospitals have seen a significant reduction in the amount of uncompensated care - while Indiana patients gained an affordable option for health coverage. \"HIP 2.0 has led to tremendous gains in patients seeking preventive care at the right time, in the right place. We firmly believe our state has turned a corner, and that HIP 2.0 will lead to lasting improvements in the health of Hoosiers for generations to come. \"Since HIP 2.0 was approved, Indiana hospitals have worked tirelessly to educate patients about the new program. We thank our member hospitals for their efforts, and thank Governor Pence for his leadership on this critical issue. On behalf of IHA and our 164 member hospitals across the state, we commend his administration for their many months of hard work to implement the program.\" --- Don Kelso, Executive Director of the Indiana Rural Health Association \"How successful is HIP 2.0? More than 355,000 Hoosiers and their families have enrolled. That's a lot of people - nearly a third of all people living in rural areas or small towns in Indiana. With 355,000 people enrolled, that means hundred s of thousands of Hoosiers now have access to regular and timely care. That means better quality outcomes across the board. That means a healthier Indiana.\" --- Diana Sullivan, President of the Indiana State Nurses Association \"January 27, 2016 marks the one-year anniversary of a momentous day in Indiana healthcare, the day Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 (HIP 2.0) was approved.\" \"The Governor's office and the Family & Social Services Administration should be commended for working with stakeholders throughout the implementation process to best meet the healthcare needs of Hoosiers.\" --- Bradley Braydon, HIP 2.0 member \"It's a game changer. It's a life changing possibility...to upgrade a little bit more every month to get the care that we need. I just never heard of anything like that. I can't believe it's available.\" --- Pat Knight, HIP 2.0 member \"I have not had glasses in 12 years. I do now because of the little premium I'm allowed to pay...To be able to see is so important. Without it, you can't read, you can't write, you can't do art, you can't even wash your dishes right.\" --- Chris Cunningham, HIP 2.0 member \"When you do something that benefits you and makes you feel better, you do want to share it. You want people to know that this is available, and nobody has to go without being able to go to their doctor when they feel that something's not right.\" --- Jennifer Stanley, St. Vincent Medical Group (SVMG) Regional Medical Director \"Taking care of my HIP 2.0 patients is so enjoyable. They're engaged. When they come in to see me, they're interested in what I have to say. They take it seriously and they want to be a part of their health care. They're interested in being healthy. As a family doctor, that's what I want for my entire community.\" --- Jonathan S. Nalli, Chief Executive Officer, St. Vincent, Indiana Senior Vice President, Ascension Health/Indiana Ministry Market Executive \"In 1881, when four Daughters of Charity arrived in Indianapolis to begin healthcare - which is now known as St. Vincent, a statewide healthcare network - they made a comment that resonates so deeply with me. We're here to keep health care human. Human for the provider. Human for the patient. Human for the caregiver. The rich will come and the poor will come if they see that we treat people as humans. I can't help but continue to go back to what our Governor has done with HIP 2.0, because we now have greater tools and you've heard stories today about how healthcare is more human now because of HIP 2.0.\" --- Carl Ellison, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Indiana Minority Health Coalition \"One of the great things about HIP 2.0 is that if we can actually say and demonstrate that minorities benefitted from this, I mean that's a very, very good thing for this state and nation. Because in minority health, you need models to illustrate what can be done.\" --- Phil Morphew, CEO of Indiana Primary Health Care Association \"HIP 2.0 is hardly a tough sell. People see right away that it's an insurance program that i s designed for them and they're eager to enroll. They don't mind the skin-in-the-game aspect of the program. We don't get complaints about that. People are able to pay those small amounts.\" --- Bob Siegmann, Senior Vice President for Healthcare Integration and Collaboration of Centerstone \"Frankly, the way the Governor set up HIP with a lot of preventive aspects to it, really encourages people, not just to have skin in the game by paying some money to be in, but also encourages them to look at a new way of dealing with their health care...\" --- Stephen C. McCaffrey, JD, President and CEO of Mental Health America of Indiana \"As we approach the one-year anniversary of HIP 2.0, we can be proud that now 355,000 Hoosiers now have health insurance coverage who might not otherwise. Some might be surprised that 70 of the participants are making contributions to their HSA-like account and are enrolled in the HIP Plus plan. Maybe most impressive is that almost 94% of enrollees who begin making contributions, continue doing so. However, the impact in the area of mental health and addiction is even more impressive, as many of these individuals have never had access to behavioral health services before HIP 2.0.\" \"HIP 2.0 takes groundbreaking steps toward improving access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment services. Significantly, HIP 2.0 includes coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services at \"parity\" with other physical health disorders. In the area of mental health and substance use, the tremendous advances that we have seen in treatment have been predicated on new medications that literally give people back their lives. HIP 2.0 ensures that appropriate mental health medications are accessible and that participants have access to medication assisted treatment for addiction\u2014evidenced based treatment that is critical to treating the opioid epidemic in Indiana.\" \"Further, HIP has become the foundation on what is developing into a system of care in the area of mental health and addiction replacing the puzzle pieces of siloed services based on disjointed funding streams. The Governor's announcement regarding the new Neuro-diagnostic Psychiatric Hospital is one example. This new evidence-based practice will create opportunities for cutting edge psychiatric diagnosis and short-term stabilization and treatment for individuals that will then move to community-based services now covered by HIP 2.0.\" ### Tiffany Peek Subject: RE: Hoosier Idol info Thanks Steve.

There were the 323 children involved in the toxic and explosive meth environments. There were the seven la w enforcement officials injured ( Howey Politics Indiana ). There was testimony that every member of a southwestern Indiana methamphetamine task force had ended up in an emergency room as the result of toxic meth lab environments. And there were three bills up for a hearing in the Indiana House Public Health Committee Monday morning. But after about an hour of testimony, Chairwoman Cindy Kirchhofer had pressing matters to deal with as she limited testimony on the three bills to less than a minute as the commi ttee hearing neared an end in the House Chambers. There was lunch to be had for hungry members. And there was the House itself scheduled to be gaveled in at 1 p.m. The committee hearing had commenced at 9 a.m., with several bills up for consideration where testimony was lengthy. The three meth bills - HB1390, HB1157 and HB1166 - came at the end, and there just wasn't time. So an array of law enforcement officials, prosecutors, pharmacists and those from the pharmaceutical industry were limited to less than a minute of testimony by the Chair. Welcome to the legislative response to Indiana's meth binge, where a good crisis shouldn't delay a panini or a tuna salad. Prosecutors like Mike Steiner of Martin County and Jeff Arnold of Delaware County tried to lend s ome perspective. Of the 1,5033 known labs busted in 2015, Steiner observed that without the smelly andryhous ammonia no longer part of the process, \"We have to get stupid lucky to find our labs. I would guess there are 20,000 to 30,000 labs across the stat e. Just a guess.\" Once a PSE -powered lab is up and running, carnage follows. Daniel Miller of the Indiana Council of Prosecuting Attorneys, had worked on meth task forces in Warrick and Vanderburg counties for two decades and said that every member of thos e task forces had ended up in the emergency room at one time or another, some with lung injuries. \"Each lab site comes with cost,\" Miller said, whether it is the $10,000 to clean toxic chemicals, or the children removed and placed into foster care, or the explosions that burn neighboring property. \"Pseudoephedrine powers our meth production in this state,\" Miller said. \"It actually is currency. We can no longer tolerate the unfettered trade. We are in support of HB1390.\" The Indiana Association of Cities an d Towns, Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council, the Indiana Pharmacists Alliance and several law enforcement groups favored Smaltz's bill in lieu of a full prescription requirement ( Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). METH BILLS BY SMALTZ, FRIZZELL & McNAMARA M AY PRODUCE HYBRID: HB1390 is the work of State Rep. Ben Smaltz, who had entered the session seeking a rescheduling of PSE. He is also aware of political realities and the reach of consumer product interests and the Indiana Retail Council, who ardently oppos e rescheduling (Howey Politics Indiana ). \"What I am trying to do is stop the labs,\" the Auburn Republican said of his district which has endured more than 700 clandestine operations. He revealed a large placard showing how much PSE can be legally purchased, which was \"50 boxes plus one in my pocket. You can buy an obscene amount in Indiana.\" The retail price is $840, he said, but that much PSE \"will make $5,000 of meth. Each of the boxes you see, a smurf will get $50.\" They can make $2,000 a year. Smaltz's b ill would allow \"patients of record,\" or those consumers known to local pharmacists, to purchase PSE products such as Sudafed. An unknown consumer would only be allowed to buy tamper resistant products at a 24 -count, or 30 mg. Smaltz said that if these cus tomers insist on full purchase, \"That's probably a meth cook. That's probably a smurf. In that case, you have to get a prescription.\" The other bills by State Rep. Davd Frizzell and Wendy McNamara don't go as far, seeking to make the pharmacist the gatekee per, as is being done in the six pharmacies in Fulton County. McNamara, R -Mount Vernon, explained, \"It's time to confront this crisis from the front end. Law enforcement has been trying to deal with this from the back end. My suggestion, my motherly advice , is we can't fight this from the back end. I'm not going to say it will solve this problem because it won't. This will cut into this cycle. It won't end the problem until everyone steps up and decides to fight this together. This will only put a dent in i t.\" Frizzell, R -Indianapolis, predicted that a \"hybrid\" of the three bills is possible by the time a vote is taken on the three bills on Wednesday. 'WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE?' ASKS METH SUPRRESSION TROOPER: The Indiana State Police won't take a stance on pen ding methamphetamine legislation, but individual officers have seen the problem first -hand (DeNoon, Indiana Public Media ). \"The argument is, well, pseudoephedrine is a very effective nasal decongestant - and I agree it is,\" says Sgt. Mike Toles, Acting Com mander of the Meth Suppression Unit. \"But there's also over 100 other - actually probably over 130 other medications out there that you can get by going to your pharmacy that don't require a prescription that you can get to address that.\" Toles is a vetera n in the meth suppression unit, and he's frustrated that despite law enforcement's best efforts, they haven't made more headway on a problem that too often involves innocent victims \u2014 kids. For him, it's a family health problem. It's a public health probl em. \"We're going to be over 300 children this year identified at labs. I hate to use this comparison - but sometimes it makes people think. If a dog were locked inside of a home where they were manufacturing meth and the dog became ill or died because of it - people would be writing editorials - they would be outraged. Where's the outrage?\" GREGG CALLS FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY: Indiana Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Gregg made a call for greater transparency on the first anniversary of Gov. Mike Pence's JustIN controversy ( Howey Politics Indiana ). \"While this governor would have created a taxpayer funded propaganda machine to control what information reporters and the public have access to, I want to throw open the doors of state government,\" Gre gg said. \"Times have changed. With advances in technology and following the lead of other states and communities, similar to what Mayor Pete Buttigeig did in South Bend, we can make our state government one of the most open and transparent in the nation,\" added Gregg. \"Hoosiers expect and deserve no less.\" Gregg would create a Public Transparency Commission, strengthen powers of the public access counselor, and mandate a 10 -day turnaround on public information requests. BSU PRESIDENT FERGUSON'S MYSTERIOUS RESIGNATION: Ball State University's board of trustees accepted the mysterious resignation of President Paul Ferguson during a meeting at the university's Indianapolis Center on Monday morning (Slabaugh , Muncie Star Press ). The board last week sent The St ar Press a notice of the special meeting that contained nothing on the agenda, as well as a notice of an executive session immediately before the special meeting. The special meeting was open, but no one from the press or the public attended. Myra Borshoff , an external public relations consultant, referred questions about Ferguson's sudden and unexpected departure to Indianapolis attorney Rick Hall, chairman of the university's trustees, who wasn't available for comment Monday afternoon. Today's news was se nt to the media from Borshoff's company, an independent firm. \"There is something going on for his resignation to be so sudden, and the trustees ought to tell us what it is,\" said BSU professor Eric Kelly, a former chair of University Senate. \"This is weir d. I'm stunned that it's happening mid -semester. I would not have been surprised if they had announced he would be leaving effective July 1. Coming in after a strong president like Jo Ann Gora ... is very tough. I kind of expected he would wind up with a two -year job for a whole bunch of reasons.\"Ferguson had been signed, effective Aug. 1, 2014, to a five -year contract at Ball State. He came to BSU from the presidency of the University of Maine and was Ball State's 15th president. QUINNIPIAC IOWA POLL SAYS GOP RACE TOO CLOSE TO CALL: Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are running neck -and-neck in Iowa with only six days to go until the caucuses there, a new poll finds (The Hill). A Quinnipiac University survey released on Tuesday shows Trump taking 31 percent support over Cruz at 29 percent. That's unchanged from the previous survey released in early January. Trump and Cruz have been in all -out war against one another as they sprint to the finish and seek to influence the dwindling number of voters who have not yet se ttled on a candidate. The Quinnipiac University poll found that 39 percent of likely Republican caucus -goers say they could still change their minds before Election Day on Feb. 1. Fifty -nine percent say they've completely made up their minds. \"The Iowa Rep ublican Caucus remains too close to call,\" said Quinnipiac University polling director Peter A. Brown. \"One week before the caucuses gather, the question is which candidate has the best field organization. If the events of the last two weeks haven't moved the needle, one wonders what would change it in the next six days.\" FOX HAS CLINTON UP BY 6% IN IOWA: Bernie Sanders now sits within striking distance of front -runner Hillary Clinton in Iowa, according to the latest Fox News Poll. At the same time, Clint on is still ahead among likely Democratic caucus -goers, and leads among those who \"definitely\" plan to attend -- as well as those who have participated in past caucuses. Clinton's up by six percentage points (48 -42 percent) in the new poll, released Monday . In early December, she led Sanders by 14 (50 -36 percent). VISIT INDY CITES $60M IN RFRA LOSSES: Tourism officials say Indiana may have lost as much as $60 million in revenue after a dozen conventions picked cities other than Indianapolis amid the uproar over the state's controversial religious objections law. A document prepared by tourism group Visi t Indy shows that the 12 out -of-state groups were surveyed and all said the controversial law played a role in their decisions to locate their events elsewhere. The document was obtained by the Associated Press ahead of its formal release Thursday. The Rep ublican -backed law garnered quick national backlash after it was signed by Gov. Mike Pence in March, with critics saying it sanctioned discrimination against gay people on religious grounds. \"We'd say, 'Why didn't you select Indy?' and they proactively cit ed (the law) as a reason they did not select Indianapolis,\" Gahl said when asked about the document. \"That is not news you want to hear when you are in the business of marketing a city.\" In an emailed statement Monday, Pence spokeswoman Kara Brooks said In diana was a \"welcoming\" state with a strong economy. She noted multiple organizations that have expanded their role or recommitted to hosting conventions and events in the state, including the NFL scouting combine and the Future Farmers of America. VANDE RBURGH SUPT. SAYS SCHOOLS NOT HELD 'HARMLESS': There is no \"holding harmless\" when the reputations of schools are damaged by the release of flawed data (Erbacher, Evansville Courier & Press ). Evansville Vanderburgh School Corp. Superintendent David Smith s hared that sentiment during Monday's EVSC School Board meeting, in anticipation of the state board of education's expected vote to approve A -F school accountability grades on Tuesday. Smith told school board members at their first meeting of 2016 that he l ooks forward to the day when he doesn't have to discuss the statewide ISTEP assessment. He reminded board members that ISTEP scores were released three different times, and that the EVSC still has more than 500 undetermined scores, multiple students with d ifferent scores for the same test, and some missing tests. \"To say that it's been botched is, I think, being generous,\" Smith said. He said that while he appreciates the efforts of state leaders to shield teachers from potential negative impacts, the \"flaw ed\" ISTEP assessment is the primary metric in school accountability grades and, if released, will continue to live on. \"There is nearly universal consensus that the results of last year's ISTEP test are not an accurate depiction of the work of the teachers ,\" Smith said. \"Nor is it an accurate depiction of the cognitive abilities of our students.\" HPI DAILY ANALYSIS: House Public Health Committee Chair Cindy Kirchhofer was embarrassing in the way she handled Monday's testimony on three meth bills. After sometimes meandering testimony on other bills over the previous two and a half hours, the three meth bills were shoehorned into about an hour of time, and at the end of the hearing, Kirchhofer was actually timing those testifying, some given only 20 or 30 seconds to weigh in. This was a completely tone deaf handling of a critical issue that has involved the security of more than a thousand children over the past year, injured more than 100 first responders, and cost local governments tens of millions of dolla rs. After listening to the testimony, I have to ask the same question posed by Indiana State Police Meth Suppression Unit superviser Mike Toles, which was where is the outrage from legislators? - Brian A. Howey Campaigns 'GOVERNING' CALLS INGOV 'TOSSUP': Governing Magazine has moved the Indiana gubernatorial race from \"Leans Republican\" to \"tossup.\" It wrote: By now, many had expected Pence to have rebounded from a botched attempt to pass a religious freedom law that spaw ned a pro -LGBT backlash among Democrats and the GOP -leaning business community. But a year later, Pence is still hobbled by that controversy, which remains unsettled due to pending legislation. Once seen as a rising GOP star with national ambitions, Pence can't seem to make anyone at either end of the spectrum -- and even those in the middle -- happy. Republican legislators, who have a supermajority, have shown little deference, and Pence's highly billed State of the State address, intended to turn a new pa ge, doesn't appear to have changed minds. Pence will have money to spend on his re -election, and he should benefit from an improving economy in the conservative state. Still, this contest, already competitive when we last looked, has moved toward the Democ rats, as former state House Speaker John Gregg, who lost narrowly to Pence in 2012, has coalesced Democratic support. Gregg isn't considered a great campaigner, but he raised $2 million during the last half of 2015. A possible Libertarian candidacy could h ave an impact too: Pence won in 2012 by a narrow plurality, not a majority. This contest could bounce back and forth before Election Day. For now, though, we're moving the race from lean Republican to tossup. POLL GAUGED RITZ REELECT NUMBERS : Buried in a recent poll regarding Hoosier attitudes toward school choice and vouchers are some revealing numbers regarding Superintendent of Public Instruction Glenda Ritz and the upcoming election (Abdul, IndyPolitics) . The Friedman Foundation for Educational Choic e recently polled more than 1,000 Hoosiers regarding choice and vouchers, but also asked about Ritz's performance. Ritz has frequently butted heads with Governor Mike Pence and Republican lawmakers over school choice, accountability and testing. The poll s howed 39.3% of respondents either strongly approved or somewhat approved of the job Ritz was doing. Slightly more than 24% either strongly or somewhat disapproved of her job performance. And 34.5% either had no opinion of Ritz or did not know who she was. When it came to whether Ritz should be re -elected for the job, slightly fewer than 23% said they would support her re -election, 20.6% said they would vote Republican, four percent said they would vote Libertarian and 50.5 % were undecided. WASHINGTON SEEKS SD3: A Gary community leader who was defeated in a 2012 primary challenge to state Sen. Earline Rogers, D -Gary, will try again this year now that the veteran Region lawmaker is retiring (Carden, NWI Times ). Darren Washington, president of the Calum et Township board and former president of the Gary school board, last week filed paperwork with the secretary of state to run for the Democratic nomination in Senate District 3. He said his goal, if elected, is to promote economic development, public safet y and equality in education in the district, which includes Gary, Lake Station, New Chicago, Hobart, Merrillville and Crown Point. \"We must also preserve and create new employment opportunities by supporting our unions through continuous construction proje cts and supporting existing small businesses with revenue generation possibilities,\" he said. WALORSKI FILES FOR REELECTION: Rep. Walorski (IN -2) visited the State House to officially file paperwork for re -election to Congress in Indiana's Second Distri ct. While at the State House, she also had the opportunity to address the House and Senate Chambers ( Howey Politics Indiana ). Rep. Walorski said, \"I'm honored and grateful to serve the hardworking Hoosiers of Indiana's Second District. The support I've rec eived from every corner of the district has been overwhelming. I remain committed to fighting for our veterans, service members, farmers, entrepreneurs and small business owners, and the families I'm fortunate to represent.\" Her campaign also announced they started 2016 with over $750,000 in the bank. STUTZMAN FILES: U.S. Marlin Stutzman filed paperwork with the Indiana Secretary of State's Office today making his bid for Indiana's open senate seat official ( Howey Politics Indiana ). As an outspoken and un apologetic conservative Stutzman enjoys the support of hundreds of volunteers and activists who gathered more signatures statewide than any other candidate in the race for senate, as of his filing Monday morning. \"Today, with the help of devoted volunteers from all over our great state, I am pleased to say we are one step closer to sending a conservative to challenge the status quo in Washington DC\", stated Stutzman. BANKS ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR 122ND: State Senator Jim Banks, Republican candidate for Indiana's CD3, released a position paper on the importance of Fort Wayne's 122nd Fighter Wing and how he will work to strengthen the unit in Congress. With more than 1,000 jobs and an economic impact of $58 million on the region, the Fort Wayne Air Guard base and the 122nd Fighter Wing are vital to the local economy (Howey Politics Indiana ). Proposals in Banks' paper include: Reversing devastating military cutbacks and working to fund a Reagan -era military b uild-up in the 21st Century. Identifying and targeting areas of wasteful military spending that distract from the mission and prevent resources from being deployed where they can best support our national defense. Seeking a seat on the House Armed Services Committee to closely monitor developments that may impact the 122nd, the Air Guard base and northeast Indiana's regional defense cluster. \"As a service member who was deployed overseas, I am acutely aware of the importance of the Fort Wayne Air Guard base and the 122nd Fighter Wing. If elected, my first priority for Baer Field and the people of northeast Indiana will be acquiring newer aircraft and increasing the number of joint units and missions assigned to Baer Field,\" said Banks. \"The 122nd truly is th e crown jewel of national defense assets in northeast Indiana and will be one of my priorities if elected to represent the Third District.\" REP. CHARLIE BROWN SEEKING REELECTION: State Rep. Charlie Brown (D -Gary) has filed for reelection to the House Dis trict 3 seat he currently holds in the Indiana State Legislature ( Howey Politics Indiana ). \"I have had the honor to serve the citizens of Indiana House District 3 for many years and I believe we have worked together well to bring to our region a renewed co mmitment to make the future something to embrace rather than fear,\" Brown said. \"Embracing the future rather than fearing it often involves hard work and perseverance, however. It's not something that 'just happens.' For many years, I believe I have exhibi ted these characteristics at the Indiana House of Representatives here at the Statehouse. The people of Indiana House District 3 deserve no less from their legislators.\" Brown noted that public health, education and social justice for all remain the hallma rks of his past and future legislative efforts. HAMILTON COUNTY GOP CHAIR FIGHT GETS WILD: A battle for control of the Hamilton Co. Republican Party was set in motion late last year when Pete Emigh informed party leadership of his plan to resign as the c ounty chairman (Welsh, Advance Indiana) . Nobody was more surprised than the party's vice chairman, Laura Campbell, who automatically succeeded Emigh as acting county chairman upon the tendering of his resignation to state and local party officials. Campbel l was even more surprised at Emigh's desire to hastily convene a party caucus to elect a new chairman to fill out the remainder of his term. Emigh desired to hold the caucus election on the first day of the legislative session. Campbell, who was interested in running for chairman, also learned from Emigh that the party's treasurer, Pete Peterson, desired to succeed him as chairman and that the two of them should talk. Things got more interesting days later when Campbell learned from a party source while att ending a political function that Emigh had recently appointed many PCs shortly before he resigned. Campbell sought a list of the PCs from Emigh and, much to her surprise, discovered he had appointed as many as 71 PCs on November 29, 2015, including his dau ghter, his mortgage broker who co -signed on his family home, Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness, vendors who do business with the City of Fishers, a number of Fishers city employees and other persons clearly disposed to casting votes in favor of Peterson. Accordi ng to Campbell, most of the newly -appointed PCs have had little or no past involvement with the Hamilton Co. Republican Party organization. As acting chairman, Campbell knew state party rules required her to convene a caucus to elect a new chairman within 30 days of Emigh's resignation. Campbell also knew that party rules allowed her to remove from their positions any PCs or vice PCs appointed by Emigh. As it turned out, Emigh had not notified either the state party or the Hamilton Co. GOP's secretary of th e 71 appointments he made on November 29. Under state party rules, appointed PCs serve at the pleasure of the county chairman. Campbell exercised her authority under state party rules and terminated the appointment of the 71 PCs appointed by Emigh. Peterso n's camp rushed to radio talk show host Abdul -Hakim Shabazz, who quickly broadcast the termination of the appointments as \"firings\" and reported that Mayor Fadness had filed a formal complaint with the state party, claiming Campbell lacked authority to ter minate the appointment of him and 70 other pro -Peterson persons as PCs. The Indiana State Republican Party is meeting in an emergency rules committee meeting today to rule on the matter. MONDAY FILINGS: Democrat: State Rep. Charlie Brown HD3. Republican: U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman U.S. Senate, U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski 2CD. Presidential 2016 EVANGELICALS FLOCKING TO TRUMP IN NBC POLL: Donald Trump's outreach to Christians is bearing fruit, if the results of the latest NBC News/Survey Monkey weekly online tracking poll out Tuesday are any indication ( Politico ). Among white evangelical Republican voters, Trump earned the support of 37 percent, while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father is a pastor and has played a key role in recruiting faith leaders to support his son, is at 20 percent. In the same survey conduct ed the previous week, Cruz registered nine points higher. Below the top two contenders, Ben Carson earned 11 percent among evangelicals, while Marco Rubio took 10 percent. TRUMP TOPS 40% IN CNN POLL: Donald Trump has hit a new high in the race for the Re publican nomination, according to a new CNN/ORC Poll , with more than 4 -in-10 Republican voters nationwide now saying they back the billionaire. And more than two - thirds of Republicans say he's the candidate most likely to capture their party's presidential nomination. Trump has topped the 40% mark for the first time in CNN/ORC polling, standing at 41%. That more than doubles the support of his nearest competitor, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who notches 19% support in the poll. No other candidate hit double -digits. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio landed at 8%, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 6%, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 5%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 4%, and the rest at 3% or less. CRUZ SAYS TRUMP COULD BE 'UNSTOPPABLE': Ted Cruz on Monday offered a remarkably candid assessment of the race for the Republican nomination: Donald Trump \"could be unstoppable\" if he wins the Iowa caucus ( CNN). Cruz, the Texas senator who is running neck -and-neck with Trump in Iowa polling, urged a gathering of evangelical past ors on Monday to coalesce around his candidacy in order to defeat the billionaire real estate mogul, according to video obtained by the Christian Broadcasting Network and The Brody File. CNN has not independently obtained the video. KIPLINGER EDITORS SEE CRUZ, HILLARY NOMINATIONS: The Kiplinger Letter editors said on Friday they believe Sen. Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton will win the major party nominations: Although Donald Trump continues to dominate the polls, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is p oised to overtake him as the GOP front -runner for the presidential nomination. Cruz stands to gain momentum by racking up strong showings in the Southern states that figure heavily in the early primaries. Members of the GOP establishment will try to rally around a more moderate candidate, such as Marco Rubio of Florida, but will struggle to defeat Cruz. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is well positioned to gain the nomination, despite an early surge by Vt. Sen. Bernie Sanders. TRUMP SEES GOP ESTAB LISHMENT FOES: Donald Trump insisted Monday that the Republican establishment is against him, but conceded that party leaders are warming to his candidacy as a better alternative to rival Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential bid ( CNN). In the first portion of a wi de-ranging interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer just a week before Iowans head to the caucuses, Trump touted his strong lead in the polls, once again raised the \"problems\" Cruz faces due to his Canadian birthplace and undisclosed campaign loans and explained why he joked about shooting somebody in the middle of New York's 5th Avenue. Trump also explained why establishment leaders are more prepared to back his presidential bid over that of Cruz, the Texas senator who has cast himself as a principled lawmaker bu t whom critics call inflexible. Trump, for his part, called Cruz a \"nasty person.\" \"I think the establishment actually is against me, but really coming on line because they see me as opposed to Cruz who is a nasty guy who can't get along with anybody,\" Tru mp said. \"At a certain point you've got to make deals.\" TRUMP SAYS HE WAS 'JOKING' ON SHOOTING REMARK: Trump also dismissed criticisms he took after saying at a rally Saturday that he could shoot somebody in the middle of a crowded street and not lose an y supporters ( CNN). \"I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,\" Trump said Saturday at an event in Sioux Center, Iowa. Trump told Blitzer that he \"was joking\" and noted that his audience of supporters laughed along with him as he made those remarks. \"Of course I'm joking,\" Trump said. \"And the purpose of that is to say the people love me. You know, they want to stay with me. They're loyal. They're tired of seeing our country being pushed around and led by peopl e that are stupid people. They're tired of that.\" AXELROD TAKING TRUMP SERIOUSLY: For David Axelrod, Donald Trump's rise among Republican voters could best be explained with the rise of another nearly a decade ago: Barack Obama ( Politico) . In a New York Times op -ed published Monday, the former Obama adviser wrote of his advice for the then -prospective presidential candidate in 2006, in which he laid out the Illinois senator's case for a White House run. \"Here's the gist. Open -seat presidential elections a re shaped by perceptions of the style and personality of the outgoing incumbent. Voters rarely seek the replica of what they have,\" Axelrod wrote. \"They almost always seek the remedy, the candidate who has the personal qualities the public finds lacking in the departing executive.\" In other words, Axelrod added, if he had \"only reread my own words, written nine years ago to another aspiring candidate, I would have taken the Trump candidacy more seriously from the start.\" CLINTON BRUSHES OFF CHARACTER ATTA CK: Hillary Clinton brushed off attacks on her character as the battle wounds of a time -tested leader ( CBS News ). \"I've been around a long time, people have thrown all kinds of things at me,\" she said. \"I just keep going forward.\" Clinton acknowledged that \"if you're new to politics,\" the attacks on her character may seem concerning. Yet she pointed out that she's been working on issues like achieving universal health care coverage longer than some young caucus -goers have been alive. \"I've been at the front lines of change and progess since I was your age,\" she told the college student. \"I've taken on the status quo time and time again. I've had many, many millions of dollars spent against me.\" S.C. REP SWITCHES ENDORSEMENT TO SANDERS: South Carolina state Rep. Justin T. Bamberg \u2014 the lawyer for the family of Walter Scott, who was killed by a police officer last April \u2014 endorsed Bernie Sanders Monday, after initially throwing his support behind Hillary Clinton in December ( Politico ). in a press conference Bamberg said until now he had not given Sanders \"his fair shake\" but he now fully supports the Vermont senator. \"Bernie represents bold new leadership and is not afraid to challenge the status quo,\" Bamberg said. The state representative also addressed criticism Sanders has received about his goals being unattainable. General Assembly PENCE CAREER HANGS IN BALANCE WITH BIG BUSINESS: Increasingly, an unspoken question hangs over Indiana's debate on gay rights: How far are the state's key business leaders willing to go in their push to expand the state's civil rights laws? Those leaders flexed their muscles last year to temper the national firestorm that followed the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics feared would open the door to discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Hoosiers (Schneider, IndyStar ). At the time, those business leaders vowed to continue fighting for full statewide LGBT protections. But now, nine months later, they're fac ed with a dilemma. Any such legislation could put Gov. Mike Pence in political danger as he faces one of the toughest campaigns of his career. If Pence opposes expanded protections, as he has in the past, he would run counter to public opinion polls that show a majority of Hoosiers support them. But if he supports an expansion, he risks alienating social conservatives whom he needs to turn out in a tight race. The best thing for Pence \u2014 politically \u2014 might be if the legislation never reaches his desk. That leaves business leaders with a tough choice: Will they go to the mat for LGBT Hoosiers and push to advance civil rights legislation, even if it means handing a potential political advantage to Pence's union -backed opponent, Democrat John Gregg? \"I'm not go ing to take a stab at that question,\" said Kevin Brinegar, president of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, which supports LGBT protections. \"I'll pass.\" Last year, many of the state's key powerbrokers \u2014 including the Indiana Pacers' Jim Morris, IndyCar's Mar k Miles, the NCAA's Mark Emmert and Eli Lilly and Co. CEO John Lechleiter \u2014 exerted their influence at the Statehouse. In less than a week, they successfully pushed Pence and lawmakers to pass a RFRA \"fix\" that prevents the law from being used to discrimin ate against gay and transgender people. Now, those business leaders say they want to finish the job and add sexual orientation and gender identity to the state's civil rights laws. The difference is, they could argue they were saving Pence's career last ye ar. \"Governor Pence is a strong supporter of the business community, but at the same time, he's a strong supporter of the conservative religious community,\" said Joe Losco, a political science professor at Ball State University. \"Right now, they seem to be at a loggerhead.\" COLUMBUS REPUBLIC CALLS FOR LGBT EXPANSION: The Columbus Republic editorialized on Monday: Let's be clear upfront: No one should be discriminated against. Hoosier values demand that everyone be treated fairly and with dignity. Yet, in Indiana, the struggle for equality goes on when it comes to one of the most fundamental of all civil rights: the right not to be discriminated against. Indiana's civil rights laws prohibit practices that discriminate against individuals based on race, religion, sex, disability, national origin or ancestry. What is starkly missing from the code are protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. It's well past time for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community to be included in the sta te's civil rights laws so they are not discriminated against when it comes to employment, housing and public and business accommodations. But some legislators and Gov. Mike Pence are once again wavering on sending the strongest message possible that Indian a in no way, shape or form tolerates discrimination. The governor is offering up little leadership. FREEDOM INDIANA BLASTS SB100, SB66: Freedom Indiana, the statewide grassroots organization fighting to update existing Indiana laws against discriminatio n to include gay and transgender people, today condemned Senate Bill 66 as a dangerous piece of legislation that would thrust the state back into the national spotlight created by last year's Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and bring about even more legal and reputational challenges for the state ( Howey Politics Indiana ). \"Senate Bill 66 is RFRA on steroids,\" said Freedom Indiana campaign manager Chris Paulsen. \"Not only would it reopen the national and international wounds caused by last y ear's discriminatory RFRA legislation, it would make it easier to discriminate against any group currently or potentially protected under our civil rights law. Just when you thought lawmakers had learned a lesson from RFRA, a handful of them have decided t o breathe life into a 'Super RFRA.'\" Senate Bill 66 will be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee at 9 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Jan. 27. Senate Bills 100 and 344, which purport to address discrimination against gay and transgender people, will be heard in the Senate Rules Committee at 4 p.m. ET the same day. RESTRICTIONS FOR POLICE VIDOES DEBATED: A legislative proposal allowing Indiana law enforcement agencies to withhold video from police body cameras is advancing unchanged ( Associated Press ). The Indian a House rejected on a voice vote Monday a proposed amendment that would have judges release the video unless doing so would increase the risk of harm to someone or prejudice a court case. Bill sponsor Republican Rep. Kevin Mahan of Hartford City argued aga inst the change, saying he wanted a process that encourages police agencies to start using body cameras. The bill currently requires those seeking video to prove that its release is in the public interest. Hoosier State Press Association director Steve Key says the bill now gives police departments all incentives to deny public release of videos. BILL WOULD EXPAND VOUCHERS : A bill that would allow students to receive a school voucher for the spring semester of a current school year \u2014and more easily allow them to switch schools mid -year\u2014 is advancing in the Indiana General Assembly, with some Senate Republicans saying the bill would help expelled students and dropouts (Colombo, IBJ). Sen. Carlin Yoder, R -Middlebury, said he proposed the bill to help The Crossing, a private alternative school with several campuses across Indiana, serve troubled students during the second semester. \"It's such an obvious win for kids,\" Yoder said. \"What's so harmful about the state giving those kids a voucher so they can actual ly be successful? These kids end up being productive citizens and making something of their lives. All I'm trying to do is help kids get back to school.\" Vouchers are \"choice scholarships\" which use taxpayer dollars to help families pay to attend private s chools. The controversial program has expanded rapidly in Indiana since it started in the 2011 -12 school year. SEN. BROWN'S SOLID WASTE BILL ADVANCES: A bill authored by State Sen. Liz Brown (R -Fort Wayne) that would increase local control over solid wa ste management districts passed the Senate Committee on Environmental Affairs by a vote of 6 -3 (Howey Politics Indiana ). Under current law, solid waste management districts are created and regulated by the state. Senate Bill 366 would change that statute b y giving local officials the opportunity to examine and determine whether their solid waste management district is what's best for the community. As amended in committee, a local body couldn't dissolve their solid waste district until 2017 - allowing ample time for discussion and a decision. \"This bill is advantageous to local governments,\" Brown said. \"It gives the power back to local officials who know and understand the needs of their specific communities.\" SB 366 now moves to the full Senate for further consideration. BANKS' GUARD, CHILD SAFETY BILLS ADVANCE: Bills authored by State Sen. Jim Banks (R -Columbia City) supporting child Safety and protecting employment for National Guard members and veterans passed the full Senate today ( Howey Politics Indiana). Senate Bill 159, which passed by a vote of 50 -0, would require the Indiana Department of Child Services to communicate with the United States Department of Defense (DoD) regarding allegations of child abuse or neglect involving children in military f amilies. Banks said this legislation would allow Indiana to collaborate with the Department of Defense in cases of abused or neglected children of military families ensuring those children are being cared for responsibly. Senate Bill 362, which passed by a vote of 50 -0, would extend the rights, benefits and protections found in the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to members of the Indiana National Guard who live in another state during a state -sponsored activation. \"There are people joining the Indiana National Guard who live outside of state lines, Banks added. \"This bill would provide those members employment protections in their respective state if they had to miss work due to their National Guard duties.\" ELECTION BILL QUESTIONED: Schools across Indiana are set to learn their new A -F performance grades after months of discord over changes to the ISTEP standardized exam that led to big drops in student scores (Banta, Bloomington Herald -Times ). The State Board of Education is expected to vote Tuesday on approving the ratings for more than 2,000 public and private schools. Schools can receive higher grades than last year, but not lower ratings. That's because of a state law change approved by legislators and signed by Republican Gov. Mi ke Pence last week. Slightly more than half of students passed both the language arts and mathematics portions of last year's ISTEP exam, down from nearly 75 percent who passed both sections in 2014. The drop followed changes making the exam more difficult . COLUMBUS LEGISLATORS COMMENT ON ROAD PLANS: Chief among the Republican legislators' priorities is passing a bill that funds continued improvements to the state's infrastructure system. The state's infrastructure fund is dwindling, so lawmakers are scrambling to find money to complete road improvem ent projects (Columbus Republic ). Three different ideas for generating funds for road improvements have been presented so far this session, State Rep. Sean Eberhart said. From his perspective, State Rep. Milo Smith said the gasoline tax should be rebranded as a road user fee. He would support using funds collected from the user fee to pay for road work. Smith also has proposed his own solution to the road funding problem \u2014 House Bill 1131, which would create a supplemental motor fuel tax. However, Smith sai d his proposal has gotten no traction so far this session. Outside of the gas tax, lawmakers also are considering raising the cigarette tax to pay for road work. Right now, consumers pay a 99.5 cent tax on a pack of cigarettes, but the House Republican's proposal is to raise that tax by $1. Growing up, Smith said he has vivid memories of listening to his parents coughing because of their tobacco use, so he also would support raising the cigarette tax. \"It's kind of a user tax,\" Smith said. \"If you're going to smoke, you should be paying for the Medicaid cost.\" Eberhart, however, said he is only lukewarm to the idea of increasing the cigarette tax. SMITH COMMENTS ON LGBT LEGISLATION: The Third House meeting also included limited discussion about changes to the state's civil rights law ( Columbus Republic ). LGBT advocates have been calling for an amendment to the state's civil rights code that would add protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Hoosiers. Republican lawmakers, however, have been w orking to find a compromise that would expand LGBT protections while also providing certain exemptions for religious beliefs. Rather than adding specific LGBT protections, Smith advocated for finding an overarching solution that would prevent all forms of discrimination against all Indiana residents. \"When we add another protection, who are we leaving out?\" Smith said. LEGISLATIVE CIVILITY CITED: Here's a man -bites-dog story. A handful of state lawmakers were recognized Monday for being civil ( WISH -TV). It's part of an effort to elevate the debate at the Statehouse. A newly -formed group of retired lawmakers is trying to encourage more civility. It created an award that is believed to be the first of its kind in the country. It was given to three senators, Luke Kenley of Noblesville, Vaneta Becker of Evansville and Earline Rogers of Gary. State Representatives Tim Brown of Crawfordsville and Charlie Brown of Gary were also recognized for, among other things, setting good examples. \"So as to reflect positivel y on and to generate respect for the General Assembly,\" said retired legislator Ralph Foley. \"With the acrimony and the fighting and the circular firing squads we see taking place in politics,\" said former legislator Dale Grubb. \"Young kids who have a desi re to figure out where they're going in life have discounted government service, and I think that would be a travesty.\" State GOVERNOR: 1,000 SHOW UP FOR CHOICE RALLY - More than 1,000 people expressed their support Monday inside the Indiana statehouse for choosing where to send their son or daughter to school ( Fox59 ). It's National School Choice Week. There are thousands of events going on around the country, including in Indiana, supporting the idea that your income and your zip code should not determine where your kids can go to school. \"Your school, your choice!\" shouted supporters during a school choice rally in the atrium of the statehouse Monday. \"Would you join me in thanking all the members of the Indiana General Assembly who have stood by education reform for now more than a decade, give them a big round of applause, they need to hear you upstairs,\" said Gov. Mike Pence. EDUCATION: SCHOOLS TO LEARN A -F GRADES - Schools across Indiana are set to learn their new A -F performance grades after months of discord over changes to the ISTEP standardized exam that led to big drops in student scores ( Associated Press ). The State Board of Education is expected to vote Tuesda y on approving the ratings for more than 2,000 public and private schools. Schools can receive higher grades than last year, but not lower ratings. That's because of a state law change approved by legislators and signed by Republican Gov. Mike Pence last w eek. Slightly more than half of students passed both the language arts and mathematics portions of last year's ISTEP exam, down from nearly 75 percent who passed both sections in 2014. The drop followed changes making the exam more difficult. DOC: HEALTH PROBLEMS AT PUTNAMVILLE - A deadly mystery illness at a state prison is putting inmates and employees at risk (Chapman, WTHR -TV). One inmate has died and 25 others are now under watch at the Putnamville Correctional Facility as Indiana state health offici als and the Centers for Disease Control try to figure out what's making people sick. In an update Monday afternoon, the Department of Correction revealed at least four inmates are now in critical condition. Officials still don't know the source of the quic kly spreading illness. All they can say is that it presents with flu and pneumonia like symptoms, including shortness of breath. The DOC says it has replaced 75 air handling filters and provided masks and hand sanitizer to all inside the prison. Visitors are not allowed until further notice. Those living near the prison are still concerned. They're worried about what their community has been exposed to as workers have been in and out of the facility prior to the outbreak on Friday. 13 Investigates spoke w ith a former \"America's Most Wanted\" fugitive, Wade Meisberger, who said he warned the state in January 2015 about potential problems. Meisberger describes \"The State Farm,\" as it's called, as an incubator. He showed 13 Investigates letters he sent to both prison officials and Gov. Mike Pence, calling Putnamville's sanitation program ineffective. \"You just can put that many people in such a little amount of space and expect it to be clean and stay clean and for there not to be any kind of germs or bacteria ,\" said Meisberger.

Nation WHITE HOUSE: OBAMA BANS SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR TEENS - President Barack Obama is ordering changes to how federal prisons use solitary confinement as Co ngress considers similar reforms as part of a broad package on sentencing, he announced Monday evening ( Politico ). Obama banned the use of solitary confinement for juveniles. While that is likely to affect only a tiny number of people \u2014 only about 26 priso ners in the federal system are under 18 \u2014 the move is intended to set an example for state and local jails, which hold 9 in 10 inmates in the U.S. Obama also banned using solitary confinement for low -level infractions at federal prisons and ordered the Bur eau of Prisons to develop alternatives for prisoners who are mentally ill or are place in solitary confinement for their own protection. WHITE HOUSE: OBAMA FOR EASING 401(K) RULES - President Obama will propose in his 2017 budget new rules that would make it easier for small businesses to join together to form 401(k) retirement plans for their workers, even if the businesses are in different industries, administration officials said Monday ( New York Times ). The officials said that the proposal, if accepted by the Republican -led Congress, could make retirement plans available to more people by reducing administrative costs and compliance issues, which are sometimes too great for a sin gle small business to bear. \"We need to find new ways to help working families build up a nest egg,\" said Jeffrey D. Zients, the director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council. He said that retirement plans were not currently available to more than half of all workers at businesses that employ fewer than 50 people. SCOTUS: JUVENILE LIFE SENTENCES CAN BE REVERSED - The Supreme Court ruled Monday that those sentenced as teenagers to life imprisonment for murder must have a chance to argue that they be re leased from prison (Washington Post ). The court said its 2012 decision that struck down mandatory life imprisonment terms without parole for juveniles must be applied retroactively. That would mean new sentencing or a chance to argue for parole, said Justi ce Anthony M. Kennedy, who wrote the 6 -to-3 decision. The decision continues the trend of the court in deciding that juveniles convicted of even the most heinous crimes must be treated differently than adults. It has also ruled out capital punishment for j uveniles. ABORTION: INDICTMENT IN PP VIDEO - A grand jury investigating Planned Parenthood has indicted two anti -abortion activists who covertly shot videos of the organization ( Associated Press ). Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson announced Monday that Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden was indicted on a felony charge of tampering with a governmental record and a misdemeanor count of related to purchasing human organs. Another activist was also indicted on a charge of tamperin g with a governmental record. A news release announcing the indictment doesn't say what the record was. Anderson said the grand jury cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing. The Center for Medical Progress is the anti -abortion group that released cove rtly shot videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of aborted fetuses for research. A phone message left with the group wasn't immediately returned. Local CITIES: SCHUETTER WON'T APPEAL JASPER ELECTION RECOUNT - The loser of a southern Indiana mayor's race decided by a single vote has decided not to appeal a recount. Democratic candidate Wayne Schuetter of Jasper tells the Jasper Herald that after talking to attorneys, he decided a legal challenge would be costly, the odds of winning were slim, and it wasn't in the city's best interest. Schuetter had until Thursday to file an appeal of a recount commission's decision. He and Republican Mayor Terry Seitz each received 1,856 votes in the November election, but the re count commission decided the contest when two Republican members of the three -member panel determined an absentee ballot for Schuetter was invalid because it had not been initialed by two members of the county clerk's office, as required by state code. CITIES: PARK TUDOR HEAD COMMITTED SUICIDE - The head of Park Tudor School committed suicide Saturday, according to the Marion County Coroner's Office (WISH -TV). Marion County Chief Deputy Coroner Alfarena Ballew released the cause of death Monday afternoon . Park Tudor announced the death of headmaster Dr. Matthew D. Miller on Saturday. Classes were canceled Monday. Miller had been at Park Tudor since July 2011. CITIES: MAYOR HENRY WANTS TO UP CITY PAY - Mayor Tom Henry on Monday said he plans to examine t he wages of Fort Wayne city employees to ensure every public worker is earning a livable wage (Gong, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). Henry's comments came during his annual address to the Fort Wayne Rotary Club at Parkview Field, where he discussed the city's accomplishments in public safety, redevelopment, economic and downtown development, streets and roads infrastructure, utilities and parks. The mayor also touched on the city's financial condition and the state of the Legacy Fund. The annual address, give n during a luncheon with the Rotary Club, has traditionally served as a preview for Henry's State of the City address, which is scheduled for Feb. 10. \"My friends, I submit to you that $7.75 - the minimum wage, the federal minimum wage - is not enough for an individual or family to subsist in our community,\" Henry said. \"So my goal right now is not only to help educate those individuals so they can go up to make more money, but I'm going to submit to you right now that I'm going to take a look at the city of Fort Wayne's wages to make sure that everybody that works for me is making a livable wage.\" Despite the city's unemployment rate hovering about 4 percent, Henry said the city must ensure that jobs coming into Fort Wayne offer good pay and benefits for r esidents. CITIES: TERRE HAUTE COUNCIL EYES FISCAL DILEMMA - The Terre Haute City Council plans to conduct a special meeting at 5:30 p.m. today in an effort to provide fiscal oversight related to the city's ongoing budget challenges (Loughlin, Terre Haute Tribune -Star). The council is expected to explore possible budget cuts and revenue options, including new user fees. The public will be able to comment at the beginning and end of the meeting on issues related to city finances, said Todd Nation, council president. The goal is that the council develop a consensus on how it will approach the issue, he said. CITIES: KITCHELL TO HONOR 'BICENTENNIAL CITIZENS' - Logansport Mayor Dave Kitchell is recognizing one of the citys residents each week during Indiana's 200th year. He's calling them Logansport's Bicentennial Citizens ( Logansport Pharos -Tribune ). Each week throughout the year of Indiana's bicentennial, a Logansport citizen or native who has achieved statewide or national acclaim will be honored, Kitchell said in a press release. COUNTIES: ALLEN SEES SPIKE IN HIV, HEP C - Allen County saw an uptick in new HIV cases in 2015, according to the latest health department figures (Gong, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette ). In 2015, Allen County reported 23 new cases, up from 18 the year before, Kathy Thornson, director of HIV/STD prevention for the Fort Wayne -Allen County Department of Health, told the Fort Wayne -Allen County Board of Health on Monday. \"Five cases doesn't sound like a huge number, but when we actually lo ok at it for our county, it's a 28 percent increase that we saw in newly diagnosed HIV cases,\" Thornson said. In addition to an increase in new cases of HIV, Allen County also saw an increase in the number of new hepatitis C investigations performed in 201 5, Erika Pitcher, the department of health's director of community health & case management services, said. There were 395 new case investigations in 2015, an increase of 61 percent from 2014, when there were 245 new cases being investigated. \"I was a litt le surprised to see that we jumped 61 percent this year to 395 cases,\" Pitcher said. \"There's a high number in the fourth quarter that are suspect and still waiting to be classified.\" COUNTIES: LaPORTE DEPUTY CORONER PLEADS GUILTY - A LaPorte County deputy coroner suspended without pay due to drug dealing allegations has pleaded guilty (Maddux, NWI Times ). Dawn Maxson, 47, is scheduled for an argued sentencing March 22. She pleaded guilty Friday in LaPorte Circuit Court to dealing in a schedule I controlled substance, a level 4 felony punishable by a two - to 12-year sentence, and dealing in a schedule III controlled substance, a level 5 felony, which carries a one - to six-year sentencing range. Maxson was arrested Oct. 29 after selling 70 hydromorphone pills for $500 in the parking lot of Kmart along Ind. 2 on LaPorte's west side, according court documents. Authorities said Maxson obtained the drugs through prescriptions legally written by a physician and sold a portion of the pills whi le consuming the rest for a legitimate medical condition.

Some might be surprised that 70% of the participants are making contributions to their HSA-like account and are enrolled in the HIP Plus plan. Maybe most impressive is that almost 94% of enrollees who begin making contributions, continue doing so. However, the impact in the area of mental health and addiction is even more impressive, as many of these individuals have never had access to behavioral health services before HIP 2.0. SB 165, introduced by Senator Pat Miller, Indianapolis, would clarify HIP 2.0 in Indiana law. Mental Health America believes that all individuals and families should have access to a broad scope of medically appropriate, evidence-based interventions in the continuum of behavioral health services and supports. HIP 2.0 takes groundbreaking steps toward improving access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment services. Significantly, HIP 2.0 includes coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services at \"parity\" with other physical health disorders. In the area of mental health and substance use the tremendous advances that we have seen in treatment have been predicated on new medications that literally give people back their lives. HIP 2.0 ensures that appropriate mental health medications are accessible and that participants have access to medication assisted treatment for addiction \u2014evidenced based treatment that is critical to treating the opioid epidemic in Indiana. Further, HIP has become the foundation on what is developing into a system of care in the area of mental health and addiction, replacing the puzzle pieces of siloed services based on disjointed funding streams. The Governor 's announcement regarding the new Neuro-diagnostic Psychiatric Hospital is one example. This new evidence-based practice will create opportunities for cutting edge psychiatric diagnosis and short-term stabilization and treatment for individuals that will then move to community-based services now covered by HIP 2.0. Maybe most impressive is the progress we have made in the area of criminal justice reform. Legislation was passed to provide for treatment in lieu of incarceration, when appropriate, for nonviolent crimes involving individuals with behavioral health disorders. People who require treatment for mental heath or addiction \u2014as opposed to incarceration- -can now receive it through HIP 2.0. Other new initiatives in the criminal justice area, including \"Recovery Works \" and enhanced funding for treatment in community corrections, are all based on a foundation provided by HIP 2.0. Indiana's Constitution requires that we provide services for Hoosiers with mental illness. We have developed new ways to provide those services since the Constitution was written; but now more than ever, HIP 2.0 and SB 165 help to fulfill our constitutional promise. Stephen C.

I urge you to read it and make your LCC members aware of it. On the surface, it seems to have no immediate impact on LCCs, as all of the original the key elements have been retained, including the Local and State Drug Free Communities Funds.

I think we can all understand the politics of that. Grin and bear it.) but he has chosen to create an entirely new commission instead. But if he wants to make this a new initiative at the state level, there may be some thoughts also about changes at the local level. Nothing in the bill indicates that, but notice that the ICCDA will have to approve each and every LCC. The thinking may be to just automatically grandfather in current LCC's, but it does raise the potential of changes in composition, function, and relationship to the ICCDA and ICJI. Those changes can be implemented without specifying in legislation. They can be by promulgated rule or administrative action. So, bottom line is, stay apprised as the legislation moves along and be speaking to your local legislators to make sure the important work that we are doing remains enabled and supported. I have heard from Sonya and she is working with the State Board of Accounts to gather the information I have requested concerning the uses and status of the State DFC Fund. I am hopeful that what shakes out of all of this is finding out that once again, some support for our local plans can come from that fund.

Jane Seigel reported that Aaron Garner from the Department of Correction distributed the November population report by email to the Advisory Council members. Ms. Seigel stated that Mr. Garner will be able to answer any questions related to the November report at the next meeting. 6. Report from DMHA on Recovery Works lauch. Kevin Moore reported that DMHA launched Recovery Works at the beginning of November and is processing the treatment vouchers by hand until the vendor system is ready. He stated that the Recovery Works applications and vouchers have been slowly picking up momentum since November 1st. He noted that DMHA is working with Allen County to get treatment providers online for that area of the state. Sara Cozad distributed a report on the progress of Recovery Works and reported that there are 29 approved treatment agencies and 20 pending applications. She also stated that criminal justice partners have referred 129 individuals for treatment services such as housing assistance, substance abuse counseling, and alcohol and drug screens. Ms. Cozad also distributed a map showing the counties covered by a Recovery Works agency and counties without any providers. She stated that areas of opportunity are around Allen County and around Tippecanoe County. 7. Report from DOC on 2016 application process. Deb Braun reported that the majority of contracts have been executed for the FY 16 grant awards. She said that DOC would usually release 25% of the grant award up front for counties and then make 12 monthly payments for the remainder of the award, but will release these award funds immediately. She distributed copies of the draft grant application, cover sheet and budget for FY 17 and explained that the application has been reduced to 23 pages and the budget includes narrative. Ms. Braun also stated that DOC will incorporate suggestions from Judicial Center staff. She explained that there was one hiccup with the first round of grant applications because Howard County did not submit their application properly. DOC discovered the application after the awards had been made, graded the application and funded it separately. Ms. Braun asked Advisory Council members to submit comments and suggestions on the application documents by Thursday. Jane Seigel asked the Advisory Council members to discuss accounting for the grant awards, especially with respect to project income made off of grant funded positions or programs. The Advisory Council members had a lengthy discussion on the issue and decided to reach out to the State Board of Accounts for guidance. Ms. Seigel also asked the Advisory Council members to discuss the weight of the collaboration plans in the FY 17 application process. The Advisory Council discussed offering technical assistance to counties who need help with the collaboration plan and the idea of contingencies on funding for sub-par plans. The Advisory Council members agreed that the collaboration plans should be a high priority and given great weight in the application review process. 8. Legislative Report. Larry Landis reported that the Legislative Committee met for the first time today. The group went through HEA 1006 and identified 4 areas to recommend for revision in the 2016 session of the General Assembly. Mr. Landis outlined the recommended revisions as follows: p. 2, change the wording to have the DOC commissioner coordinate with the Division of Mental Health and Addiction rather than listing specific priorities; p. 5, add all other local criminal justice agencies to the collaboration plan; p. 6, add \"in jail\" for treatment options; and p. 11, rewrite \"felons in all stages of criminal justice system\". David Powell made a motion to adopt the recommendations of the Legislative Committee. The Advisory Council discussed the recommendations and Sara Cozad pointed out that the language on p. 12 has caused confusion because DMHA does not license treatment providers. She suggested that the language be changed to reflect that the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency issues licenses to mental health treatment providers. Mr. Powell amended his motion to include Ms. Cozad's recommendation for p. 12 and Linda Brady seconded the motion. The Advisory Council members approved the motion unanimously. Mr. Landis stated that he will get the recommendation revisions to a legislator by December 4th. 9. Next meeting. Jane Seigel announced that the Advisory Council will meet on January 15, 2016 at 10 a.m. at the Indiana Judicial Center.
