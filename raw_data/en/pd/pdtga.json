A new study has found that nearly half of US dog owners are hesitant to vaccinate their pets, and that their attitudes are influenced by their views on human vaccines, especially the COVID-19 vaccine. The study also suggested that canine vaccine hesitancy could undermine the efforts to eliminate rabies globally and prevent future outbreaks. The prevalence and causes of canine vaccine hesitancy The study, published in the journal Vaccine, was conducted by researchers from the [Boston University School of Public Health and Polar Bears International](https://phys.org/news/2023-08-dog-owners-hesitant-vaccinate-pets.html). They surveyed a nationally representative sample of 2,200 US dog owners using the research sampling firm YouGov between March 30 and April 10. They found that more than half of the respondents expressed some level of canine vaccine hesitancy, meaning that they were skeptical about the safety, efficacy, or necessity of vaccinating their dogs. According to the survey results, nearly 40% of dog owners believe that canine vaccines are unsafe, more than 20% believe these vaccines are ineffective, and 30% consider them to be medically unnecessary. About 37% of dog owners also believe that canine vaccination could cause their dogs to develop autism, even though there is no scientific evidence to support this claim for animals or humans. The study also found that canine vaccine hesitancy is strongly associated with human vaccine hesitancy, especially towards the COVID-19 vaccine. Dog owners who hold negative attitudes towards human vaccines are more likely to hold negative views towards vaccinating their pets. The study's lead author, Dr. Matt Motta, assistant professor of health law, policy & management at BUSPH, said that the findings indicate a COVID vaccine \"spillover\" effect in the US. The study's authors suggested that canine vaccine hesitancy is driven by similar factors as human vaccine hesitancy, such as misinformation, mistrust, and personal beliefs. They also noted that some dog owners may be influenced by the anti-vaccine movement in the pet industry, which promotes alternative or holistic treatments for dogs and discourages conventional veterinary care.

Rabies is a fatal viral disease that affects the nervous system of mammals. It can be transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal. Dogs are the primary source of human rabies deaths worldwide, accounting for about 99% of cases. Rabies is preventable through vaccination, which is highly effective and safe for both dogs and humans. In the US, almost all states require domestic dogs to be vaccinated against rabies by law. However, if dog owners fail to comply with these regulations due to vaccine hesitancy, they could expose themselves and others to the disease. The study found that dog owners who are hesitant to vaccinate their pets are also more likely to oppose policies that encourage widespread rabies vaccination, and less likely to make the effort to vaccinate their pets. Canine vaccine hesitancy could also hamper the global efforts to eliminate rabies by 20303, a goal set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners. The WHO estimates that more than 59,000 people die from canine-mediated rabies each year, mostly in low- and middle-income countries where access to canine rabies vaccines is limited. The WHO recommends mass vaccination of at least 70% of dogs in endemic areas as the most effective strategy to prevent human rabies deaths. However, if dog owners in these areas are hesitant to vaccinate their pets due to misinformation or mistrust, this strategy could fail. The study's authors urged governments and health authorities to take action to address canine vaccine hesitancy and restore trust in vaccine safety and efficacy. They suggested that public education campaigns should target both human and animal health benefits of vaccination, and counteract the myths and misinformation spread by anti-vaccine groups. They also recommended that veterinarians should play a key role in communicating with dog owners about the importance of vaccinating their pets and providing accurate and reliable information about the risks and benefits of vaccines. The study's authors hoped that their research will raise awareness about the issue of canine vaccine hesitancy and its potential impact on public health. They also called for more research on the topic, especially in other countries and regions where rabies is endemic or emerg, and concluded that \"the vaccine spillover effects that we document in our research underscore the importance of restoring trust in human vaccine safety and efficacy\".
