CODE OF MARYLAND REGULATIONS (COMAR) COMAR is the official compilation of all regulations issued by agencies of the State of Maryland. The Maryland Register is COMAR's temporary supplement, printing all changes to regulations as soon as they occur. At lea st once annually, the changes to regulations printed in the Maryland Register are incorporated into COMAR by means of permanent supplements. CITATION TO COMAR REGULATIONS COMAR regulations are cited by title number, chapter number, and regulation number. Example: COMAR 10.08.01.03 refers to Title 10, Subtitle 08, Chapter 01, Regulation 03. DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE Incorporation by reference is a legal device by which a document is made part of COMAR simply by referring to i t. While the text of an incorporated document does not appear in COMAR, the provisions of the incorporated document are as fully enforceable as any other COMAR regulation. Each regulation that proposes to incorporate a document is identified in the Marylan d Register by an Editor's Note. The Cumulative Table of COMAR Regulations Adopted, Amended or Repealed, found online, also identifies each regulation incorporating a document. Documents incorporated by reference are available for inspection in various depo sitory libraries located throughout the State and at the Division of State Documents. These depositories are listed in the first issue of the Maryland Register published each year. For further information, call 410 -974-2486. HOW TO RESEARCH REGULATIONS An Administrative History at the end of every COMAR chapter gives information about past changes to regulations. To determine if there have been any subsequent changes, check the ''Cumulative Table of COMAR Regulations Adopted, Amended, or Repealed'' which i s found online at http://www.dsd.state.md.us/PDF/CumulativeTable.pdf . This table lists the regulations in numerical order, by their COMAR number, followed by the citation to the Maryland Register in which the change occurred.

Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to implement Addendum IV to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for American Eel. The 2012 American Eel Benchmark Stock Assessment indicated the American eel population in U.S. waters is depleted. The ASMFC American Eel Management Board approved Draft Addendum IV to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for American Eel with a goal to reduce overall mortality and increase conservation of American eel stocks. Addendum IV established a coast wide catch cap for the commercial yellow eel fishery starting in 2015. The following two management triggers were established: if the harvest cap is exceeded by mor e than 10% in any one year or if the harvest cap is exceeded for two consecutive years, then an individual state quota is allocated and required to be managed in the following year. Therefore, if the coast wide American eel harvest exceeds the coast wide c ap by more than 10% in 2015, Maryland must have the ability to manage their quota (pre -determined in Addendum IV) starting in 2016. The proposed action establishes an eel harvester permit that will be required for all commercial eel harvesters, this includ es commercial finfish and crab license holders. Crab license holders are included because they are allowed to harvest eels for bait. If a state quota is implemented, all eel permit holders will be subject to daily reporting requirements. These reporting re quirements will comply with Addendum IV. In order to effectively manage the eel quota, the proposed action includes a provision to allow the Department to modify, open or close the season or modify catch limits by public notice. Comparison to Federal Stand ards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact The proposed action has no economic impact. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has minimal or no economic impact on small businesses. Impact on Individuals with Disabilities The proposed action has no impact on individuals with disabilities.

BELTON Secretary of Natural Resources Title 10 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE Subtitle 06 DISEASES Notice of Proposed Action [16-021-P] The Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene proposes to: (1) Amend Regulation .02 and repeal Regulation .17-1 under COMAR 10.06.01 Communicable Diseases and Related Conditions of Public Health Importance ; and (2) Adopt new Regulations .01\u2014.08 under a new chapter, COMAR 10.06.07 Sexually Transmitted Infections \u2014 Expedited Partner Therapy for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea . Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to repeal regulations related to the Expedited Partner The rapy (EPT) Pilot Program in Baltimore City Health Department under COMAR 10.06.01, and add a new chapter of regulations for EPT for chlamydia and gonorrhea in Maryland under COMAR 10.06.07. Pursuant to Health -General \u00a718 - 214.1, Annotated Code of M aryland, Ch. 183, Acts of 2015, this proposal creates regulations for certain health care providers and pharmacists, within their existing scopes of practice, to prescribe or dispense antibiotic therapy to any partner of a patient diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea without making a personal physical assessment of the partner, and without having a previous provider - patient relationship with the partner. This proposal expands EPT permissibility throughout Maryland in order to help reduce the likelihood of repeat infection in a patient diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea. Specifically, this proposal outlines eligibility, prescribing and dispensing authority, counseling and educational requirements, documentation, and reporting. This proposal also expands E PT permissibility throughout Maryland and helps to reduce the likelihood of repeat infection in a diagnosed patient. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. This proposal will result in an indeterminable impact to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Department), local health departments (LHDs), pharmacists, insurers, and health care providers. As permitted in statute, EPT is a vol untary practice of treating chlamydia or gonorrhea in a sex partner or partners of an infected patient; therefore, there is no way to determine how many: health care providers (including LHDs) will offer EPT to their patients or need training from the Depa rtment; patients will accept EPT for their sex partner or partners; sex partners will accept EPT medication or fill their prescription for the medication; pharmacists will fill EPT prescriptions; and repeat infections will be avoided. The impact of this pr oposal on insurers, including Medicaid, is indeterminable because of the unknown number of EPT prescriptions that will be given to an insured sex partner or partners. It is anticipated that the Department, LHDs, insurers, health care providers, and the pu blic will benefit from a reduction in repeat infections. Pharmacists will incur minor costs associated with providing educational information to accompany EPT medications and health care providers who provide EPT will likewise incur minor costs associated with counseling patients and providing educational information for their partner or partners. Insurers will incur reimbursement costs for EPT medications given to a sex partner or partners who are their enrollees, but will also benefit from a reduction in costs associated with untreated infections in their enrollees. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: (E+) Indeterminable B. On other State agencies: NONE C. On local governments : (E+) Indeterminable PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 18 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 1, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 2016 Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: (1) Pharmacies (-) Indeterminable (2) Insurers (-) Indeterminable (3) Health care providers (-) Indeterminable E. On other industries or tra de groups: NONE F. Direct and indirect effects on public: (+) Indeterminable III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A. The Department will incur operational costs as a result of start - up costs during the first year, including maintaining newly developed regulations, developing the EPT website, and providing technical assistance and educational materials. Additionally, the Department will expend existing federal funding to educate pharmacists and health care providers about EPT. This funding amount is indeterminable because the number of health care providers who will need training from the Department is unknown. C. LHD Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) and Family Planning programs may incur the cost of prescribing or dispensing medications and providing educational information for the patient's sex partner or partners. LHDs may also see a reduction in costs associated with providing services for repeat infection in a patient. D(1). Pharmacies will incur minor oper ational costs associated with filling EPT prescriptions and providing educational information for the patient's sex partner or partners. Additionally, pharmacies will generate revenue by filling EPT prescriptions at an indeterminable amount as it will depe nd on the insurance plan coverage of the patient and the patient's partner or partners, along with the varying reimbursement rates. D(2). Insurers will incur the cost of EPT medications for patient's partner or partners enrolled in their insurance plan. T his may also result in lower costs overall if patients experience lower rates of repeat infections and fewer patients seek care. D(3). Health care providers will incur costs associated with counseling patients and providing educational information for a patient's sex partner or partners and possibly for adapting electronic medical records software to accommodate EPT documentation. Health care providers may also see a reduction in costs associated with providing fewer clinical services once their patients' partner or partners are treated. F. It is anticipated that the public will benefit from reduced rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea and costs associated with repeat infection. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has a meaningful economic impact on small business. An analysis of this economic impact follows. Small businesses that could be potentially be impacted by this proposal include independent pharmacists and small health care practices who provide EPT. Health care providers will incu r costs associated with providing counseling and educational information, and can anticipate a reduction in costs associated with providing services for repeat infection in a patient. Additionally, independent pharmacists will incur costs associated with p roviding educational information and will generate revenue with each prescription filled. However, the actual impact of this proposal on independent pharmacists and small health care practices cannot be determined at this time, so it is unclear whether thi s proposal will have a meaningful impact on small businesses or not. Impact on Individuals with Disabilities The proposed action has no impact on individuals with disabilities.

VAN T. MITCHELL Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 24 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 1, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 2016 Subti tle 09 MEDICAL CARE PROGRAMS 10.09.56 Home and Community -Based Services Waiver for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Authority: Health -General Arti cle, and 15 -130, Annotated Code of Maryland Notice of Proposed Action [16-004-P] The Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene proposes to amend Regulations .01, .02, .04\u2014.08, .11, .14.17 , .19, .21, and .22, and adopt new Regulations .06-2 and . 14-1 under COMAR 10.09.56 Home and Community -Based Services Waiver for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder . Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to update regulations to ref lect changes in the waiver authority approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The proposed amendments will establish intensive therapeutic integration as a new waiver service and increase the reimbursement limit for environmental accessi bility adaptations. Additionally, the autism spectrum disorder participant eligibility requirements, staff training, and staffing for residential habilitation service are updated. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard t o this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. The addition intensive therapeutic service (ITI) and the increased reimbursement limit for environmental accessibility adaptations (EAA) will result in increased Program exp enditures of $168,245. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: (E+) $168,245 B. On other State agencies: NONE C. On local governments: NONE Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: (+) $168,245 E. On other industries or trade groups: NONE F. Direct and indirect effects on public: NONE III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A. and D. The n ew ITI service is expected to be used by 52 participants, averaging four units of service per week, 50 weeks per year, at $15.28 per unit. This service will result in increased Program expenditures, and provider revenues, of $158,912 annually. (52 particip ants x 4 units x 50 weeks x $15.28) The reimbursement limit for environmental accessibility adaptations will increase from $1,500 to $2,000 to be utilized over a 3 year period. An average of 56 participants utilized this service in the past 3 years. Histo rically, all users of the service used the maximum allowed. Therefore, the new reimbursement limit will result in an expected increase of $9,333 ($500 increase/3 years = $166.67 x 56 users). The total increased expenditure for the Program, and revenue for Autism Waiver providers, for both services is $168,245. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has a meaningful economic impact on small business. An analysis of this economic impact follows. Most providers rendering ITI and EAA are sma ll businesses. Autism Waiver providers' revenue will increase by $168,245. Impact on Individuals with Disabilities The proposed action has an impact on individuals with disabilities as follows: Autism Waiver program participants who require a higher level of support will have access to ITI, which may improve their social skills and safety in home and community settings. The increase in the EAA reimbursement limit will allow participants to access additional funds for physical adaptations, as well as, assist ive and augmentative devices.

MITCHELL Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene Subtitle 11 MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH 10.11.04 Lead Poisoning Screening Program Authority: Education Article, \u00a77 -403; -General Article, \u00a718 -106; Annotated Code of Maryland Notice of Proposed Action [16-005-P] The Secretary of Health and Ment al Hygiene proposes to amend Regulations .02, and .04\u2014.06 under COMAR 10.11.04 Lead Poisoning Screening Program . Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to improve lead testing rates in Maryland and align regulations with the new Center for Dis ease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. As the profile of lead exposure changes across the State, and lower levels of lead exposure are recommended by the CDC, relatively fewer children are exposed to lead in the traditional at -risk areas of older re ntal housing, and a higher proportion are being exposed in owner -occupied homes and from other sources of lead in the environment. Lead -exposed children can be found in every jurisdiction in the State. This proposal expands the definition of at -risk areas to include the entire State, amends lead poisoning blood testing requirements, allows the submission of alternative blood lead analysis documentation for children under certain circumstances, amends certain documentation reporting requirements, and makes g eneral updates. These amendments, together with the Department's new Targeting Plan, will expand the definition of at -risk area of lead poisoning to include the entire State, thus increasing the number of children tested for lead at ages 12 and 24 months. This will likely lead to an increase in the number of children tested for lead, and likely also lead to an increase in the number of children identified as having some lead exposure in an effort to prevent a number of children from ongoing lead exposure. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. This proposal will increase the number of children tested for lead in Maryland. The Department, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), and local health departments (LHDs) will experience an indeterminable increase in expenditures related to outreach, investigation, and case management of lead -exposed children. Health care providers may exp erience an increase in expenditures related to the testing and case management of children, depending on reimbursement by health care insurers. PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 30 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 1, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 2016 Homeowners and apartment building owners could experience an increase in expenditures for investigation and abat ement of lead in their properties. Health care insurers will experience an increase in expenditures related to testing and care of children who may be found to be lead -exposed. Homeowners and apartment building owners and health care insurers could also ex perience cost savings by addressing lead exposures before they become lead poisoning cases and avoiding more expensive medical care. According to 2014 MDE data, the number of children 12 or 24 months of age in Maryland was 177,841, of whom 68,881 (38.7%) w ere tested for lead. The number untested who would require lead testing under this proposal would be approximately 108,960 children. However, ultimately the public will benefit from reduced exposure to lead hazards and earlier detection of elevated blood l ead levels. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: (E+) Indeterminable B. On other State agencies: (E+) Indeterminable C. On local governments: (E+) Indeterminable Benefit ( +) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: (-) Indeterminable E. On other industries or trade groups: (1) Homeowners and apartment building owners (-) Indeterminable (2) Insurers (-) Indeterminable F. Direct and indirec t effects on public: (+) Indeterminable III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A. Medicaid will experience an increase in the number of children tested for lead and a smaller increase in the number of children identif ied with elevated blood lead levels. However, some of these children might have developed more severe lead poisoning except for the mandated early testing, and the costs of treating more severely lead-poisoned children would then be avoided by Medicaid due to the earlier testing. In addition, the Environmental Health Bureau will experience a significant increase in referral calls, from parents, providers, and LHDs. In most cases, these calls will be addressed by existing staff and referred to LHDs or to MD E. There will also be an increase in outreach by the Environmental Health Bureau that will likely continue throughout State Fiscal Year 16. B. MDE will almost certainly experience an increase in the number of referrals related to lead exposure, primarily referrals for affected rental properties built before 1978 will require investigation and administrative follow -up for compliance with lead and rental property laws. In addition, the Childhood Lead Registry will experience an increase in the number of blo od lead testing results. C. LHDs may see a significant increase in the number of lead - exposed children and may experience an increase in the number of related inquiries. A few LHDs currently account for the bulk of the cases of lead -exposed children ident ified, but when the proposed changes go into effect, it is anticipated that many or all LHDs will see significantly increased numbers of lead -exposed children, especially children with low lead levels (5 - 9 micrograms/deciliter). The Department is working with LHDs to minimize an increase in expenditures, while some LHDs have agreed to funnel questions related to new cases. D. Blood lead testing will likely increase across the Maryland population, both for children enrolled in Medicaid, and for children covered by private insurance. The increased expenditures by health care providers will likely be greater for children enrolled in private health insurance since Medicaid children are all supposed to be tested at ages 12 and 24 months already (current testin g rates are probably in the 60% range for this population). By contrast, many children enrolled in private health insurance will not be living in areas previously defined as at -risk, so they would not previously have been tested. It is anticipated that tes ting will be covered by health insurance in virtually all locations and practices. There will be costs associated with follow -up of positive tests. E(1). Homeowners and apartment building owners may see an increase in expenses if additional homes and/or r ental units are identified with lead hazards. Homeowners and apartment building owners would experience additional expenditures in order to abate the lead hazard. However, some cases of lead exposure will be identified and addressed before they become lead poisoning cases, which will result in savings by avoiding more expensive medical care. E(2). As testing increases, health care insurers will experience an increase in expenditures related to testing and care of children who may be found to be lead -expose d. It is anticipated that some cases of lead exposure will be identified and addressed before they become lead poisoning cases, which will also result in savings to insurers by avoiding more expensive medical care. F. Members of the public will benefit fr om earlier recognition of lead poisoning and follow -up. There will, however, be some cases in which the initial results may be elevated, then drop after the elevated tests are confirmed with venous testing. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has a meaningful economic impact on small business. An analysis of this economic impact follows. Some property owners who meet the criteria of small businesses could be affected if children in their properties are identified as having lead exposure . This could result in additional expenditures to investigate and abate lead sources in their properties. Impact on Individuals with Disabilities The proposed action has no impact on individuals with disabilities.

Statement of Purpose The purpose of this a ction is to align COMAR 10.18.05, 10.18.06, and 10.18.07 with current practices and bring these chapters into closer alignment with the Affordable Care Act. This proposal will also establish regulations for two existing programs - the Maryland AIDS Drug As sistance Program (MADAP) Temporary Assistance Program (TAP) and Urgent MADAP - codified as COMAR 10.18.01 and 10.18.10, respectively. Amendments to COMAR 10.18.07 will expand the capacity to help clients through the payment of co -pays, co-insurance, and de ductibles associated with health care visits. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. As a result of proposed changes to COMAR 10.18.07 M ADAP -Plus, this proposal will have a minimal economic impact on the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Department) and a positive impact on health care providers and clients, resulting from coverage of additional outpatient healthcare services. The D epartment's expenditures in MADAP -Plus will increase by an estimated $910,800 annually for co -pays, co - insurance, and deductibles based on estimated utilization for the following services: primary medical care, HIV subspecialty care, and laboratory service s. The Department has sufficient federal funds (Ryan White Part B) and special funds (pharmaceutical rebates) to cover the cost of these additional services. The other proposed changes to COMAR 10.18.01, 10.18.05, 10.18.06, and 10.18.10 either update exist ing regulations or establish new regulations that reflect current practice. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: (E+) $910,800 B. On other State agencies: NONE C. On local go vernments: NONE Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: (+) Indeterminable E. On other industries or trade groups: NONE F. Direct and indirect effects on public: (+) Indeterminable III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A. Under this proposal, the Department will pay for co -pays, co - insurance, and deductibles for additional covered healthcare services in the MADAP -Plus program. The estimated average number of visits per client is five visits per year. The Department has sufficient federal funds (Ryan White Part B) and special funds (pharmaceutical rebates) to cover the cost of these additional services. Expenditures are based on estimated client utilization of servi ces and estimated average cost per visit. The estimated number of clients who may be served through this expansion is 1,800 clients. The estimated total number of visits provided through this expansion is 9,000 visits. The estimated average amount paid by MADAP for these visits is $101.20 per visit. 9,000 x $101.20 = $910,800 D. There will be a minimal positive economic impact on health care providers resulting from an increase in client utilization of covered healthcare services. F. The effects on the p ublic will be positive as the proposed regulatory changes will remove a barrier to care for MADAP -Plus clients. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has minimal or no economic impact on small businesses. Impact on Individuals with Disab ilities The proposed action has no impact on individuals with disabilities.

M ITCHELL Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene Subtitle 18 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION AND ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) 10.18.08 HIV [Counseling (i), 2 18- 102, 18 -336, and 18 -338.3, Annotated Code of Maryland Notice of Proposed Action [16-017-P] The Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene proposes to amend Regulations .01\u2014.05, repeal existing Re gulations .06\u2014.10, adopt new Regulations .06\u2014.09, amend and recodify existing Regulation .11 to be Regulation .10, and recodify existing Regulation .12 to be Regulation .11 under COMAR 10.18.08 HIV Testing Procedures . Statement of Purpose The purpose of t his action is to streamline and update processes related to HIV testing for health care providers and in nonclinical settings and ensure overall consistency across various related regulations. Health care providers are generally physicians, nurses, or the designee of a health care facility. Nonclinical settings are locations or settings where medical and/or treatment services are not provided. The consent process for HIV testing was streamlined for health care providers to allow consent to be collected in t he same manner in which consent is collected for other medical procedures. Also, the amount and type of information which is to be delivered by health care providers to patients prior to testing has been reduced. No procedural changes were made in nonclini cal settings. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. As a result of the changes to streamline pretest activities related to HIV testing , health care providers (including those in local health departments) may note a negligible positive economic impact. As clinical settings implement changes to the testing process, the time they spend with each patient to provide the required information p rior to testing will be reduced. This may allow a health care provider to see more patients, which may increase revenue generated by the additional patients. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: NONE B. On other State agencies: NONE C. On local governments: (E+) Indeterminable Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: (+) Indeterminable E. On other industries or NONE PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 58 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 1, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 2016 trade groups: F. Direct and indirect effects on public: NONE III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) C.

This action was considered at a scheduled rule making meeting on October 26, 2015, notice of which was given under General Provisions Article, \u00a73 -302(c), Annotated Code of Maryland. Statement of Purpose The purpose of this action is to align regulations to the statutes passed during the 2015 Maryland General Assembly, Sen ate Bill 868, defining Transportation Network Company, Transportation Network Operator and Transportation Network Services. The modifications are to streamline and modernize outdated regulations, and implement new statutory provisions regarding Transportat ion Network Companies, Transportation Network Operators and Transportation Network Services. PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 70 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 1, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 2016 Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summary of Economic Impact. In the past 4years, a new variation of an intrastate passenger -for-hire transportation service has begun service in Maryland, Transportation Network Services. The General Assembly passed a bill, signed by the Governor, defining and regulating this type of serv ice. Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: (1) At least $1 million (R+) Annual Basis (2) At least $455,000 (E+) Annual Basis B. On other State agencies: (1) Unquantifiable (E+) Annual Basis (2) Approximately $75,000 (R+) Annual Basis C. On local governments: (1) Approximately $1,425,000 (R+) Annual Basis (2) Unquantifiable (E+) Annual Basis Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: (1) At least $3.5 million (-) Unquantifiable (2) Unquantifiable (+) Unquantifiable E. On other industries or trade groups: (1) Unquantifiable (+) Unquantifiable (2) Unquantifiable (-) Unquantifiable F. Direct and indirect effects on public: (1) Unquantifiable (-) Unquantifiable (2) Unquantifiable (+) Unquantifiable III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) A(1). On issuing agency, Revenue: The assumption is that there will be at least two operating Transpo rtation Network Companies authorized by the Commission. There will be an estimated 20,000 Transportation Network Operators and vehicles authorized in Maryland. The two Transportation Network Companies will be expected to pay an annual assessment to the Com mission as required by the Public Utilities Article. Additionally, the For -Hire Driving Services Enforcement Fund is an annual $40 assessment to be paid annually per each vehicle permitted. Therefore, the revenue to the For-Hire Driving Services Enforcemen t Fund is expected to be increased by $800,000 ($40 x 20,000). A(2). On issuing agency, Expenditures: The assumption that with the addition of two Transportation Network Companies and estimated 20,000 Transportation Network Operators and vehicles, additio nal staffing would be required. Based on these estimated numbers, the following additional staff would be required: three (3) Administrative Specialist positions (salary and expenses $45,000 x 3 positions = $135,000), one (1) Field Investigator positions ( salary and expenses $50,000), and one Staff attorney (salary and expenses $90,000). Additionally, day -to-day activities including office supplies, postage, phone lines, travel, and other expenses will cost an estimated $180,000. Although the Fiscal and Pol icy Note for SB868 estimated additional increased expense to the Commission would to be $109,300 annually, the operations of the Transportation Network Companies and Operators have experienced significant growth since this estimate was generated. Additiona lly, the fiscal note estimated expense was based on the original language of the proposed bill that limited the scope of the Commission's enforcement activities. B(1). On other State agencies, Expenditures: Additional resources and expenses will be necess ary in the Office of the Comptroller and the Maryland Insurance Administration. Commission Staff does not have access to information that would allow us to estimate the magnitude of those resources and expenditures. However, based on the Fiscal and Policy Note for SB868, there would be an increase of $59,600 in FY2016 and by $8,900 in FY2017 for the Maryland Insurance Information, but no expenses noted for the Office of the Comptroller. Again, these estimates were based on a proposed bill that limited the s cope of the Maryland Insurance Administration and Office of the Comptroller activities B(2). On other State agencies, Revenue: The assumption is that there will be at least 6 million trips completed in Maryland. The Office of the Comptroller, by statue, c an collect 5% of the amount collected to be distributed to the Administrative Cost Account. Therefore, the Office of the Comptroller could possibility collect $75,000 (6 million x 25\u00a2 x 5%). C(1). On local governments, Revenue: Each local government, by statue, may establish a tax of 25\u00a2 per each trip. The assumption is that there will be at least 6 million trips completed in Maryland, with all jurisdictions imposing a tax and notifying the Office of the Comptroller. Therefore, the local governments can po ssibly collect $1,425,000 (6 million x 25\u00a2 - $75,000 [Office of the Comptroller]). C(2). Expenditures for local governments to implement receipt of revenues is unquantifiable. D(1). On regulated industries or trade groups, Costs: The assumption is that t here will be additional costs borne by the Transportation Network Companies and Transportation Network Operators for assessments levied by the Commission (at least $1 million), the 25\u00a2 per trip tax imposed by the local jurisdictions (at least $1,500,000), an annual inspection of each vehicle conducted by a facility authorized to conduct a State motor vehicle inspection (the assumption of 20,000 x $50 -$70 = $1,000,000 -$1,400,000) as well as any cost of repair to bring the vehicle to State standards (unquanti fiable). Again, the assumptions are based on 20,000 Transportation Network Operators that conduct at least 6 million trips. D(2). On regulated industries or trade groups, Benefits: The benefits are an unquantifiable amount because of the assumption of increased safety with Commission oversight and the codification of insurance requirements pertaining to Transportation Network Companies and Transportation Network Operators. Additionally, certain vehicles that are not Transportation Network Operators will be inspected only once per year; previous regulations required that these vehicles be inspected twice per year. The owners of those vehicles will see an intangible and unquantifiable benefit of time freed to perform transportation services and not incapacita ted the vehicle inspection process. E(1). On other industries or trade groups, Benefits and Costs: At this junction, it is hard to place any estimated benefits or costs to PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 71 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 1, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 2016 other industries or trade groups. However, public safety is the overarching reason for the statute and respective regulations. E(2). On other industries or trade groups, Benefits and Costs: At this junction, it is hard to place any estimated benefits or costs to other industries or trade groups. However, public safety is the overarching reason for the statute and respective regulations. F(1). Direct and indirect effects on public, Benefits and Costs: Again, it is hard to place any estimated benefits or costs. However, public safety and regulatory oversight is the overarching reason for the statute and respective regulations. F(2). Direct and indirect effects on public, Benefits and Costs: Again, it is hard to place any estimated benefits or costs. However, public safety and regulatory oversight is the overarching reason for the statute and respective regulations. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has a meaningful economic impact on small business. An analysis of this economic impact follows. As a result of the passage of the statute, many individuals will be employ ed lawfully as \"independent contractors\" (if they are not deemed to be \"employees\") driving for Transportation Network Companies. Existing market participants will experience greater lawful competition. Impact on Individuals with Disabilities The proposed action has an impact on individuals with disabilities as follows: The regulations clarify the rights of individuals with disabilities when using passenger -for-hire transportation services.

DISCLOSURE REGARDING SURPLUS LINES INSURANCE. Please Read the Following Carefully Before Purchasing Insurance From a Surplus Lines Insurer. This policy is issued by a surplus lines insurer that has been approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration to issue insurance policies in the surplus lines insurance market. Surplus lines insurers are not under the jurisdiction of the Maryland Insurance Administration and do not possess a certificate of authority to transact insurance business in the State of Maryland. Beca use surplus lines insurers are not under the jurisdiction of the Maryland Insurance Administration, your ability to seek assistance from the State if you have a problem with your insurance company is limited. [The] Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation and Maryland Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Corporation [provide a fund ] provide funds that [permits ] permit certain claimants or policyholders to receive payment of covered claims if their insurance company becomes insolvent (i.e., bankrup t) and is unable to pay the claims. However, [this fund does ] these funds do not apply to surplus lines insurers , as a surplus lines insurer is not a member insurer of the Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation or the Maryland Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Corporation . If a surplus lines insurer becomes insolvent (i.e. bankrupt), any claim that you have against the surplus lines insurer will not be covered by the [fund] funds administered by Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corpor ation and Maryland Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Corporation . If you have any questions regarding this disclosure or surplus lines insurance, please contact the Maryland Insurance Administration at 410-468-2340. C.\u2014D. (text unchanged) ALFRED W. REDMER , Jr. Insurance Commissioner Subtitle 15 UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES Notice of Proposed Action [16-012-P] The Insurance Commissioner proposes to: (1) Amend Regulations .01\u2014.07 under COMAR 31.15.04 Solicitation of Annuity and Deposit Fund Contracts ; and (2) Adopt new Regulations .01\u2014.09 under a new chapter, COMAR 31.15.16 Annuity Disclosure . Statement of Purpose The pu rpose of this action is to adopt the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) \"Annuity Disclosure Model Regulation,\" Model MDL -245. This Model Regulation addresses many of the same issues found in current COMAR 31.15.04, but in more detail. Model MDL -245 was adopted by the NAIC in 1999 and has been amended in 2011 and 2013. Maryland's current chapter, COMAR 31.15.04, which applies to both annuities and deposit fund contracts, has not been amended since its adoption in January 1980. The NAIC M odel provides more detailed requirements for annuity illustrations and conforms COMAR to the modern annuity marketplace. Comparison to Federal Standards There is no corresponding federal standard to this proposed action. Estimate of Economic Impact I. Summ ary of Economic Impact. The amendments to this chapter will have a minimal economic impact on insurers issuing annuities in Maryland. PROPOSED ACTION ON REGULATIONS 77 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 1, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 2016 Revenue (R+/R -) II. Types of Economic Impact. Expenditure (E+/E -) Magnitude A. On issuing agency: NONE B. On other State agencies: NONE C. On local governments: NONE Benefit (+) Cost ( -) Magnitude D. On regulated industries or trade groups: Compliance costs (-) Minimal E. On other industries or trade groups: NONE F. Direct and indirec t effects on public: NONE III. Assumptions. (Identified by Impact Letter and Number from Section II.) D. The proposed amendments will have a minimal impact on insurers that issue annuities in Maryland. Some insurers may incur additional administrative c osts related to implementing the more detailed annuity disclosures required by the adoption of the NAIC Model. Larger insurers who issue annuities in the national or regional markets would likely see some cost savings, as their annuity disclosures would no longer need to be written to comply with the outdated Maryland regulations. The Commissioner does not believe that any additional costs will be significant, relative to the benefit to the insurer through the use of a national standard annuity disclosure and the benefit to the consumer of the improved disclosure that these amendments provide. Economic Impact on Small Businesses The proposed action has minimal or no economic impact on small businesses. Impact on Individuals with Disabilities The proposed ac tion has no impact on individuals with disabilities.

STEPHANIE L. RICHARD SON Secretary to the Commission [16-01-15] SUSQUEHANNA RIVER BASIN COMMISSION 18 CFR Part 806 \u2014 Review and Approval of Projects AGENCY: Susquehanna River Basin Commission. ACTION: F inal rule. SUMMARY: This document contains final rules that would amend the regulations of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (Commission) to simplify and clarify the process for transferring approvals and to add sections dealing with general permits and modifications to approvals. These amendments are to be made effective upon publication of this rulemaking. DATES: Effective December 11, 2015. ADDRESSES: Susquehanna River Basin Commission, 4423 N. Front Street, Harrisburg, PA 17110 -1788. FOR FUR THER INFORMATION Also, for further information on the final rulemaking, visit the Commission's website at www.srbc.net. SUPP LEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on September 21, 2015 (80 FR 56936); the New York Register on October 7, 2015; the Maryland Register on October 16, 2015; and the Pennsylvania Bulletin on October 1 7, 2015. The Commission convened a public hearing on October 29, 2015, in Grantville, Pennsylvania and a written comment period was held open through November 9, 2015. General Comments Comment : The rule will simplify the approval process for certain modifications and will be less burdensome on permittees and the Commission while still protecting the Susquehanna River Basin resources. Comment: The proposed rule will assist in streamlining the administrative and permitting process and are positive changes . Comment: The proposed rule should serve to provide great potential improvements for both the Commission and the regulated community. Response : The Commission appreciates the comments. Comments by Section, Part 806 Section 806.6 \u2014Transfer of approvals. Comment: We appreciate \u00a7 806.6(b) addressing previously unpermitted withdrawals and uses of water, which should address actions that affect local water resources. Response: The Commission appreciates the comment. This section is largely unchanged from t he prior regulatory text. Comment: The Commission should require approvals being transferred that are greater than 10 years old to perform a new or updated aquatic resource survey (ARS). Response: The Commission disagrees with the comment. The transfer rule does not allow new project sponsors to increase the withdrawal or consumptive use of the project above what was previously approved. The Commission will be able to require an ARS, if appropriate and necessary, when these approvals expire and need to be renewed pursuant to 18 CFR 806.14. Comment: The proposed rule will allow approvals where there is a change in ownership but no change in the project or the use of water to occur without the submittal of an entirely new application, and the Commission i s to be commended for proposing this change. Response: The Commission appreciates the comment. Section 806.14 \u2014Contents of application. Comment: The Commission proposed to add \u00a7 806.14(d) to set forth the application requirements for minor modifications. Section 806.14(a) should be correspondingly revised to include an exception for applications for minor modifications. Response: The Commission agrees and will add the phrase \"applications for minor modifications\" in the first sentence of \u00a7 806.14(a) to clarify that the requirements of that paragraph do not apply to applications for minor modifications. Section 806.15 \u2014Notice of application. Comment: The next to last sentence of \u00a7 806.15(a) appears to contain grammatically incorrect language (which appear s in the existing regulatory text). This should be corrected. Response: The Commission agrees with the comment. The next to last sentence will be corrected to delete the word \"for\" and place two commas to make the sentence grammatically correct. Comment : The intent of proposed rulemaking is that new paragraph (i) is meant to be the exclusive source of notice requirements for minor modification; however, no changes were proposed to paragraph (a) that make it clear that paragraph (a) does not apply to minor modifications. Paragraph (a) should be clarified. Response: The Commission agrees with the comment and also finds it applicable to new paragraph (h). In the final rule, paragraph (a) will now begin with \"Except with respect to paragraphs (h) and (i), ...\". Comment : The extension of time allotted for notices to be published from 10 to 20 days allows ample time for all interested parties and the public to comment. Response: The Commission appreciates with the comment. 806.17 \u2014General permits. Comment: Section 806.17(d)(3) provides that a Notice of Intent (NOI) must be denied if the project does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 806.21(a) or (b). However, \u00a7 806.21(b) does not provide any requirements, but rather gives the Commission discretion to modify or deny a project if the Commission determines that the project is not in the best interest of the conversation, development, management or control of the basin's water resources or is in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan. The reference to \u00a7 806.21(b) sho uld be removed or the standard placed verbatim into \u00a7 806.17(d)(3). Response: The Commission does not agree with the proposed revisions of the commenter. However, the Commission agrees that the paragraph could be clarified in light of the comment. As a part of the final rule, the Commission will revise paragraph (d)(3) to read as set out in the regulatory text at the end of this document. Comment: The Commission does not define \"minimal adverse impacts\" in \u00a7 806.17(a)(4). Comment: The Commission should tier a determination of minimal adverse impacts, looking at the existing standards in 18 CFR 806.23 or adopting a \"significance\" inquiry as provided in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Comment: The Commission should add a paragraph that prov ides that it shall not issue a general permit that creates or incites significant direct, indirect or cumulative impacts to water resources. SPECIAL DOCUMENTS 106 MARYLAND REGISTER, VOLUME 43, ISSUE 1, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 2016 Response: The Commission agrees that \u00a7 806.17(a)(4) would be strengthened by a reference to the Commission's exist ing regulatory review standards. These standards are known and defined with respect to Commission reviews of consumptive uses, withdrawals and diversions. Conversely, the Commission does not agree that the inquiries under NEPA would provide clarity in a substantive review in establishing a general permit. In addition, adopting a new set of standards for general permits would add complexity and confusion to the process that is avoided by referencing the Commission's existing review standards. The Commiss ion will revise the final rule so that \u00a7 806.17(a)(4) reads as set out in the regulatory text at the end of this document. Comment: The proposed regulations seem to presume NOI issuance. Response: The Commission disagrees with the comment. Part of the proposed rule includes \u00a7 806.17(d) entitled, \"Denial of Coverage.\" Comment: Public notice under the general permit procedure is inadequate. Specifically, the public is not afforded notice via the Federal Register of receipt of an NOI. Response: The Com mission agrees that the procedures do not set forth any requirement that the Commission publish receipt of NOIs. Accordingly, the Commission will amend the final rule to include a new paragraph (c)(9) to read as set out in the regulatory text at the end o f this document. Comment: Section 806.17(b)(3) should be revised to require the Commission to take into account the level of public interest and likelihood for controversy for any proposed general permit in determining whether to hold a public hearing. Response: The Commission agrees with the comment. The Commission will amend \u00a7 806.17(b)(3) to read as set out in the regulatory text at the end of this document. Comment: Section 806.17(c)(4) should be amended to provide for full Commission review and app roval of general permits. Response: No such revision is necessary. Section 806.17(b)(4) currently provides that the Commission will adopt and issue general permits. Paragraph (c)(4) provides that the approval of coverage under a general permit, shall be determined by the Executive Director unless the Commission establishes a different mechanism for approval when issuing the general permit. This process is similar to the existing process for approving projects under the Commission's Approvals By Rule in 18 CFR 806.22(e)(7) and (f)(10), where the Executive Director issues the approvals to project sponsors. Comment: Section 806.17(c)(8) should be amended to require the project to conduct an aquatic resource survey (ARS) before any General Permit is renewed or amended. Response: The Commission disagrees with the comment. The Commission currently requires projects to conduct an ARS on a case - by-case basis for individual applications for surface water withdrawals. The Commission does not believe that it wou ld be appropriate to require ARSs to be conducted as a rule for every general permit NOI holder for renewal or amendment. The general permit procedures as proposed, however, are sufficiently broad to allow the Commission, as a part of the scope or applica tion of a general permit developed by the Commission, to require an ARS from NOI applicants, if the Commission finds it appropriate for the type of activity being permitted. Comment: The Commission is urged to specifically mandate adequate fees for genera l permit applications. Response: The Commission appreciates the comment. The proposed rule provides that the Commission may set a fee for NOIs to any general permit. This allows the Commission to set a specific fee for NOIs under each particular general permit and tailor the fees to what is required of the NOI applicants and the Commission for each activity permitted. 806.18 \u2014Approval modifications. Comment: Section 806.18(c)(8) should be revised to grammatically consistent with paragraphs (c)(1) thr ough (7). Response: The Commission agrees with the comment. Paragraph (c)(8) is revised to read as set out in the regulatory text at the end of this document. Comment: The word \"flows\" in \u00a7 806.18(d)(4) should be revised to \"flow.\" Response: The Commis sion agrees with the comment and has made this revision to the final rule. Comment: Aside from the correction of typographical errors, every suggested minor modification category includes changes in permit terms that can result in significant adverse impa cts to local water resources and should not be allowed as minor modifications. Response: The Commission disagrees with the comment. In developing the list of minor modifications, the Commission examined the range of modification requests that it receives and carefully vetted those categories and developed them specifically because they do not pose significant adverse impacts to local water resources. Review of these types of modifications is largely administrative in nature and poses little to no risk to human health, safety or the environment. Transition Issues As a part of the Resolution adopting this final rule, the Commission also has set a reduced fee for applications for minor modifications at $750. Future adjustments may be made to this applic ation fee during the regular annual adjustments to the Commission fee schedule. List of Subjects in 18 CFR Part 806 Administrative practice and procedure, Water resources. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission amends 18 CFR part 806 as follows: PART 806 \u2014REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF PROJECTS 1.
