Its advocates see it as a holistic and [salutogenetic](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Salutogenesis.html) approach to medicine which focuses on ensuring that the conditions for health are present in a person. Therapies are intended to enhance the organism's capacities to heal. [[1]](#_note-Klotter/) Anthroposophical medicine is employed as an extension to conventional [medicine](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Medicine.html), not as an alternative to it; orthodox medical treatments such as [surgery](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Surgery.html) and [allopathic](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Allopathic.html) medicine are employed as necessary. [[1]](#_note-Klotter/) Anthroposophical physicians must have a conventional medical education, including a degree from an established and certified medical school, as well as supplementary training in the anthroposophical approach. [[2]](#_note-vR/) [[3]](#_note-0/) Additional recommended knowledge Origins The first steps towards an anthroposophical approach to medicine were made before 1920, when homeopathic physicians and pharmacists began working with Rudolf Steiner, who recommended new medicinal substances as well as specific methods for preparing these. In 1921, Dr. Ita Wegman opened the first anthroposophic medical clinic, now known as the Ita Wegman Clinic, [[4]](#_note-1/) in Arlesheim, Switzerland. Wegman was soon joined by a number of other doctors. They began to train the first anthroposophic nurses for the clinic. At Wegman's request, Steiner regularly visited the clinic and suggested treatment regimes for particular patients. Between 1921 and 1925, he also gave several series of lectures on medicine. In 1925, Wegman and Steiner wrote the first book on the anthroposophic approach to medicine, Fundamentals of Therapy. The clinic expanded and soon opened a branch in Ascona. Wegman lectured widely, visiting Holland and England particularly frequently, and an increasing number of doctors began to include the anthroposophic approach in their practices. A cancer clinic, the Lukas Clinic, [[5]](#_note-2/) opened in Arlesheim in 1963. Methodology Anthroposophical medicine approaches disease as an imbalance in the biological organism and employs treatment strategies intended to restore this balance. Anthroposophical approaches include anthroposophical medicines based upon modified [homeopathic](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Homeopathy.html) principles, physical therapies including massage therapy and artistic therapies. Many of these are intended to support the patient's capacity for self-healing. Anthroposophical medicine is based upon the anthroposophical view of the human being which considers the patient's: [[1]](#_note-Klotter/) - physical constitution; - life or etheric body, seen as the organizing principle directing growth and regeneration; - astral body, understood as the bearer of affect and consciousness; - and ego, seen as the capacity for self-reflection and free will. Anthroposophical doctors generally restrict the use of [antibiotics](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Antibiotics.html), antipyretics, and [vaccinations](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Inoculation.html). Most children treated by anthroposophic doctors are vaccinated only against tetanus and polio, and most vaccinations are given later than recommended by health authorities. [[6]](#_note-Lancet/) Studies of efficacy - A study of the effectiveness of anthroposophical medicine found long-standing improvements of disease symptoms and quality of life in patients with mental, respiratory, and musculoskeletal diseases and other chronic conditions; the study did not compare results with other treatment regimens. [[7]](#_note-3/) - A study of anthroposophic treatment of chronic illness found that \"Anthroposophic therapies were associated with long-term reduction of chronic disease symptoms, improvement of health-related quality of life, and health cost reduction.\" [[8]](#_note-4/) - The multicenter PARSIFAL study, involving 6,630 children age 5 to 13 in 5 European countries, concluded that certain practices of anthroposophical doctors, such as restrictive use of antibiotics and antipyretics, are associated with a reduced risk of allergic disease in children. [[9]](#_note-5/) - A comparison of the effectiveness of treatments of chronic lower back pain found that anthroposophically treated patients showed at least comparable improvements to conventionally treated patients, and significantly more pronounced improvement on three scales: mental health, general health and vitality [[10]](#_note-6/) Mistletoe treatment for cancer Anthroposophical medicine includes a [cancer](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Cancer.html) treatment based on [mistletoe](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Mistletoe.html) extracts developed by anthroposophical researchers. This treatment is widely used in Central Europe, where up to two-thirds of all oncology patients' treatment regimen includes mistletoe. [[11]](#_note-7/) A number of studies support the efficacy of mistletoe in treating cancers. [[12]](#_note-8/) One review of studies of mistletoe concludes that Iscador (mistletoe) has been shown to be effective against cancers in animals, but that its efficacy in humans is unclear. [[13]](#_note-9/) The National Cancer Institute has concluded that mistletoe extract has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory and to boost the immune system in animals, [[14]](#_note-10/) that there is evidence that mistletoe can boost the immune system in human beings, but that almost all of the studies done on human beings have major weaknesses that raise doubts about the reliability of their findings. [[15]](#_note-11/) Regarding mistletoe, the [American Cancer Society](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/American_Cancer_Society.html) website says, \"A number of laboratory experiments suggest mistletoe may have the potential to treat cancer, but these results have not yet been reflected in clinical trials. Available evidence from well-designed clinical trials that have studied mistletoe did not support claims that mistletoe could improve length or quality of life... Review of evidence from carefully conducted controlled human clinical studies indicates that mistletoe does not have any significant anti-tumor activity. Most of the studies that have found positive results from mistletoe extract in the treatment or prevention of cancer are not considered scientifically dependable.\" [[16]](#_note-12/) Side effects of mistletoe injections have been reported to include redness, pain or, in a few cases, inflammations under the skin [[17]](#_note-BMJ/), but it is not clear from the cited report whether it was [homeopathic](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Homeopathy.html) Iscador or another of the 30 types of mistletoe extracts [[18]](#_note-13/) that was used. [Edzard Ernst](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Edzard_Ernst.html) warns that mistletoe can have negative effects and some patients may choose to abandon other cancer treatments, which he sees dangerous. [[19]](#_note-14/) Criticism and controversy Robert Todd Carroll claims that, because of the individualized nature of treatment and for ethical reasons, Anthroposophical physicians do not conduct [double-blind](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Blind_experiment.html) controlled scientific experiments, [[20]](#_note-15/) and that it is thus nearly impossible to evaluate their success rates. Anthroposophical medicine has been criticized by some current day advocates of [evidence based medicine](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Evidence_based_medicine.html) such as Wallace Sampson [[21]](#_note-16/) and [Edzard Ernst](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Edzard_Ernst.html) [[22]](#_note-Edzard/) who have argued that practitioners of anthroposophical medicine and other forms of alternative medicine deliver treatments for which the efficacy or safety hasn't been adequately demonstrated through strictly controlled medical and scientific testing. [[22]](#_note-Edzard/) Other Steiner's descriptions of certain [bodily organs](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Organ_%28anatomy%29.html) and their functions sometimes differ significantly from those found in medical textbooks. He stated, for example, that the [heart](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Heart.html) is not a pump but a regulator of circulatory flow. [[23]](#_note-17/) Present-day clinics and doctors There are currently anthroposophical medical practices in more than 60 countries.
