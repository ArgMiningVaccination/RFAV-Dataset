It offers state-of-the-art microscopes, expert training, and an interactive environment for scientists to learn about the latest advancements in imaging technology. The Resource provides access to wide-field fluorescence, deconvolution, and confocal microscopy as well as live cell imaging, super-resolution structured illumination microscopy, and standard transmission and immuno-electron microscopy. [Explore all the CSHL Core Technologist The Shared Resource provides users with access to state-of-the-art microscopes, as well as technical advice and expertise in preparing cells or tissues for immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy, live-cell imaging, super-resolution imaging, transmission electron microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy. For assistance please contact Erika Wee, the Shared Resource Manager, at 516-367-5079. Services include: - Training individuals to use microscope modalities that best meet the needs of their specific scientific questions and allow them to achieve the highest image quality. - Preparing cells, organoids, and/or tissues for light or electron microscopic analysis to localize proteins, nucleic acids, or to examine basic cellular structures. - Providing access and support for advanced software packages for image processing, 3-D rendering and measurements. Individuals who want to use one of the microscopes must first contact the Resource Manager for an in-depth training session. After training, investigators can sign up for microscope use. Scheduling of the major microscopes is done through online reservation calendars. Microscope images and datasets can be transferred to a shared server or to users' own computers for preparing figures for presentation and/or publication. Available microscopes include: - Zeiss AxioImager2i upright fluorescence microscope for examining fixed samples. - Zeiss Observer inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a fully automated stage for image tiling/mosaics, time-lapse imaging of cultured cells, and brightfield imaging using phase-contrast or Nomarski optics. - Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscope with live 7 laser lines (405, 458, 488, 514, 561, 594, 633nm), and advanced spectral separation functions. - Zeiss LSM780 confocal laser scanning microscope with live cell imaging capabilities (time-lapse and photokinesis) and fully automated stage for image tiling, seven available laser lines (405, 458, 488, 514, 561, 594, 633nm), and advanced spectral separation functions for 7-color multiplex IF imaging. - Perkin-Elmer UltraVIEW VoX high speed spinning disk (Yokogawa\u00ae CSU-X1) laser confocal microscope with live cell imaging capability, time-lapse microscopy, photokinesis, multi-position image acquisition, 6 laser lines (405, 440, 488, 514, 561 and 640nm). - Applied Precision DeltaVision wide-field fluorescence microscopes for live cell imaging and deconvolution. - Applied Precision OMX (Optical Microscope eXperimental) structured illumination super-resolution microscope, 5 laser lines (405, 457, 488, 514, and 594nm). - Hitachi H-7000 transmission electron microscope.
