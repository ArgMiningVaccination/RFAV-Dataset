This time 10 years ago, close to the same number were in the hopper. Of this year's just-introduced bills, many bear similarities to others filed within the past decade. Some would require major changes in existing laws or repeal them altogther,while others seek a refinement in state statute. Some examples are proposals dealing with ethanol development and promotion, elk breeding, firearm usage, school breakfasts, and even the anointing of a reptile \u2014 theBlanding's turtle \u2014 to join ranks as a state symbol. And some bills that don't pass in one session may get reintroduced during the next biennium. Three proposals that crop up repeatedly seek to enact initiative and referen-dum, place term limits on public offices, or make the Legislature unicameral (one body). But the Capitol isn't the only place where history repeats itself. In downtown St. Paul on Feb. 20, for example, the whistle of the ill-fated Titanic was blown for the first timesince the ship sank during its maiden voyage in 1912. The whistle appears in an exhibitwith other artifacts rescued from the ocean depths. This past week, the Legislature introduced some innovative concepts and also tweaked a few old bills to make them new again. Later, outside and high above the Capitol dome,two celestial planets also repeated history. Not since 1900 have the planets Venus andJupiter aligned themselves so closely. This conjunction of planets was even closertogether some 2,000 years ago, and is said to be the Christmas star seen then overBethlehem. On the national political scene, history will repeat itself if, as expected, a person named George Bush campaigns for U.S. president, and another president's relative becomes aNew York resident to run for the U.S. Senate from that state. Government aside, within the past year, movies about World War II returned and were nominated for Academy Awards. Broadway featured revivals including \"TwelfthNight\" and the musicals \"Oklahoma\" and \"Cabaret.\" A new and sleeker VolkswagenBeetle cruises the highways, and the old Rolling Stones are once again on tour! Although musical trends often repeat themselves, noteworthy this year is the come- back of dancing to swing music now played by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy or listening to thesinger from Squirrel Nut Zippers who sounds so hauntingly like the late great BillieHoliday. And even though lawmakers this year are seeing proposals for funding items like windmills that generate electricity instead of pumping water, some things never change.Taxes, rebates, and education issues are still the hot topics in the Legislature. As historycontinues to repeat itself, everything old seems new again. \u2014LeClair Grier Lambert3 February 26, 1999 / SESSION WEEKLY By Jon Fure Some see it as giving power to the people, others see it as a distortion of representativedemocracy, and nobody disputes that it is apolitically charged and controversial issue. The power of initiative and referendum would give citizens direct authority to placeon the ballot proposed changes in state law orin the Minnesota Constitution. Under current law, only the Legislature can change laws or put a constitutional amend-ment question on the ballot, but a bill underconsideration this year could give that rightand others to Minnesota voters through apetition process. Of course, such a change would require that an amendment to the constitution beapproved by voters. In three previous elections \u2014 1913, 1915, and 1980 \u2014 Minnesota voters have failed toamend the constitution to allow for initiativeand referendum. Each time, \"yes\" votes out-numbered \"no\" votes among the people whovoted on the ballot question, but each mea-sure failed because those who did not vote onthe question counted as \"no\" votes. This year's proposal ( HF484 ) would place a constitutional amendment on the ballot forthe 2000 general election that would allowpeople to enact an initiative law, repeal anexisting law, or put constitutional amend-ment questions on future ballots by filing apetition. Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Eden Prairie), the bill's sponsor, said other states have similar initia-tive and referendum laws, and he said thoselaws promote higher voter turnout and in-creased accountability of lawmakers. The bill was approved Feb. 24 by the House Governmental Operations and VeteransAffairs Policy Committee. Under Paulsen's plan, an initiative would go on the ballot if a petition is signed by5 percent of the number of voters who votedfor governor in the previous election in three-quarters of the state's congressional districts.And a constitutional amendment questionwould go on the ballot if a petition is signed by8 percent of those voters. The requirement regarding congressional districts is designed to make it difficult for aninitiative to be placed on the ballot withoutsupport from different areas in the state. Voter turnout is 5 percent to 7 percent Initiative and Referendum . . . Plan would let voters have lawmaking powers higher in states that have initiative and refer-endum, Paulsen said. And lawmakers are heldmore accountable because the laws allow vot-ers to approve measures that have popularsupport but are unpopular with lawmakers,such as term-limit restrictions. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) said he once lived in California and that initiativeand referendum proposals in that state areheavily influenced by organizations that havethe most money. \"The concept sounds wonderful, but I view this as a special interest bill,\" he said. But Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) said many good laws have been passed throughinitiatives and referendums, includingwomen's suffrage and minimum wage laws. \"I look at it as empowering people,\" he said.One common argument against initiative and referendum laws is that many measuresare too complex to be simply stated on anelection ballot and voted on without the ex-tensive information, deliberation, and debatethat help legislators make decisions. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville) said the cost of communicating ideas through massmedia creates a distinct advantage to well-funded causes. Similar concerns were expressed by Jane McWilliams, who testified against the bill onbehalf of the League of Women Voters. Theorganization studied the initiative and refer- endum issue about 15 years ago, she said, andnothing has happened since then to changethe league's position. \"(The League of Women Voters) believes that consideration and enactment of complexpublic policy is most appropriately done inthe legislative arena,\" she said. McWilliams also said the league has con- cerns about the possibility of undue influenceby groups that have a lot of money. But well-funded causes already influence the Legislature, said Rep. Mike Osskopp(R-Lake City). Contributions to the party cau-cuses may influence decisions made by law-makers, Osskopp said. Osskopp also said it seems ironic that the League of Women Voters doesn't support ini-tiative and referendum laws, considering thatSusan B. Anthony traveled the country andgathered signatures that led to women beinggiven the right to vote. McWilliams said she had not considered that argument, but that she considers thatgiving women the right to vote is more basiclaw than those the Legislature deals withtoday. Dane Waters, president and founder of the Initiative & Referendum Institute, said someform of initiative or referendum is available in27 states. The main variations in those laws areA bill advancing in the House calls for voters to decide on a constitutional amendment that would allowinitiative and referendum in Minnesota. Photo illustration by Tom Olmscheid4 SESSION WEEKLY / February 26, 1999in the percentage of voters required to sign a petition, the requirements concerning whatparts of the state those people must live in, andthe amount of time allowed for gatheringsignatures. The amount of money spent on campaigns for initiative or referendum also varies. Wa-ters said one important question to ask is whyit is necessary to spend so much money on thecampaigns. \"The more difficult the process (to get some- thing on the ballot), the more you limit it tothose interests that have a lot of money,\"Waters said. The process as proposed in Paulsen's bill seemed reasonable to several people who tes-tified in support of the bill. Cedric Scofield,chair of the Reform Party's government af-fairs committee, said his party doesn't sup-port the issue blindly, but it does supportpeople's right to petition their government. \"This is a tool for good public policy,\" he said. \"It's just a matter of getting it right.\" Marc Asch, of the government watchdog group Common Cause, said his organizationdoes not have a formal position, but that hebelieves campaign finance laws that apply topolitical candidates should also apply to ballotinitiatives or referendums. He said he has considerable experience gath- ering signatures as a volunteer, and the samechallenges apply whether the cause is well-funded or not. \"You have to be able to deal with a lot of rejection,\" he said. Steven Anderson, spokesman for another watchdog group called Citizens Lobby, said hehas tried to encourage support for this type oflegislation for about four years, but until nowhe has not seen a proposal receive a committeehearing. He said he has consistently heard the same arguments against initiative and referendumlaws, and he feels this bill addresses thosearguments. The bill now moves to the House Crime Prevention Committee. To find out who represents you at the Capitol . . .

Even harder to believe, the plan failed because Minneapolis representatives votedagainst it. The brief debate surfaced in 1857while Minnesotawas still a territoryon its way to state-hood. St. Paulserved as the terri-torial capital, and the city of Minneapolisconsisted of two small towns, St. Anthonyand Minneapolis, on opposite sides of St.Anthony Falls. In 1849, the Territorial Legislature was charged by the U. S. Congress to designatea capital for the new state. Eight years later,when the Legislature finally got around tothe task, St. Peter emerged as the mostpopular site. In February 1857, a bill to move the capital from St. Paul to St. Peter passed theCouncil, the territorial version of the stateSenate. The bill was then sent to the Housefor consideration. Territorial Gov. Willis Gorman, who had actively campaigned for the St. Peter site,vowed to sign the bill after it was approvedby the House. But Rep. William Pitt Murray and others in the St. Paul House delegation didn'twant to see their city lose the capital. OnFeb. 17, 1857, sensing his cause was lost,Murray offered an amendment to the billthat would have deleted \"St. Peter\" andadded \"Nicollet Island, between Minne-apolis and St. Anthony.\" Murray probably made the effort in good faith, figuring that if St. Paul couldn't havethe capital, it should at least remain in theneighborhood. Maybe he thought it would be nice to have a grand Minnesota capitol buildingoverlooking roaring St. Anthony Falls. Whatever the reason, the amendment was rejected on a 19-18 vote. All five St. Paulrepresentatives supported the amendment.The Minneapolis delegation, however,couldn't maintain a united front, and fourmembers voted against the amendment. If those Minneapolis lawmakers had sup- ported it, the bill would have gone back tothe Council with the Nicollet Islandamendment. The original St. Peter bill passed the Council by only one vote, with two Min-neapolis members voting for the bill. If theamended bill had gone back to the Coun-cil, it probably would have passed. And Minneapoliswould have beenMinnesota'scapital city. These votes soon caught theeye of Minnea-politans, who at a local meeting passed a resolution censur-ing their elected officials for voting againstthe amendment and for theSt. Peter bill. While the combined efforts of the Minne- apolis and St. Paul delegations could not killthe plan to move the capital, the actions ofCouncil member Joe Rolette did. As chair of the Council's enrollment committee, Rolette was given the approvedbill on Feb. 27 and decided to play a prankon the supporters of the St. Peter plan. Rolette dropped the bill off at a bank, changed rooms at his hotel, and told themanager to tell everyone he had left town.When word got back to him of all theexcitement he was causing, he decided todo some real damage. He remained inhiding \u2014 with the bill \u2014 until after theCouncil had adjourned, effectively killingthe plan. Gorman signed a copy of the bill that was forwarded to him, but a judge laterruled that bill to be invalid. Rolette, thehero of St. Paul, was given a torchlightparade through the city. There were no parades in Minneapolis.A second attempt to move the capital to Minneapolis occurred in 1881, the yearthe St. Paul statehouse burned to theground. Following the disaster severalMinneapolis lawmakers proposed build-ing the new capitol building in the city'sLoring Park. But the plan fizzled out. Some histori- ans speculate that the proposal failed be-cause it didn't have the support ofthen-Gov. John Pillsbury. Pillsbury wasfrom Minneapolis. Territorial lawmakers briefly considered NicolletIsland in Minneapolis, pictured here in 1857, as a sitefor Minnesota's capital. Photo from Twin Cities/A Pictoral History ; Lucile M. Kane and Alan Ominsky; 1983.5 February 26, 1999 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Feb. 18 - 25, 1999 AGRICULTURE Urban ag school proposed Ask a Twin Cities teen-ager where milk comes from and you're likely to hear the reply,\"from a carton.\" And because many of the state's young people live in urban areas, that lack of appar-ent interest in farming has some educatorsconcerned for the future of Minnesota's agri-culture industry. Their concern has initiated an interest in an urban agricultural high school near the Uni-versity of Minnesota's St. Paul campus and thestate fairgrounds in Falcon Heights. Supporters laid out an informal request Feb. 23 for $350,000 before the House Agri-culture and Rural Development Finance Com-mittee to study all facets of the idea. A bill that would provide funding for the planning phase of the school has been draftedbut has yet to be introduced. Dr. Roland L. Peterson, director of the Di- vision of Agricultural Education at the U of M,said a visit to a similar school in Chicagoconvinced him there should be one inMinnesota. \"What I saw blew me away,\" he told lawmakers. Peterson said he sees firsthand that there's a shortage of workers to fill spots in agriculturalareas of business, education, and production. \"Rural Minnesota can't continue to pro- vide all the workers for agriculture,\" he said. Pat Plonski, executive director of the Min- nesota Agricultural Education LeadershipCouncil, said there are already 18 urban areasin the country that have similar schools. Hesaid there is virtually no opportunity for theroughly 38,000 students in grades seventhrough twelve in Minneapolis and St. Paul toparticipate in agricultural education. \"This needs to change if Minnesota is to continue in its role as one of the greatest andmost diversified agricultural states in this na-tion,\" Plonski said. Supporters are eyeing the long-time head- quarters of Harvest States Cooperative at thecorner of Snelling and Larpenteur avenues inFalcon Heights as the potential site for theschool. The location is immediately adjacentto the fairgrounds and is just east of theU of M's St. Paul campus, which is home to the university's agriculture-related programs. Plonski said organizers are looking at pro- posals to establish either a charter school or amagnet school with its own autonomousboard. The institution would also have anadvisory board, consisting of farmers and oth-ers interested in agriculture. Part of the grant money would be used to conduct a market study to determine exactlyhow many students would be interested inattending the school. However, Plonski said that if Chicago is a good indicator, the challenge will be findingslots in the school for all the students who wishto attend. The school would also contain a museum dedicated to documenting the history of Har-vest States, the history of the cooperative move-ment in Minnesota, and the history ofagriculture in general. The committee may consider a bill on the matter later this session.BONDING New scrutiny for local requests A proposal to send local bonding requests to the Minnesota Department of Finance be-fore they come before the Legislature woninitial approval Feb. 23 in the House CapitalInvestment Committee. Under the bill ( HF726 ), the department would review each request and submit its rec-ommendations to the Legislature for consid-eration in the bonding bill. Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud), sponsor of the bill, said that his proposal would givethe Legislature a tool to better evaluate thelocal bonding requests. \"It is a concern of mine that we are passing appropriations for these local governmentswithout adequately weighing all the facts,\" hesaid. The bill outlines a set of nine criteria that the finance department should use in evaluat- ing each proposal. Those include consider whether each project: has additional local, private, and user financing; helps fulfill an important state mission; is of regional or statewide importance; will not require additional state funding for operation; does not expand the state's role into a new policy area; does not create serious inequities among local jurisdictions; has a credible plan for ongoing maintenance and funding throughout the life of theproject; does not compete with other local facilities; and has resolutions of support from all governing bodies immediately affected by the project. While the bill would encourage local gov- ernments to submit their requests to the de-partment, it also states that neither theLegislature nor the governor would be boundby the recommendations of the departmentand that legislators and the governor couldintroduce projects for consideration that havenot been reviewed by the department. Knoblach's bill, which would apply to re- quests for the 2000 bonding bill, would re-quire local governments to submit theirproposals to the finance department byJune 1, 1999.Dr. Roland L. Peterson, director of the Division ofAgricultural Education at the University ofMinnesota, speaks in favor of a proposal to fundan urban agriculture high school on the statefairgrounds in Falcon Heights.6 SESSION WEEKLY / February 26, 1999David Strom, from the Taxpayers League of Minnesota, testified in support of the bill. Hesaid that last year's $1 billion bonding lawshows that funding for local projects is out ofcontrol. \"This is a process that is badly in need of reform,\" he said. Andy Kirn, from the Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, also testified in support of thebill. He said that the people of Minnesotavoted against \"politics as usual\" in the 1998elections. \"Nothing represents politics as usual in this state more than the process for determiningbonding proposals,\" he said. But some legislators expressed concern that Knoblach's bill would take power away fromthe Legislature. Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls) said this bill would move power from the legisla-tive branch to the executive branch. He saidthe proposal would put so-called \"politics asusual\" in the hands of bureaucrats who are notaccountable to voters. Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) said she is also concerned about the bill. Shesaid it amounts to the committee giving up itspower. \"I just don't think we're ready for this yet,\" she said. \"I think we should keep the power inthe elected officials on this committee.\" The bill now goes to the House Local Gov- ernment and Metropolitan AffairsCommittee. CRIME Last word for prosecutors Following two days of arguments by pros- ecutors and public defenders, a bill that wouldgive prosecutors the last word in criminalcourts appears to be headed to trial on theHouse floor. Under current law, the prosecutor goes first in final arguments and is followed by thedefense attorney. The law allows the judge togive the prosecutor a response to the defense'sfinal arguments only to address misstatementsof fact or law, or if the defense's argument isprejudicial or inflammatory. The bill ( HF197 ), sponsored by Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan), would guar-antee the prosecutors a right to respond fol-lowing the defense's final arguments. Theresponse could only address issues brought upby the defense's argument. The bill was approved Feb. 20 by the House Crime Prevention Committee, following tes-timony that day and on Feb. 16.Pawlenty said it is only fair that prosecutors who have the heavy burden of proving the casebe allowed to go last. He said that Minnesotais the only criminal system in the nation thatallows the defense to go last. \"We should not have a Minnesota-unique style of justice when it comes to criminaljustice,\" he said. Prosecutors said that current law allowing a response to the defense's argument is awk-ward for both prosecutors and judges. Paul Scoggins, assistant county attorney for Hennepin County, said that when prosecu-tors can only address misstatements of fact orlaw, juries might assume that the prosecutoragrees with the rest of the defense attorney'sarguments. He also said that it sends a signal to the jury that something is not routine, and that reflectsbadly on the prosecutor. \"All of a sudden the prosecutor is popping back up like a bad piece of cork,\" he said. John Stanoch, former Hennepin County judge and current lawyer with the attorneygeneral's office, said judges fear that givingprosecutors a response to the defense's argu-ments opens up a greater possibility that thecase can be appealed. \"You are very hesitant in the ninth inning to say, 'I'm going to give you a chance to respondto the rebuttal,'\" he said. Laurie Beyer-Kropuenske, acting director of the Minnesota Center for Crime VictimServices, also testified in support of the bill.She said that sometimes the last thing thatvictims' families hear in the courtroom aredisparaging remarks from the defense aboutthe victim. She said that while the entire trial is about searching for the truth, final arguments aresometimes very different. \"Sometimes, it is just slinging the mud to see how much of it sticks,\" she said. State Public Defender John Stuart testified against the bill. He said that defense attorneysdon't attack victims because that reflects badlyon their clients, and that Minnesota juries aresmart enough not to reward that behavior. \"They're not going to give the advantage to a client of a lawyer who does that,\" he said. Stuart said Minnesota established its crimi- nal justice process 124 years ago, and that ithas worked well since then. \"Nothing that I've seen or heard has con- vinced me that this was a mistake,\" he said. William McGee, chief public defender for Hennepin County, also spoke against the bill.He said that the defense attorney should golast because his or her client risks \"the ulti-mate loss of his liberty.\" He said the existingsystem is working well.\"As my father always said, and as we've all heard before, if it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" hesaid. Pawlenty's bill now goes to the House floor. Concealed handgun debate Do more permissive concealed handgun laws reduce crime? Two nationally recognized researchers pre- sented their views on that issue to lawmakersbefore a joint meeting of the House and SenateCrime Prevention committees Feb. 21. Professor John Lott of the University of Chicago and Professor Jens Ludwig ofGeorgetown University have both done ex-tensive research on the issue. And they havecome to very different conclusions. Lott studied county crime data from all 50 states between 1977 and 1992. He found thatmore permissive concealed handgun laws de-ter violent crime such as assault, murder, andrape. Specifically, Lott found that on average states that passed the permissive laws saw an8.5 percent reduction in murders, a 5 percentreduction in rapes, and a 7 percent reductionin aggravated assaults. \"The passage of concealed handgun laws saves many more lives than it loses,\" he toldlawmakers. Lott, however, found increases in crimes where the offender does not confront the vic-tim, such as auto theft. And he found thatviolent crime rates increased in border areasof states that enacted permissive laws. He said that these results show that the laws force criminals to alter their behavior awayfrom violent acts in areas that have passedthese laws. Lott said that in every state that considered these laws opponents argued that people car-rying concealed handguns would misuse theweapons. He said that that almost neverhappens. \"The people who are willing to go through the permitting process are almost always law-abiding citizens,\" he said. Lott said that his study is the most compre- hensive study that has been done on this issueso far. He said follow-up studies have con-firmed his results. \"Nobody has found significant evidence of a cost associated with these laws, and mosthave found a benefit,\" he said. Ludwig studied murder rates in one state between 1982 and 1991. He found that norelationship exists between the concealedhandgun laws and the murder rate. He disagreed with Lott's findings about these laws.7 February 26, 1999 / SESSION WEEKLY\"We can't be sure that they cause crime rates to go down,\" he said. \"And they're atleast as likely to go up.\" Ludwig said that these laws may have nega- tive consequences. \"It is important to realize that there are other possibilities, that the passage of theselaws may create an undesirable change in thebehavior of criminals,\" he said. For example, criminals may be more likely to use deadly force when committing crimesto make sure that they don't have to deal withan armed victim, he said. John Lott, professor of economics at the University of Chicago, uses a graph to illustrate the merits ofpermissive concealed handgun laws. Jens Ludwig, seated , assistant professor of public policy at Georgetown University, took the other side of the debate during a Feb. 20 hearing on the matter. EDUCATIONSCHOOL Schools need lunch money A bill that would increase the state's share of school lunch funding and extend school break-fast programs was considered Feb. 24 by theHouse K-12 Education Finance Committee. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie), would increase state fund-ing for lunches from 6.5 cents to 10 cents perlunch. The state has paid school districts at the rate of 6.5 cents per lunch since 1991, but schoolofficials say that amount doesn't go nearly asfar today as it did eight years ago. Kielkuckisaid districts are having to dip into their gen-eral fund money to keep up with rising foodand labor costs. Kielkucki's bill ( HF720 ) would also pro- vide funding to extend the state's current tar-geted breakfast program. That programprovides free breakfasts for all students atcertain elementary schools where more than 33 percent of the students qualify for free orreduced-price lunches. The program began in1994 as a pilot project in six elementary schoolsand was expanded in 1997 to include 41 schoolsthroughout the state. Oak Grove Elementary School in Bloomington has participated in the program Al Bushman, a third-grade teacher at LincolnCenter Elementary School in South St. Paul,vouches for the importance of breakfast forschoolchildren during testimony on a bill thatwould increase funding for school food programs.since 1994, and Principal Sherre Walsted toldlawmakers she has seen results including in-creased attendance, higher test scores, andfewer discipline problems. \"Having a full stomach makes all the differ- ence in kids and how they learn,\" she said. She noted that although schools need to qualify for the program by having one-third oftheir students eligible for the free or reduced-price lunches, family economics aren't theonly reason children miss breakfast. \"Tight morning schedules can mean kids are either skipping breakfast or making theirown,\" she said. \"And on their own, they'llprobably reach for the sugar, which only lastsan hour. At school they're getting protein,fats, everything they need.\" A third provision in Kielkucki's bill aims to ensure that all students have access to a healthybreakfast by extending current state fundingfor school breakfast programs. Although thetargeted breakfast program is only available tocertain elementary schools, Kielkucki said allpublic schools would benefit from breakfastfunding, which enables schools to offer inex-pensive, nutritious meals to all students. Lawmakers agreed that breakfast is an es- sential meal for children. Rep. Alice Johnson(DFL-Spring Lake Park) said she considersbreakfast funding a \"no-brainer.\" \"It's the cheapest way to increase learning and raise test scores,\" she said. But Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) ques- tioned the need for state funding. \"I don't think anybody questions the value of a good breakfast for children,\" he said. \"Thequestion comes in what the role the govern-ment should play in feeding everyone'schildren.\" The bill would provide $11.6 million for school lunches in fiscal year 2000, and nearly$12 million for lunches in 2001. It would alsoprovide $3.7 million for targeted breakfastgrants and $456,000 in school breakfast fund-ing for each year of the 2000-01 biennium. The committee took no action on the bill but may include it in this year's omnibus K-12finance bill. Districts facing tuition bills Beginning this May, school districts whose students end up having to take remedialcourses in reading, writing, or math duringtheir freshman year of college can be chargedtuition by the post-secondary institution. But a bill sponsored by Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson) would change that. The House Education Policy committee approved the bill ( HF473 ) Feb. 23. Harder's proposal bill would repeal a 19978 SESSION WEEKLY / February 26, 1999 law that established the policy. The law was intended as diploma warranty coverage forhigh school graduates. But Harder said some of her constituents made her aware of certain examples in whichthe law could conceivably penalize a schooldistrict that acted in good faith. For instance, students can refuse to repeat a grade even if a school district recommendsthey do so. Under the law, the district wouldhave to pay tuition for any remedial instruc-tion such a student might need in college. In addition, a district would be charged for remedial college courses for students whomoved into the district near the end of theirhigh school careers. Bob Meeks, a lobbyist for the Minnesota School Board Association, told committeemembers the law sends the wrong message tostudents and school districts. \"This whole thing just deserves a lot more consideration than it received (in 1997),\" hesaid. HF473 moves to the House K-12 Education Finance Committee. School standards bill stalls A plan to set statewide expectation levels for school districts met a setback Feb. 25 in theHouse Education Policy Committee. Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud) withdrew his bill ( HF320 ) after two days of debate re- vealed that lawmakers want more time to con-sider the issue. Setting statewide standards for school dis- tricts has been a subject of contentious delib-erations at the Capitol for many years. Lastyear, Opatz sponsored a similar bill that pro-posed state monitoring of schools and laid outa plan for the state to take over failing schools.That measure failed after encountering oppo-sition from teachers, school districts, andlawmakers. This year, however, Opatz's bill contains no plans for state takeovers. His bill simply pro-poses a measuring system based on standard-ized test scores. It would also recognize factors that could cause schools to tend to have low overall scores.Those factors include having high percentagesof students on free or reduced-price lunchprograms, special education students, or stu-dents who participate in English-as-a-second-language programs. Those schools would beallowed extra time to bring up low scores. Officials from Education Minnesota \u2014 the state's major teachers union \u2014 told the com-mittee they do not support the plan becausethe dust has not yet settled on the state'sGraduation Standards.But others testified in support of the bill, saying a system of accountability needs to bein place so that schools having trouble canhave the opportunity to improve and helpstudents who fall behind. \"Your kids and mine are hanging in the balance,\" said Yusef Mgeni, president of theUrban Coalition. \"We don't have the luxuryof failure.\" Although the bill is not currently under consideration, the issue may be revived beforelawmakers put together this year's omnibusK-12 education bill.

The bill ( HF122 ), sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), would put thequestion on the ballot in the 2000 generalelection. Current state law requires Minnesotans to be 21 or older to seek any state or local officeexcept governor. Gubernatorial candidatesmust be age 25 or older. The bill would not change the age require- ment for governor, but it would reduce theminimum age for candidates for other consti-tutional offices and for legislative, municipal,and school board openings.Some lawmakers questioned whether an 18-year-old should be allowed to run for schoolboard. Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie)said he believes an 18-year-old high schoolstudent serving on a school board could be a\"huge conflict of interest.\" A student wouldconceivably be participating in decisions suchas discipline policies for fellow students, hir-ing and firing of teachers, and salarynegotiations. But Rukavina said voters would be able to decide if a situation presents such a conflict.He added that the first elected office he heldwas as a school board member in Virginiawhen he was 21. Minimum age requirements for holding public office vary in other states. In 17 states,18-year-olds can run for legislative seats.Twenty-five states have no minimum age re-quirement for attorney general or secretary ofstate races. \"I see this as an excellent way of engaging this great group of voters,\" said Rep. Ann H.Rest (DFL-New Hope). The bill now moves to the full Governmental Operations and Veterans Affairs Committee. Boundary Waters controversy A resolution that would ask President Clinton and Congress to intervene in the on-going battle between Minnesota and the fed-eral government over land rights in theBoundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness9 February 26, 1999 / SESSION WEEKLYGAME & FISH(BWCAW) is one step closer to landing on desks in Washington, D.C. The BWCAW consists of just more than 1 million acres of federally protected landwithin the Superior National Forest in north-eastern Minnesota. Most of the land is ownedby the federal government and managed bythe U.S. Forest Service, but the state still ownsroughly 100,000 acres of land within thewilderness preserve. The House Environment and Natural Re- sources Policy Committee approved a resolu-tion Feb. 23 that would request a federal lawauthorizing an exchange of state-owned landwithin the BWCAW for federal land outsidethe preserve but within the Superior NationalForest. The proposal ( HF426 ), sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), notes thatMinnesota is unable to earn any money fromleases, sales, or natural resource managementof the state-owned land within the BWCAWbecause access is restricted. \"We are locked out of 100,000 acres,\" said Rep. Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook). \"The federalgovernment has essentially stolen this landfrom us.\" Recently, the state of Utah successfully ne- gotiated a similar land-for-land and cash ex-change with the federal government, Rukavinatold the committee. Patty Burke, legislative director for the Min- nesota Department of Natural Resources, saidher agency supports the intent of the resolu-tion. The problem, Burke said, is getting theU.S. Forest Service and the federal govern-ment to the negotiating table. \"We are looking for a congressional solu- tion because the forest service has no reason tonegotiate,\" Rukavina said. The resolution is headed for a vote on the House floor. Student voters HEALTHKatie Cowhey, a sophomore at Prior Lake Senior High School, votes in a mock election on a billthat would limit the rights of 16- and 17-year-olds to refuse chemical dependency treatment.Cowhey participated in the Minnesota Youth Legislative Summit on Feb. 25. Shooting deer in a barrel? A bill permitting the taking of farmed deer and elk on licensed shooting preserves wasapproved Feb. 24 by the House AgriculturePolicy Committee. Farmed cervidae \u2014 a family of animals including deer, elk, and others \u2014 were grantedstatus as agricultural products in 1993. Thebill ( HF710 ) would expand permitted uses of the farmed animals to include stocking themon licensed shooting preserves. Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), the bill's sponsor, said he was not a supporter of theidea when it was first broached because itseemed to be a hunting issue. However, hesaid he now sees it as a value-added practice for farmers who raise elk and deer. \"How an animal ends up in your freezer shouldn't matter,\" Holsten told thecommittee. The bill would allow the establishment of 10 preserves ranging from 240 to 960 acres. Allwild deer would have to be removed from anarea before a preserve would be created. The measure would also establish a season for harvesting animals, from Aug. 15 to March31. No hunting license would be required inthe preserves, but weapons used would haveto comply with those authorized to take wilddeer and elk in the same region. Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison), who is sponsoring an identical bill ( HF715 ), said he supports the idea because he has constitu-ents who raise elk who have had to refusepeople the opportunity to hunt because thelaw does not allow it. He said the preserves would be ideal for the elderly, people who have never shot an elk, ordisabled hunters. Several speakers fired rounds at Holsten's bill. \"It's like shooting fish in a barrel,\" said Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel), who also had questionsabout whether the license fees proposed forthe preserves would be enough to cover theDepartment of Agriculture's costs. Other concerns were raised over the per- ception the preserves would create. To clarify that what is being proposed is not technically hunting, Rep. Leslie Schumacher(DFL-Princeton) offered, and the committeeaccepted, an amendment to strike any men-tion of \"hunt\" or \"hunting\" from the bill.That wasn't enough to stop opposition from Tom Meyers, representing Minnesota Con-servation Federation. \"It will still be perceived as hunting by the nonhunting public,\" Meyers said. \"It shouldn'tmatter, but it does. The animal rights peopleare going to attack this, and the hunters willtake the flak.\" Holsten's bill moves to the House Govern- mental Operations and Veterans Affairs PolicyCommittee. Encouraging organ donation Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park) and Norma Bradow of Fergus Falls haveformed a close bond in recent months. Be-cause of the gift of a liver from Bradow's latehusband, Luther is alive today. The two appeared together Feb. 19 before the House Health and Human Services Fi-nance Committee. On the agenda was a bill(HF127 ), which is sponsored by Luther, to appropriate $2 million over the next bien-nium to begin the proposed \"Minnesota do-nor decision campaign.\" The campaign would include research and public opinion surveys to assess attitudes to-ward organ, tissue, and eye donations and toevaluate public awareness efforts. It wouldalso include advertising and public educationprograms aimed at raising awareness aboutorgan donation and encouraging people tobecome donors. The largest portion of the proposed funding10 SESSION WEEKLY / February 26, 1999 \u2014 about $800,000 \u2014 would be spent on me- dia activities, including television and radiocommercials. Luther told the committee there is a critical shortage of donors and that across the country10 people die each day waiting for transplants. More than 1,300 Minnesotans currently await a lifesaving organ transplant. The wait-ing list grows 12 to 15 percent annually, butthe number of donors remains essentiallyunchanged. Susan Gunderson, executive director of LifeSource, a regional organ donation coordi-nation organization, said most Minnesotanssupport organ donation, but they simply don'tknow how to assure that they become donors. Under the bill, LifeSource is the lone entity that would qualify for the one-time statefunding. Gunderson said she's most excited about creating a mobile classroom that would tourthe state and provide accurate information onorgan donation in an interactive format. \"There's a lot of misinformation out there,\" Gunderson said, noting that even the medicalprofession isn't well-versed on the topic. She said one of the keys to assuring that your organs are donated is to tell your familywhen you're healthy so your wishes are well-known. In emotional testimony, Bradow told the committee how she and her husband had dis-cussed the matter in the 1970s, never thinkingthe opportunity to be an organ donor wouldarise as soon as it did. Gary Bradow was a victim of a stroke in 1998 at age 56. His wife said he had beenextremely healthy until then, making him anideal candidate for organ donation.Rep. Darlene Luther, right , consoles Norma Bradow, Fergus Falls, who tells lawmakers how her husband, Gary, felt it important to be able to donate his organs. Luther said it was Gary's liver that saved her lifewhen she had a liver transplant in 1998. Bradow testified before a House committee Feb. 19 in favor ofa bill that would fund a campaign to boost organ donation. The committee took no action on the mat- ter but will consider the bill for inclusion inthis year's omnibus health and human ser-vices funding bill. Bed rail bill passed The House passed a bill Feb. 23 that would give nursing home patients and their familiesgreater input on whether side rails can legallybe used on beds in nursing facilities. The votewas 132-0. \"This is a bill about grandpas and grand- mas, moms and dads and loved ones,\" said thebill's sponsor, Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Roches-ter). \"It's about real seniors suffering real fear.\" In 1998, the Minnesota Department of Health began fining nursing homes that theybelieved were improperly using restraints. Afederal law severely restricts the legal use ofbed rails and other restraints. Proponents of limiting rail use said patients could injure or even kill themselves if theybecame entangled in the restraints, and thestate health department began requiring aphysician's prescription to use rails. Soon many nursing homes stopped using bed rails, but family members complainedthat they were more concerned for the safetyof patients without rails. Bradley's bill ( HF40 ) would include a patient's physical safety as a medical condi-tion sufficient to warrant a prescription forbed rails. The bill moves to the Senate.Alternative medicine plan If your physician offers you herbal medi- cine, he or she can be accused of practicingoutside \"acceptable and prevailing\" conven-tional standards of care. And if an unlicensed herbalist offers you herbal medicine, he or she can be prosecutedfor \"practicing medicine without a license.\" So just how do you get herbal medicine, if that's your preferred method of treatment?It's not easy in Minnesota. A bill ( HF537 ) debated by the House Health and Human Services Policy CommitteeFeb. 25 would change that. The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault), would allow comple-mentary and alternative health care to be prac-ticed if a patient is informed about the benefitsand potential harm from the treatment. Thebill also contains examples of forms whichpatients would be required to read and sign. The bill covers such practices as homeopa- thy, naturopathy, massage therapy and bodywork, holistic and integrative therapies, andculturally traditional healing practices, amongothers. Another section of the bill would address consumer complaints against licensed andunlicensed practitioners, but would not changecriminal laws for fraud or for personal injurycivil actions. In some cases, Boudreau said, legal actions have been taken against unlicensed providersof alternative medical services, even thoughthere was no consumer harmed and the re-cipient of the care was pleased. Boudreau told the committee her proposal was not a licensing initiative, but more of aderegulatory approach. \"It updates the law so it is in sync with present health care reality,\" she added. Studies show 70 percent of all Americans and 47 percent of all physicians are using atleast one form of complementary or alterna-tive methods for their personal health care. The bill is slated to come before a Health Care Directive Subcommittee of the full healthand human services policy committee. Changes for ambulance services Two bills designed to address the changing face of ambulance services in Minnesota wereapproved Feb. 23 by the House Health andHuman Services Policy Committee. The first bill ( HF302 ) would allow ambu- lance services to participate in shared servicepurchasing arrangements for supplies, mate-rials, and equipment. The second ( HF463 ) would place ambu-11 February 26, 1999 / SESSION WEEKLYHIGHER EDUCATIONlance providers under peer review protection. Both bills are sponsored by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston). Davids told the committee that ambulance services need more flexibility in approachingpurchases, particularly of expensive items suchas vehicles. He said pending changes in theway federal programs reimburse ambulanceservices may leave services with less money. Existing law requires government-owned ambulance services to take bids on equipmentpurchases over $25,000. HF302 would allow co-ops to purchase ambulances, the most costlyexpenditure an ambulance provider faces. Davids said one small ambulance service buying one new vehicle every five years doesn'thave as much bargaining power as a group ofservices purchasing a fleet. Davids said HF463 aims to shield ambu- lance providers in certain legal situations. Without peer review protection, he said, any in-house discussion of how cases werehandled is public record and subject todiscovery, should a legal challenge arise. O.J. Doyle, an emergency medical services consultant from Apple Valley, said the lack ofprotection has made ambulance service medi-cal directors \u2014 required to be physicians \u2014skittish about the liability issue. He said many of them are volunteers and the ambulance services cannot exist withoutthem. Both bills move to the House floor. Caring for spouses The House passed a bill ( HF60 ) Feb. 23 that would allow certain qualified medical profes-sionals to be paid to care for their spouses. Thevote was 129-3. The measure would apply only to licensed nurses employed by Medicare-certified homehealth agencies. Those eligible could be paidto care for a disabled spouse who receivesgovernment-financed home health care. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin), sponsor of the bill, said that under existing law paymentis not possible in certain instances, and thathas caused a hardship for a family in hisdistrict. The bill moves to the Senate.Taylor-funded plan approved The House Higher Education Finance Com- mittee approved a bill Feb. 22 that wouldauthorize construction of the Taylor Center, aprivately-funded building on the campus ofMinnesota State University, Mankato. The bill ( HF492 ) is sponsored by Rep. John Dorn (DFL-Mankato). Because the campus is part of the Minne- sota State Colleges and Universities system,and therefore a state entity, the Legislature isrequired to approve the new building'sconstruction. Formerly known as Mankato State Univer- sity, the school raised $16.5 million in privatedonations to pay for the center. It is named inhonor of alumnus Glen Taylor, chief execu-tive officer and chair of the Taylor Corpora-tion and owner of the MinnesotaTimberwolves basketball team. Taylor donated $9.2 million toward the project, which consists of a 5,000-seat arena,athletic programs and facilities, and a studentwelcome center. Minnesota State University President Richard Rush estimated that the center's con-struction will take about 18 months and shouldbe completed by the end of 2000 or early 2001. Rush said the Taylor Center will serve as a new entrance to campus because it will link amajor road with the campus. \"We think it will be a showcase not only for MSU, but also for the entire region,\" Rushsaid. HF492 moves to the House Capital Invest- ment Committee. HUMAN SERVICES Where to find information Chief Clerk's Office 211 State Capitol (651) 296-2314 The Chief Clerk's Office provides copies of bills at no charge, all agendas for House ses-sions, and the Journal of the House.Lawmakers seek hard numbers Officials from the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system (MnSCU) got off to asomewhat rocky start with legislators during abudget presentation before the House HigherEducation Finance Committee. A team of MnSCU officials, led by Chancellor Morrie Anderson, appeared be-fore the committee Feb. 24 to detail a requestfor a $230.6 million increase over the system'sbiennial budget. Anderson said the proposal targets several key areas for improvement, including studentsuccess, technology training, faculty salaries,and partnerships linking students andworkforce development in high-demandindustries. The 53-campus system consists of 36 state universities, community colleges, and techni-cal colleges. MnSCU graduates comprise about20 percent of Minnesota's workforce, and the schools offer more than 3,500 educationalprograms. Much of the presentation focused on the institution's goals and past accomplishments,which some lawmakers said are difficult tolink directly with the budget issues. Many legislators said they wanted a more in-depth presentation listing dollar amountsalong with campus and administrative costs. Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona) grilled Anderson on which specific programs wouldbenefit from state money, but said he was notreceiving satisfactory answers. \"Behind that screen, there's nothing,\" he said. \"Today from MnSCU, we have had nosubstantive answer to any question we'veasked.\" Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), the committee chair, also showed her frustration. \"We are trying to look at numbers,\" she said. \"And you have given us the reasons forand the overall picture of what you're trying todo. Now, please attach it to some numbers.\" In his biennial budget, Gov. Jesse Ventura has recommended funding $121.3 million ofMnSCU's request, or about 53 percent. MnSCU officials will return to the commit- tee Feb. 26 to continue their budgetpresentation. Waiting lists for services Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester) knows first-hand the challenges faced by those withdevelopmental disabilities and their caregivers. He told the House Health and Human Ser- vices Policy Committee Feb. 23 that he has abrother who is developmentally disabled. Foryears, the brother lived with his parents, but ashis parents grew older, the arrangement neededto be changed. Bradley said when it came time to find a new place for his brother to live, he encountered aroadblock that thousands are facing across thestate \u2014 a waiting list caused by a criticalshortage of funds to provide support services. Bradley is sponsoring a bill ( HF345 ), which was approved by the committee, that wouldinfuse state money into programs to provideservices such as in-home support services,respite care, housing modifications, residen-tial services, employment services, and cashgrants. Those services are often called \"waivered\" services because they are provided outside oftraditional programs funded by the federalgovernment. About 4,700 Minnesotans arebelieved to be waiting for help.12 SESSION WEEKLY / February 26, 1999The list developed over the past several decades as the state concentrated ondownsizing regional treatment centers, ac-cording to Robert Brick, executive director ofArc Minnesota, an advocacy group for peoplewith developmental disabilities. Brick told the committee that it is now time to concentrate on those families who havesacrificed and cared for loved ones at home. He said that when funding is not available for developmentally disabled individuals toreceive services, counties are often forced touse family foster care, funded by local prop-erty taxes. The committee also heard testimony from parents who said they waited as long as14 years to find homes for their disabled chil-dren. Parents also expressed concerns aboutwhat would happen as they age and becomeless able to provide care themselves. Cindy Johnson of St. Paul said her daugh- ter, Jenna, has been on a waiting list for11 years. \"I was told unless our family had a crisis, such that we throw Jenna out so she becomeshomeless, or I died, there was little hope ofgetting a waiver to meet her needs,\" Johnsontestified. \"I refuse to do either of theseoptions.\" Johnson has not been able to work for many years, thereby sacrificing her shot at a retire-ment income, Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) pointed out. While no one on the committee disputed the need to fund the programs addressed inthe bill, concerns over how much money wouldCertifying interpreters If you're deaf or can't speak or understand English, having confidence in the person in-terpreting for you is essential. Assuring the competence of those inter- preters is the aim of two bills consideredFeb. 25 by the House Health and HumanServices Policy Committee. The first bill ( HF206 ) would require certifi- cation and registration for those who provideAmerican Sign Language interpretation. Spon-sored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul),the proposal would establish standards andencourage the Minnesota State Colleges andUnversities System to establish programs tohelp train interpreters. The bill would also provide $75,000 to es- tablish mentorship programs to assist newgraduates of interpreter training programs inobtaining certification. Entenza said incapable interpreters cause hardships for the hearing impaired, and insome instances, problems with interpreterscan put the deaf or hearing impaired at risk. The second bill ( HF568 ) would provide for voluntary licensing of spoken languageinterpreters. Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), who is spon- soring the proposal, said many new immi-grants coming to Minnesota require socialservices and access to other programs to helpthem succeed. Interpretation services are of-ten taken where and when they can be foundwith little regard to quality. Clark pointed out that the courts require certification for spoken language interpretersand said it would be a good idea to begin witha voluntary program for other endeavors.Making it voluntary would help begin theassessment process to determine the languages,level of skill, and level of education that shouldbe required for interpreters. The bill would also establish a pilot training program for interpreters to be operated by theUniversity of Minnesota and the Minnesota INSURANCEDorothy Ecklund of Moorhead speaks in supportof a bill that would provide more state money tohelp people with developmental disabilities.Ecklund testified Feb. 23 before the House Health& Human Services Policy Committee.be needed and how it could be used to leveragefederal dollars were expressed. Bradley's bill would phase in funding over two biennia, and he suggested $30 millionwould be needed. However, officials from the Minnesota De- partment of Human Services have said thecost would be closer to $140 million andpointed out that only a small portion is cov-ered in Gov. Jesse Ventura's proposed budget. Further discussion of financial details of the bill are expected when it reaches its next stop,the House Health and Human ServicesFinance Committee.State Colleges and Universities. Special em- phasis in the area of medical interpreting wouldbe offered. Rep. Thomas Huntley (DFL-Duluth) said that in one recent week Hennepin CountyMedical Center reported needing translationsfor 50 different languages. Rep. Mary Ellen Otremba (DFL-Long Prairie) said even in rural Minnesota the questfor interpreters had reached feverish pitch.She said her community has established a taskforce to help find interpreters. Another report referenced by Clark reveals that as many as 200,000 Minnesotans do notspeak English well enough to communicate ina medical emergency. Both bills are slated to receive a second hearing before a Health Care Directive Sub-committee of the full policy committee. Regulating payment deals People who receive structured settlement payments from an insurance company wouldbe guaranteed legal and financial advice be-fore selling the rights to those payments undera bill approved Feb. 23 by the House Com-merce Committee. The bill ( HF478 ) would require companies that buy a person's rights to payments due asa result of a personal injury or workers' com-pensation claim to disclose detailed financialinformation about the transaction. Rep. BillHaas (R-Champlin), sponsor of the bill, saidthose transactions, known as \"factoring trans-actions,\" are not currently regulated. Under the bill, the company buying the rights to the payments would have to disclosehow the present value of the cash compares tothe money the claimant is scheduled to receiveover time. The transaction could be done only if the court determines it to be necessary for theclaimant to avoid an \"imminent financial hard-ship\" and it would not cause undue financialhardship in the future. The bill would require a factoring transac- tion to be approved by a court, and all of theinterested parties would have to approve. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) said if the insurance company is considered an \"inter-ested party,\" then the bill seems to allow theinsurance company to veto any factoringtransaction. Haas said the court would have the final authority, not the insurance company. But theinsurance company's role would be to makesure all of the interested parties are notified.Beneficiaries of the structured settlement are13 February 26, 1999 / SESSION WEEKLYnot limited to the claimant, Haas said. Chil- dren, a former spouse, or an estate could all beinvolved, he said. The bill now moves to the House Judiciary Finance Committee. LAWLOCAL GOVERNMENT House passes malpractice bill A bill that seeks to give victims of medical malpractice their day in court was approvedFeb. 23 by the full House. The vote was 130-2. Current law requires that lawsuits dealing with medical malpractice must be initiatedwithin two years of the occurrence of themalpractice. The bill ( HF56 ) would extend the time allowed to file a medical malpracticecase, allowing up to four years for a victim totake legal action. \"This bill is about real people,\" said Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins). \"It's aboutpeople who needed the law to change so theycould see some justice. It's about truth andfairness.\" Bill sponsor Rep. Henry Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) said his plan would not make iteasier for a plaintiff to win a medical malprac-tice suit. It would simply give people a reason-able amount of time to discover thatmalpractice has occurred and to file a case, hesaid. Initially, Van Dellen's bill would have set the deadline to file a case at two years from thediscovery of the malpractice, not from theoccurrence of the malpractice as with the cur-rent law. The bill would have placed a six-yearlimit from the occurrence of the malpractice. But when the bill was first discussed by the House Civil Law Committee in early Febru-ary, Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) offered,and the committee accepted, a compromiseamendment that would simply extend thecurrent two-year limit to four years. Several medical organizations that initially opposed the bill said that they could live withthe compromise. Bishop said Van Dellen's bill would be \"a major advance in law for medical malprac-tice.\" Last year, two bills to extend the malprac- tice deadline were approved by the HouseJudiciary Committee, but both stalled beforereaching the House floor. Van Dellen andFolliard were at the forefront of last year'sefforts. Van Dellen's bill now waits for action by the Senate.Y2K bill advances A bill that aims to stomp on problems stem- ming from the so-called Y2K bug was ap-proved Feb. 24 by the House Civil LawCommittee. The bill ( HF73 ) provides several measures to address potential problems that may arisewhen computers make the switch from 1999to 2000. Before approving the bill, the committee added an amendment that seeks to address thepossible effects the Y2K bug may have on thestate's courts. The amendment, offered by Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), would create aspecial panel of district court judges to hear allY2K court cases, and it would place limits onhow those cases could proceed. Bishop said that the courts should be given an opportunity to respond to the large num-ber of cases that may result from the Y2Kproblem. Initially, Bishop's amendment would have allowed courts to award only damages stem-ming from economic loss. Plaintiffs wouldnot have been allowed to collect punitive dam-ages. But Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) said that those provisions madeBishop's amendment a \"whopper,\" and thatthe amendment would have greatly expandedthe original bill. Responding to Carruthers concerns, Bishop removed those sections from his amendment. \"I don't want to have any whopper prob- lems in this amendment,\" he said. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland), would protect some types ofY2K information from civil liability and wouldauthorize the governor to declare a state ofemergency based on problems associated withthe glitch. The measure would also allow cities to in- cur debt for spending to address year 2000problems without voter approval, and it wouldappropriate money for a local governmentY2K loan fund. The Y2K bug is a problem that may occur in many computers that were not programmedto handle the switch to the year 2000. Manyolder programs use only the last two digits totrack the year, and at the end of 1999, thoseprograms will roll to 00. That means somecomputers will think it's 1900, which couldcause major technical malfunctions and cre-ate troubles in industries such as airline travel,banking, and utilities. The bill, initially rejected Feb. 8 by the House Local Government and Metropolitan AffairsCommittee, was later resurrected by that com-mittee and approved Feb. 18.It now goes to the House Governmental Operations and Veterans Affairs PolicyCommittee. Funds for storm recovery When a natural disaster strikes a commu- nity, help often pours in from everywhere.Other cities send crews, other agencies helpout where they can, and volunteers assist withcleanup. But eventually someone has to pay the bill. If a federal disaster has been declared, most ofthe costs are reimbursed from the federal gov-ernment. But if there's no federal disasterdeclaration, a storm or similar event can bedevastating to city or county coffers. Easing that burden is the aim of a bill (HF294 ) approved Feb. 22 by the House Local Government and Metropolitan AffairsCommittee. The proposal calls for the establishment of a state aid fund to which cities could apply forhelp once unreimbursed costs exceed 5 per-cent of their gross tax levy. Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Vadnais Heights), who is sponsoring the bill, said many Minne-sota cities experienced damage from stormsduring the summer of 1998. And while muchof the damage was paid for through federalreimbursement, the point was made clear thatthe state doesn't have a streamlined methodfor lending assistance. \"It's a safety net for cities,\" said Broecker, former city councilor in Vadnais Heights. Shoreview Mayor Sandy Martin said a tor- nado that swept through her communitybrought with it a $600,000 cleanup bill. Hadthe city been forced to bear the entire cost, itwould have had to raise its tax levy an addi-tional 7 percent, a figure she said would havebeen devastating to the community. In Shoreview, expenditures for straight-time personnel costs and a reforestation programwere not covered by the federal government.The city lost nearly 5,000 trees. \"This would be a way for the state to be more proactive in assisting with disasters,\"Martin told the committee. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) ques- tioned the need for such a program, notingthat when catastrophies have occurred in thepast, the Legislature has been more than will-ing to help. Bill proponents told Rukavina that not all disasters happen when the Legislature is meet-ing. If a disaster occurs in September, forinstance, a political subdivision is often forced14 SESSION WEEKLY / February 26, 1999to wait until the following spring for reim- bursement. Broecker's bill would provide $10 million to establish the aid program. The bill moves to the House Judiciary Finance Committee.

The girls, part of a group from the Pratt Community Center in Minneapolis, participated in the Women Cometo the Capitol Day, where they got a closer look at the operation of state government.Capitol time Reprieve for stud users The House gave final passage to a bill Feb. 25 that would repeal the upcoming state-wide ban on metal traction devices, or studs,for snowmobiles. The vote was 105-23. The House had passed an earlier version of the bill ( HF6 ) Jan. 21, but the measure had since been amended by the Senate to includegraduated fines for snowmobilers caught us-ing studs on state-owned paved trails. Stud use would remain illegal on paved trails. It was damage by illegal studs to thosetrails that prompted the 1998 law banningstuds on all public lands as of July 1, 1999. HF6 would repeal that law, which also re- quires snowmobilers to buy a $50 sticker touse studs until the ban takes effect. Rep. Tom Hackbarth (R-Cedar), sponsor of the bill, said the special fee and pending banhave caused parts of the state to suffer fromlost tourism revenue, and his plan would helpbring some tourism dollars back to the state. Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul) urged colleagues on the House floor to vote againstthe bill because, she said, cost estimates forstud damage to paved trails continue toincrease. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources had estimated the total damage tostate, county, and local trails at $3 million. ButHausman said Minnesota counties have esti-mated the damage is more than $7 million. \"To pass the repeal today without dealing with this huge amount of damage would be amistake,\" she said. Hackbarth is also sponsoring a separate bill (HF928 ) that would address the issue of re- pairing the paved trails. A special task forcemet and provided recommendations thatformed the basis of that measure. The HouseEnvironment and Natural Resources PolicyCommittee debated that bill Feb. 25, but didnot vote on it. The panel is slated to furtherconsider the measure. HF6 now goes to the governor.Bill would repeal PWC fee The debate over personal watercraft is mak- ing waves for the third time in as many years. A bill that would repeal the three-year, $50 surcharge on personal watercraft that was au-thorized by the 1998 Legislature was approvedFeb. 23 by the House Environment andNatural Resources Policy Committee. Proceeds from the surcharge are to be di- vided between the state and counties for lawenforcement and education efforts. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) estimated that with 27,000 registeredpersonal watercraft in Minnesota, the sur-charge would generate $450,000 annually. The bill ( HF54 ) is sponsored by Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus), who has been a vocalopponent of restrictions on personal water-craft and snowmobile use. Finseth said he supports a repeal because personal watercraft accident rates havedropped, even though the programs the sur-charge is meant to support are not yet in place. \"Things go in cycles, just like they did with snowmobiles back in the '70s,\" he said. \"Ithink we're headed in the right direction.\" Education and enforcement efforts would not suffer if the surcharge were repealed, DNRBoat and Water Safety Coordinator KimElverum told the committee. Currently, personal watercraft owners must pay the $50 surcharge in addition to a $12registration fee, Elverum explained. \"So they are being discriminated againstbecause they have to register twice,\" said Rep. Bob Westfall (R-Rothsay). Gov. Jesse Ventura, who owns a handful of the machines, strongly supports the repeal.Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby), who spon-sored last year's personal watercraft legisla-tion, expressed disappointment that a governorwho advocates personal responsibility at ev-ery turn would want to see the cost of personalwatercraft enforcement shifted to all otherboaters and local property taxpayers. \"We need to have the enforcement for the people of Minnesota who enjoy simple peaceand quiet on their lakes,\" said Rep. TomOsthoff (DFL-St. Paul). \"There are far more ofthem than one governor.\" Hasskamp also argued that with all of the media attention directed toward personalwatercraft issues last year, the so-called \"badoperators\" knew law enforcement effortswould be beefed up and that in turn led to animprovement in behavior. \"I am fearing what is going to happen on our waters this summer,\" Hasskamp said. \"Arepeal sends the wrong public message to theworst operators.\" The bill moves to the House Environment and Natural Resources Finance Committee.

The House answered that question Feb. 25, voting 81 to 49 after three hours of debate topass a bill ( HF5 ) that would propose a consti- tutional amendment to require a three-fifthsvote (rather than a simple majority) to passtax hikes. The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Tim Wilkin (R-Eagan), would let voters decide if theywant the super-majority requirement for theLegislature to pass an increase in existing taxor to impose a new tax. The proposed amendment would also ask voters to accept a three-fifths requirement forraising certain state-imposed fees andsurcharges. Wilkin said the measure was designed to protect taxpayers. He noted that 11 statesrequire an even stronger \"super-majority.\" InMinnesota, it would likely mean that raisingtaxes would require bipartisan or tripartisansupport. \"Government has an obligation to properly and adequately fund necessary programs, butthere comes a point where government itselfhas to be reigned in,\" said Majority LeaderTim Pawlenty need to drawthe line and say, 'no more.'\" Although the final vote reflected strong sup- port from Wilkins' fellow Republicans, not allof them were in favor. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) said he didn't like the bill and the \"trap it puts us in.\" Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) invoked the founding fathers in arguing that majori-ties should control the power to tax. \"We shouldn't do the lazy, sloppy, gim- micky way of taxing,\" Orfield said. \"Weshouldn't have government by well-financedminorities.\" The bill goes to the Senate. Eliminating the marriage penalty One plus one equals two. Correct?Yes, but not if you're referring to Minnesota's income tax. In the case of the tax code, one individual marrying another results in a higher tax liabil-ity than two individuals living together out-side of marriage. Bridging that gap \u2014 often referred to as the \"marriage penalty\" \u2014 is the intent of a billsponsored by Rep. Andrew Westerberg(R-Blaine).Westerberg told the House Taxes Commit- tee Feb. 25 that he believes families are thebuilding blocks of society and deserve a fairshake when it comes to taxes. His bill ( HF267 ) would increase the width of the income tax brackets for married jointfilers to twice the brackets for single filers. Under current law, two single taxpayers who marry will pay higher Minnesota incometaxes than they would have paid as two singlefilers. That means a single woman and a single man earning $20,000 each will pay combinedincome tax of $2,510. A married couple earn-ing $40,000 would pay $2,695. Although the bill sounds like a simple fix, it's not, according to Rep. Jim Knoblach(R-St. Cloud), who has sponsored legislationto undo the marriage penalty in previoussessions. He said no matter what action is taken, someone is going to be treated unfairly. How-ever, he noted that that is no reason for gov-ernment to be relaying the message thatmarriage is a bad thing. \"We shouldn't be penalizing married people,\" Knoblach added. Committee chair Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) said while the bill would noteliminate the penalty entirely for all filers, it isa good first step. He suggested that only a flat-tax structure would remove the penalty in onestroke of the pen. Abrams said one-earner families would ac- tually get a bonus under the proposal, whichhe believes would properly recognize the con-tribution of stay-at-home spouses. Some lawmakers questioned if the bill wouldn't lead to a \"singles penalty.\" Westerberg said his bill would not raise taxes on singles \"a dime,\" but he admitted thatin some instances, there could be disadvan-tages for singles. Tom Prichard, president of the Minnesota Family Council, called the marriage penalty\"totally inappropriate\" and said that his grouprepresents the 660,000 families that would payless tax were this bill passed. \"Frankly, families are due some tax relief,\" he added. Westerberg's bill carries a $330 million price tag over the next biennium, a figure Abramssaid would require considerable stretching tofit within targets that will eventually be estab-lished for the committee. The bill may be considered later for inclu- sion in the omnibus tax bill.Resorts seek tax change A bill that would allow Minnesota's resorts to stay open for more days and still qualify fora reduced property tax rate faced tough sled-ding before the Property Tax Division of theHouse Taxes Committee Feb. 24. Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby), the proposal's sponsor, said her plan would one more \"tool to succeed.\" She saidraising the number of occupancy days from250 to 275 would allow resort owners to ben-efit from their investment in improved facili-ties and better marketing. She pointed out that resorters are doing a better job of selling off-peak and winter sea-son packages; however, if they exceed the speci-fied number of occupancy days, their tax ratejumps from resort to commercial, a three-foldhike for some property owners. Several committee members expressed con- cerns that the bill would give an unfair advan-tage to some lodging businesses and questionedwhere the definition of \"seasonal\" would beobsolete, given the increased number of daysof operation requested in the bill. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) said he supports a longer operating span for smalloperations, but not for larger ones. He ques-tioned why the state should favor resorts overmotels. Hasskamp said that resorts are unique be- cause they are located on lakefront property. \"If they can't survive, they'll sell and divide the property and it will be lost,\" Hasskampsaid. \"Once the resorts are gone, they're notcoming back.\" Dutch Cragun, owner of a well-known re- sort on Gull Lake, told the committee thesteep increases in valuation for shoreline prop-erty is further evidence of the need to help theresorts stay in business. He said resorts are similar to family farms and require a great deal of investment. Thenumber of resorts has fallen from a high of4,000 in the mid-60s to 1,200 today, the bulkof which are tiny \"ma and pa\" operations. Cragun noted that if a year with ideal con- ditions should come for state resorts, manywould be able to exceed the 250-day require-ment but would be punished for their goodfortune. Rep. Larry Howes (R-Hackensack), a co- sponsor of the bill, said if the resorts are openlonger, more benefits accrue to the state. \"Thousands of tourists buy gas, groceries, and entertainment, to the benefit of the peopleof the county,\" Howes said. The committee took no action on the bill, but lawmakers may reconsider it for inclusionin this year's omnibus tax bill.16 SESSION WEEKLY / February 26, 1999TRANSPORTATIONTaxed to smoke and to quit The state is preparing to spend a great deal of money to convince people to quit smoking. Yet,if smokers decide to quit and purchase a nicotinepatch or nicotine gum, they pay sales tax. Some lawmakers find that incongruous.Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) is ) that would stub out the sales tax for items to be used exclusively toassist individuals to refrain from smokingtobacco. Mulder told the House Taxes Committee Feb. 23 that the bill would not extend protec-tion to everything touted as a smoking cure,such as copper bracelets. But several commit-tee members questioned whether the distinc-tion was drawn carefully enough in the bill. Rep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester) said he envisions a lot of \"voodoo products\" comingto market as a result of the state's influx oftobacco settlement money. Mulder said he is also concerned by that prospect, but noted that to be sold legitimatelyfor smoking cessation, products would haveto be approved by the U. S. Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). FDA approval, he said,would qualify items for his proposedexemption. Studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 20 percent ofMinnesota adults smoke tobacco. Other stud-ies indicate that about a third of the smokingpopulation attempts to quit each year. The bill would carry a price tag of $1.3 million for the coming biennium. The committee took no action on the bill, but may consider it later for inclusion in theomnibus tax bill. Earth-friendly tax bill What color should Minnesota's tax code be? Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) be- lieves it should be green. That's why she issponsoring a bill ( HF86 ) that would exempt the purchase of pollution control equipmentand solar energy systems from state sales tax. Rest told the House Taxes Committee Feb. 23 that while the state encourages the useof solar energy with one hand, it taxes thosewho purchase solar energy equipment withthe other. And although the state and federal govern- ment mandate that industries purchase pollu-tion control devices, the state punishesbusinesses for complying by charging salestax. Rest said her proposal represented a \"green- ing\" of Minnesota tax policy.The bill would add pollution control equip- ment to the definition of capital equipment instate statute. Most purchasers of capital equip-ment may file for a tax refund. Solar energy systems would be exempted categorically, independent of the capital equip-ment program, making the savings availableat the time of purchase. Purchases by electricutilities would not be included. To be exempt under the bill, a solar system would have to be used in a commercial orindustrial application and generate a certainminimum amount of energy. The committee took no action, but may reconsider the proposal for inclusion in itsomnibus tax bill. Bill allows minivan TVs Minnesota consumers who want to pur- chase Oldsmobile Silhouette minivans wouldhave the state's permission, under a bill ap-proved Feb. 23 by the House TransportationPolicy Committee. The bill ( HF745 ) would clarify the state's restrictions on the installation of televisionsets in motor vehicles. The Silhouette comes equipped with a televi- sion. The van cannot be sold in Minnesota be-cause the mounting of the screen is not completelybehind the driver, although the driver of the vanis still unable to see the screen. Sherry Munyon, director of government affairs for the Minnesota Automobile DealersAssociation, said Minnesota is the only statein the country where the van cannot be sold. Current law states that televisions can be mounted only from the back of the driver'sseat and beyond. The bill would change thelaw to allow screens to be mounted in anyplace except where the driver can see the screen. \"I think the intent of the law still holds firm,\" said Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska),the bill's sponsor. Exceptions to current law include television or video equipment used in law enforcementvehicles. The bill moves to the House floor. Speeding release of titles A bill that would close a legal loophole that can cause car dealerships to run afoul of thelaw was approved Feb. 25 by the House Trans-portation Policy Committee. The bill ( HF790 ), sponsored by Rep. Bill Kuisle (R-Rochester), would decrease theamount of time banks are allowed to release a title after a car is paid off to seven days. Undercurrent law, banks have 15 days to do so. However, car dealers have only 10 days to transfer titles to buyers after a vehicle is sold.This can present a problem when dealers needto obtain titles from a bank. If the bank takeslonger than 10 days, the dealer's deadline hasnot been met and they break the law. Sherry Munyon, director of government affairs for the Minnesota Automobile DealersAssociation, said dealerships are starting to bewarned by law enforcement officials for theirviolations. \"We do have a concern because they're out of compliance by no fault of their own,\"Munyon said. The bill originally proposed a five-day limit for banks, but was changed after a request formore time from bankers. Jenny Engh, director of government rela- tions for the Minnesota Bankers Association,said banks need time to verify information ontitles and to make sure checks clear. HF790 moves to the House Commerce Committee. Metric sytem unnecessary Even though the United States stated its intent to convert to the metric system of mea-surement in 1969, the implementation hasnot been on a fast track. In the last three decades, a few federal man- dates were created to get the country inchingin the direction of the metric system, butexceptions have been made for the highwayindustry. A bill approved by the House Transporta- tion Policy Committee Feb. 25 would grantthe Minnesota Department of Transportationsome of those exceptions for highway con-struction projects. The department started converting to the metric system in 1992, and by 1999 most stateprojects will be under the metric system. How-ever, Congress has made the conversion op-tional for highway construction. The bill ( HF571 ) would allow the depart- ment to instead use the English system ofmeasurement strictly for highway construc-tion projects, therefore making it easier forlocal governments and private contractors todo business with the state. If the bill becomes law, all projects initiated on or after July 1 would be required to use theEnglish system. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Torrey Westrom (R-Elbow Lake), moves to the House Trans-portation Finance Committee.17 February 26, 1999 / SESSION WEEKLYBy Sarah Hallonquist Of the 94,000 Minnesota men and women who fought in the Korean War, 738 died and154 are still considered missing. Last September, those Minnesotans received a tribute with the dedication of the MinnesotaKorean War Veterans Memorial on the Capi-tol lawn. The names of the dead are inscribed on seven granite walls, and a sculpture depicts a lonesoldier walking toward a silhouette of anothersoldier who represents those missing in action. The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when communist North Korea invaded SouthKorea in an attempt to reunite the country.The armistice was signed July 27, 1953, andCongress officially ended U.S. involvement inKorea on Jan. 31, 1955. The war is often referred to as the Korean Conflict because Congress never actually de-clared war against North Korea. And it is oftencalled the \"Forgotten War\" because it seldomreceives much media attention. But more than 54,000 Americans died in the Korean War, compared with 58,000 whodied in the Vietnam War, which lasted fiveyears longer. In 1995, a national Korean War memorial was completed in Washington, D.C. Part ofthat structure, which is a field of soldiers andmemorial walls, is made of granite from theCold Spring Granite Co. in Minnesota. The national monument spurred the Min- nesota effort, and the 1995 Legislature appro-priated $300,000 for the project. Construction on the memorial began in April 1998, after a two-year fund-raising Memorial honors Minnesotans who fought in Korea effort by the Minnesota Korean Veterans Cha-pter 1 from Roseville. The group had the taskof raising $300,000 to match the state's contri-bution to the project.Meanwhile, the Capitol Area Architectural and Planning Board held a design contest.Arthur Norby's \"Body and Soul\" won theboard's approval from five other submissionsin late 1996. Four thousand people attendedthe Sept. 13, 1998, dedication ceremony. Although there isn't an official list, many legislators past and present served during theKorean War. Sens. Bill Belanger (R-Bloomington), Leo Foley (DFL-Coon Rapids), and Sam Solon(DFL-Duluth) are Korean War veterans. Former Rep. Joe Begich from Eveleth, who served in the House from 1974 to 1992, alsofought in Korea, and was ordered there thesame time as Belanger. Rep. Kathy Tingelstad's(R-Andover) father, who passed away in Janu-ary, also was a Korean War veteran. Belanger spent a year in Korea, and remem- bers a lengthy battle in November 1950 withthe Chinese army in the Chosin Reservoir. However, Belanger was sent home in July 1951 because he was in a reserve unit. Becausewar hadn't been declared, reserves technicallyshouldn't have been there, he said. \"I don't think we were there legally,\" Belanger said. Belanger was not involved in the planning of the memorial, but he did correct the list ofdeceased veterans by adding a name of some-one he knew. He visited the memorial a fewdays after the dedication ceremony \"I thought it was good,\" Belanger said, add- ing that he believes Minnesota's memorial ismore authentic than the one in Washington. At the Korean War Veterans Memorial on theCapitol grounds, a lone soldier stands lookingthrough a silhouette of a fellow soldier. Thesilhouette represents the 154 Minnesotans whoare still considered missing in action from the war.

Bain's speech, \"Biotech- nology in Minnesota \u2014 ThePromise and the Challenge,\"was the last in this year's Capi- tol Forum Series, a program of lectures held atthe Minnesota History Center. Bain spoke about the issues surrounding biotechnology, an industry in which biologi-cal processes are engineered to create prod-ucts such as medicines, foods, and textiles. Biologically engineered products can range from Dolly, the famous cloned sheep, to spe-cially designed seeds for farmers or even thefinish on the denim used to make blue jeans. Bain said that biotechnology is a rapidly growing industry, and while its gains may notbe easily predictable, current products suggestit has a promising future. \"My strong recommendation is that you look at how you can attract more of it,\" Bain said. Creating development-friendly environ- ments, strengthening technical education, andsupporting the biotechnology efforts alreadyin place throughout the state are some of theways Bain suggested policy-makers could in-vite more industry to Minnesota. \"If you do all of these things we're talking about, you may be creating biotechnology'snext generation of products and services,\" hesaid. Bain said Minnesota has some of the tough- est controls on agricultural biotechnology test-ing, but it also has one the highest numbers oftesting areas in the country. The industry's firms are often small compa- nies that need a lot of start-up capital, and itcan take up to 10 years for some of thosecompanies to make significant profits fromtheir patents. Even so, Bain said, biotechnol-ogy is worth investing in because of its inevi-table success. Currently, there are 114 companies in Min- nesota that deal with some form of biotech-nology. Thirty-five of those businesses arerelated to medicine and health care, and therest are agricultural companies. \"With your resources in Minnesota, this is an economic sector that has a huge impact forthe state,\" Bain said.Capitol Forum Series . . . Lawmakers urged to let biotechnology drive growth He used the example of a business in San Mateo, Calif., that left the area because of highreal estate prices, strict tax and regulatorypolicies, and poor educational training facili-ties. Business leaders also reported that thearea's lawmakers did not understand the needsof the biotechnology industry, which made itdifficult for firms to deal with government. \"There's a lot of forecasting that has to be done by you,\" Bain told legislators. \"You haveto understand what they're doing.\" Economics aside, however, biotechnology evokes both hope and fear, Bain said. To illustrate his point, he told a story of a 16-year-old boy, John, who was dying of dia-betes and had rejected two types of insulinbefore a doctor suggested a newly engineeredform of insulin that had recently been ap-proved by the federal government. The boy's father agreed to travel the un- charted territory and use the new insulin.Today, John \u2014 Bain's son \u2014 is 31 years old. But just as biotechnology does a lot of good, Bain said it has negative consequences, too. Ethical quandaries, such as the race to map the human gene structure, create new debateson patenting biological information abouthumans. And those ethical dilemmas will con-tinue as long as science keeps up its pace.After his speech, legislators asked Bain ques- tions on topics ranging from industrial hempto biologically engineered farming products. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) asked why it seemed that medical advancements in bio-technology had progressed faster than agri-cultural ones. Bain said that could be because food is a more familiar commodity that might notpresent as much of a perceived need for somepeople as medical technology does. He re-minded the audience that people would noteven drink pasteurized milk when it was firstproduced. Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel) said biotechnol- ogy clearly has an impact for agriculture. \"The one message is that we are in a tech- nology age and change will be at a faster pace,\"Ness said. Ness is chair of the House Agriculture and Rural Development Finance Committee. Hesaid that as a legislator, he has an opportunityto make sure that necessary technologicalchanges go smoothly. Bain is a former reporter for NBC News and has won two Emmy Awards for producingtelevision documentaries. He began coveringbiotechnology issues in 1977 at the First Na-tional Conference on Genetic Engineering.He now heads his own communications firm,Bain and Associates, of which the Biotechnol-ogy Industry Organization is a client. While predicting technological advance- ments is not always a science, Bain's messageto legislators about biotechnology was to payattention and understand. \"All you can do is draw lessons from what you see and apply them to the future,\" Bainsaid. Further investigation of the policy dilem- mas of biotechnology will be the focus of nextyear's Capitol Forum Series. The series aresponsored by the McKnight Foundation andMinnesota Technology, Inc. Jackson Bain, a former NBC journalist, impresseson lawmakers the importance of supporting thegrowing industry of biotechnology. Bain spoke aspart of this year's Capitol Forum Series.

Dan Dorman (R-Albert Lea) says he feels lucky because serving in the House hasturned his avocation into his vocation. \"Having something you take an interest in \u2014 poli-tics has always been kindof a hobby for me \u2014 andall of a sudden you're do-ing it as a job, is like adream come true,\" hesaid. Part of Dorman's inter- est in politics comes from his other job, as owner of Hanson Tire Servicein Albert Lea, which is just north of the Iowaborder. Minnesota's higher taxes make it dif-ficult for many businesses in southern Minne-sota to compete with those in Iowa, SouthDakota, or Wisconsin, he said. \"Part of my business is selling farm tires, and I'm not competitive five miles south of mybusiness,\" he said. Some businesses have adapted by relocating or establishing additional offices in neighbor-ing states, thereby taking jobs away from Min-nesota, Dorman said. Dorman has worked toward solutions to those problems as a member of the MinnesotaChamber of Commerce board. He said he hasmet with his local legislators many times inrecent years to present ideas on economicdevelopment issues such as workers' compen-sation reform and commercial/industrialproperty tax reform. That experience is especially helpful now that he sits on the other side of the desk,New Members . . . Business owner aims to make Minnesota competitive Dorman said. One of his goals as a new Housemember is to support legislation to improveMinnesota's business climate. Most of Dorman's efforts so far have been focused on reducing taxes. He's sponsoring abill ( HF2 ) that would reduce income taxes, restructure property taxes, and phase out thehealth care provider tax. Dorman said he isoptimistic that the bill will become law, andthat it will be the largest state tax cut inMinnesota's history. As sponsor of that bill, Dorman said he's worked closely with House staff to determinethe projected financial impacts of proposedtax cuts. \"If you want to take an across-the-board half-percent increase in every classification,they develop a computer report that would tellyou the financial impacts in the future,\" hesaid. \"You have to ask whether the state canafford to do that.\" Getting the bill into its final form has in- volved repeating that process under differentscenarios and deciding how each tax classifi-cation would change. Dorman said he has hadinput from other House members, staff, andlobbyists, and he has been reading detailedbudget information and fiscal notes from theDepartment of Revenue. Dorman also said he is the only freshman with a coach \u2014 former House memberBob Haukoos, also of Albert Lea, who is nowthe official doorman for the House chamber. Dorman represents District 27A, which cov- ers Freeborn County. He describes the districtas economically and culturally diverse. In-stead of a dominant employer or industry, ithas many small businesses and family farms. \"There is no 5,000-pound gorilla, so we kind of have to fend for ourselves to createjobs,\" he said. \"We haven't enjoyed the eco-nomic boom that other parts of the state haveexperienced.\" That could change in the near future, Dorman said, as an ethanol plant is in theplanning stages for that area. Not only wouldthe plant create new jobs, it would enhance thestate's agriculture industry, he said. Dorman hopes to help secure funding for that project and for plans to clean up pollutionin Albert Lea Lake, which he believes wouldbring more tourism into the district. He serves on the House Agriculture Policy, Jobs and Economic Development Policy, andTaxes committees as well as on the PropertyTax Division of the Taxes Committee. He said the day-to-day challenges of his new job haven't diminished the thrill of serv-ing in the House. \"I'm still very proud every time I drive down the highway and see a sign that saysFreeborn County,\" he said. \"It's a lot ofresponsibility.\" Albert Freeborn Location: southern Minnesota Top concern : \"Hard working families in Minnesota deserve lower taxation.

While Rep. Tim Wilkin (R-Eagan), 33, was closing in on winning theDistrict 38A House seat,his wife, Eileen, gave birthto Rebecca, the couple'ssecond child. Their son,John, is 21 months old. \"We didn't even get to go to our own electionnight party,\" Wilkin said. Wilkin and his wife are used to mixing life's celebrations with politics,however. The couple started out by gettingmarried during his unsuccessful 1996 bid forthe state Senate against incumbent Sen.Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan). In fact, theWilkins had begun their courtship during hisextensive early preparation for that race, whichhe lost by only 1,247 votes. \"If that had worked out, all three legislators [from District 38] would have been namedTim,\" he said. At that time, Reps. Tim Commers and Tim Pawlenty, also Republicans from Eagan,held the district's seats in the House. Although he lost that race, Wilkin said his door-knocking for the Senate campaign paidoff two years later. \"That really laid a lot of groundwork that helped out this campaign,\" he said. The lifelong Republican is no stranger to political campaigns, having stumped forGeorge Bush and Dan Quayle in 1992 as state-wide chair of the Minnesota Young Republi-cans. In a 1993 special election, he passed outcampaign fliers for Rep. Jim RhodesNew Members . working to deliver on tax-cutting initiatives (R-St. Louis Park), who began his fourth termthis year. He also chaired the House campaign for his predecessor, Commers, in 1994. Commersstepped down in 1998 after serving three terms. In addition, Wilkin served four years on the Dakota County Planning Commission andwas vice chair of that group in 1997. Thatexperience gave him a good flavor for howsuburban and rural communities work witheach other on property and development is-sues. He said he favors local planning that issupported by the residents and not dictated bythe Metropolitan Council. \"I don't think the Legislature should be ceding authority to the Metropolitan Coun-cil,\" he said. Wilkin was a member of the Burnsville Eagan Cable Commission, but stepped down be-cause he said he thinks cable now has a num-ber of effective competitors, compared to itsprevious monopoly position. \"I don't believe in extending bureaucracies beyond their useful life,\" he said. That philosophy has followed him into the House, where his goals include paring downwhat he sees as a state government that's toobig. He said he would like to see thegovernment's ability to regulate be limited. To fulfill his campaign promises, Wilkin is sponsoring a bill ( HF5 ) that seeks a constitu- tional amendment to require a three-fifthsmajority in the Legislature to raise taxes. If thebill passes, voters would have to approve theproposed amendment in order to put themeasure into practice. \"It doesn't prevent taxes from going up,\" Wilkin said. \"It supports consensus.\" He is also a co-sponsor of a bill that wouldeliminate the motor-vehicle emissions inspec- tion program. Emissions tests, he said, causecynicism and tend to undermine other envi-ronmental regulations. Another cause for Wilkin is repealing the health care provider tax used to fund theMinnesotaCare subsidized health insuranceprogram. Wilkin said the tax only adds to thehigh cost of health care. \"I don't think we should be taxing sick people,\" he said. Wilkin came to Minnesota straight out of college in the summer of 1988 to be an auditorfor Norwest Banks. He earned a bachelor'sdegree in business administration from IowaState University, where he majored in finance.He met Eileen, a former piano teacher, in1995. The Freeport, Ill., native now works as an insurance underwriter for Northland Insur-ance Company in Mendota Heights. Outsideof work and politics, he spends the majority ofhis time with his family. He said he's notplanning an extended career in the House.He'd like to serve no more than four or fiveterms, and then return to the private sector. But for right now, the soft-spoken Wilkin said he's \"lovin' it\" in the population: 37,400 Eagan County: Dakota Location: Southeast metro Top concern: \"Reducing taxes and spending, while improving educational performance, are the issuesof greatest concern to my district.\" \u2014 Rep.
