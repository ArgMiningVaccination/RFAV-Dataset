There were several challenges created by COVID with the increased volumes of patients seeking access to care for both COVID and non-COVID-related needs. Call volumes are higher than ever, resulting in long wait times and diffi-culty returning calls in a timely fashion. Patient appoint-ment wait times for new and follow-up visits are unreason-ably long as physicians, and care teams struggle with the added demand of COVID patients, the loss of staff avail-ability due to COVID compounded by record rates of turnover across the entire health care landscape. COVID has changed the nature of the patient encounter, limiting visitors, increasing safety measures and disciplined use of personal protection equipment (i.e., masks, face shields, gowns) for both the care team member and the patient, increasing the time Volume 18 Issue 9 $5.00 March 2022PRSRT STD U.S. Postage PAID West Palm Beach, FL Permit #4595 THE REGION'S MONTHLY NEWSPAPER FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS & PHYSICIANS Continued on page 30 Continued on page 36 Continued on page 38 TM See pages 40-48 Continued on page 36SALUTE TO PHYSICIANS See pages 10 - 30 OUR 18TH YEAR SERVING THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY! T op Five Access Challenges and Solutions in Response to COVID James Moffett BY ALEX BINELO Our hospital systems and healthcare workers have been put to the ultimate test over the past two years. With over five million confirmed cases in Florida and new variants spreading rapidly , COVID-19 continues to impact every player in the local healthcare industry . During the first couple of months of the pandemic, we saw some medical practices struggle due to a decreased demand for services that patients didn't consider \"essential.\" Then, numerous hospitals lost revenue after experiencing a significant reduction in elective surger-ies, as well as diminished bed capacity and staffing constraints. The increasing costs of insurance and Medicaid con-tracts also compounded these financial matters for several providers. As new variants emerge, healthcare organizations are better positioned to face these challenges because they have adapt-ed their business models and determined BY VANESSA ORR While it may seem that becoming the medical director of a facility is an easy way for a physician to earn extra income, the position comes with myriad respon-sibilities, including ones of which doc-tors may not be aware. \"A lot of physicians think that becom- ing a medical director won't require a lot of time and will require very little effort,\" said Bill Gompers, CFE, Producer, Risk Strategies Company , Danna-Gracey . \"How wrong they are if it is done right.\" Depending on the specific arrange- ment, the duties of a medical director can be extensive. \"Before accepting the position, it is critical that doctors under-stand the legal, regulatory and profes-sional liability issues involved in the par-ticular medical directorship that they are contemplating,\" said Gompers. In some places, medical directors are required to pr ovide patient care, while in others they are not. Duties may include credentialing; ensuring that the practice is in regulatory compliance; developing and implementing protocols, policies and pro-cedures; vetting standards and supervis-ing any ancillary personnel; performing chart and peer reviews; per forming the Medical Directorships Come with Responsibilities, RisksBill Gompers Alex Binelo BY CLAUDIA MASON, MD Palm Beach County Medical Society recognizes a physi- cian's worth. We understand the business case to maintain a physically , emotionally and morally healthy physician population in South Florida. It has been well documented by the AMA the level of burnout, moral distress, and physical tolls taken on physicians that ever-increasing work demands without ade-quate support create. The New York Times' opinion piece authored by Dr. Danielle Ofri was titled \"The Business of Health Care Depends on Exploiting Doctors and Nurses.\" She goes on to state that the integrity of healthcare workers to put their patients first seems to administrators, like every-thing is going well as the work gets done. The cost is burnout, turnover, and increased suicide for the physician. It means lost revenue, recruit-ment costs, and costs to ramp up of a new practice of approximately $1M per provider for the organization. If the loss is one of a specialized proceduralist the cost may be much higher. Hidden costs are those of loss of organizational prestige, reputation, and patient base. The Mayo Clinic estimates that for every point lower on a five-point physician sat-isfaction scale the provider is 30-50% more likely to leave. We blame the EMR. We blame administrative tasks that are better done by support staff that have been pushed to physicians. The EMR is a fine tool for collecting data, and physi-cians and clinical staff have turned into data entry clerks. Documentation \"must haves\" rule for collection of quality data metrics that drive compensation. Adding extra support staff to do these tasks comes with the penalty of increases in productivity quotas. We blame loss of autonomy .

You can reach Charles Felix at Charles@southfloridahospitalnews.com Charles Felix Publisher's NotePublisher's Note After 8 frustrating months of defrosting our Samsung refrigera- tor's ice maker and cheese tray with a hair dryer every 48 hours, we finally bit the bullet and bought a bright and shiny new high-tech LG. (After blowing up four hair dryers, even Carol couldn't argue anymore.) Our Best Buy purchase and delivery went smoothly , and the refrigerator was working well, that is until I tried to connect to its Smart Wi-Fi enabled system. Luckily Carol wasn't home during my initial frustration trying to register our refrigerator with the wi-fi \"gods,\" since she'd immediately been suspicious about entering Best Buy to begin with when all she really wanted was a fridge dependable enough to make ice. (In her words, were Eskimos now buying igloos at Best Buy?) But after some collaboration with my besties, the Best Buy geeks, my con- nectivity problem finally had to be upgraded to a LG Priority Service Ambassador. Of course, I was immediately put on hold, shifted from depart-ment to department but I was determined to hang on and get my Wi-Fi connected since I knew that the Eskimo reference would come back to haunt me. So, while I simmered listening to the LG hold message, Carol arrived home just in time for the LG robot to announce loud and clear on speaker, \"We will be happy to assist you with your service problems, you are the 4,624th call in line. We have scheduled a return call on September 14th at 2:30 p.m. (Today's date was February 11.) As I was summarily dis-connected, Carol's only comment was that I should make sure to mark that date on my calendar. In all fairness to both Best Buy and LG, the next day I re-initiated the Smart Wi-Fi registration, and all was connected, our dual ice makers are churning out cubes, and Carol's hair dryer no longer has to do double duty .

This CCM program generates high patient satisfaction, increases patient engagement and retention in CCM, ensures maximum MIPS scores, and therefore, greater revenue for partic-ipating medical practices. Along with the large increase in Medicare CCM reimbursement for 2022, participation in this innovative program is a must for primary care practices. The Quadruple Aim The Quadruple Aim framework- enhanced patient experi- ence of care, better health of populations, reduced health care costs and increased physician satisfaction - guides continuous improvement in health care. The four pillars are integrated to function in concert, so implementation of all four pillars is required for optimal effectiveness. YDIT has strategically embedded the QA to guide Next Gen CCM delivery . Patient Centricity Patient centricity is front and center in Next Gen CCM. From the beginning, Medicare CCM has required shared decision-making between practitioners and patients. When patients believe health care professionals genuinely listen and act on what matters to them, they are more likely to be engaged in their care. Therefore, YDIT has built a patient-centered culture by recruiting compassionate care managers who listen closely to patient priorities and provide them the most appropriate supportive CCM services. Patient-Centricity/QA Combination Patient centricity is pivotal to advancing the QA in Next Gen CCM, and together these two value-added components of Next Gen CCM work together as follows: 1) Patient experience of care is enhanced by focusing on what matters most to the patient. Patient satisfaction increases when they become engaged in their care. 2) Better outcomes for the Medicare patient population having multiple chronic conditions result from adherence to QA guidance and patient shared decision-making. 3) Reduced Medicare costs result from increased patient well- ness. 4) Physician satisfaction increases and burnout decreases by having healthier patients, meeting MIPS requirements, and generating significant new revenue. Summary The Next Gen CCM innovation of pairing patient centricity with the QA creates synergy that increases patient satisfaction, improves patient outcomes, improves MIPS scores and pro-motes patient wellness.

Next Gen CCM, the Quadruple Aim, and Patient Centricity BY RICHARD GROSSO, CEO, AND SCOTT RICE, MD, PHD, MBA, MS Golisano Children's Hospital Receives Asthma-Friendly Hospital Award from The Florida Asthma Coalition The Florida Asthma Coalition is honoring Golisano Children's Hospital of Southwest Florida for being recog-nized as an Asthma-Friendly Hospital. The award represents Golisano Children's Hospital's efforts to create a safe and healthy environment for their patients with asthma. The Asthma-Friendly Hospital des- ignation is a recognition designed to improve asthma management at hospi-tals by reducing health risks for asth-ma patients, prevent and minimize asthma-related ER visits and hospital-izations, and reduce readmissions for acute severe asthma exacerbations. To earn this recognition, team mem- bers at Golisano Children's Hospital successfully completed multiple crite-ria that focused on professional devel-opment for nurses, physicians and res-piratory therapists on asthma manage-ment and the creation of an asthma action plan. They also updated educa-tional folders that they give to patients and families who are admitted for asth-ma to make them more robust. The Golisano Children's Hospital team also added new , kid-oriented videos to the learner iPads in the hospital.

Spotlight BY VANESSA ORR In February 2022, Jorge Paoli-Bruno, M.D., MBA, FACHE, CPE, FAAFP , became the medical direc-tor at Anthem, Inc. Healthsun Plans, one of the largest health benefits com-panies in the United States. His background as a family physician, a health systems administrator and finan-cial expert helped prepare him for his new journey , as did his rela-tionship with the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE). \"I spent the last seven years working for Jackson Health System in the Corrections Health Services section, running services to the Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation Depart ment, one of the largest correctional systems in the United States,\" said Dr. Paoli-Bruno, who served as both the medical director and interim chief medical officer for the organization. \"In addition, I continued visiting clinics and supervising mid-level providers at health care clinics and comprehensive out-patient rehabilitation facilities on the out-side. \"I am very excited that I will be able to utilize these skills as the medical director at Anthem, which is a Top 500 company nationwide. Through its affiliated compa-nies, Anthem serves more than 118 mil-lion people, including more than 45 mil-lion within its family of health plans,\" he added. Dr. Paoli-Bruno first became interested in the healthcare field while exploring a biomedical engineering major at Marquette University . Changing gears, he enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico to pursue a major in biology and decided to continue on to medical school. \"I went into family medicine because I wanted to understand the broad spectrum of a human being; I didn't want to specialize in just one area,\" the board-certified doc-tor explained. Because he was also intrigued by numbers, Dr. Paoli-Bruno decided to pur-sue an MBA with a concentra-tion in finance, which led to an interest in healthcare man-agement. \"I was still having face-to-face contact with patients while getting the management point of view ,\" he said, noting that this mix of interests also led to his earning a Certified Physician Executive (CPE) credential along with an American Academy of Family Physicians' Fellowship. Dr. Paoli-Bruno's most recent accom- plishment came this past February , when he became a Fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives. \"Being a Fellow signifies not only 'tenure' but additional work in the com-munity , within organized medicine, within teaching, and a greater commitment to continuing professional development and/or research,\" he explained. \"Achieving the Fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives is a prestigious dis-tinction that shows that I am a leader among leaders in healthcare administra-tion, and demonstrates my competency in all areas of healthcare management, and my lifelong commitment to change and improvement.\" The doctor, who joined ACHE in 2008, said that he appreciates the networking and mentoring opportunities that were provided by the organization, and is very proud of this latest achievement. \"Earning a fellowship shows evidence that you are moving forward; that you have the desire to keep doing better all of the time,\" he said. \"It also shows that you have knowledge that is important in any healthcare facility or system.\" ACHE of South Florida Member Spotlight: Jorge Paoli-Bruno, MD, MBA, FACHE, CPE, FAAFP Dr. FL 33146KK II MedicalIn appreciation to Enrique Escal\u00f3n, M.D. Pediatric Hematologist/Oncologist For 51 years of service to the children of our community and beyond, thank you.

South e availabletor og grams ar l pr 6 March 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News While hospice is consid- ered a medical interven- tion, it is, more precisely , a fully funded federal benefit intended for patients with advanced illness. As part of an entitlement program that patients pay into, it is a benefit they can use\u2014and tap into sooner. If patients do, they receive the holistic care that a physician alone can-not provide. With hospice, an interdisciplinary team works together to deliver coordinated care. A social worker helps patients with their social needs while a chaplain assists with spiritual care. Nurses and physicians address the patient's ongoing pain relief, yet the entire approach is team-based and comprehensive. The origins of hospice as a community- based service began in the 1960s, when Dr. Cicely Saunders founded St. Christopher's Hospice in London. The facility paired expert symptom relief with physical, social, spiritual, and psychologi-cal care to meet the needs of patients and their families. This model evolved in the U.S., and the federal benefit under Medicare Part A became permanent in 1985. 1 Payroll taxes dually paid by employees and employers help fund this, and individuals eligible at 65 for Medicare Part A are entitled to access this benefit. Hospice is also covered by most insurance and Medicaid. Yet so many are not aware of it. Over 48% of Medicare decedents do not access their hospice benefit. 2 As a physician, it is my civic duty to inform patients of the enhanced care they can receive. Patients and their families are often surprised\u2014they tell me that hospice services seem too good to be true. Currently , more than one-third of patients live less than seven days in hos-pice. Because of this shortened time frame, these patients miss months of care and support which would have enhanced their quality of life. Hospice is for the living not just for the dying. It enables advanced illness patients to be comfortable wherever they are\u2014at home, in assisted living, a nursing home, or a hospital setting. Hospice also supplies durable medical equipment, such as wheelchairs and commodes, which other medical plans may not cover, making it a financial benefit as well. Physicians use a six-month projected life span to determine hospice eligibility . Yet, if a patient is still in the end-stage of disease at six months, they can renew hos-pice care at two-month intervals. The team will monitor the patient daily . If the patient has stabilized, the hospice may discharge them. More likely , the patient will re-certi-fy as they continue to decline. Ultimately , a patient decides if they want to use the hospice benefit. Their physician can help them determine eligibili-ty . As a physician myself, I want to understand ways to support a patient. If I have a struggling patient and med-ical treatments are no longer working, I want to provide my patient with the quality of life they desire. For example, a cardiologist referred an advanced heart disease patient to hospice care. She spent several months receiving coordinated care. During this time, her family learned more about the disease process while a team of experts supported this patient. Her family thanked the team for their level of care. Many later ask: How come I didn't know about this before? It is our duty to inform patients and families so that hospice becomes an inte-grated part of healthcare. When patients near the end of life, the physician becomes less significant than a chaplain or social worker. I have never had a family member express any regrets about choosing hos-pice. When selecting a hospice provider, look for the level of engagement between team members and the patient and family . The attention a patient receives in hospice should increase. It takes an expert team to help navigate the emotions arising during this stage of life. In hospice, families become part of the care plan. The pathway of serious illness is not unique. Diseases progress the same any-where in the world. Yet, the US is the only country to have a fully funded hospice benefit through Medicare Part A. We must share this with our patients. It breaks my heart to see patients suffer. If we have a holistic approach for providing compas-sionate care, it is our responsibility to offer this solution sooner.

Sooner Is Better: Hospice Care for Patients With Advanced Illness BY ANDY ARWARI, MD South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2022 7 954-964-1660 Courtesy of Cleveland Clinic, \"Value-based care is a simple and proactive concept of improving care for patients. With its core based on overall wellness and preventive treatments, value-based care improves healthcare outcomes and reduces costs.\" When you do a search for articles about value in healthcare, prepare to sit for a while, as the number of citations will be great (about 764,000,000 results). Needless to say , none of us has enough hours in a day , month, year or a lifetime to cruise through all that material. Therefore, courtesy of Paul Keckley , let us take a shorter journey and focus on the value discussion dating back to the first identified value agenda created by the Affordable Care Act (2013), which Keckley labels \"Value Agenda 1.0.\" This value agenda included several pay-for-performance programs (retreads) and new alter-native payment models. CMS defines Value-based programs as those that, \"reward health care providers with incentive payments for the quality of care they give to people with Medicare. These programs are part of our larger quality strategy to reform how health care is delivered and paid for. Value-based programs also support our three-part aim: Better care for individuals, Better health for populations, and Lower cost.\" Think about the Triple Aim that transforms to the Quadruple Aim with the addition of health equity (or joy in work, if you are so persuaded). It is against this backdrop that we change administrations (Obama to Trump) and along with this change in administrations comes a change in thinking about how to approach the goals expressed by the Triple and Quadruple Aims. Keckley refers to this new approach as the \"Value Agenda 2.0.\" [2018] This particular agenda expresses the new leadership's direction and implementation was accomplished by creating, \"new alternative mod- els and executive orders requiring price transparency for drugs, hospitals and insurers.\" In the review of the literature on the relative suc- cesses of both of these value agendas, the results appear mixed. Significant improvements occurred on the quality-of-care side of the equation and less so on the cost savings to Medicare side. Annual Medicare spending increases slowed over this period but did not hit the targets predicted before implementation. Then the pandemic hit. Healthcare spending increases significantly and, \"...public anxiety about health and wellbeing has spiked and health insurers and notable hospital systems are reporting record earnings.\" Paul Keckley talks about the emergence of the \"Value Agenda 3.0\" now being driven by employers and consumers. This new paradigm will exhibit a coming together of parties to create common definitions and goals, greater price transparency , more inclusive of all healthcare purchasers (not just Medicare), and increased scrutiny of private capital firms entering the healthcare vertical. Look at 2022 as the year of collaboration with common goals like, \"value will be more precisely defined and directly linked to lower costs for individuals and families.\" Changes in healthcare will continue, keep your eyes open or you may find yourselves left behind! Jaime CaldwellA message from our President Value Is Here to Stay!P.O. Box 19268 Plantation 33318 8 March 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsTamarac resident Kenneth Goff was home shaving morning when he felt a small lump on the left side of his neck. \"There was no pain, no noth- ing, but I could feel it by the way the razor moved,\" said the 58-year-old father of five and grandfather of eight. \"It wasn't visible at all, but I could feel it right below the jaw line.\" After a CT scan at Broward Health Medical Center in August 2020, Goff was diag-nosed with HPV-mediated squa-mous cell carcinoma, a type of throat cancer. This cancer is similar to what actors Michael Douglas and Stanley T ucci have battled. The treatment of HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma may include surgery , radi-ation, chemotherapy or combination of the treatments. Ryan H. Sobel, M.D., a head and neck surgical oncologist at Broward Health Medical Center, prescribed radiation to treat Goff's isolated neck mass. Prior to radiation treatment, Dr. Sobel performed a submandibular, or saliva gland transfer, an intricate surgery only a handful sur-geons across the country are skilled at performing. He is currently the only sur-geon utilizing this technique in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Dr. Sobel strategically relocated one of Goff's saliva glands. It was moved about three inches from the right side of his throat to under the chin to place it out of direct range of the damaging effects of radiation. Patients diagnosed with throat cancer face a difficult choice: treat the cancer with radiation and risk losing their abili-ty to swallow and taste, or don't treat the cancer and risk terminal illness. \"By safely moving saliva glands away from direct radiation, we are able to help mitigate long-term risks such as the abil-ity to taste and swallow and significantly preserve a patient's quality of life,\" said Dr. Sobel. For Goff, his radiation treatments began with Evan Landau, M.D., a radia-tion oncologist at Broward Health. \"He prepared me very well and told me in advance what to expect so I could pre-pare myself mentally and physically ,\" Goff said. \"He said my taste buds would change during radiation and advised me to gain 20 pounds before starting treat-ment.\" The radiation treatment temporarily affected Goff's saliva gland. He lost his sense of taste and suffered from severe dry mouth. He's now 90% back to normal thanks to Dr. Sobel's revolutionary proce-dure. Goff was able to continue working as probation officer during his treatments. \"Everyone thought I was crazy coming to work during radiation,\" he said. \"I didn't want to sit home. We have a great crew of people I work with who are very helpful and very supportive.\" Goff's last treatment was December 2020, and now that his taste buds are fully back to normal, he's happy to be cooking up his signature dish for his fam-ily . \"My specialty is pork and beans and hotdogs,\" he said. \"We barbeque a lot.\" Grateful to the physicians at Broward Health Medical Center for treating his cancer in its early stages, Goff now advo-cates for being proactive about taking care of one's health. \"We need to take care of our bodies and pay attention to it,\" he said. \"I'm that kind of guy that when something doesn't feel right, I run to the doctor,\" Goff said. \"Some people, when they feel a little lump, don't do anything. When our bod-ies our trying to tell us something, we need to listen.\" Throat Cancer Survivors Don't Have to Sacrifice Ability to Swallow and T aste Kenneth Goff Dr. Ryan H. Sobel Brain cancer is the second most common cancer among children after leukemia. But while new therapies have sig- nificantly increased the cure rate of pediatric leukemia, effective treatment for brain cancer still lags. I am currently conducting a pioneer phase I clinical trial called ONC201 at the Miami Cancer Institute (MCI) test-ing a new targeted therapy for brain tumors. I am hopeful that this new drug will become the go-to treatment for cancers such as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a cancer that currently has no long-term survival rate. This is one of the hundreds of clinical trials for cancer in which we've enrolled patients for the past three decades. I joined the Children's Oncology Group (COG) in 1996 to find cures for pediatric cancer working with experts worldwide. The COG is supported by the National Cancer Institute and COG researchers have been instrumental in numerous advances. Through COG's multiple clinical trials, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in children saw an increase in survivorship from 60 to 90 percent. Only 50 years ago, a diagnosis of ALL was a death sentence. The next target is to get the same results - or better - for brain cancer, DIPG and other pediatric cancers. DIPG - Uniquely Difficult to Treat In children with DIPG, the average survival is six months to 18 months after diagnosis. DIPG cannot be treated with surgery because the tumor is located where breathing and heart function are controlled. Removing the tumor would cause catastrophic injury to these vital centers. The Miami Cancer Institute, where I serve as Medical Director of Pediatric Oncology , is one of five centers in the U.S. doing a trial with ONC201, a new generation of chemotherapy called \"targeted therapy\". We know our children are tolerating this new drug very well but it is too early to have any conclusion on the impact of the drug on survival. At some point, we may be able to combine ONC201 with chemotherapy or immunotherapy for a more robust response. While the children are monitored regularly in my office at MCI, the medication is given once a week by pill or via compounded liquid for younger children. The first dose is given under our supervision at MCI, after which the children return once every three weeks for assessment. There are currently 12 children participating in the trial, ranging in age from 5 years old to adolescents. All of the Institute's pediatric patients are under my care, including the majority of those receiving proton therapy . We regularly attract children from throughout Florida and other countries looking for our expertise in diagnosing and treating cancers like leukemia, brain tumors, kidney cancer and bone tumors, among others. Regional Collaboration Offers Children More Opportunities One of our goals is to expand COG treatment opportunities to patients of the other KIDZ Medical Services hematology/oncology offices at Nicklaus Children's Hospital, Palm Beach Children's Hospital at St. Mary's Medical Center, West Boca Medical Center in Boca Raton and Naples Community Hospital. The dedicated KIDZ Medical Services hematology/oncology researchers, physi- cians, and other healthcare staff have, for decades, been involved in ground-breaking research to improve cancer survival by offering patients the most advanced treat-ments, such as with proton beam therapy , and opportunities to participate in clinical trials. Keys to the medical advancements are multispecialty collaboration, medical expert- ise, participation in the Children's Oncology Group research and a deeply-rooted commitment - some might say calling - to increase survivability for pediatric cancer patients. Dr. Daghistani summed it up succinctly . \"Research is the engine of everything and as long as we have hope in our heart and work hard on doing research and supporting research, we will beat cancer one day .\" Dr. Doured Daghistani is Medical Director of Pediatric Oncology at Miami Cancer Institute.

She was lamenting the fact that throughout the division she manages, there is a huge bell curve in how doctors, nurses and the general staff treat patients. Whether it be a last-minute cancellation (or rescheduling) by a doctor, how a nurse handles a particular situa-tion, or a staff member who makes a patient wait forever without a simple update. Despite years of beating the 'patient first' drum, she has mixed results. She asked me, 'How do I get everyone to give the same excellent patient experience?' My response was simply , 'That is impossible.' There is no way your worst team member can ever be as good as your best. However, what is possible is to narrow the gap, by focusing on being more consistent. Most organizations, whether they are in health care or not, have clear, non-negotiable, standards which are clearly spelled out and the team knows they need to follow. For example, try being and employee and using \"No Problem\" (vs. \"My pleas-ure\") at Chick-fil-A, pointing with one finger (vs. two) at Disney World, or not using a guest's name when greeting them at the Ritz Carlton. The most difficult part of this is getting buy in. The easiest way to do this is by doing two things: First, assume that everyone on your team wants to do a great job when it comes to patient care/experience. Secondly , parlay that desire into conversation that will drive consensus on the fundamentals. Focus on best practices, simplicity , and common sense. Come up with a short list of things the team agrees to never do when dealing with patients and their families. Share it. Train to it. Hold each other accountable to execute. You can narrow the gap and that will result in a consistent overall experience. Your scores will soon reflect your efforts. Jay Juffre is Executive Vice President, ImageFIRST .

Even when faced with slim chances of survival, and an overwhelming probability of death, we are 100% committed to maximal efforts to save a life,\" said Dr. Sareli. \"We carry the responsibility of treating patients during the worst times of their lives and we should never miss any opportunity to make a difference in our patients' lives and those of their families.\" MEMORIAL NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE Tarek Zakaria, MD Dr. Tarek Zakaria is excited about the advances being made in the treatment of epilepsy at the Memorial Neuroscience Institute, a level 4, comprehensive, epilepsy program. \"We're one of the very few centers in Florida that offer ROSA, a robotic platform for non-invasive surgical proce-dures,\" said Dr. Zakaria, who is medical director for both epilepsy and the institute's adult neurology program. \"We've also significantly reduced seizures, and in some cases elimi-nated them completely , using different treatment options, including surgery , NeuroPace, and newer technology based on brain stimulation and neuro modulation.\" After an analysis of patient outcomes at Memorial's epilepsy pro-gram, Dr. Zakaria and the team found 50% of patients reported a 90% reduction in the number of seizures. Using newer technology significantly reduced complications, mor-bidity , and mortality for patients when compared to traditional, invasive surgeries. \"I'm happy that the improvements in treatment enables epilepsy patients to live the lives they deserve,\" said Dr. Zakaria. \"And, one day , we're going to find a cure.\" Brijesh Mehta, MD Dr. Brijesh Mehta has worked with city and county-based emergency medical services (EMS) teams since 2016 to assess and expedite treatments for acute stroke victims before they reach the hospital. The education he and his Memorial-based team provide empowers first responders to assist stroke suffer-ers in the field and offers valuable information that helps neuro teams prepare to treat patients once the ambulance arrives. \"We can improve the likelihood of good outcomes and reverse the effects of stroke if we can administer treatment in less than an hour,\" said Dr. Mehta, medical director of the Comprehensive Stroke Program and neurointerventional surgery at the Memorial Neuroscience Institute. \"By optimizing the systems of care, we have brought our response time to 30 minutes or less and we can have patients in the cath lab within the hour.\" Dr. Mehta says the follow-up data supports the positive impact of the innovative approach. Patients have less stroke-induced paralysis and permanent disability , with some regaining their strength and walking out of hospitals on their own just days later. Christopher R. DeMassi, MD, FACS Much has changed in the roughly ten years since Dr. Christopher DeMassi joined Memorial Healthcare System after completing a neurosurgery residency and fellowship at Jackson Memorial Hospital. \"Memorial had no strong epilepsy or neurology programs at that time, just a limited number of doctors working in those specialties. We were a community system that served local patients.\" Today , DeMassi leads a comprehensive neuroscience center that is expanding and on pace to become a destination that will draw patients from areas beyond South Florida. His roles include chief of the Memorial Neuroscience Institute, chief of neurosurgery , and medical director of the Memorial Spine Center. \"I'm a clinician that grew into a leader. I still enjoy surgery but have come to appreciate the fresh challenges of planning 5-10 years in advance and incor-porating all the services we offer. Memorial is a great healthcare system that's focused on the right things, enjoys com- munity support, and hires well,\" said Dr. DeMassi. \"We'll reach our goals and become the destination for care we all believe we can be.\" GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION Saima Chaudhry, MD In her role as Memorial Healthcare System's chief academic officer, Dr. Saima Chaudhry oversees a Graduate Medical Education program that now offers training in 14 accredited programs. But while residents make up the bulk of that audi-ence, it isn't just the younger doctors that Dr. Chaudhry wants to see focus on learning. \"Physicians have made a commit-ment to the public that they have the proper expertise for the job. The only way to honor that commitment is for the doctor to dedicate him or herself to lifelong learning.\" Under Dr. Chaudhry's leadership, Memorial has become an accredited source of continuing medical education, providing more than 22,000 hours of CME instruction to 13,000 clinicians during the past 12 months. \"My focus has been on advancing healthcare by training and improving doctors,\" said Dr. Chaudhry . \"It's my way of contributing to the public good.\" MEMORIAL PRIMARY CARE Christopher Ramsaran, MD A primary care and non-surgical sports medicine physician, Dr. Christopher Ramsaran treats a wide variety of patients, from the acutely/chronically ill to those with musculoskeletal injuries suffered during exercise to elite athletes. \"Our practice has grown to include a younger, more health-conscious audi-ence that looks to us for well visits as well as sports injuries.\" Caring for athletes requires a different type of expertise that illustrates the value of Dr. Ramsaran's combined specialties. Diuretics are usually the prescribed medication to treat hyper-tension, to cite just one example, but they would dehydrate an athlete during strenuous exercise and cause adverse outcomes, so different medications are required. Dr. Ramsaran is part of Memorial's team of sports medicine specialists that manage the care of athletes at several local universities. Another area of focus among that group is on concussion education, diagnosis, and treatment, including working with neurologists to ensure indi-viduals with symptoms receive immediate follow-up care. MEMORIAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM Candice Sareli, MD \"Transforming Hope into Reality\" is a phrase Dr. Candi Sareli believes accurately describes the impact of research now being done within Memorial Healthcare System that has pro-vided South Floridians convenient access to clinical trials and alternative treatments on par with any found in traditional university settings. \"We're a centralized hub supporting research being done by 130 physicians conducting 150 clinical trials in 36 special-ties,\" said Dr. Sareli, Memorial Healthcare System's chief med-ical research officer. \"We also assist our Graduate Medical Education program in their submissions to publications that document scholarly activity .\" Dr. Sareli started Memorial's academic research program in 2011 after nearly seven years as director of clin-ical research at the University of Pennsylvania. She believes strongly in the need for alter-native treatment options and loves the fact that by utilizing science and reason her team can add to the information available within the art of medicine. Paula Eckardt, MD, FACP, FIDSA, AAHIVS While many have become aware of Dr. Paula Eckardt as one of the architects of Memorial Healthcare System's ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the chief of Memorial's Division of Infectious Disease also continues to focus on treat-ing patients with HIV . \"Broward County has one of the highest rates of new HIV cases in the nation. These patients need monitoring and ongoing care regardless of the amount of COVID-related activity or restrictions in our community ,\" said Dr. Eckardt.That means an increased reliance on telemedicine, an approach that many with HIV had previously resisted because of concerns about pri-vacy . At the height of COVID, when in-person care was interrupted by shutdowns at out-patient clinics, the online consultations Dr. Eckardt had long advocated for became a crit-ical part of treatment protocols. As medical director of Memorial's Ryan White Clinic, Dr. Eckardt leads a multidisci- plinary team that ensures HIV/AIDS patients have access to medications, mental health, and case management services. The program is a source of pride for the infectious disease expert, recently earning three awards for viral suppression.

But it's a group dynamic he credits with taking the ED team at Memorial Hospital West to a different level. \"Our teamwork is outstanding. All the doctors, nurses, and physician assistants get along and work collaboratively ,\" said Dr. Katz, the hospital's chief of emergency medicine. In addition to his leadership role at Memorial Hospital West, Dr. Katz is also actively involved in the emergency medi-cine residency program on its campus and serves the larger community as medical director at Pembroke Pines Fire Rescue. He began his medical career as a paramedic at a firehouse in New York and says he says he has always been attracted to the pace, challenges, and excitement of delivering life-saving care. MEMORIAL REGIONAL HOSPITAL SOUTH James Salerno, MD Dr. James Salerno is chief of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation and a driving force behind the growth of Memorial's rehab program. Both inpatient and outpatient care now include multi-disciplinary collab-orations between neurosurgeons and oncologists, to name just two of the additional specialists that may be part of a patient's care team. \"We're becoming a destination for rehabilitation services, with more individuals aware of our reputa- tion and seeking the expertise we provide,\" said Dr. Salerno, a clinician whose practice focuses on the medically-complex transplant population. \"The expansion of services extends our geographic footprint, both inside Memorial Healthcare System and in collaboration with other healthcare providers in the com-munity .\" Dr. Salerno believes the sophisticated level of service Memorial offers enables it to be an option for patients wherever they may be. He cites the success Dr. Jeremy Jacobs has had using telemedicine to provide orders to amputees throughout Florida for necessary procedures or a replacement prosthesis.

Particularly for those caring for seniors, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed a physical, mental and emotional burden on doctors, who in the blink of an eye faced new processes, new pressures and new priorities in keeping their patients safe and healthy . As Conviva Care Centers closely monitored the pandemic, our physicians and operations staff continuously provided guidance to seniors on how best to safeguard themselves and their families. Our physicians led organization efforts to acquire and deliver COVID-19 vaccinations, and at the same time created safety pro-tocols so our patient care operations could continue while protect-ing staff and patients alike. They proactively reached out to our most vulnerable patients, including those who contracted COVID-19, and delivered food to those facing difficulty in their daily lives. With the pandemic beginning to relax its grip, this seems a good time to step back, catch our breath, and say thank you. Thanks to all of you who have invested so much of your time and energy in becoming a guiding light through this crisis and continu-ing to provide high-quality care for your patients. I so appreciate the rich life experiences our elders have lived. For many of them, with age comes health issues and, quite often, diminishing social support. The physi-cians who lead the Conviva care teams know this well. They understand the impor-tance of care management, addressing emotional and social health, and seeing the whole person, in order to help our patients live their best lives. Our physicians work to ease friction in care while participating in the joy our seniors hold in their lives. They build relationships with both our patients and their loved ones, so that together they can enable our patients to age well. It takes a lot to become a physician, and it takes a lot to bring the skills and com-passion of a physician to each patient interaction. We recognize not only the cognitive effort but also the emotional commitment that goes into providing care, every single day , for every single patient. We honor our physicians for their sense of duty and humanity in providing the best care for our sen-iors, from seeing patients in our centers to quarter-backing our team effort to support our patients' holistic needs. Pride and Gratitude Our primary care physicians are an inspiration for our organization and are a big reason why Conviva earned the 2021 eHealthcare Leadership Award in the \"Best COVID-19 Pandemic Related Communications\" category . To our physicians and care team members: We are profoundly grateful to you for staying the course during these unprecedented times. Your care promotes longevity and improves lives. You know that healthcare isn't only about managing diseases \u2014 it's also about ensuring that our patients have the environment and support to thrive, including nourishing food, a loving community , and a safe place to live. You are helping seniors live longer, fuller lives. It has been an incredible time of change and challenge, but your commitment to service as a healthcare professional has been steadfast. We thank you and we salute you. Dr. Vivek Garg is Chief Medical Officer for Humana's Primary Care Organization. Dr. Steve Lee is Chief Medical Officer, Florida Division, Conviva Care Centers.

SALUTE TO PHYSICIANS Giving Credit Where Credit Is Due: Our Physicians Are Our Heart BY VIVEK GARG, MD, AND STEVE LEE, MD South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2022 29 30 March 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News Happy Doctors Day Our doctors are the reason our patients can Age Well. Every day - but especially on Doctors Day - we share our gratitude for talented, dedicated physicians everywhere. Doctors who are committed to their patients and to providing compassionate, attentive care are invaluable to our community. Thank you! ConvivaCareCenters.com SALUTE TO PHYSICIANS cian. While they may have benefits of mobility and compensation, autonomy in managing workflow and productivity is lost. The administrative burdens of prior authorizations, phone calls, patient mes-saging, as well as the compliance learning modules, are expected to be done \"in between\" patients. Private practice physi-cians suffer from increasing costs and low-ering reimbursements. The variable under their control is volume or charging for patient access. Physician extenders, advance practice nurses soon gain their own panels of patients and are in the same situation. Moral distress of not being able to do what is right for the patient when competing interests ensues. This becomes a time/money conundrum. Our sense of purpose is diminished. How can it be that physicians flock to do \"mission\" work? We are treating throngs of patients for the sheer joy of practicing medicine. We get no compensation, there is minimal to no paperwork, just taking care of people and feeling fulfilled. Here is a clue to managing the crushing adminis-trative workload we face, by creating sys-tems that encourage practice of medicine instead of data entry . Burnout is a scourge of the profession, a danger to patients and society at large, and robs individuals of their vitality . Suicide rates among physi-cians are higher than the average even while adjusting for hours worked. Organizations with vision use physician wellness and wellbeing as critical elements for planning operations, workflows and a metric for C suite balanced scorecards. Most organizations have realized this is an issue of maintaining a limited resource. Their efforts are in the nascent stage. The Florida Department of Health's 2021 workforce report shows that 60% of Florida physicians are over age 50. Survey data shows 92% of younger physicians felt work life balance was a necessity . How will we cope? We know what works. Reduction of administrative bur-den. Physician to physician interventions to prevent \"Second Victim\" trauma. Returning voice to physicians to manage their workloads. Return of the Doctor's lounge where the organization recognizes the physical and emotional strains of prac-tice and provides nourishment for the body and a safe place for nourishment of the soul. The Palm Beach County Medical Society recognizes a physician's worth. In 2017, following a successful model from Washington State, they began a Physician Wellness Program to bring this to the attention of our members and the medical community at large. Under the leadership of Dr. Stefan Pasternack and his generosity , the Society raised funds to pro-vide resource material available to mem-bers on the PBCMS website. Additionally , the PBCMS has held a formal educational Wellness Conference to educate our mem-bers and the healthcare community . Our proudest accomplishment has been for the Society to partner with vetted mental healthcare professionals to provide confi-dential free of charge counseling for five sessions. The Committee, headed by Dr. Shawn Baca, strives to advocate for physi-cians' mental and physical health. To date the program has directly served practicing physicians, residents and medical stu-dents. Although organizations may have an assistance program, many physicians will not access that service through an employer. The PBCMS and the FMA actively advocate for changes in the licens-ing process to eliminate the question \"Have you ever seen a mental health provider?\" We advocate for physicians to do what they were trained to do. Practice Medicine. We call upon the South Florida health- care community to understand a physi-cian's worth. The business case, moral case and ethical case is clear. Preserve the abili-ty of physicians to practice medicine or be at the peril of losing this critical limited resource. Dr. Claudia Mason is President of the Palm Beach County Medical Society. Cover Story: Salute to Physicians: A Cautionary T ale for Organizations Continued from page 1 South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2022 31 HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN & FACILITY PLANNING BY LOIS THOMSON With her 30 years of experience in interior design - the past 21 with Saltz Michelson Architects -Frida Dunayer under-stands the difficulties that can arise in designing healthcare facilities. As she pointed out, \"The environ-ment we create for the patient is more important (there) than in other fields.\" Dunayer, director of interior design, explained some of the specifics: \"When we are talking about different kinds of illness-es and treatments (for patients), we have to deal with the equipment and systems necessary for successful medical treat-ment. For example, air conditioning has a big impact in the design of a building because of the need to maintain the required temperature and cleanliness. Functionality of all the spaces is the main goal for us to reach.\" She also talked about working on hospi- tals, where patient health and safety takes priority . \"Let's say we are doing a full ren-ovation of a hospital. We design the proj-ect considering different phases, according to the demand for the rooms in each case.\" They work on one side of the building to minimize the dis-ruption, and then on the other. \"We normally work it like that. It takes longer, but that's the way to deal with construction in a building that never closes.\" Once the design is finished, the construction begins, but there has been change in that area over the past few years. Dunayer said, \"Currently , all the new normals are a reality; because of COVID, the challenges are mostly financial in the case of construc-tion - and the challenge of not being able to get materials. Many of the constructions have to make sure that they are not going to have any problems budget-wise, so they increase the price even though it is not necessary . We have found several cases like that. Even though the price of materi-als has not increased, the constructors add an additional percentage because they are trying to predict prices three months in the future.\" While some of Saltz Michelson's build- ings are spectacular in their design, the healthcare facilities usually do not exhibit extravagance. Dunayer agreed that some clients like their buildings to stand out, but for others, \"it's not as important. And that doesn't affect our decision of how we design the building. It doesn't matter what the specialty , we try to do our best - look-wise, function-wise. We try to design within the budget but not sacrifice in looks. The expense is inside the medical facility because of equipment, special needs. Outside, to make a building attrac-tive, we can use different materials or we can use different colors with paint and cre-ate the same effects. It's really not difficult to design great buildings outside with a low budget.\" Dunayer said Saltz Michelson is able to handle projects of all sizes; and that over the past five years, approximately 60 per-cent of the work has been new structures. \"Before, maybe 30 percent were new buildings and the rest were renovations and additions. Now it's been different, and it's been better.\" She explained that even though renovations and additions are smaller in size, they can sometimes cause more difficulty than a new building. \"When you start construction you find so many conditions that are hidden that you have to go back to the design. Meanwhile, the construction is already underway .\" That can result in friction between the design and construction teams. The firm's clients are a mixture, and include both public works and private. Dunayer said they are fortunate to have contracts with some medical facilities and government institutions, which usually run two to three years. One project that was just finished and is operational is BARC, Broward Addiction Rehabilitation Center, for Broward County; and another under construction, also in Broward, is the sexual assault facility for women and chil-dren. Additionally , following the renova-tion of an assisted living facility , the firm was given the opportunity to do three more such buildings. \"Assisted living facil-ities provide residence and basic medical attention to elderly . The occupants usually stay temporarily to be treated for minor rehabilitation matters.\" Another of Saltz Michelson's clients is the Seminoles. Dunayer said they just fin-ished a project for the Immokalee commu-nity in central Florida. \"We designed a medical clinic, a behavioral Health Center, a police station, a fire station, and an emer-gency operation building in case of disas-ter. They are trying to organize all services for the community on a single campus.\" Whatever challenges are taking place, Saltz Michelson - and Frida Dunayer - are able to handle them.

Frida Dunayer Handles Challenges of Healthcare Interior Design Frida Dunayer Good Samaritan Medical Center Brings New T echnology and Services to the Newly Redesigned Norma E. & Miles M. Zisson Comprehensive Breast Center of the Palm Beaches Good Samaritan Medical Center part of the Palm Beach Health Network, announces a new look and new equipment in the redesigned Norma E. & Miles M. Zisson Comprehensive Breast Center of the Palm Beaches. The Palm Beach Health Network invested nearly a quar-ter of a million-dollars into the center, bringing a sleek and calm aesthetic look, along with some of the newest high-end technolo-gy for patients being treated for their breast health. Some of the new additions to the center include: \u0081 The Genius 3D Mammo - graphy exam with Hologic Clarity HD - This technology generates images of the breast that are sharper and even more detailed so a cancer can be detected earlier, when it is easier to treat. It also cuts down on unnecessary follow-up appointments by up to 40% compared to 2D imaging alone. It also produces images quicker so less time for the patient to have their breast under compression \u0081 Affirm Breast Biopsy Guidance System - This system allows doctors to quickly perform 3D breast biopsies on patients and accurately target regions of interest for a breast biopsy assisting in breast cancer detection. \u0081 Supersonic Mach 40 Ultrasound - The Ultrasound system gives the highest reso- lution images of patients to enhance diagnostic certainty , regardless of tissue density . 32 March 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com Florida 24) 255(9( Design HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN & FACILITY PLANNING Why is it required? Because it only takes one defective or non-compliant fire door to turn a small fire into a deadly inferno The purpose of official agencies such as AHCA, CMS, insurance carriers and local fire departments is to increase public safety by making sure Medicare-funded health care facilities are complying with all Fire and Life Safety and fire codes and concerns. Next to full sprinkler systems, code compliant fire, smoke and egress doors are the facility's next most crucial fire prevention device. The reason is that most fires usually start small and can be limited to the original area, providing that any fire door leading from the room is closed and is fully fire-code compliant. In addition, it is a fact that very few people are hurt or die from flames; it's smoke and fumes that injure and cause death. Therefore, fire doors blocking the spread of fire, smoke, etc., are essential. In addition, a properly engineered and closed fire door will cut off addi-tional oxygen from entering the fire zone and fueling the blaze proving it is fully compliant with the fire code. \"Fire Safety\" doors are the second line of defense against the spread of a fire and lethal smoke, with a complete sprinkler system being number one. Unfortunately , \"Fire Safety\" doors sadly have the most potential for failure due to the high frequency of use and sometimes, the simple lack of regular maintenance. For this reason, a need for strict regulatory compliance has been established by (a) The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), (b) The International Code Council (ICC), and (c) The Joint Commission, AHCA, and CMS [Healthcare], which requires the inspection of ALL Fire Doors at least annually . A complete fire door inspection requires several things. First - you need a complet- ed Door Schedule - listing every fire, smoke and egress door. Each door must be listed individually , and its exact location and other information noted. Our company National FireDoor attaches a permanent QR-coded ID label to each door's hinge edge. Facilities' floor plans are also beneficial; however, some entities use the Fire \"Life Safety Plans\" for buildings. Without a complete door schedule a full Inspection cannot be completed. When an AHCA or other AHJ (Authorities Having Jurisdiction) shows up to do a life safety survey , one of the records facilities must keep avail-able is a Fire Door ITM (Inspection, Testing & Maintenance) workbook or report. This report is a permanent record of the ITM for each door and must be available upon demand. An annual inspection of ALL fire, smoke and egress doors is required and a report for each door must be made available to any AHJ upon request. In addition, your facility can be cited for failing to comply with Annual Fire Door Inspection (AFDI) Mandate requirements. Never for-get, it's facilities management that is held responsible for required safety inspections. YOU may ask who is authorized to do the AFDI. The NFPA code states that anyone who processes the proven knowledge of Fire Safety Door Assemblies and Fire Code compliance experience is eligible as an inspector, providing they are accept-able to the AHJ. Most facilities utilize the services of professional companies such as National Fir eDoor, LLC, one of the fastest-growing companies in the Fire Door compli- ance inspection field. National FireDoor offers several programs which run from Full Service (includes everything necessary for compliance with the directives required for Annual Fire Door Inspections) to programs which supervise a DIY program. If you would like to discuss your compliance concerns, call National FireDoor for a no-obligation consultation. NFD can ensure your buildings conform to the inspection requirements for your facility now and in the future.

Jupiter Medical Center is sparing no expense to provide the highest level of care to discerning patients throughout South Florida. Since 2019, the award-winning medical center has invested $168 million in its future and the future of healthcare in South Florida. Substantial investments in campus expansion, state-of-the-art facili-ties, and advanced technology \u2014 all at the fingertips of the area's leading physicians and specialists \u2014 result in nationally rec-ognized care. Jupiter Medical Center's latest enhance- ments include: \u0081 The Anderson Family Cancer Institute: This comprehensive treatment center ushers in a new era of cancer care in South Florida. It brings together multi-disciplinary cancer experts, leading tech-nology , care navigation specialists, and personalized treatment that is unmatched in the region. \u0081 Expanded Emergency Department: When it opens in 2022, Jupiter Medical Center's Emergency Department will expand by 5,000 square feet and incorpo- rate the latest advanced emergency medi-cine technologies and expansive patient care areas. The improvements are designed to reduce wait times and enhance the patient experience. \u0081 90,000-Square-Foot Surgical Center: Plans for this $100 million, state-of-the-art Surgical Institute include 16 operating rooms, two hybrid operating rooms, anesthesiology workrooms, private con-sultation rooms, pre- and post-operative meeting areas, expanded nurses' stations, clinical offices, and more. The Surgical Institute will meet the increased demand for surgical care, expand access to minimally invasive treat- ment options, and elevate the patient experience. As they await for a loved one during surgery , for example, family mem-bers will receive real-time, clinical infor-mation and updates via private, patient-focused communication technology . Top Ratings and Leading Surgical Technology Jupiter Medical Center designed the Institute with the latest quality enhance-ments in mind, bolstered by seven consec-utive \"A\" ratings from the Leapfrog Group, a national nonprofit organization whose annual hospital survey of inpatient and outpatient care is \"the nation's gold stan-dard in evaluating hospital performance,\" and a 2021 Top Hospital distinction by Leapfrog. Jupiter's operating rooms will leverage sophisticated infection prevention tech-nology , including ultraviolet light steriliza-tion, advanced venti-lation design, and hands-free door oper-ation. An ex panded sterile processing de - part ment will enable faster cleaning and reduced sterilization times, enhancing the overall surgical infec-tion-prevention pro - cess. Combining ad - vanced sur gical, im - ag ing, and information technologies, the new Surgical Institute also will utilize the latest in multilocation data collection to consolidate patient information and make it immediately available to clinical teams. This new functionality also makes it possible to perform 3D image-guided surgery , a leading-edge technology that aids surgeons by enhancing visualization of each surgical procedure and enabling them to perform surgery with greater accuracy . Jupiter Medical Center's focus on tech- nology-enhanced multidisciplinary care prompted the addition of two advanced hybrid operating rooms. These hybrid suites will be equipped with the latest image-guided and robot-assisted surgical equipment. The suites combine a tradi-tional operating room with an image-guided interventional suite to accommo-date more complex procedures. These state-of-the-art spaces also allow for the combination of image-guided sur-gery with surgical procedures that require traditional open incisions. Multidisciplinary clinical teams can tran-sition seamlessly from minimally inva-sive procedures to an open procedure without the need to reschedule the sur-gery to a different day and time. Jupiter Medical Center is well-posi- tioned to provide world-class care across South Florida. Continued investment in sophisticated technology , specialized medical facilities, and leading physicians enables the medical center to lead the way in healthcare innovation and provide the level of care our community deserves.

The four recipients representing Century Ambulance EMS professionals include: Michael Krohn, EMT, Taylor County; Greg Thacker, Cornelius Lavan, Paramedic, and Lauretta Kaylor, Dispatcher/Paramedic both from Jacksonville, Florida. These four individuals were nominated by their station supervisors. The Star of Life medal is given each year by the Florida Ambulance Association to recognize that EMS saves, sustains, and touches lives every day and shines a light on all the important work these individuals do who have either resuscitated a patient, improved public health, had a positive impact in the community , or showed excep-tional care and compassion. \"We are very proud of the courage and dedication demonstrated by our EMT's, Paramedics and Dispatcher throughout this year and their unwavering commitment to providing compassionate care at every level in their respective roles here at Century Ambulance, said Matt Johnson, Vice President-East and General Manager of Century Ambulance. \"Over the past year, the tireless efforts of all EMS professionals throughout the state have been critical to ensuring the health and safety of all Floridians throughout this pandemic,\" he added. In addition to the awards ceremony , the Stars of Life recipients had the opportunity to meet Lt. Governor Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, attend meetings at the Florida State Capitol and also met with their state legislators and local representatives. Century Ambulance Service is a Covalent Health Company and provides services throughout the state of Florida serving northeast Florida, Columbia County , Taylor County and Palm Beach County . Back row (l-r) Michael Krohn, Greg Thacker; Front row Cornelius Lavan, Lauretta Kaylor administrative duties needed for licen- sure and board requirements, and pro-viding generalized oversight to the prac-tice, among others. \"What some physicians might think of as a way of supplementing their income for very little effort is really taking on a great deal of responsibility if they do the duties required in the needed manner,\" said Gompers. \"In fact, in some states including Florida, the failure to do these duties as defined in state statute could have an effect on the status of their med-ical licenses.\" While some of the tasks of a medical director can be delegated, the medical director can be held responsible when a patient suffers an adverse effect or the entity's regulatory compliance is called into question. \"Many physicians don't realize that their medical professional liability policy most likely excludes medical director-initiated duties,\" said Gompers. \"In order to protect themselves from any suits or issues, they may need to get a separate policy or be added on to the facility's pol-icy where they are serving as the medical director.\" There are a number of red flags that may signal a problem when looking at a medical director agreement. \"For example, if a person is a medical director at a facility like a nursing home, and refers patients there while getting a monthly fee as a medical director, he or she may be violating anti-kickback regu-lations,\" said Gompers. The Physician Self-Referral Law , com- monly referred to as the Stark law , pro-hibits physicians from referring patients to receive \"designated health services\" payable by Medicare or Medicaid from entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship. \"If a physician doesn't make sure that the ancillary staff meets their in-service education requirements and are ade-quately trained or that all of the profes-sionals in the facility have the correct licensure, they may also be liable if some-thing happens,\" added Gompers. \"In the state of Florida and other places, the medical director is also responsible to make sure that a facility's billing proce-dures are appropriate and meet all requirements.\" In Florida specifically , any licensed healthcare clinic may not operate with-out the day-to-day supervision of a single medical or clinic director, who is, in the state's view , the focus point of maintain-ing high quality care and ensuring that the facility is operating in compliance with the law. When applying for recerti-fication, medical directorships will be reviewed by the state as part of the licen-sure requirement, and if there is a com-plaint about the facility , every facet, including the medical director's role, will be reviewed. \"Anybody contemplating entering into a medical directorship should have a contract and consult with a healthcare attorney to ensure that the proposed business arrangement does not violate any state or federal laws such as corpo-rate practice of medicine and payment arrangements,\" said Gompers. \"They need to make sure that they understand their duties under the contract and con-sider if they can appropriately perform those duties. \"They also need to make sure that they have their own liability coverage to pro-tect them in this role, or make sure that they are included in the policy of the facility or clinic engaging them and get a Certificate of Insurance as evidence of such,\" he added. \"A number of physi-cians fail to realize how important this role is to the facility and how much exposure they may have.\" For more information, contact Bill Gompers at bill@dannagracey.com, (888) 777-7173 or visit www.dannagracey.com. Cover Story: Medical Directorships Come with Responsibilities, Risks Continued from page 1 required to conduct an appropriate patient encounter further reducing access. Ease of navigation from one care site to another has also been more complicated than before COVID. Due to these challenges, the Holy Cross Medical Group (HCMG), like medical groups across the country , have adapted to these demands and deployed new capabilities that will benefit patient access, safety , and care for years to come regardless of COVID. Holy Cross Medical Group (HCMG) recognized and responded to the need to answer the phones quickly and effectively by centralizing the call center. HCMG started with the primary care offices and rapidly expanded to the larger specialty practices. This resulted in greater than 98% of patient calls being answered in less than 30 seconds. Specialized training allows for the call center representative to answer questions and schedule appoint-ments while on the call eliminating long wait times, voicemails and return phone calls. Their training also prepares the call center representative to assess the health condition, and if COVID may be a factor, it can guide the patient to available resources. A collaborative team approach is improving access to patient appointments. While the patient/provider relationship remains a priority , a patient's immediate need may require seeing a provider who has immediate availability versus waiting for the established physician relationship to have an appointment available, which could be many weeks out. This is accom-modated by the centralized call center who has visibility into all physician sched-ules and can navigate a patient to another excellent physician either in the exact location or at a geographically convenient location nearby . Telehealth is another exciting method by which patient access to their physician can be accommodated. The rapid develop-ment of telehealth platforms allows patients to quickly and easily engage in a video visit with their physician from the comfort of their own home. Telehealth has proven to be an excellent solution for those patients with mobility or immuno-compromised conditions. Telehealth makes the visit both safer and more con-venient. Lastly , online scheduling provides access to care to the patient by logging onto an online scheduling option. Doc ASAP is a scheduling tool available to all current and potential patients of HCMG and accessible from any electronic device such as smartphone, tablet, or computer. It will list physician availability and make scheduling as simple as selecting a time that is convenient for them. While COVID has had heartbreaking implications across every community , it has pushed the adoption of centralized services such as call centers and the advancement of technology such as tele-health and online scheduling. HCMG has taken full advantage of these new capabil-ities to serve our patients better. It is essential to note that in addition to learning and deploying new capabilities, HCMG and other excellent health care organizations across the community have known how to keep patients and care teams safe while seeking care. It is crucial that those in need of care understand this and don't delay care even though COVID continues to be a challenge in our commu-nities. James Moffett is President, Holy Cross Health Medical Group.

The Campaign for Boca Raton Regional Hospital.nThe couple's generosity brings the total funds raised through the Keeping the Promise campaign to $225 million toward its goal of $250 million and amplifies and symbolizes the enormous philan-thropic commitment from the medical staff. \"Dr. Moncrief holds a special place in the hearts of so many of us here at the hospital and in this community ,\" said Lincoln Mendez, CEO of Boca Raton Regional Hospital. \"As a breast surgeon, she has had enormous impact on patients and their family members who depended on her extraordi-nary skill to both save and enhance life. There is no greater accomplishment as a physician, as a person. Dr. Moncrief was part of the substantial growth of the Christine E. Lynn Women's Health and Wellness Institute before she retired to spend more time with her husband and their philanthropy . The gift she is making with her husband, philanthropist and businessman Alex Gellman, underscores their commitment to Boca Regional and to our bold vision to expand. We are eternally grateful.\" The gift from Dr. Moncrief and Mr. Gellman will be fittingly recognized in the new planned Sanctuary and will carry the name of Alex's grandmother, Anne Brenner Gellman. Nicklaus Children's Hospital Awarded Grant from Rotary to Advance Behavioral Services for Children Rotary has awarded Nicklaus Children\u00ed' Hospital $333,125 to support the expansion of the hospital's tele-behavioral health program. The grant is a joint initiative of the Rotary Club of Key Biscayne in Florida and the Rotary Club of Windsor Roseland in Ontario, Canada. These critical funds will enable the hospital to expand availability of mental healthcare services for South Florida children and their families, addressing the increased demand brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, while also providing services in a safe virtual setting. The grant builds upon Nicklaus Children's existing telehealth program, Pediatric Virtual Care, which has been operational since 2013. Pediatric Virtual Care offers convenient access to pediatric care for a wide range of services from the com-fort of home, or other location. The grant funding is provided through The Rotary Foundation - Rotary's charitable arm - to select programs undertaken by Rotary members that support sustainable, defined community needs around the world. Nicklaus Children's is working hard to address the behavioral health needs of the region, aided by telehealth, which enables the hospital to safely serve more children than in the traditional office-based model. In 2021, the hospital conducted nearly 30,000 vir-tual consultations and visits, with tele-behavioral health accounting for 51 percent of these. This follows another busy year in 2020, when the hospital conducted over 31,000 virtual visits, with 42 percent involving behavioral health. The Rotary Club of Key Biscayne works closely with Nicklaus Children's Hospital on local and regional advocacy initiatives and special event development. Later this year, once it is safe to gather again, Rotary club members and Nicklaus Children's leaders will host an event to promote awareness of the mental health needs of the region\u00eds children and recognize donors, partners and contributors. Broward Health Coral Springs Becomes the First Breast Milk Depot in Broward County Broward Health Coral Springs is proud to partner with Mothers' Milk Bank of Florida (MMBFL) as the first Milk Bank Depot in Broward County . Broward Health has utilized Pasteurized Donor Human Milk in the treatment and care of premature and critically ill babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. \"We are excited for the opportunity to partner with Mother's Milk Bank of Florida by utilizing the gift of donor milk for our tiniest patients, and now also by participating with our community with giving back as a depot location,\" said Sabra Henry , Administrative Director, Women's and Children's Health at Broward Health Coral Springs. Approximately 14% of Florida babies are born preterm according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Breast milk for premature or seriously ill newborns is an effective way to enhance the baby's health, growth and development. Breast milk can reduce the incidence of serious and even fatal digestive tract infections. Once frozen donated milk is received at Broward Health Coral Springs' Milk Depot, it's sent via courier to the Milk Bank where it's tested for bacteria and levels of nutrients and pasteurized to kill any bacteria or viruses. Before the pasteurized milk is dispensed, bac-teriological testing is done to ensure its safety . Donor milk is dispensed to babies by a doctor's prescription.

As the first hospital in Palm Beach County to start an open-heart surgery program, Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center continues to provide innovative, top quality cardiac care to the community . \"Experience counts, and that's what this achievement represents as an important part of the growth of our cardiac pro-gram for almost 40 years,\" said Teresa Urquhart, chief executive officer for Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. \"When it comes to the heart, we remain focused on advancing the level of care we provide to our patients by adding some of the newest and latest car-diac procedures to our program.\" Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center started its open-heart program in 1983, with cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Richard Faro performing the first procedure. Since then, the hospital has been recognized nationally for its cardiac care, and continues to be at the forefront of pioneering some of the latest medical proce-dures in the area . Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center Implementing the ERAS System for Heart Surgery Patients Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center is adopting the ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery) system for patients undergoing heart procedures.

In fact, BDO's recent CFO Survey , which polled 100 healthcare industry CFOs with revenues ranging from $250 million to $3 billion, found that 63% of healthcare organizations are thriving and 82% expect to be thriving in one year. In South Florida, telehealth innovations have given primary care physicians the flexibility to provide patients with more convenient care and the bandwidth to garner additional busi-ness. Fewer in-person visits have reduced patient costs, allowing primary care facilities to benefit from cost-sav-ings bonuses on capitated health plans, including Medicare Advantage. In addition to making these opera- tional pivots, healthcare organizations that received Provider Relief Funds (PRF) and related government funding are positioned to face new variants and come out of the pandemic with greater financial stability . A number of South Florida's specialty practices have quickly rebounded because of the funds. While some of the federal funding program updates, such as changing eli-gibility criteria and the need for addi-tional documentation, have required increased oversight to ensure compli-ance with the latest audit requirements, the funds have had an overall positive impact on South Florida's healthcare industry . Looking ahead, we expect to see con- tinued growth and investment in South Florida healthcare. The influx of people moving to Florida from across the coun-try and the substantial senior population has sparked a great deal of merger and acquisition activity from out-of-state private equity groups. These firms are attracted to opportunities for consolida-tion and acquisition and are heavily investing in Florida's rapidly growing healthcare tech industry . The firms are also helping South Florida companies expand and replicate their success in regions across the country . Several med-ical centers are bringing South Florida's full-service medical center concept, which involves multiple specialty offices in one large facility , to regions of Texas and California. As South Florida further emerges as a healthcare hub, mergers and acquisi-tions are expected to continue, especial-ly over the coming months before any new tax proposals are finalized. While the state's healthcare sector has seen unprecedented challenges over the last two years, it has proven incredibly resilient with access to better services and working systems in place to care for high volumes of patients. Adversity often breeds innovation, and the posi-tive steps South Florida's healthcare organizations are taking have positioned them to help more people in 2022 and beyond.

Conflicting views of legality between federal and state regulations cre-ate critical yet often overlooked financial challenges for contractors in the medical cannabis industry .

I'm in the marketing and creative field within cannabis; I call it \"the fun stuff\". At Fluent, I'm in charge of the branding, all the marketing initiatives, and all the creative strategy and development that comes with it. I'm really passionate about cannabis branding. I believe the industry is very young and there's a lot of work to do on the branding and marketing side. Because the industry is so new , I've seen cannabis companies miss the mark with compelling branding and just recently we are starting to see strong and well-developed brands hitting the market. This trend is not going to stop anytime soon. How can people in Florida benefit from the company you represent? We are proud of being a patient-mind- ed cannabis company that goes above and beyond to make cannabis patients feel supported and taken care of. We offer a wide range of high-quality cannabis products, but we take it up a notch by providing an outstanding cus-tomer experience too. Our dispensary team is the best and our online experi-ence is just an extension of the quality service patients expect to get when they visit Fluent. Getfluent.com is the place to go to start your cannabis journey with Fluent. How did you get started within the cannabis industry? Before joining the cannabis industry I worked as a creative developer for Legacy and Digital Media. A production company in Miami reached out to me to develop a Documentary Series about the cannabis industry in Florida. This was during 2017 and the MMTC that I was assigned to follow was Knox Medical, which later became Fluent Cannabis. I fell in love with the industry during the production of the pilot episode. I started to advise the CEO on some ideas for marketing the company and, four years later, here I am as the Creative Director of Fluent. Are you personally a MJ card holder? Yes, I am. Do you see Florida moving forward with recreational Marijuana/cannabis and how will that affect your business? The simple answer is yes. I believe it's not a matter of \"if\" anymore--It's a mat-ter of \"when\" and \"how\". Whenever recreational cannabis laws are put in place, every player in the industry will be affected. In general, I think it will be great for the industry and patients/con-sumers, but I'm sure there will be win-ners and losers while this transition hap-pens. I'm looking forward to continuing along the journey of adult-use policies in Florida. From a marketing and creative standpoint, I think the best is yet to come. Beginning Monday , March 1, 2022, the Medical Marijuana Use Registry (Registry) was updated to comply with section 381.986(8)(e)16.b., Florida Statutes (F .S.), which states, in part, med-ical marijuana treatment centers (MMTCs) \"may not dispense more than one 35-day supply of marijuana in a form for smoking within any 35-day period to a qualified patient or caregiver.\" As such, a 35-day rolling limit will now be used to calculate dispensation limits for marijua-na in a form for smoking. This means the amount of marijuana in a form for smok-ing a patient may purchase on any given day is calculated as the difference between the amount permitted by the patient's current order and the patient's total dispensation history over the past 35 days. The 35-day cycle is not based on the calendar month or certification-issued date. All patients will be given a 35-day tran- sitionary period from March 1, 2022 to April 4, 2022. During this time, only dis-pensations made on or after March 1, 2022, for marijuana in a form for smok-ing, will be used to calculate the amount available to be dispensed to the patient. Beginning April 5, 2022, all patients will start their own 35-day rolling limit, and MMTCs will not be permitted to dis-pense an amount in excess of a patient's 35-day rolling limit. As part of this Registry update, patients and caregivers will see a new \"Dispensable Amount\" value on their orders. The \"Dispensable Amount\" value is the total available amount of marijuana in a form for smoking that a qualified patient or caregiver may receive at any given time due to the patient's 35-day rolling limit. For more details about a patient's dis- pensation history and the date additional amounts will become available to the patient, you can access the new \"Dispensation History\" dashboard. This dashboard tracks all smoking dispensa-tions used to calculate the patient's \"Dispensable Amount.\" To view this new dashboard, expand your active Smoking Order in the Registry , and click the \"See Calculation\" link next to the \"Dispensable Amount.\" It is important to note that \"Date Expires\" means that the respective amount of marijuana in a form for smoking will become available the day following the date listed (i.e., the amount dispensed becomes available to the patient at midnight of the day follow-ing the date listed on \"Date Expires\"). The Office of Medical Marijuana Use (OMMU) has published an instructional guide on how to understand the Amount Available Calculation Page. This guide can also be found on the OMMU's website, here: https://knowthefactsmmj.com/ registry/#instructional-guides.

The forthcoming legislation, which was released in draft form last July , repeals federal marijuana prohibition by removing cannabis from the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. Speaking at the event, Sen. Schumer said: \"In the coming weeks, we're ramp-ing up our outreach and we expect to introduce final legislation. Our goal is to do it in April. Then we begin the nation-wide push, spearheaded by New York, to get the federal law done. As the majority leader, I can set priorities. This is a prior-ity for me.\" NORML 's Political Director Morgan Fox responded: \"We are enthusiastic that the Senator is moving forward on his promise to prioritize cannabis policy reform in the 117th Congress. It is our hope that the official introduction of CAOA jumpstarts hearings and debates in the Upper Chamber \u2014 debates that are long overdue.\" In past months, Senate leadership has received criticism for both the slow roll-out of the CAOA and for failing to sup-port efforts to enact more incremental federal legislation, such as The SAFE Banking Act, which has been passed mul-tiple times by the U.S. House of Representatives. NORML was among numerous groups that submitted comments in response to CAOA draft. Specifically , NORML called for: \u0081 Strengthening civic protections, including record relief, to provide justice to those previously wronged by federal marijuana criminalization; \u0081 Revising outdated employment poli- cies regarding non-scientific testing for trace metabolic elements of THC; \u0081 Ensuring that small and local busi- nesses can compete both with larger cor-porations and the unregulated market by reducing regulatory and tax burdens; \u0081 Narrowing the scope of the proposed excise tax to exempt medical cannabis consumer markets; \u0081 Balancing the roles of the FDA, TTB, ATF , and antitrust regulators in a manner that is consistent with other adult-use substances, such as alcohol or tobacco, to ensure non-disruption of currently operational state programs and promot-ing increased local ownership in the future iterations of the marketplace. As initially drafted, the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act directs the U.S. Attorney General to remove mari-juana from the federal Controlled Substances Act \u2014 thereby allowing states to either maintain or establish their own cannabis regulatory poli- cies free from undue federal interference. Under this scheme, state governments - if they choose to do so - can continue to impose criminal penalties for marijuana possession offenses. However, states would not be permitted to prohibit the interstate commerce of legal cannabis products transported through their bor-ders. The proposal also mandates for the expungement of the records of anyone convicted of a federal, non-violent mari-juana offense. The expungements must take place within one year of the law's enactment. The Act also forbids federal officials from taking discriminatory actions against those who legally use cannabis. It prohibits \"individuals from being denied any federal public benefit ... on the basis of [the] use or possession of cannabis.\" It also, for the first time, permits physicians associated with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to make recommenda-tions to their patients to access medical cannabis. The proposal transfers primary agency jurisdiction over cannabis regulation from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to the Food and Drug Administration and to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in manner similar to the ways in which these agen-cies already oversee alcohol and tobacco products. A federal excise tax of 10 per-cent would be imposed within the first year of the law's enactment. Medical cannabis access programs, which are operational in the majority of U.S. states, would not be disrupted under this feder-al plan. The proposed Senate plan is competing against two other House bills, The MORE Act and The States Reform Act, both of which also seek to deschedule cannabis at the federal level. The MORE Act previously was advanced by the U.S. House of Representative in the 116th Congress and is expected to be taken up again by House lawmakers in the coming weeks.

It may or may not be too much to expect laypersons to understand terms like Dealta-8 versus Delta-9 but explaining the fact that THC-based prod-ucts are the psychoactive components is not difficult to convey . 4. CBD and THC can be taken in any dosage regardless of what other medica-tions one uses. While there may be many benefits to the various cannabinoids, it is critical to emphasize that appropriate dos-ing with cannabis is just as important as it is with other prescribed or over-the-counter medications. As one would expect and hopefully understand, too lit-tle or too much may not achieve a desir-able effect. 5. All cannabis is the same. This goes without saying that the more we learn about the variations of the plant the more we need to educate others. For now , it is too easy for people to just think all cannabis is the same. One analogy I have used to begin this conversation is to think of the cannabis plant in the way you might think of a coffee bean. Coffee beans can grow in different geographies, under dif-ferent climates, with different cultivation methods. All coffee beans are not the same. 6. CBD will show up in a drug test. This may be one of the biggest fears that individuals have - the possibility of what-ever cannabinoid they take and no matter how they take it - it will lead to a positive drug test. While there are no absolutes, and certainly there is inaccurate labeling or no labeling with some products, this is an area that needs further factual clarifica-tion and may in fact be specific to one's occupation and what form of cannabis they are choosing to use in what manner. 7. Cannabis can cure any condition. It can't? Really? How about the irony that states can approve the use of medical mar-ijuana for certain conditions, but over-the-counter CBD products are not allowed to market their benefit for any medical con-dition? The fact is that by the very nature of having receptors throughout the body leads to the claims of symptomatic relief for many . An explanation of how this works can be helpful without getting too technical, with a disclaimer that cannabis is not a cure all for everything. 8. Medicinal and recreational marijua- na are the same thing. This is an area where we as educators, healthcare providers, and clinicians can play a major role in explaining the importance of pro-fessional oversight, advice and guidance for using cannabis to obtain optimal results. The difference here lies in one's purpose and goals. 9. It is not possible that the body has a new system. Very few of us who have migrated to the cannabis space went to school during a time when we were for-mally educated about the endocannabi-noid system. How is it possible that just 30 some years ago someone found a system in the body that we never knew about? Teaching an old dog new tricks is possible. New body system charts in all of our offices need to include the ECS alongside nervous, cardiovascular, digestive, etc. 10. Cannabis is illegal. No not all cannabis is illegal all of the time. Educating here involves more than Florida laws. A good number of individu-als flock here during the winter, vacation here and many of us from here travel else-where. Despite frequent changes in legis-lation, providing simple methods for peo-ple to understand what is legal, where it is legal, how it impacts travel, work and even possession are important.

Deals discussed and valuable information gleaned while hob- nobbing with like-minded people in a large conference hall often prove to be game changers, say scores of attendees at Benzinga events. \"We've seen cannabis businesses raise tens of millions of dol- lars at our events and this year's meeting will be even larger, with a record level of investment capital and top-notch opera-tors,\" said Chief Zinger Jason Raznick. In addition to the roomy expo floor to give more visibility to the brands that are shaping the cannabis space, attendees can also peel off to private meeting areas, or hunker down in the comfortable chairs and listen to an interview or fireside chat.

The cash deal includes the sale of substantially all of MedMen's Florida-based assets, including its license, dispensaries, inventory and cultiva-tion operations. Additionally , the Company agreed to license its trademarks in the state for a two-year period, subject to termination rights, for a quarterly revenue-based fee. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. The deal is expected to close in late April or early May 2022, pending the receipt of all required contractual consents and governmental approvals including the requisite change of ownership approval from the Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use. \"As MedMen continues to transform its business model and position itself for future growth, our go-forward strategy is going to include an asset-light model that enables us to leverage the power and strength of the MedMen brand,\" said Michael Serruya, MedMen's Chairman and Interim CEO. \"We feel confident this model will deliver strong financial results and opportunities for growth across many states and will continue to identify trade-mark licensing opportunities that will introduce the MedMen brand and retail experience to other markets across the United States and internationally .\" Subscribe to...

FALLON Yes, Florida cannabis con- struction is different and many of the initial license holders learned this truth the expen-sive way . Due to the diverse and intricate set of codes, Florida compliance regula-tions, and existing property conditions, it takes more than a tool belt to design and con-struct successful cannabis infrastructure in the unique Florida market. Partnering with a Florida- based, statewide cannabis-experienced general contractor, such as S.R. Construction Service (SRCS), brings familiarity with all phases of large-scale indoor cultivation, pro-cessing, retail construction and a keen awareness of the many Department of Health (DOH) requirements. This knowledge and experience is vital to ensure your infrastruc-ture plan is successfully executed delivering market share and ROI. Oswaldo Graziani Director of Marketing & Creative Fluent What benefits do you see for patients throughout Florida within this space? Cannabis is medicine, and it's all about providing communities with choices. Medical cannabis patients have the opportunity to choose between a variety of healthcare options beyond big pharma. Medical cannabis is positively changing people's lives every day . What motivates you to be a part of the cannabis Industry? There are a combination of factors that motivated me to join the industry . For starters, I'm a true believer in the powers of the plant--It has changed my life for the better and I want others to feel the benefits and positive influences too. Secondly , the cannabis industry is new and exciting, and it's really inspiring for a creative and marketing professional to tap into such an evolving space. Lastly , I truly believe Florida has enormous potential to become one of the most important cannabis states in the United States. We have it all: the population, the weather, and the demo-graphics.

JEFF G. KONIN It is likely that if you are reading this article, you too have realized that we all have a long way to go in educating the general public about many aspects of cannabis. I have found that in near every presentation that I give it is essential to revert back to the basics. Why? The bot-tom line is that for the most part the gen-eral public is not cannabis smart. This may or may not include the hundreds of thousands of medical marijuana patients in Florida, but it is essential to elevate the baseline knowledge of as many people as possible in order to remove the remaining stigmas associated with cannabis. Here is my top 10 list of cannabis myths and facts that should be a part of every educational presentation: 1. CBD is a drug that can get you high. The majority of the general public do not know what cannabinoids are or that there is any difference between THC and CBD, let alone what the difference actually is. Very simple explanations, factoid sheets, and educational materials can go a long way toward clarifying this myth. 2. There is no research to support any effectiveness of cannabis. The fact is if you type the word \"cannabis\" in a PubMed search it will yield 27,628 results! It that a lot? Yes. Could we benefit from more? Of course! It is important to disseminate what has been published with quality and strive to performs the studies that address the unanswered questions. 3. CBD has a psychoactive effect.
