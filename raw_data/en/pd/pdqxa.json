These events cause terror, intense fear, horror,helplessness, and physical stress reactions. The impact of these eventsdoes not simply go away when they are over. Instead, traumatic events areprofound experiences that change the way children, adolescents andadults see themselves and their world. From the time the trauma occurred, people with post-traumatic stress experience it in all stages of their life and in their day-to-day activities -parenting, working, socializing, attending appointments, and interper-sonal relationships. Trauma survivors are at risk of being re-traumatized in every social serv- ice and health care setting. This is due to a lack of knowledge about theeffects of traumatic events and a limited understanding of how to workeffectively with survivors. When re-traumatization happens, the system has failed survivors and leaves trauma survivors feeling misunderstoodand unsupported, which perpetuates a damaging cycle that prevents heal-ing an dgrowth. T his c an b eprevented with basic knowledge and by con- sidering trauma-informed language and practices. This h andbookaims t oprovide this knowledge for service providers who work with trauma survivors. Traumatic events impact everyone differently, but inevitably there will be some impact in some way. People experience trauma and the subsequent healing process subjectively. anormal response to abnormal events 9 Trauma-informed Introduction\"In a trauma-informed system, trauma is viewed not as a single, discrete event, but rather as a deningand organizing experience that forms the core of anindividual's identity. The far-reaching impact, andthe attempts to cope with the aftermath of the trau-matic experience, come to dene who the traumasurvivor is.\" (Harris & Fallot, 2001) In a tr aum a-informed system, practitioners assume that when a traum ahasoccurred, it changes the rules of the game. An individ- ual constr ucts a sense of self ,asense of other sandabelief about the w orld that incorporates, and is in many cases based on, the horricevent or events. This then informs other life choices and guides the development of particular coping strategies. The impact of trauma is thus felt throughout an individual's life in areas of functioning that may seem quite far removed from thetrauma, as well as in areas that are more obviously connected tothe trauma (Harris & Fallot, 2001). 10 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Purpose of this toolkit: 1This Toolkit provides recommended practices that will assist service providers and/or organizations to increase their capacity in delivering trauma-informed services. Trauma survivors and service providers have indicated the need for serv- ices and communities to be trauma informed through the implementationof more trauma-informed practices. The experience of trauma is so prevalent in our society that service providers can assume that a percentage of the people they work with havesurvived a trauma of some sort. This means that not only do we have theresponsibility to understand the impact of trauma, but we also require abasic understanding of recovery and how to help in a way that neithercauses harm (re-traumatization) nor completely ignores the impact andmeaning that the trauma has to the person. The more that organizations and service providers are trauma informed in Manitoba, the more that communities are able to deal with crises andemergencies.When c rises or emergencies happen, traumatized individu- als an dfamilies need effective support to deal with the impact immediate- ly.This w ill reduce negative impacts or threats of re-traumatization that can o ccur w hen si tuations are not handled with the best interests of the survivor in mind. When potentially traumatizing incidents are managed effectively, communities are strengthened and resilience is enhanced. Trauma-informed services are knowledgeable of and sensitive to trauma- related issues present in survivors. Atrauma-informed system is one in which all components of a given serv- ice system have been reconsidered and evaluated in the light of a basicunderstanding of the role that violence plays in the lives of people seekinghealth and addiction services. A trauma-informed system uses that infor-mation to design service systems that accommodate the vulnerabilities oftrauma survivors, and allows services to be delivered in a way that willavoid inadvertent re-traumatization and facilitate consumer participationin treatment (Harris & Fallot, 2001). anormal response to abnormal events 11 Trauma-informed Introduction When potentially traumatizingincidents aremanagedeffectively,communities are strengthenedand resilience is enhanced. 2The benets of providing trauma informed care, regardless of the setting, are many. While the benets to the client/patient are primary and may be obvious we should stop to consider for a moment the resulting benets to the indi-vidual service provider and the organization at large. It is not unusual forpeople affected by trauma to exhibit a variety of behaviours when takenout of their context are subject to misinterpretation and can result in acommunication breakdown and frustration on the part of the care/serviceprovider. People can be unfairly judged and perhaps even labeled. Some people's behaviour might be incorrectly and unfairly described as resistant, uncooperative, controlling, or manipulative. It is not unusualfor a service provider to become angry with the client/patient who may betrauma affected, question their own ability and doubt the person's moti-vation to change thus creating a potentially toxic situation both. If how-ever the service provider works from the vantage point of being traumainformed the understanding that comes from this awareness can reduce frustration, improve communication, enhance the quality of the relation-ship and increase work satisfaction. Investing in integrating a traumainformedperspective does not create more work but can instead make the work easier, and more satisfying. 3This T oolkit o utlines the imp ortance of acknowledging trau- matic experiences in the lives of clients, residents, patients, etc., tha tservices are provided to, and identifying appropriate responses that lead to healing and recovery of the whole person - mind, body and spirit. Atrauma-informed approach emphasizes understanding the whole indi- vidual and appreciating the context in which that person is living theirlife. Rather than asking, \"How do I understand this problem or this symp- tom?\" ,the service provider now asks, \"How do I understand this person?\" This approach shifts the focus to the individual and away from some par- ticular and limited aspect of their functioning. It also gives the messagethat their life is understandable and that behaviours make sense whenthey are understood as part of a whole picture (Harris & Fallot, 2001). 12 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed 4This Toolkit is centered on the trauma survivor, and how serv- ice providers can keep the needs of survivors at the center of their work. When trauma survivors seek help, they often face a hierarchy of expertise that includes many medical and mental health specialists. The survivorusually ends up at the bottom of this hierarchy with little voice or choicein what happens in their treatment process. Keeping the survivors part ofthe process ensures they are part of their own recovery. In summary, this Toolkit provides information on all aspects of trauma including what it is, its impacts, effective approaches to working with sur-vivors, trauma recovery, the impact on service providers of working withtrauma survivors, and information on resources and training. anormal response to abnormal events 13 Trauma-informed Introductionwhat this toolkit is NOT: This Toolkit is not intended to teach service providers to be counsellors, or to encourage them to step outside their scope of practice and developskills in the realm of psychotherapy. who this toolkit is intended for: Since trauma survivors exist in every human service, this Toolkit is intended for use by all service providers working with persons,families and/or communities who may be affected by trauma. This includes all health services, mental health services, counselling and ther-apy services, law enforcement services, Corrections services, dental serv-ices, members of the Clergy, administrative staff, volunteers, and paidstaff. how to use this toolkit: This T oolkitis a u ser-friendly information handbook intended to help service providers and organizations become trauma informed. It provides information on all aspects of trauma, including recovery and resources. Getting a ba sicunderstan ding o ftrauma, its impacts on clients, and how wecan better serve their needs is accomplished by reading the various sec- tions o fthis T oolkit. The sections are short and each is focused on a particular aspect of trau- ma, making it both easy to reference and more accessible in your work-space. Whether or not you consult the Toolkit repeatedly in your work, itis recommended that you review it from time to time to help you staytrauma informed. No matter how you use this Toolkit, it will help you contribute to the heal- ing and recovery of trauma survivors, families and communities. 14 Trauma-informed . . 32 ColonializationImp acts Sexual Abuse . . . . and Characteristics Essential to Working with Trauma Survivors Guidelines for Working with Trauma or events that by de- nition are out of the ordinary in terms of their over-whelming nature. They are more than merelystressful - they are also shocking, terrifying, anddevastating to the victim, resulting in profoundlyupsetting feelings of terror, shame, helplessness,and powerlessness.\" (Courtois, 1999) Atraumatic event involves a single experience, or enduring or repeated events, that completely overwhelm the individual's ability to cope or inte-grate the ideas and emotions involved in that experience. Recent research has revealed that emotional trauma can result from such common occurrences as an auto accident, sudden job loss, relationshiploss, a humiliating or deeply disappointing circumstance, the discovery of alife-threatening illness or disabling condition, or other similar situa- tions. Traumatizing events can take a serious emotional toll on those involved, even if th eevent did not cause physical damage. When the traumatic experience involves another person inflicting pain for their ownpleasure or selsh reasons, the survivor's beliefs about human- ity and the goodness in people is destroyed. This profoundly affects their identity, resulting in negative effects in mind, body, soul and spirit. Regardless of its source, an emotional trauma contains three common ele- ments: It was unexpected. The person was unprepared. There was nothing the person could do to stop it from happening. anormal response to abnormal events 17 Trauma-informed Whatistrauma? It is not the event that determines whether something istraumatic, but the individual's experience of the event.Simply put, traumatic events are beyond a person's control. It is not the event that determines whether something is traumatic to someone, but the individual's experience of the event. Those who have good coping skills, who feel supported after the event, and who had a chance to talk about and process the traumatic event, often goon to integrate the experience into their lives, like any other experience.Survivors who do not have this experience and do not express the associ-ated feelings are not able to integrate the traumatic event, and it becomessomething to be greatly feared and avoided. It is at this point that negativecoping behaviours start and may continue until a survivor decides to facethe difcult emotions that surround the traumatic experience. The impact of these events does not simply go away when they are over. Instead, traumatic events are profound experiences that shape the way aperson sees themselves, others, and the world. Because the traumatic experience was so terrible, it is normal for people to block the experience from their memory, or try to avoid any remindersof the trauma; this is how they survive. However, the consequences ofthesesurvival m echanisms are a lack of integration of the traumatic expe- rience, such that it becomes the experience in a person's life rather than oneofmany. This lack of processing of the trauma means that it is ever- presentforthesurvivor, and they feel as if the trauma happened yester- day when it could have been months or many years since. Who Can Be Traumatized? Anyone can be traumatized. No one is immune. It is widespread through- out the world and affects every part of the population. Individuals of all ages, walks of life, and sexual orientations (including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and two spirit*) can be profoundlyaffected. [The term \"two-spirit\" is an Aboriginal term referring to thosewho have both male and female spirits.] 18 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Anyone can be traumatized. No one is immune. It is widespread throughout the world and affectsevery part of the population.Families can be traumatized by an event happening to one or more of its members. Even people who did not directly experience the trauma can beimpacted by it, especially if they have a close relationship to the traumasurvivor. Communities can be traumatized when events affect any of its members. Cultures can be traumatized when repeated denigration, attempts at assimilation, and genocide occur. Service providers can be traumatized after hearing the stories and wit- nessing the suffering of trauma survivors. This is called \"vicarious trau-ma\" and happens when the provider is regularly confronted withtraumatic content. Who Perpetrates Abuse? In the case of sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect, we most often hear about girls being abused by men. And while this is highly prevalent in oursociety,wealsoneed to be aware of other victims of child sexual abuse and their perpetrators: Women can be offenders, perpetrating abuse on their male and femalechildren an dother children in their lives. Men can be victims of sexual abuse at the hands of any caregiver or older person. Teens and older children can perpetrate abuse against young chil- dren. Very old people can perpetrate abuse, and be victims themselves ofsexual abuse and assault. Those in positions of authority, such as members of the Clergy,teachers, coaches, therapists, doctors and caregivers, can also beperpetrators. anormal response to abnormal events 19 Trauma-informed whatistrauma?20 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Atrauma-informed service provider acknowledges and understands the effects of violence and traumaon tho se with whom they work.

When a human-service program becomes trauma- informed, every part of its organization, management andservice delivery system is assessed and potentially modi-fied to include a basic understanding of how traumaimpacts the life of an individual who is seeking services.Trauma-informed organizations are based on an under-standing of the vulnerabilities or triggers of trauma sur-vivors that traditional service delivery approaches mayexacerbate, so that their services and programs can bemore supportive and avoid re-traumatization (NationalMental Health Information Centre, 2008).

Research onthe impact of trauma on various populations indicates that the greatmajority of those not immediately and personally affected by a terribletragedy sustain no lasting damage. Most of those involved in witnessingor being a part of devastating events are able, in the long term, to ndways of going on with their lives with little change in their capacity tolove, trust, and hope for their future. People can develop PTSD when, instead of facing and dealing with the sit- uation, they react to traumatic events by emotionally blocking them dur-ing and after the trauma. This allows the experience to dominate how theyorganize their lives and causes them to perceive most subsequent stress-ful life events in the light of their prior trauma. Focusing on the past inthis w ay gradually robs their lives of meaning and pleasure. The description and symptoms of PTSD go all the way back to Ancient Greece.However, it was not until 1980 that the cluster of symptoms clas- siedas a mental illness after the suffering of Vietnam War veterans was incorporated into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American P sychiatric Association. Imp actdepends on the age and development of the person and the source ofthe trauma i.e. whether the trauma was relational and perpetrated by a close other, a natural disaster, war, or by a person outside of the family. anormal response to abnormal events 27 Trauma-informed PTSDThe diagnosis of PTSD usually focuses on three ele- ments: 1The repeated reliving of memories of the trau- matic experience in images, smells, sounds, and physical sensations. These are usually accompanied byextreme physiological states, as well as psychological stressthat may include trembling, crying, fear, rage, confusion,or paralysis - all which lead to self-blame. 2Avoidance of reminders of the trauma, as well as emotional numbing or detachment. This is associated with an inability to experience pleasure and with a generalwithdrawal from engagement with life. 3Apattern of increased arousal, as expressed by hyper vigilance, irritability, memory and concentra- tion problems, sleep disturbances, and an exaggerated star- tle response. Hyper arousal causes traumatized people tobecome easily distressed by minor irritations. Their per-ceptions confuse the present and traumatic past, such that traumatized people react to many ordinary frustrations as if th eyweretraumatic events. The core issue of PTSD is that certain sensations or emotions related to traumatic experiences are dissociated, keep returning, and do not fade with time. People with PTSD seem unable to put an event behind them and minimize its impact. They may not realize that their present intense feelings are related to the past, so they may blame their present surround-ings for the way they feel. PTSD can be placed on a continuum from minimal traumatic impact to moderate effects, to high or complex PTSD that includes additional symp-toms associated with severe long-term childhood trauma, i.e., sexual andphysical abuse, residential school experience. The more prolonged the trauma and the more interpersonal in nature, the more severe the impact will be. 28 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed anormal response to abnormal events 29 Trauma-informed Those who have fewer traumatic experiences and were able to address the impact of the event either at the time it occurred or sometime later, willbe closer to the lower end of the continuum. As the frequency and dura-tion of traumatic events increase, so do the negative impacts and symp-toms. When children experience trauma and their caregivers address itshortly after it occurred, the likelihood of developing PTSD is lower. Complex PTSD is at the far end of the continuum and is characterized by ahistory of severe, long-term trauma that usually includes exposure to caregivers who were cruel, inconsistent, exploitive, unresponsive or vio-lent. Survivors struggle with more chronic likeself-harm, s ubstan ceabuse, and suicidal behaviours.PTSDPTSD Continuum minimal impact moderate effects high or complex PTSDtrauma trauma trauma Trauma TRAUMA30 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Many thousands of Aboriginal children were taken from their families and enrolled in the residentialschool system during its existence.

These experiences happenduring the developing years of infancy, childhood and adolescence, andare perpetrated by trusted adults and/or older gures in the person's life. Given that children are completely dependent on the adults in their lives for survival, trauma that occurs at this stage of life deeply impacts identi-ty and shapes beliefs about self and the world. Development is severelynegatively affected, resulting in many problems in most areas of life thatcontinue through all the stages of development into adulthood. The experience of many Aboriginal people in Canada due to forced atten- dance at residential school encompasses all types of developmental traumas. Historic Trauma: The Legacy of Residential Schools \"Our dignity was taken away... and a lot of people don't realize that. They don't really understand about how our dignity wastakenawayfromus, how we were taught to be ashamed to be Natives. Then our self-respect was gone. Once you lose your self-respect, how can you respect someone else? Then you take your frustrations out on other people.\" (Elder, 1998) Colonialization Given the high population of Aboriginal people living in Manitoba, it is crucial that service providers have an understanding of the profoundeffects of colonialization in Aboriginal people. Colonialization itself is acollectively experienced trauma. There are important historical factorsthat surround the experience of being Aboriginal in Canada. The term \"Aboriginal\" includes M\u00e9tis, Inuit and First Nations, regardless of where they live in Canada and regardless of whether they are \"regis-tered\" under the Indian Act of Canada.Many thousands of Aboriginal children were taken from their families and enrolled in the residential school system during its existence. While themajority of these children were status Indians, attendance also includedmany Inuit, M\u00e9tis and non-status Indians. Regardless of the precise num-ber of people involved, Aboriginal people across the country have paid ahigh price, both individually and collectively for the government's mis-guided experiment in cultural assimilation (Aboriginal HealingFoundation, 2003). In 1867, Canada instituted a policy of Aboriginal assimilation designed to transform communities from \"savage\" to \"civilized\". Canadian law forcedAboriginal parents under threat of prosecution to send their children tothe schools. The residential schools prohibited the use of Aboriginal lan-guages, as well as the observance of their traditions and customs. Childrendid not see their family members for months and even years at a time. From the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, residential school was the norm for Aboriginal people. They were operated by religious orders in the earlier years and then moved to total governmental control in later years. Atrocities th atoccurred in schools are numerous, including physical abuse, neglect, torture, murder, and sexual abuse at the hands of the staff. Despitethe fact that abuses were directed toward specic individuals, theywerepartofalarger project to suppress Aboriginal culture and iden- tity in its entirety. Although this effort was not successful, Aboriginal communities continue to feel the impact of what some call attempted \"cul- tural genocide\". Impacts The impacts of the residential school experience are intergenerational - passed on from generation to generation. Parents who were forced to sendtheir children to the schools had to deal with the devastating effects ofseparation and total lack of input in the care and welfare of their children.Many of the children suffered atrocities from the staff, but also sustainedfurther abuse as a consequence of the curriculum that stripped them oftheir native languages and culture. This caused additional feelings ofalienation, shame and anger that were passed down to their children andgrandchildren. anormal response to abnormal events 33 Trauma-informed ExamplesThe effects of trauma tend to ripple outward from the victims to those who surround them, and among residential school survivors, the consequences ofemotional, physical and sexual abuse continue to be felt in each subsequentgeneration. Deep, traumatic wounds exist in the lives of many Aboriginalpeople who were taught to be ashamed just because they were Aboriginal. The impacts are felt at individual, family and community levels: Individual Iisolation/alienation Ishame Ianger toward school Ilow of Iloss of connectedness with languages and traditions Iloss of togetherness and collective support Iloss of support from Elders Ilack of control over land and resources Iincreased suicide rate Ilack of communal raising of children Ilack of initiative Idependency on others Icommunal violence 34 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Because the impacts of residential schools are intergenerational, many Aboriginal people were born into families and communities that had beenstruggling with the effects of trauma for many years. These are reinforcedby the racist attitudes that continue to permeate Canadian society. Hope and resilience Despite the legacy of residential schools, there are many reasons to be hopeful. The experience of residential schools for some Aboriginal peoplehas strengthened their identity and caused communities to come togeth-er to implement healing initiatives that address aspects of the residentialschool legacy. Resilience is evident in the steps Aboriginal people havetaken to counteract negative outcomes. Many former students have foundsupport in Elders and healing circles. They have also opted to share mem-ories and stories with other former students, pursue further education,relearn Aboriginal languages, and follow spiritual paths to reinforceAboriginal identity (Aboriginal Healing Foundation, 2003). The cycle of trauma is being broken as the stories of trauma are being told and the many strengths of Aboriginal cultures are being used to heal. The Experience of Immigrants and Refugees \"I came t oCanadatond peace. I've climbed the ladder of peace and I thought that would be all. I ran from flames, but now I'm faced w ith hidden flames. Integration is like that.\" (Somali refugee, 2006) Given that immigrants and refugees are a signicant and growing part of our Canadian population, it is crucial that service providers and servicesystems acknowledge trauma in these groups by being knowledgeableabout their experiences in their home country and their experience ofmigration and settling in Canada. An immigrant is a person who has been granted the right to live in Canada permanently by Canadian immigration authorities. There are many differ-ent classes of immigrants depending on the circumstances under whichthe immigrant has come to Canada. anormal response to abnormal events 35 Trauma-informed Examples The cycle of trauma is being broken as thestories of trauma are being told and the manystrengths of Aboriginal cultures arebeing used to heal.Citizenship and Immigration Canada's denition of a Convention Refugee is based on the United Nation's denition: A person who, by reason of awell-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality,membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, is (a) out-side their country of nationality and unable, or by reason of that fear,unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country; or (b) nothaving a country of nationality, is outside the country of their formerhabitual residence and unable, or by reason of that fear, unwilling toreturn to that country. Immigrants and refugees face similar experiences in their home countries and in the process of settling in the new country. However, becauserefugees are fleeing extremely traumatic conditions, almost all of themhave experienced losses and may have suffered multiple traumatic experi-ences, including torture. Their vulnerability to isolation is exacerbated bypoverty, grief, and the lack of education, literacy and skills in the languageof the receiving country (Robertson et al., 2006). Immigrants (non-refugee status) may have faced the same issues as refugees, and the two groups share the same experience of having to set-tlein a f oreigncountry. Issues related to trauma that they have already experienced can be compounded by the following circumstances and chal- lenges faced in the integration process: Inot understanding Canadian cultural norms Ifeeling th atthehost country doesn't understand their culture, or make any efforts to do so Ifacing constant racism that is deeply rooted in Canadian society Ifeeling unwelcome in Canada Inding adequate employment Ilearning English or French Ilack of recognition of education Inding adequate housing Ifew family supports Idealing with bureaucracy Ifeeling isolated Iinadequate childcare 36 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Idifculties enrolling children in school Igrief of missing family in their home country and not seeing family for years at a time Inding themselves living in lower living standards due to low income Ilack of societal acceptance of religious beliefs and prac- tices Ifacing continued family violence Idealing with negative comments by politicians, the media, or in private conversations that reflect negativepublic opinions about immigrants and refugees For those who faced discrimination, punishment and torture in their home country, some additional issues may include: Icontinued discrimination in Canada Idistrust of the Canadian government because it could have been responsible for their maltreatment in thehome country Ifeelings of shame Ifeeling guilty for having survived when other family and communitymemb ersmayhave been killed Ifeeling they need to prove how bad the situation was at hometostayin Canada and the associated fear of depor- tation Iliving with the physical, psychological and emotional consequences of trauma while trying to negotiate settle- ment and integration (Canadian Council for Refugees, 2002) Iliving with little or no information about the welfare of family members in life-threatening situations Iconstantly wondering when they will be reunited with their families Ibeing stuck for years without permanent status in Canada anormal response to abnormal events 37 Trauma-informed ExamplesAll of these issues contribute to a difcult transition into Canadian socie- ty. For trauma survivors, their traumatic issues may not be addressed atall due to all the other issues that refugees and immigrants face on a dailybasis. Additionally, survivors may not feel comfortable asking for help dueto the lack of understanding of their culture by service providers and/orthe image of weakness that this may invoke in their own culture. As service providers, we can be helpful even though we do not understand the specics of every culture represented in Manitoba. If we understandsurvivors' issues from their perspective and make a concerted effort tounderstand their cultural interpretations of the traumatic events, thenthat will guide our work with them. It is the survivors' interpretation ofthe trauma that is important and helps us understand both the impact ofthe trauma now and how we can be helpful. In summary, service providers working with trauma survivors have a responsibility to be aware of the many challenges that immigrant andrefugees face as they try to integrate into Canadian society. Displaying this knowledge and willingness to learn will help form a solid helping rela-tionship essential to trauma recovery. 38 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed As service providers, wecan be helpfuleven though we do notunderstand the specifics of every culture.The Far-Reaching Effects of Trauma: Prevalence Many statistics are available in Canada on sources of trauma such as war and family violence. Incidences of violence and abuse are generally under-reported, especially in the areas of sexual abuse and sexual assault. It hasbeen well established that because of the stigma and shame associatedwith trauma, current statistics only reflect reported data and not neces-sarily the actual number of cases. The following statistics are primarily drawn from national and provincial sources and are intended to provide a general understanding of trendsonly. PTSD: IAccording to the Canadian Mental Health Association, about 1 in 10 people in Canada have PTSD. ISome people can experience symptoms without develop- ing the full-blown disorder. IAbout 5 to 10 percent of people may have some symp- toms w ithout developing high levels of the disorder. IWomen are twice as likely as men to develop PTSD (CBC News,2006). Canadian Forces: IMoreCanadian soldiers than ever are presenting with psychiatric disabilities such as PTSD. More than 8,500 pensions have been awarded, representing an increase of 2,100 since 2001. Veterans' Affairs say 30 percent ofpensions go to veterans from World War II and theKorean War, but Canada's mission in Afghanistan is alsoboosting the numbers. According to the MilitaryOmbudsman's Ofce in Canada, the rate of PTSD amongCanada's peacekeepers is as high as 20 percent. IThere is no centralized Canadian Forces (CF)-wide process in place to collect up-to-date statistics on thenumber of current and former CF members who havebeen diagnosed with PTSD or other stress-induced anormal response to abnormal events 39 Trauma-informed Prevalence Incidences of violence andabuse aregenerallyunderreported,especially in theareas of sexualabuse and sexual assault. injuries. However, in 2002, CF was surveyed by Statistics Canada to determine the prevalence of PTSD and otherconditions. The survey found that in 2001, 2.8 percentof the regular force and 1.2 percent of the reservists hadsymptoms of PTSD. The more missions soldiers hadembarked on, the more likely they were to develop PTSD(Canadian Community Health Survey, 2002). Refugees: IAccording to trends and statistics regularly released by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the number ofrefugees around the world had increased by the end of2006 to almost 10 million, the highest in ve years. ICanada generally accepts more than 25,000 refugees a year, and over the past ve years has granted permanentresidence to more than 147,000 refugees (Citizenshipand Immigration Canada, 2007). IRefugees come to Canada primarily from Africa, the Middle East, and South America. IIn 2006, 1,208 refugees came to Manitoba (Province of Manitoba,2007) Immigrants: IIn 2006, M anitoba r eceived9,989 immigrants, an increase of 23.4 percent over the previous year. IManitoba als oreceived 50 percent of all provincial nom- inees who came to Canada. IManitoba's top immigrant source countries were the Philippines, Germany, India, China and Korea. Sexual assault: IThe General Social Survey of 2004 suggests that only 8 percent of sexual assault incidents in that year werereported to police. IRates of reported sexual assault have declined since 1993. 40 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Family violence: Partner Violence (Statistics Canada, 2004, 2005, 2007) IAccording to the 2004 General Social Survey, it is esti- mated that 7 percent of Canadians 15 years of age andover in a current, previous or common-law union experi-enced spousal violence in the previous 5 years,unchanged from 1999. IIn 1999, it was found that 4 percent of both men and women in current marital or common-law relationshipsexperienced either physical or sexual violence from theirpartner. In 2004, there was no signicant change in ratesfor either women or men in current relationships. ISurvey data from 2004 show that rates of spousal vio- lence are highest among those who are common-law andwho have a previous partner/spouse. IAboriginal people were three times more likely to be vic- tims of spousal violence than were those who were non- Aboriginal (21 percent versus 7 percent). IIn 2004, 36 percent of Aboriginal people experienced emotional ornancial abuse, which is much higher than thatof non-Aboriginal people, visible minorities, and immi grantpopulations. IEmotional abuse and/or controlling behaviour are often pre-cursors to violence in a relationship. IEmotional or nancial abuse was 2.5 times more com- mon between partners than physical violence. Both women and men reported emotional and nancial abuse. IBeing called names or being put down is one of the strongest predictors of family violence. Child Abuse (Statistics Canada, 2007; The Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect, 2003) IRates of sexual assault and sexual abuse are more than 5 times higher for children and youth than for adults. IRates of physical abuse are slightly lower than for adults. IPerpetrators of violence are part of the immediate envi- ronment of children and youth. anormal response to abnormal events 41 Trauma-informed PrevalenceIParents are the most common perpetrators of violence. IIn 2005, male family members were identied as the accused in 97 percent of all family-related sexual assaultsand 71 percent of physical assaults; female family mem-bers were accused in 3 percent of family-related sexualassaults and 29 percent of physical assaults. IResearch estimates that 1 in 6 boys is sexually abused (Klinic Community Health Centre, 2005). IAccording to the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect 2003, which consisted ofreports from Child Welfare workers, substantiated casesof child abuse broke down in the following percentages: neglect: 30 percent exposure to domestic abuse: 28 percent physical abuse: 24 percent emotional abuse: 15 percent sexual abuse: 3percent Older Adults (Statistics Canada, 2004, 2007) IMale seniors experience higher levels of violence. ITheonlyviolentoffence for which senior females expe- rienced higher rates than males was for sexual assault. ISeniorwomen experience higher rates of family-inflicted abuse. IMost senior victims know their perpetrator. IAnadultchildcommits most family violence against seniors. Residential School: IThe last federally run residential school closed in 1996. IThere are 80,000 people alive today who attended resi- dential schools (Indian Residential Schools Resolution,2006). IOf the 19,220 Indian Residential School Claims led against the Government of Canada by former students,7,257 have been resolved (Indian Residential SchoolsResolution, 2006). IThe average age of claimants is 57 years old (Assembly of First Nations). 42 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed The Effects of Trauma The effects of being traumatized are very individual, and survivors are impacted physically, emotionally, behaviourally, cognitively and spiritually.

I spent those years living in constant fear, and there was no one to talk tobecause I was afraid my family wouldn't believe me and blameme like he did. He's dead, and it was a long time ago, but I stillfeel like I'm back there sometimes. I feel like a damaged, used-up person. I just want to feel whole instead of all over the place.\" (Trauma survivor, 2008) Sexual abuse survivors experience additional effects due the sexual nature of their experiences - additional shame, self-blame, and self-hatred.Survivors have to contend with feeling dirty and damaged, a direct resultof the messages the perpetrator instilled in them. The abuse usuallyoccurs over a period of time in secret, is perpetrated by a trusted adult,and is a deep, dark secret the survivor will have hidden for a very longtime. To be \"informed about trauma\" when working with abuse survivors means to know the history of past and current abuse in the life of a person withwhomyouareworking.This information allows for more holistic and integrated services. Being trauma-informed also means understanding therolethat violence and victimization plays in the lives of survivors (Harris & F allot,2001). Perpetrators of violence and abuse often make recurring statements to their victims that blame them and place them at the centre of the respon- sibility for the abuse. They say things like, \"You deserve this\", \"I know you want this\", and \"You asked for this\". Children cannot ask to be sexuallyabused, nor can they say \"no\" to an adult or older person who has totalcontrol over them. Victims live in fear of their perpetrators who make ter-rifying threats against them to ensure that their victims do not disclosethe abuse to anyone. In a young person's world, this is all that they know.They obey the perpetrator because, in their mind, their very survivaldepends on it. In reality, their dependency is often used against them. These feelings and fears are carried into adult life, as are the behaviours the victims used to survive. Many child abuse survivors dene themselves anormal response to abnormal events 45 Trauma-informed Sexualized Being trauma- informed also means understandingthe role plays in the lives of survivors.46 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed The effects of Traumaby these abusive experiences, and still live from day to day as if they are just surviving and living in fear of further victimization. Self-destructive behaviours are common survival mechanisms. Self-harm- ing, for example, is a coping mechanism developed to manage intenseemotional pain resulting from the experience of being abused by thosewho were the most important people in the child's life. For those who donot have the emotional capacity to work through their difcult emotionsand experiences, self-harming activities such as cutting, burning andbruising parts of the body provide immediate help in the short term. The horric memories of the abuse accompany child abuse survivors daily, and are often manifested in nightmares and flashbacks that make themfeel as if the abuse is happening again. This is the brain's way of dealingwith overwhelming experiences and feelings that must be processed, butsurvivors often avoid dealing with these feelings out of fear of losing con-trol. Child abuse survivors often feel and behave in a way that makes them seem \"unstable\" because they have great difculty regulating their emo-tional sta tes,whichswing from one extreme to another. Men an dwomen have many common effects, but there are differences in howtheyexperience and interpret the abuse, and how they and others see themselves in the world. Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder can occur: Ithe earlier the abuse, Ithe more prolonged it was, Ithe closer the relationship with the perpetrator, and Ithe more severe the violence. IChronic suicidal behaviours, self-harming behaviours, relationship problems, addictions and depression arecommonly associated with this disorder.Issues for Male Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse It is difcult to know how widespread male sexual abuse is because it often goes unreported. In our society, men are portrayed as strong,unemotional, tough, and heroic, and there is great pressure on them tomaintain this image, even at the risk of neglecting their own emotionalneeds. For male survivors of sexual abuse, getting help is difcult andoften avoided for fear of appearing weak. It is important to differentiate the effects of sexual abuse on men because they are more likely to be overlooked. Men also tend to bottle emotions,which leads to high-risk behaviours including more completed suicidesand violent behaviour. There are many myths in our society about men being victims of abuse. If service providers believe in these myths, this will prevent them from pro-viding knowledgeable and sensitive services to male survivors of sexualabuse. These myths hold a lot of power and may create obstacles for mentotalk about their experiences. Common myths about men as victims of abuse Myth: Men w ho have been sexually abused will eventually sexuallyoffend against others. Fact:Most peoplewhohave been sexually abused do not abuse children as adults. It is a small minority of men who eventuallygo on to perpetrate sexual abuse. Myth: Most sexual abuse is perpetrated by \"dirty old men\". Fact: Sexual abuse is perpetrated against boys by anyone in a position of power in relation to them. Myth: Men who have experienced sexual abuse are, or will become, gay or bisexual. Fact: Sexual abuse is an act of violence where sexual acts are the weapon. The abuse itself is not about sex, butpower. Therefore, there is no impact on sexual orientation. anormal response to abnormal events 47 Trauma-informed SexualizedMyth: Childhood sexual abuse rarely happens to boys. Fact: Research estimates that 1 in 6 boys is sexually abused (Klinic, 2005). Myth: Boys sexually abused by an adult female enjoyed it. Fact: Sexual abuse is never enjoyable. Abuse is nonconsen- sual and violating, but because the body is designed torespond to stimulations, physical reactions such as ejacula-tion can occur. This is not under the survivor's control andcontributes to shame and self-blame. The impact of these myths on boys and men It is impossible to effectively work toward trust and safety with a trauma survivor if service providers believe the myths about abused men andboys that are prevalent in our society. These beliefs cause harm to traumasurvivors. As long as these myths continue to be believed and replicated,male survivors of sexual abuse will be less likely to get the recognition andhelp they need, and the cycle of guilt, shame, anger and silence will con- tinue. Foranymalesurvivorwho has been sexually abused, overcoming these myths is an essential part of recovery. This can only happen, however, with p roviders who are willing to educate and support male survivors in their healing p rocess. 48 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Effects of Sexual Abuse Physical Ipain in the genital areas or anywhere on the body where abuse occurred Iextreme discomfort in medical exams Ichronic pain Iunexplained medical problems Ino sexual pleasure Ishakiness of love others Ifeel lik ean o utsider/mist Iself-hatred Ifear Isubstance abuse Iover-engaging in relationships/refusal to to friends family Iself-destructive behaviours Isuicide attempts Iaggression and hostility Ibreaking the law anormal response to abnormal events 49 Trauma-informed SexualizedCognitive \"Effects of Trauma\" section (page 43) Spiritual Ifeeling permanently damaged Ilacking a sense of identity outside the abuse context Idoubting the existence of God Ifeeling soulless Ifeeling evil Istops practising faith The effects of traumatic exposure depend on both the developmental level of the individual when the trauma occurred, and who the perpetrator was.Some people may have been abused as far back as they can remember, while others will remember times before the abuse started. If a person hadsome support and understanding from signicant people in their lives atthetimethetraumaoccurred, the impact will most likely be less than a survivor who had no support or understanding when the abuse was dis- closedto the family and community. In our role as service providers we do notwanttocontinue with the denial of trauma. When we acknowledge its presence, we can make a difference for someone in pain. 50 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Co-occurring Disorders: Substance Abuse and Trauma \"I started using drugs and alcohol, or anything I could get my hands on, when I was 13. I found it was the only way that Icould deal with my Mom's temper, and it took the edge off of theanger and sadness, but now I'm really messed up, and nd thatthe memories are still there and so are the feelings I had when Iwas 13, but I'm 42. I've never felt so stuck....\" (Trauma survivor, 2003) The term \"co-occurring disorder\" refers to the abuse/dependence of sub- stance use and mental disorders. Co-occurring disorders are so common with trauma survivors that they should be considered expectedrather than an exception. They are associated with a variety of negative outcomes, including high relapse rates, hospitalization, violence, incarceration, homelessness, andserious infectious diseases (CODI, 2004). Currently it is estimated that 4 million people in the United States have a co-occurring disorder, but this number could be as high as 10 million (SAMHS A). Personsdiagnosed with co-occurring disorders have one or more mental disorders, as well as one or more disorders relating to alcohol or substance abuse. People with a lifetime history of PTSD have elevated rates of co-occurring disorders. Among men with PTSD, rates of co-occurring alcohol abuse ordependence are the highest. Research also shows that PTSD is a risk fac-tor for substance abuse and addiction. Substance abuse is very common amongst trauma survivors because it is aquick way to numb feelings and avoid the profound emotional pain and suffering. When an addiction is present, assessment should consider anyexisting traumatic impacts. anormal response to abnormal events 51 Trauma-informed Substanceabuse Substance abuse is very commonamongst trauma survivors because it is aquick way to numb feelings and avoid theprofound emotional painand suffering. In mental health programs, it is estimated that 25 to 50 percent of people have a substance use disorder. This is mirrored in drug treatment facilitieswhere it is estimated that 50 to 75 percent of people have a mental disor-der. The two issues cannot be separated because they are so closely interwov- en: If the person were not dealing with trauma, they would not feel theneed to use substances to cope. One issue triggers the other. For example, sobriety often reveals unre- solved memories and emotional pain. These flood the addicted individualwho then uses substances, alcohol, and addicting behaviours to regulateand numb their emotions. Many mental illnesses are born out of unresolved trauma from childhood. For many people, disorders such as depression, personality disorders, andanxiety disorders are directly related to a history of unresolved trauma. Itishere where treatment addresses only the current symptoms and not the root cause. According to Judith Herman, \"Survivors of childhood abuse,like other traumatized people, are frequently misdiagnosed and mistreat-edin th emental h ealth system. Because of the number and complexity of their symptoms, their treatment is often fragmented and incomplete.\" (Herman, 1992 p .123) This demonstrates the strong link between trauma, mental illness, and substan ceabuse. Because the root cause is not addressed, people use sub- stan ces to manage the pain and push down the memories and negative feelings associated with the trauma. This becomes a negative circle that keeps the person stuck until both the trauma and the substance abuseissues are treated. These issues can and should be treated at the same time so that the sur- vivor doesn't work on one issue while the other is being neglected. Thesource of the psychological pain must be addressed to positively impactreduction of substance use. When this doesn't happen, survivors often fallthrough the cracks of the social service and health systems and receivepoor care. The attitude of \"You must get clean before you can work onyour trauma issues\" keeps survivors stuck. 52 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed It is important to let survivors know that it's normal to use substances to cope with the overwhelming emotions, and that help exists for reducingor stopping substance use and for addressing the traumatic issues. CODI The Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders Initiative of Manitoba (CODI) was undertaken as a partnership project of theWinnipeg Regional Health Authority, The Addictions Foundation ofManitoba, and Manitoba Health. This is a systems change model that iscommitted to the Comprehensive, Continuous and Integrated System ofCare, an integrated mental health and substance abuse philosophy thataims to efciently use existing resources and utilize best practices. Part ofthis process is a comprehensive training program for service providers inmental health and addictions services. There are eight best practice prin-ciples and accompanying clinical training guidelines. This training isoffered regularly in the City of Winnipeg. Please see the Training area ofthis T oolkit for more information (page 82). anormal response to abnormal events 53 Trauma-informed Substanceabuse54 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed \"It's like I can live without fear of being harmed again. Sometimes I still feel scared, but I know that Iam str onger now and I'm a better person for having gone through it. I feel like my recovery is well on itswaynow.\" (Trauma survivor, 2008)Trauma Recovery Recovery is the core goal for trauma survivors, their families, and their treatment providers. Recovery does not necessarily mean complete free-dom from post-traumatic issues. However, it does mean regaining theunderstanding, support, and practical assistance so that trauma survivorscan nd within themselves a genuine basis for hope, as well as personal,relational and spiritual renewal (Connecticut Department of MentalHealth and Addictions Services). Important Aspects of Trauma Recovery Herman (1992) conceives trauma recovery to proceed in three stages: ISafety and Stabilization IRemembrance and Mourning IReconnection Safety and Stabilization The central task of recovery is safety. Clients may feel they lack control over their emotions and other issues that stem from the unresolved trauma. Helpingclientstorealizewhat areas of their life need to be stabilized and how that will beaccomplished will help the client move toward recovery. For example: Iatraumasurvivor struggles with containing difcult emo- tions in e verydaylife that stem from the trauma Iaservice provider helps the survivor contain these emotions Itheywork together as a team to stabilize the emotions so thesurvivor can move on with the recovery process. This process takes time and varies from person to person. ISome people who experienced trauma, particularly com- plex trauma, nd that speaking about their experience orthe impact of their experience emotionally overwhelming.Recently, both therapists and researchers have been explor-ing nonverbal ways to foster emotional regulation. Severalstudies have suggested that Mindfulness Based StressReduction (MBSR) groups and the use of acupuncture forclients with PTSD reduce negative emotions and promote amore calm appraisal of life situations (Hollield, 2007 andDavidson et. al., 2003). These practices work well with anormal response to abnormal events 55 Trauma-informed Recoverymore traditional talk therapies allowing greater stability throughout recovery. Auricular acupuncture has the addedadvantage of reducing cravings for alcohol and drugs as wellas promoting better sleep and clearer thinking among clientswho receive it regularly (Stuyt, 2005). It is also well suited forsupporting work with refugees and immigrants in that it isnonverbal and closer to the methods of traditional medicinefound in their own cultures. Remembrance and Mourning When clients feel stable, the task shifts to recounting the trauma, putting words and emotions to it, and making meaning of it. This process is usually undertak-enwith a counsellor or therapist in individual and/or group counselling. Reconnection The nal stage of recovery involves redening oneself in the context of meaningful relationships. Trauma survivors gain closure on their experi-ences when they are able to see the things that happened to them with the knowledge that these events do not determine who they are. They are liber-ated by the belief that, regardless of what happened to them, they alwayshavethems elves. In m anyinstan ces,survivors nd a mission through which they can contin- uetoheal an dgrow,such as talking to youth, or peer mentoring. Successful resolution of the effects of trauma is a powerful testament to the resiliency ofthehum an s pirit. Other aspects of trauma recovery IAssist the client in connecting with services that are central to recovery: health and mental health services, addictions serv-ices, therapeutic services, crisis services, culturally appropri-ate/relevant services, traditional healing services. IPartner with the client as they dene what recovery means to them. IConsider the client's cultural context and include social sup- ports that help them connect to the community. IEncourage and assist the client in connecting with them- selves, safe family members, friends, culture and communityin a m eaningful way. 56 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Successful resolution of the effects of trauma is a powerfultestament to the resiliency of the human spirit.The Resilience of Trauma Survivors \"Being a trauma survivor means that I have remarkable coping skills, intuition, and resiliency. Contrary to what many (includ-ing other survivors) may think, trauma survivors can be, andoften are, highly functioning individuals. Even though we some-times have an inability to care for ourselves and make safechoices, this does not mean we are strangers to ourselves and donot know our needs.\" (Trauma survivor, Provincial Trauma Forum, 2007) Too often, programs focus so intently on the problems that they miss the strengths and resilience people bring to the human service setting. Just aswe spend time and energy on focusing on the impact of trauma, we mustspend equal time on how people survived the experience, the strengthsthey have developed from having survived it, and how that resiliency has,or will help, in their recovery. Traditional helping approaches highlight pathology or illness, and inad- vertently give the impression that there is something wrong with a personrather th anthatsomething wrong was done to the person (Elliot, et al., 2005). W hen working with survivors of trauma, it is crucially important tomakethedistinction between who they are as human beings and what wasdonetothem. Sur vivors tend to blur these lines and it is our task to make this distinction clear in our work with them. Trauma-informed practice recognizes symptoms as originating from adaptations to the traumatic event(s) or context. Validating resilience is important even when past coping behaviours are now causing problems.Understanding a symptom as an adaptation reduces a survivor's guilt andshame, increases their self-esteem, and provides a guideline for develop-ing new skills and resources to allow new and better adaptations to thecurrent situation (Elliot, et al., 2005). The language we use when speaking with trauma survivors should also reflect resilience. The term \"survivor\" was coined to counteract the senseof powerlessness that \"victim\" implies. anormal response to abnormal events 57 Trauma-informed ResilienceCommon traumatic experiences in communities can be a uniting force that builds collective resiliency and is viewed as strength- and capacity-building. Working from a resilience-minded perspective helps trauma survivors realize that they have the skills they need to heal and recover. However,many survivors do not see these and need their coping behaviours andknowledge reframed from weakness to strength. This is a chief part oftrauma-informed practice. 58 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Working from aresilience- mindedperspectivehelps trauma survivors realize that they havethe skills they need to heal and recover.Service Providers: qualities and characteristics essential to working with trauma survivors \"A big part of my recovery and decision to start dealing with my past was talking to my Minister. He helped me to feel comfort-able, like I was normal, and I was accepted by him uncondition-ally, even though I talked about doing drugs and crime. Heseemed to really listen and I never felt bad or stupid aroundhim. This was a new experience for me. I still keep in contactwith him and do talks at the AA meetings at the Church.\" (Trauma survivor, 2001) Working with trauma survivors is tough work, and can be emotionally draining. The stories and situations that they may describe can make aprovider feel many emotions, including sadness, pity, frustration, hope-lessness, anger and disbelief. The skills and characteristics outlined belowareessential in building strong relationships with trauma survivors. Strong provider/survivor relationships are the foundation of helping andrecovery. Empathic: Survivorsneed to feel supported and understood, not pitied. So rather than b eing s ympathetic, providers need to demonstrate empathy by com- municating an understanding of feelings to the individual. For example, \"I getthesensethat you are feeling sad and hurt by what happened\". This statement does not imply judgement, but rather that you are trying to understand where they are coming from. Able to talk openly: In order to be helpful to trauma survivors, providers need to be able to talk openly about issues, feelings and experiences related to the trauma. Itis up to the trauma survivor to disclose these things, and there is no rightway to do this. The amount or nature of the information is not relevant.If you come across as uncomfortable or unable to say certain words, itcommunicates to the survivor that you don't want to hear it; survivorswill feel bad and this can be harmful. anormal response to abnormal events 59 Trauma-informed Serviceproviders Strong provider/survivor relationships are the foundationof helping and recovery. Self-aware: Providers who are self-aware of their feelings, thoughts, and how they come across are more likely to invite trauma survivors to discuss theirfeelings more openly. Survivors will sense this, leading to a stronger help-ing relationship. Flexible: Providers must be flexible when working with trauma survivors in order to demonstrate care and concern. This can include a willingness to changenormal routines or procedures to accommodate some trauma survivor'sdifculties with, for example, medical exams or ofce space. Comfortable with the unknown: Someone else's experience of trauma may not be something with which the provider can directly relate. This can provoke feelings of discomfortand a need to provide familiarity. Staying open to different possibilitiesand trusting the survivor's needs will allow you to be more effective inkeeping the survivor feel more grounded. Willingness to learn from survivors: Providersareoften considered experts. However, when providers position thems elves as experts in relation to their clients, it makes clients feel less than. Y ouarenot the expert of your clients' lives; they are the experts, and youmust bewilling t olearn from them. Letting them teach us about their world is the best way to become knowledgeable. Willingness to connect emotionally with the trauma survivor's experience of trauma: In order to make a strong connection with trauma survivors, providers must make a connection beyond only facts and symptoms. Feelings andemotions play a central role in your work with survivors. This type of con-nection allows survivors to feel accepted and genuinely cared for. Willingness to step into the world of the survivor: Providers must be willing to step into the shoes of the trauma survivor for the time they share together. This will make a strong connection and cre-ate a solid understanding of what it is like for that person to live with thetrauma. 60 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Able to regulate own emotions: Given the intense emotions that can result from discussions with sur- vivors, providers need to be able to regulate these emotions and staygrounded during and after work with survivors. Survivors themselvesmay present as unable to regulate their emotions, so it is your job to staycalm and demonstrate emotional regulation. Able to treat the survivor as an equal: In order not to pathologize trauma survivors, providers need to treat sur- vivors as equals and not act on a belief system that survivors are weakerand less resourceful. When trauma survivors are treated as equals, theirstrengths and resources are highlighted. Good listener: Providers must be willing to actively listen to trauma survivors by focus- ing solely on what they are saying and showing genuine interest. This willencourage the survivor to open up and share information and feelingsthat will help in healing and recovery. Willingness to debrief: Iftheprovider is t obesuccessful in processing the experience, it is impor- tantthat they be able to debrief with co-workers about their contacts with traumasurvivors. It is normal to be left with difcult feelings after con- versations about trauma, or its impact. You are more helpful when you can share with others your feelings and thoughts about the experience. anormal response to abnormal events 61 Trauma-informed Serviceproviders62 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Trauma-informed services do not need to be focused on treating symptoms or syndromes related to trauma. Rather, regardless of their primary mission-to deliver primary care, mental health, addictions services, housing, for example - their commitment is to provide services in a manner that is welcomingandappropriate to the special needs of trauma sur- vivors (Harris & F allot,2001).Guidelines for Working with Trauma Survivors Strengths-based Perspective Focusing on strengths instead of weaknesses is a basic tenant of work with all people, but especially with trauma survivors who may see them-selves as inherently weak due to their experiences. Working from astrengths-based perspective is part of a process of relationship and trustbuilding. Focusing on their strengths engages clients in their own process of change by instilling hope about the ultimate pos-sibility of changing and creating a better life for themselvesand their family (ARC Community Services, Madison, WI). Conversations with trauma survivors should be nonjudgemental and occur within a context of compassion, empathy and humanity. The pri- mary focus is on rapport and relationship building, as well as the client'sown capacity for survival and healing. This n on-authoritarian approach views the client as the expert in their ownlife,andas a whole person rather than just an illness or mental health label. A saresult,thetreatment of their trauma symptoms encompasses their mind, body, soul and spirit. How We Talk to Trauma Survivors In any verbal message, the part of language that has the most impact is how we say it. We need to be cognizant of the words we choose, the tonewe use, and how our statements and questions are phrased. anormal response to abnormal events 63 Trauma-informed Guidelines Conversations with trauma survivors should be nonjudgementaland occur within acontext of compassion,empathy and humanity. Important points to consider Some important points on language and what we need to consider when working with trauma survivors are: ISince English is often a second language, make sure that people who do not speak English as a rst languageunderstand the process. IUse appropriate language at the client's level of under- standing. IDon't use jargon. IAcknowledge non-verbal communication as verbal com- munication. Some people communicate more throughbehaviour than with words. IAcknowledge silence as a way of communicating. Some people can't speak about it, or need time to feel comfort-able. IClarify anything you do not understand or are confused by. Some people will speak indirectly about trauma. For example, \"He was bothering me\" could mean \"He was abus- ing me\". IUselanguagethatdoes not denote assumptions or judgements. Your inner assumptions should never be reflected in your language. IDon'talwaysrefer to perpetrators as \"he\",andvictims a s \"she\", orvice versa. We know that victims and perpetra- torsofviolence can be both sexes. IBecareful about the label \"offender\" or\"perpetrator\" asit could describe a beloved parent or family member that abused them. Language and assumptions If we want trauma survivors to hear us and be open to sharing their feel- ings and needs, then it is important to watch the language we use andassumptions we make. If we approach survivors with a belief systembased on negative assumptions, we will perpetuate the cycle and add tothe problem. Below is a list of commonly held assumptions that serviceproviders may unwittingly promote, as well as suggestions for turning 64 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed these unhelpful responses into helpful belief systems that will assist the person with their recovery. anormal response to abnormal events 65 Trauma-informed GuidelinesUNHELPFUL ASSUMPTION I\"This person is sick.\" making it up.\" I\"They want coping methods.\" I\"They'll I\"They are permanently damaged.\"HELPFUL RESPONSE I\"This person is a survivor of trauma.\" I\"They are stronger for having gone through the trauma.\" I\"Recovery from trauma is a process and takes time.\" I\"This is hard to hear, and harder to talk about.\" I\"They are crying out for help.\" I\"Talking about the trauma gives people permission to heal.\" I\"Theyhave survival skills that have got them to where they are now.\" I\"People can recover from trauma.\" I\"They can change, learn and recover.\"Asking About Traumatic Experiences Having knowledge about the experience of trauma survival is important. Equally important is knowing how to ask about it and acknowledge it in away that feels comfortable and genuine, and is appropriate in the currentcircumstances. There are times when asking about trauma is not appropri-ate, and/or the provider must be cognizant of guiding the conversation inaway that doesn't lead the trauma survivor to feel overwhelmed. A series of scenarios below outlines how to appropriately ask about trauma andrespond in different circumstances. How do I ask about trauma when a person doesn't come out and say it, but gives other indications that they are having difculties? SCENARIO: You are having a conversation with someone who is talking about feelings, behaviours, and thoughts that indicate theycould be dealing with unresolved trauma, but they do not say that this is an issue for them. You are not sure how toaddress it, but feel it should be addressed. APPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Ask for clarication or for the individual to helpyouunderstand why the feelings, etc., are present. Invite them to talk morein depth about the trauma that may have occurred and is currently affecting them negatively. For example, \"What are your thoughts about whatthese feelings might be connected to?\" or\"I'mwondering if you could expand a bit on some feelings and thoughts you have mentioned to help me understand how to be helpful.\" INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Not providing a context for why you are asking. \"You must have been abused\" or \"Was it a traumatic experience in your past that you haven't dealt with yet that is causing these feelings?\" 66 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed What if I ask about the trauma and say the wrong thing and make it worse? SCENARIO: An individual is describing traumatic experiences at the hands of their mother during their childhood. They arevery emotional, and you feel quite moved and saddened bytheir experiences. You take your time to decide how youwould like to address this because you want to help themfeel accepted and comfortable. APPROPRIATE RESPONSE: You will not make the situation worse if your response is validating, nonjudgemental, and accepts the person'sfeelings and their right to feel that way. For example, \"Sounds like you are going through a hard time and that makes sense given what you've already gonethrough.\" INA PPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Making discounting statements or ignoring their strong feelings can make the situation worse for the trau-ma survivor because it reinforces negative belief systems. For example, \"Thatwasalongtime ago. Let's move on.\" Whatif I s aysomething that comes out wrong and what I really meant g ets lo st? SCENARIO: Awoman is describing a painful traumatic experience involving witnessing killings in her village in her home country. You feel empathy and support for her situation,but what you say is... APPROPRIATE RESPONSE: You see the discomfort on her face, and realize what you said was just phrased improperly. You say, \"I'm sorry. That came out wrong. What I meant to say was, that was a terrible experience, andI'm so glad you were able to nd safety.\" This response shows the woman that you are human and able to admit when you've made a mistake. anormal response to abnormal events 67 Trauma-informed GuidelinesINAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE: \"That's awful. Aren't you glad you live in Canada now?\" This discounts her situation and makes an assumption that things are better now. What if someone discloses trauma and they want to tell me all about it, but it's not my role or responsibility to be a counsellor? SCENARIO: Ayoung woman discloses that she was sexually assaulted a few months ago. She goes on at length about the situation,asking you for advice and stating she feels she needs towork on the impacts that she is just now acknowledging.She says she feels comfortable talking with you. APPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Acknowledging the feelings and courage it takes to disclose trauma is important, but it is not necessary for you tocounsel people if this falls outside the realm of your role. A more appro-priate response is to refer them to the service that ts for them and that they are willing to use. For example, \"This is a hard time for you, and I thank you for sharing this with me. Sounds like you have a lot to talk about and I'mwonderingifcounselling is an option for you right now?\" INA PPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Shutt ing a p erson down by cutting off thecontact:\"I'mnotacounsellor, so I can't help you, but here's the number for some services.\" Orconversely, trying to provide counselling that is outside your role: \"I'mnotacounsellor, but I can try and give you the best advice I can.\" How do I ask men about trauma in a way that may help them feel more comfortable in discussing their feelings and experiences? SCENARIO: You are speaking with a man in his mid-40s who says his childhood was really hard, and that he lived in fear of hisfather for most of it. You ask him if his father abused himand his reply is, \"Yeah, he was really mean and he'd let you know with his sts when he was angry. He also knew how totake it to the next level of humiliation in my room at night.\" You feel he is referring to sexual abuse. 68 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed anormal response to abnormal events 69 Trauma-informed GuidelinesAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Acknowledge his reference to sexual abuse and validate the experience. For example, \"You described physical abuse by your Dad, and I know that abuse can often be sexual, too. Is that what youmean by the humiliation in your room?\" The man says, \"Yeah, he did stuff to me and I hated it, and I never told anyone about it because I was afraid they'dthink it was my fault and I was gay.\" Responding to this appropriately would invite the man to acknowledge the harsh judgements as a societal myth.For example, \"Abuse is never the fault of the child; you were in a situation where you had no choices. Sexual abuse cannot make you gay because it is usedas a weapon, but society sure seems to send us that message. It's not easy to talkabout this stuff. I appreciate your sharing it with me.\" INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Not acknowledging the sexual abuse ref- erence. For example, \"I know a lot of guys who were beat up as kids; good thing you've moved on from that now.\" This response does not acknowledge the sexual abuse, but does assume he's over it. This sends the message thatyou don't want to hear about the sexual abuse. Are there times when I shouldn't ask about the trauma? SCENARIO: Youare speaking with a woman whose emotions of panic, anxi etyandhopelessness are very strong. She seems over- whelmed,distr acted, and in need of immediate help. She states that she's been bombarded with memories and flash- backsrecently, has missed work, is crying a lot, and isn't really feeling she's in reality. She needs help now. APPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Acknowledge her feelings and fears and assess her current situation as someone who is in crisis and having dif-culty containing her emotions and dealing with daily functioning. Thisindividual is not physically or mentally able to function properly, so ask-ing about the trauma may exacerbate the situation by adding to her inabil-ity to cope. Instead, you could ask, \"How can I help you now? What needs to happen to help you feel more under control now?\" INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE: \"Sounds like you are dealing with trauma. Do you have time to talk about the memories and how they are impacting on70 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed you now?\" This response ignores the immediate needs of safety and stabi- lization this woman needs, and focuses instead on issues that are longerterm. Do I need to get all the details of the trauma in order to under- stand where the survivor is coming from and for them to heal? SCENARIO: You are speaking with a veteran who states that the war is still with him in his mind and he feels like he just leftGermany yesterday. He wonders if the pain will ever goaway. APPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Acknowledge his statement, but do not ask for specific details or the whole story of the trauma unless the survivorindicates that this is an important part of recovery for them. Just askingabout the feelings and impacts of the trauma is all that is necessary toencourage healing and recovery. For example, \"Seems that an experience like war can really stay with you. How do you make sense of the experience now?\" This focuses on the impact of the trauma, which is current. INA PPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Focusing on getting the whole story of thetrauma,including details of specic incidents. For example, \"Canyou pleasestartfrom the beginning and tell me in detail about your experiences that are still painful?\" This provides too much information that may not be necessaryto recovery and may actually set the individual back because the memories are still too painful. What if I become frustrated with people because I sense they are trying to be difcult by withholding information? SCENARIO: You are speaking with an Aboriginal man in his 50s who suffers from depression. He says very little about his feel-ings, and does not make eye contact. When you ask himabout his depression, he provides little information andseems uncomfortable, like he doesn't want to be there,even though he came voluntarily. You become frustrated, low on patience, and wonder why he can't just be \"normal\". APPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Ask about his discomfort and what you can do differently to accommodate him so he can benet from the meeting.Understand what his \"normal\" way of communicating is and place yourwork with him in that context. INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE: Being judgmental, and allowing your emotions to interfere with service. For example, \"I can't help you if you don't give me information.\" Trauma-Informed Practice Best practices of working with trauma survivors are rooted in the follow- ing areas: IRelationship building based on respect, trust and safety IUsing a strengths-based perspective when working with people. IFramequestions an dstatements with empathy, being careful not to be judgmental. IFrametheclient's coping behaviours as ways to survive, andexplorealternative ways to cope as part of the recov- eryprocess. IRespondto disclosure with belief and validation that will inform practical issues related to care (Havig, 2008). IHelp the client contain difcult emotions before focus- ing on recovery. IAcknowledge that what happened to the client was bad, but that the client is not a bad person. IRecognize that the client had no control over what hap- pened to them. Let them know that the way they sur-vived during the traumatic experiences was actually theirway of resisting what was happening to them and of say-ing no, even if it did nothing to stop the perpetrator. IProvide an appropriate and knowledgeable response to the client that includes concerns they may have regard- anormal response to abnormal events 71 Trauma-informed Guidelinesing the services and then using this knowledge to guide service delivery. IWatch for triggers and trauma reactions and making efforts to reduce these. Providing and receiving information IInquire about trauma history and facilitate a supportive discussion with the client while keeping it contained. IMake sure the client is comfortable with the conversa- tion. ICheck in with the client to make sure the discussion of trauma feels safe and not overwhelming. IMake time for questions and concerns that the client may have. IWrite things down for clients who may dissociate during encounters. IProvide a suicide risk assessment where indicated and follow up with the client when the risk has passed. IInquire about a possible history of trauma if a client is perpetrating abuse themselves. Creating a climate of hope and resilience IAcknowledge the client's abilities to transcend adversity. IAcknowledge the strengths it takes to get to where the client is currently. IMakereference to the client as \"a survivor\", and focus on healing and recovery as \"possible\". IMove beyond just survival to a context of a healing process, and let the client decide what their path to heal-ing consists of. ILet the client know that you believe in them and support their efforts to heal. 72 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed anormal response to abnormal events 73 Trauma-informed Providing choices IInvolve the client in the decision-making process re: treatment/service options. IInquire about counselling in the past and offer referrals if indicated IEnsure that the client feels comfortable in invasive assessments and procedures, and make adjustments tothese processes where clients request it. IInform before performing - continually inform the client of what is happening during health care encoun-ters and assessments (Havig, 2008). IGive the client choices about referrals where possible. IInvolve other service providers that are currently involved in the client's care. Culturally appropriate/informed IHave the knowledge and skills to work within the client's culture by asking them about it, and understand how your own cultural background can influence transactionswith the client (Elliot, et al., 2005). IUnderstan dthemeaning th eclient gives to the trauma fromtheir cultural perspective. IUnderstan dwhat healing means within the cultural context. IBeopen tobeing e ducated, and ask questions about the culture. IBeopen toreferring clients to traditional healing servic- es,and become educated on traditional Aboriginal heal- ing ways. IBe involved in the cultural community that is served. IAdvocate on behalf of clients who speak English as a sec- ond language or are newly negotiating Canadian humanservices. IWork through historical distrust - issues may exist from the past that interfere with effective service provision.Understanding that this is normal and not personal willhelp in building a strong relationship (Brokenleg, 2008). ITeach Western ways as skills, not identity replacement (Brokenleg, 2008).Guidelines74 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed \"This huge panic came over me and all I could think was, 'Please let me get to my car, please...'. I startedrunning; all the while visions of me being raped weregoing through my head. I heard someone call my name, and it was my co-worker running after mewith m ypurse. The fear I felt that day scared me. I wasnever like tha tbefore.\" (Guidancecounsellor, 2005)Effects on Service Providers: Vicarious Trauma Working with trauma survivors is hard work. As with anything, there are the good aspects - strength and resilience building, personal growth, andbeing a witness to incredible progress and change - and the difcultaspects - knowing about human cruelty and the devastating impact it hason the people we work with. Working with trauma survivors puts us at risk of developing vicarious trauma. This term refers to \"the cumulative, transformative effect on theprovider working with survivors of traumatic life events\" (Saakvitne &Pearlman, 1996). Vicarious trauma is the experience of bearing witness to atrocities that are committed human against human. It is the result of absorbing the sight,smell, sound, touch and feel of the stories told in detail by survivors whoaresearching for a way to release their own pain (Health Canada, 2001). Just as being a primary victim of trauma transforms clients' understand- ing o fthems elves an dtheworldaround them, so, too, does bearing wit- ness t oit, sometimes in detail. Providers become secondary victims of traumawhen they form relationships with trauma survivors and are privy totheinformation that caused such terror, shame and sadness for clients. Providers are vulnerable because of their empathic openness, which is a necessarypart of the helping process. Vicarious trauma can be seen as an occupational hazard that is almost unavoidable when hearing about traumatic experiences. Just as PTSD ison a continuum, so is vicarious trauma. The more traumatic material theprovider is aware of, the more likely they are to develop vicarious trauma.This is normal and is completely manageable with strong workplace andsocial supports. anormal response to abnormal events 75 Trauma-informed VicariousTraumaVicarious trauma disrupts our belief and assumptions about self and the world in seven core areas (Malaviya, 1997): Frame of reference: Identifying too closely with clients' situations of helplessness, horror, sad- ness and cruelty disrupts our frame of reference, our comfort zone, andour basic beliefs that people are good and the world is safe. Safety: Loss of safety due to so much knowledge about how others take advantage of vulnerable people. Trust and Dependency: We become aware of violations of trust, and that clients become depend- ent on abusive people. Power: Wemay identify with clients' feelings of helplessness and powerlessness, and take it on to the disadvantage of our client. Independence: Wemay feel that our own freedom of movement is restricted by the awareness/f ear for ourselves. Esteem: Theperception that people are \"bad\" can develop because we are exposed tothe malicious and cruel behaviour of others. Intimacy: Trauma-related providers can feel increasingly alienated and estranged from those who don't do the same kind of work. Providers may have difculty managing strong feelings and maintaining a positive view of themselves. 76 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Vicarious trauma is different from burnout, which is the psychological strain of working with difcult populations - high stress with lowrewards. Burnout doesn't affect you in the same seven areas as vicarioustrauma does. Managing Vicarious Trauma Vicarious trauma is manageable if the provider realizes it is impacting in anegative way, and then takes immediate steps to address it. It is impor- tant that providers have a clear distinction between work and personallife. Although empathy and genuine connection are critical in workingwith trauma survivors, providers need to be able to make a separationthat allows them to nurture their mind, body, soul and spirit. If providersare not connected to themselves, then they will not be as effective in con-necting with clients. Just as providers encourage their clients to nd ways to become more cen- tered and grounded, providers themselves need to practice this. The ABCs of Addressing Vicarious Trauma (fromHealth Canada, 2001) Awareness Ibeing a ttun edto one's needs, limits, emotions and resources. Heed all levels of awareness and sources of information, cognitive, intuitive and somatic. Practice mindfulness and acceptance. Balance Imaintaining balance among activities, especially work, play and rest. Inner balance allows attention to allaspects of oneself. Connection Iconnecting with yourself, to others and to something larger. Communication is part of connection and breaksthe silence of unacknowledged pain. These connectionsoffset isolation and increase validation and hope. anormal response to abnormal events 77 Trauma-informed VicariousTrauma Vicarious trauma is manageable ifthe providerrealizes it isimpacting in a negative way, and then takesimmediate steps to address it.Local Resources ___________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 78 Trauma-informed Trauma-informed Community and Provincial Services for Trauma Survivors On our web site, www.trauma-informed.ca, we will maintain a directory of appropriate international, national and provincial resources with links totheir web site.
