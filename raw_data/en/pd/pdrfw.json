This is the way medicine is viewed today, but this was not always the case. The history of medicine is studied by researchers who use artifacts and historical documents to work out how medicine was practiced in [ancient history](https://study.com/academy/lesson/ancient-history-overview-civilizations-events.html). The medicine that is used in modern societies is very different from the medical attentions of ancient history. Early civilizations did not have doctors and medical treatments, they saw illnesses and diseases as a normal part of everyday life - just one of the dangers. Historians have studied ancient medicine and observed that it evolved in different cultures and civilizations. When trying to determine who invented medicine, historians look to ancient Egypt, which had the first physicians. The most famous medical practitioner in the history of medication is Imhotep, who is considered to be the father of medicine, as there are no records of medical work before him. The ancient Egyptians treated wounds and injuries and developed medical texts to teach others how to save lives and prevent serious injuries from killing people. The history of medication in [ancient Babylon](https://study.com/learn/lesson/ancient-babylon-history-empire.html) involved heavy reliance on magic and religion. The medical procedures, medication given, and surgeries performed were a mixture of natural remedies and faith rituals. While the Egyptians believed in training medical providers, in ancient Babylon anybody at all could become a doctor. However, it was a risky job. A doctor who killed a patient during surgery could have their hands cut off as punishment. The medical practices of the ancient Babylon civilization have been studied from texts which have survived from around 500 BCE. These texts give detailed ingredients for the medicines the doctors prescribed, although it appears a lot of medicine was guesswork. The ancient medicine of India is studied from the sacred writings of the time called Vedas, which was originally passed down orally. Parents would teach their children and so the culture would learn the knowledge through the generations. Vedas was written down between 1500 and 500 BCE and explain the practices used in [ancient India](https://study.com/learn/lesson/ancient-india-civilization-history-kingdoms-how-old-is-india.html) for medicine as well as the beliefs of the people at the time. While the ancient Indians did use plants and other natural medicines, they also had a strong religious belief that the healing of people was related to gods, magic, and charms such as crystals and talismans. The ancient Chinese also recorded their medical knowledge for future generations. An important text that can be studied by historians today is the Huangdi Neijing, which relates to internal medicine in ancient China and explains in detail how to perform medical treatments. The ancient Chinese believed in balance in the body and the world, called the [Yin-Yang](https://study.com/learn/lesson/taoism-symbol-principles-yin-yan.html). If a person's internal balance was not in order, they could become ill and even die. Ancient Chinese medicines used many procedures, some of which are still in use today like the practice of acupuncture. They also used herbs and natural remedies to prevent disease and cure people of illness. Between 700 and 300 BCE, the ancient Greek civilization became powerful and developed as a country and an empire. They encountered other civilizations and learned from them, using medical knowledge developed from Egypt, Babylon, China, and India. Imhotep became Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine, known for the [rod of Asclepius](https://study.com/learn/lesson/rod-of-asclepius-vs-caduceus-overview-symbolism.html), a staff with a snake wound around it. This rod became the official symbol for medicine it is recognized the world over today. For example, Asclepius's rod is the official symbol of the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://study.com/learn/lesson/world-health-organization-history-purpose.html). Doctors today take an oath to do no harm; this \" [Hippocratic oath](https://study.com/learn/lesson/hippocratic-oath-summary.html)\" is named after the Greek physician Hippocrates. He is considered to be the father of modern medicine and developed many techniques and rules that medical practitioners observe. Medicine in Greece marked a turning point in the history of medication by moving away from religion as part of medicine and rather relying on science and natural consequences to determine treatments. As the ancient Romans took over from the Greeks, they learned and improved on Greek medical information. Some Greek physicians even became Roman, like the famous doctor Galen. Once the Roman Empire fell, the important medical advances and procedures of the Greeks and Romans were preserved in ancient texts. Medieval monks preserved these texts and helped to establish hospitals to care for and heal people with proven procedures. The medieval monks also translated texts into many languages such as Latin and Arabic. Medicine started advancing when the ancient Greeks transitioned from the over-reliance on faith and magic from previous civilizations to taking a scientific, evidence-based attitude. With records of medical procedures being translated into other languages, more people were learning how to save lives, further advancing medical treatments. In the 18th century, the world changed considerably with the Industrial Revolution. The growth in technology and the economy meant that medicine grew and advanced as well. This progress continued into the 19th century with developments in anesthetics, a better understanding of germs, and medical training. In ancient medicine people just accepted illness, disease, and death, whereas the advancement of modern medicine saw the connection between the cause of an illness or disease and the treatment for it. The technological advances in medicine continued throughout the 19th century and are still progressing today. Some advances of note include: Medicine is the use of drugs and surgery to prolong and preserve human life. Before the start of medicine, early humans just accepted disease and illness as a part of life. Modern medicine has evolved from ancient medicine, which started in ancient Egypt with the first doctors. The first records of medical work came from the ancient Egyptian physician, Imhotep. Ancient India also had medical practitioners who treated people with natural remedies, procedures, and religious beliefs. These [medical practices](https://study.com/learn/lesson/types-medical-practice-pros-cons.html) were passed down the generations using the ancient Indian text called Vedas. The ancient Chinese developed the ideas as well and recorded their knowledge in an ancient text called the Huangdi Neijing. Modern medicine started to develop in ancient Greece with the physician Hippocrates, who is considered to be the father of modern medicine. The Greeks used knowledge from other ancient civilizations to create medicines and practices that saved people in complex ways. [Asclepius](https://study.com/learn/lesson/aesculapius-in-greek-mythology-myths-powers-lineage.html), the Greek god of medicine, is remembered today by his rod of Asclepius, a staff with a snake wound around it symbolizing healing. The Roman Empire took Greek wisdom to develop its own medical practices. When the Roman empire crashed, medical information was preserved by medieval monks who preserved the ancient texts of the Romans and translated them into Latin and Arabic. This marked the start of the advanced procedures available in medicine today. People began to see the connection between the cause of disease and the treatment, such as in the development of antibiotics to kill bacteria. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.
