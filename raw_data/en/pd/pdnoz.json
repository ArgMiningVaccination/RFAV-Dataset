A plethora of clinic-aid investigations was done before being diagnosed with the rare disease Isaac Syndrome accompanied by Membranous Glomerulonephritis, Lymes & Glaucoma and before I could stabilize, my life had changed by 180\u00b0 from a cultural, social, economic, and health perspective. The diagnosis was followed by therapies & treatments and the journey continues in searching for a permanent cure. For generations, Western medicines have rubbed shoulders with our 'genotype' in a way that we recognize it more of a traditional practice, a quick fix to our health issues. My diagnosis too followed extensive western therapies like infusing steroids, plasmapheresis, immunosuppressants, pain killers, shots of ACTH injections, etc. I thought spending a couple of hours in an emergency room could get me back to my daily routine, but soon it was evident that allopath does not have all the answers at times. Allopath procedures even had side effects, treating only the symptoms without addressing the root cause of the issue. Since 2017 I, fortunately, got to breathe the intimacy of some practices that instantly delivered results, transformed energies, and improvised health, a set of 'Alternate therapies' (any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine, but which lacks biological plausibility and is untested) that helped in reducing my daily dose of 38 pills. Considering the number of health issues, I was recommended to take one or more therapies at the same. I am not an expert on any of the concepts, yet relied more on my anecdotal- experience realizing the importance of these interventions was as interesting as they are intriguing- Physical Therapies / Practices AYURVEDA: Identifies three basic types of energy present in everyone, Vata (the subtle energy of movement), pitta (the energy of digestion and metabolism), and Kapha (the energy that forms the body's structure). The cause of the disease is viewed as a lack of proper cellular function due to an excess or deficiency of these 3 energies. The practitioner evaluates key symptoms of illness and arrives at diagnosis through direct questioning, observation, pulse reading, observing the tongue, eyes, etc. My initial analysis concluded metabolic disturbances that resulted in tissue degeneration, muscle weakness, body pain, etc. therefore procedures were implemented to treat the root cause. Fermented water treatment, body massage, concoctions, diet management, and Panchakarma (a rejuvenating detox eradicating body toxins to restore constitutional balance and improvising wellness) were the key pillars of the overall treatment. Worth pondering thoughts my doctor was hunger is one signal that the previous food is digested, take time to chew food and not rush, and exercise slowly. Though medicines took time to integrate but gave satisfactory results in due course reducing symptoms. NATUROPATH: A system that uses natural remedies to self-heal. I was exposed to this genre considering that all the other medicines would only give temporary relief and not cure completely. My treatments included diet management, mud therapy, massage, acupuncture, and herbal medicines. By the end of the treatment, though I was exhausted as the food regime was strict, it was a safe genre with no side effects. Now I have some idea of how our forefathers used nature as their physicians. HOMEOPATHY: Is based on the principle that \"like cures like\". It means that any substance, which can produce symptoms in a healthy person, can cure similar symptoms in the person. The remedies are normally based on natural and non-addictive ingredients. I remember visiting a well-known homeopath doctor in 2018 when I lost unexpected weight, abrupt sugar & BP levels, etc... A note of hysteria crept into me while discussing this mishap with my confident doctors who reasoned Lymes, limited food intake & indigestion to be the cause of concern. My doctor prescribed some salt supplements that helped my symptoms. MAGNETIC ACUPRESSURE: A science that stimulates and influences the acupoints in the body to balance the accurate flow of energy integrating with individual organs. This therapy was recommended by my ayurvedic doctor as its effective in taming inflammation, and pain, and increases energy metabolism. The benefits were easily measurable as I saw improvement in my sugar levels, back pain, BP, and capping excess flow of protein from urine. I'm sure to have received many other silent benefits of the therapy. IYENGAR YOGA: An extremely effective way of practicing hatha yoga that eased my stiff joints and muscles. Initially, I was hesitant considering my body condition but the practice used necessary props that made it interesting. I remember how my reflexes improved just after a couple of sessions. SEITAI: Due to detrimental modern lifestyle, diet, and injuries our body deviates from its optimal healthy state and this therapy restores the body to its natural order. The practitioner addressed strained muscles and paid attention to the body's meridians to restore the natural energy flow. The exercises taught during the session were very effective as my body responded and showed signs of improvement. FOOD THERAPY: Taking care of what, when, and how we consume is key to solving many health problems. My food platter had changed as symptoms only allowed easy-to-digest food consumed in moderation. Even, though I had so many pills to pop, the flavors on my taste buds were usually on a hunger strike. SPORTS MEDICINE: I took Table tennis, a paradigm for exercise prescription that resulted in functional physical changes. It infused physical confidence. WEARING LOSE CLOTHES: Helped ease nerve pain. (It was fascinating to know that 'skinny jeans neuropathy' is a syndrome where wearing tight pants could cause nerve compression leading to many problems). My takeaway \u2014 even little things could matter and infuse some extent of relief. Mental Therapies Faith and wellness go hand in hand. My body healed from major injuries and aches after being exposed to some mental therapies feeling peaceful even with a piece of dark chocolate. THE HUMOR THERAPY: Worked as a trance pill even during the most challenging moments, caramelizing my life longitudes. COW SEVA: I instantly connected with the holy creatures after reading an interesting piece, 'Holy Cancer' by Amit Vaidya who survived cancer by practicing therapies by connecting with Mother Earth and Holy Cows. My takeaway -it gave a heartwarming smile, a special bond, and a lesson to be happy, even when the periphery of freedom is limited. MEDITATION: Opened doors to a world, where sitting quietly felt fulfilled. READING INSPIRATIONAL BOOKS & DOCUMENTARIES: It acted as the fuel for creating an optimistic outlook towards life, inspired me to work hard, kept my faith alive, and never let me feel alone as others were dealing with even difficult situations. WRITING ARTICLES: As an ex-investment banker it was a new skill. In the process of sharing my experiences I learned quickly that alone, I'm rare, but together, part of a strong community of individuals fighting rare health conditions. The process of writing taught me to open up even with strangers, kept me socially active surfacing better solutions, and, constantly inspired me as the cause is to raise awareness. PLAYING AN INSTRUMENT: (One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain, Bob Marley). Did You Know? Music as a healing influence got popular during World War I & II when patients suffering from physical and emotional trauma from the wars showed positive signs. VISITING A HOSPITAL: There is a variety of things that can conjure positive psychology of 'Gratitude'. Visting a government hospital made me feel fortunate to have received all the personal treatments, medicines, and care. I became more thankful to the people who contributed to my recovery process. The above-discussed techniques resulted in positive: - Reduction in the daily medicines: - from 26 in 2020 to 12 pills, reducing my overall symptoms. Focused on Prevention rather than a symptomatic approach Enhanced my life quality and strengthen body-functionalities Reduced overall symptoms Less invasive Made me more independent Diabetes settled: - so much so that there are no signs anymore The feeling of Gratitude and Optimism CRUX: - In my experience, recovery isn't about medicines or physical therapies instead underdogs like being happy and psychosomatic therapies, co-relating mind-body communication that helps remove the dis-ease. These initiatives are not exit points but incentives to constantly look for a better tomorrow. Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own. "}
