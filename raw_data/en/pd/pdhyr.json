Since each chakra is characterized by an aspect of emotional, physical, spiritual and mental states of existence, energy healers direct their own energy to balance the energetic flow in themselves and others. Energy healing certificate programs range significantly in cost, format, length, schedule and philosophy. Prospective students have flexible options, such as home-study, weekend intensives, traditional classroom options, workshops, degree options that last between one and four years, apprenticeships and study abroad programs. Specialization options may include massage therapy, hypnotherapy or Reiki. To enroll in these programs, most schools require prospective students to provide evidence of an interest of energy work and will seek applicants with a clear mind and a sense of social responsibility. Certification in Energy Healing Students in energy healing certificate programs develop self-awareness, a spiritual practice and an understanding of existing healing modalities. Courses in metaphysics, polarity therapy, electromagnetic therapy, cymatic therapy, Ayurveda medicine, intercessory prayer, acupressure and interpersonal relations are incorporated into the curriculum, along with classes covering: - Reiki - Hypnotherapy - Meditation - Qi gong - Gestalt therapy - Bioenergetics Salary and Career Information Most energy healers set up a private practice and charge an hourly rate for services. Practitioners choose rates that best fit their lifestyle, region, clientele, marketing strategies and range of services. Rates are comparable to practitioners in the fields of massage therapy, hypnotherapy or Reiki. Continuing Education Information Many employers consider quantifiable research to be just as important as qualitative research and experience. For this reason, energy healers who hold certificates may also consider obtaining a bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree in energy medicine or a related field. The standard degree may broaden the opportunities for practitioners looking to gain research skills and broaden their expertise. The degree may also give practitioners the chance to work for reputable organizations, including those in public and private sectors. Although programs vary greatly for energy healing certificates, students will generally learn about spiritual healing methods and specific meditative techniques. Many graduates will work independently in their own practices, or possibly seek out formal undergraduate degree programs. "}
