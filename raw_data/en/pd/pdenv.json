The practice was established in 2009 and serves clients throughout Hertfordshire, North London and the Northern Home Counties. Balance Homeopathy was set up with the intention of providing clear, practical advice and natural remedies to help clients restore their health and well-being. Homeopathy is a holistic system of medicine which can be used by everyone, regardless of their age and condition in a gentle and natural way. It is particularly well suited to pregnant women, children and those who are sensitive to certain medicines or those who are seeking an alternative to conventional medicine. It can be used to help with both acute and chronic complaints with the advantage of being free from addiction or toxicity. The beauty of homeopathy is that its essence lies in treating everyone individually. This means that all treatment is tailored uniquely to your particular needs and condition, ensuring the relevant remedies are selected specifically for you. [Read more](/about-homeopathy.html)...
