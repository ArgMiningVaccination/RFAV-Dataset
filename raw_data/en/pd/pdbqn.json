Risk of neurologic conditions related to long COVID were elevated even in people who were not hospitalized with acute COVID-19 infection. The recent study also demonstrated that the risk was present regardless of age, race and sex, or conditions such as obesity, smoking, diabetes and immune dysfunction, amongst other factors. Researchers are working hard to understand the mechanisms by which COVID-19 infection leads to the neurological disorders observed in long COVID. Mechanisms of great interest include the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses present in COVID-19 infection. It is hypothesized that omega-3s - namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - could help to lessen the impact of long COVID because they play an important role in modulating the inflammatory response and resolving inflammation in the body[iii],[iv] Additionally, omega-3s have been shown to have a positive impact on brain health - including brain development[v],[vi],[vii], cognitive performance[viii],[ix] and mood[x],[xi],[xii],[xiii] - thus these nutritional ingredients are of particular interest in the context of neurological outcomes. The recent publication indicates promising opportunities to expand research on the potential role of omega-3 supplementation as part of a strategy to support long COVID symptoms. \"As a global leader of nutritional lipid solutions, DSM remains at the forefront of new developments in omega-3 science,\" comments Dr. Sonia Hartunian-Sowa, Director of Science, Translation, & Advocacy, DSM. \"We're keen to help expand knowledge surrounding the role these important ingredients play in this emerging field of research and ultimately inspire the development of purpose-led health solutions.\" For more information, join DSM at SupplySide West 2022 (booth 4355), or visit [here](http://www.dsm.com/human-nutrition/en/products/nutritional-lipids.html).
