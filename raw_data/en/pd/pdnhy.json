FOOD THERAPY Chinese food therapy dates back as early as 2000 BC. The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, also known as the Huangdi Neijing, which was written around 300 BC, was most important in forming the basis of Chinese food therapy. It classified food by four food groups, five tastes and by their natures and characteristics. PHILOSOPHY ABOUT FOOD The principles of yin and yang are used in the sphere of food and cooking. Yang foods increase the body's heat (e.g. raise the metabolism), while Yin foods decrease the body's heat (e.g. lower the metabolism). As a generalization, Yang foods tend to be dense in food energy, especially energy from fat and starch, while Yin foods tend to have high water contents, are low in energy and low on the glycemic index. The Chinese ideal is to eat both types of food to keep the body in balance. An animal, or person eating too much Yang food might suffer from bad skin, be over excitable and be hot most of the time while an animal, or person eating too much Yin food might be cold, lethargic or anemic. The yin yang type and dominant element of each individual determines how susceptible the person is to these effects of food. A neutral individual is generally healthy and will have strong reactions to these effects only after overconsumption of certain kinds of food. A yang type individual usually can eat all yin type food with no ill effect, but may easily get a nose bleed, anger easily, develop hot spots or develop anhydrosis with a small amount of yang type food. A yin type individual is usually less thrifty, tired and is reactive to either yin or yang food. Boosting or nourishing types of food are needed to bring a yin individual back into balance. Each of the 5 elements of TCVM, (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water), also have particular food items that can enhance or strengthen their inherent qualities and adds more dimensions to consider when selecting a diet that works well for that particular patient and their condition. A veterinarian trained in 5 element theory methodology can easily recognize the patients pattern needs based on these ancient theories. Excesses and deficiencies can then be addressed through proper food choices and adjusted as needed. TREATMENT EXPECTATIONS & SUCCESS For small animals, the insertion of acupuncture needles is virtually painless. The larger needles necessary for large animals may cause some pain as the needle passes through the skin. In all animals, once the needles are in place, there should be no pain. Most animals become very relaxed and may even become sleepy. Nevertheless, acupuncture treatment may cause some sensation, presumed to be those such as tingles or numbness which can occur in humans and which may be uncomfortable at times to some animals. Acupuncture is one of the safest forms of medical treatment for animals when it is administered by a properly trained veterinarian. Side effects of acupuncture are rare, but they do exist. An animals condition may seem worse for up to 48 hours after a treatment. Other animals may become sleepy or lethargic for 24 hours after acupuncture. These effects are an indication that some physiological changes are developing, and they are most often followed by an improvement in the animals condition. The length and frequency of acupuncture treatments depends on the condition of the patient and the method of stimulation that is used by the veterinary acupuncturist. Stimulation of an individual acupuncture point may take as little as 10 seconds or as much as 30 minutes. A simple acute problem, such as a sprain, may require only one treatment, whereas more severe or chronic ailments may need several or several dozen treatments. When multiple treatments are necessary, they usually begin intensively and are tapered to maximum efficiency. Patients often start with 1-3 treatments per week for 4 to 6 weeks. A positive response is usually seen after the first to third treatments. Once a maximum positive response is achieved (usually after 4-8 treatments for small animals and 3-4 in large animals), treatments are tapered off so that the greatest amount of symptom free time elapses between them. Many animals with chronic conditions can taper off to 2-4 treatments per year. Animals undergoing athletic training can benefit from acupuncture as often as twice a week to once a month. The frequency depends on the intensity of the training and the condition of the athlete. There are two important criteria you should look for in a veterinary acupuncturist: - Your veterinary acupuncturist must be a licensed veterinarian. - Your veterinary acupuncturist should have formal training in the practice of acupuncture for animals. In most countries, states, and provinces, veterinary acupuncture is considered a surgical procedure that only licensed veterinarians may legally administer to animals. VETERINARY ACUPUNCTURE Veterinary acupuncture is used all over the world, either by itself or in conjunction with Western medicine, to treat a wide variety of maladies in every species of domestic and exotic animals. Modern veterinary acupuncturists use solid needles, hypodermic needles, bleeding needles, electricity, heat, massage and low power lasers to stimulate acupuncture points. Acupuncture works well for functional problems such as those that involve paralysis, noninfectious inflammation (such as allergies), and pain. Driven by traditional chinese medicine trained practitioners, acupuncture can be helpful in the treatment of such non-functional problems such as behavioral and developmental disorders. For small animals, the following are some of the general conditions that are treated with acupuncture: - Musculoskeletal problems, such as arthritis or vertebral disc pathology, and hip dysplasia - Skin problems, such as lick granuloma - Respiratory problems, such as feline asthma - Gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea - Selected reproductive problems In addition, regular acupuncture treatment can treat minor sports injuries as they occur and help to keep muscles and tendons resistant to injury. World-class professional and amateur athletes often use acupuncture as a routine part of their training. Acupuncture is used on many animals involved athletic endeavors, such as racing, jumping, or showing. "}
