The insertion of extremely fine needles into the skin at specific acupuncture points releases endorphins, the body's natural pain-killing chemicals. It also affects the part of the brain that governs serotonin, a brain chemical involved with mood. This is a very stressful and challenging time for many of us. If acupuncture isn't accessible to you right now, give acupressure a try! A simple acupressure routine may help to manage some of the effects of stress and anxiety on the body. Applying pressure to acupuncture points mobilizes energy in the channels and communicates with the nervous system to stimulate the release of those feel-good chemicals. In Chinese Medicine theory, emotions and mental functions are viewed as components of qi (the body's vital energy) and blood. Correcting the movement of qi and blood in the meridians brings balance back to the mind, body, and spirit. Most acupuncture points calm the nervous system, but here are a few favorites for reducing stress and easing anxiety: Du 20, Yin Tang, Ren 17, GB-21, Ht-7, Sp-6, and Lr-3. In Chinese Medicine, all emotions have a special directionality. The \"qi\" of anxiety and stress is generally concentrated upwards, settling into the mind, shoulders, heart, and chest. Acupressure can help redistribute this energy through the meridians so you can ground again. To do this, we recommend starting with Du-20, the point at the top of your head, and ending with Lr-3 on the feet for a grounding treatment. You can press the point on each side of the body to feel which one is more tender/sensitive. If you notice a difference, spend more time on the tender side. If you're still feeling unsettled, press into the bottom of your feet, which your thumb or a tennis ball, to anchor that energy. When locating points, feel for a tender spot or a place when your finger seems to dip slightly. Most acupuncture points are noticeable once you find them! Spend 30 seconds on each point with firm pressure, while taking nice deep breaths into your abdomen. Tip: Try using relaxing essential oils like lavender, neroli, clary sage, sandalwood, bergamot, or vetiver to enhance your acupressure session.

Place a finger at the top of each ear and follow an imaginary line upward- Du-20 is located where your two fingers meet. Actions: regulates the movement of all yang energy in the body. Pressing on this point can both raise the yang to lift depression and sadness, and, it can ground energy to ease anxiety and overthinking. Du-20 clears the mind to help you feel focused and present. As a \"Sea of Marrow\" point, Du-20 nourishes the brain and can help treat headaches, dizziness, insomnia, and other neurological conditions. Yin Tang \"Hall of Impression\" Location: located between the eyebrows, in the area known as the third eye Actions: powerfully calms the spirit and takes the edge off emotional restlessness and anxiety. Connects with the pineal gland to promote deep relaxation and treat insomnia; relieves headaches, foggy thinking, and helps clear nasal congestion or a runny nose. A favorite point to include in any acupuncture treatment for emotional well-being. Gall Bladder 21 (GB-21) \"Shoulder Well\" Location: at the highest point of the shoulder (in the muscle), at the midpoint between the spine and the rotator cuff Actions: a go-to area for massage, pressing into GB-21 strongly descends energy to release stress and tension held in the upper body, and, can help alleviate anger, migraines, and high blood pressure. Also helpful for those who feel you \"carry the burden of the world on your shoulders\". As you press on this point, be sure you maintain steady breaths into your abdomen. Note: Do not use if pregnant. Conception Vessel 17 (Ren 17) \"Chest Center\" Location: At the center of the chest, midway between the nipples. Actions: beneficial for those who tend to feel the effects of stress and anxiety in their chest, manifesting as shortness of breath, tightness, or palpitations. Relaxes and opens the chest, and releases the diaphragm. Known as the 'influential point of Qi', this is an essential point to regulate the movement of qi, which often becomes stuck with emotional distress. Heart 7 (Ht-7) \"Spirit Gate\" Location: on the inner wrist crease, towards the ulnar (little finger) side. Feel for a hollow at the base of the pisiform bone. Actions: the \"source point\" on the heart channel, where the vital energy of the heart organ system gathers. Deeply connects with the heart meridian to nourish the spirit and treat all emotional imbalances, and strengthen heart qi and blood. Quiets the mind and settles worry/anxiety; eases emotional distress with sleep disturbances; releases chest tightness and heart palpitations; strengthens the Fire element- animation, joy, and connection; used in the treatment of emotional shock. Spleen 6 (Sp-6) \"Three Yin Crossing\" Location: on the inside of your leg, just above your ankle. To find this point, (1) locate the highest peak of the ankle then (2) four finger widths up your leg, slightly behind the bone (tibia) Actions: one of the best points for digestive, gynecological, and urinary issues, as well as emotional and sleep disorders. Named \"3 yin crossing\" because the liver and kidney meridians pass here- three organ systems that become easily taxed during times of stress. This can feel like exhaustion/fatigue, chronic pain, indigestion, and period problems. Sp-6 builds back blood and yin and moves stagnant energy in these channels. Note: Do not use if pregnant. Liver 3 (Lr-3) \"Great Surge\" Location: located on the foot, between the first and second toes, about an inch away from the web of the toes Actions: THE point to relieve anger, stress, and irritability.
