Demekhina, 42, treats symptoms experienced by many Hongkongers\u2014from the physical, like bloating and lack of energy, to the psychological, like burnout. She also specialises in women's health issues. \"Our job is to find where the problem begins, and nutrition is a way to optimise the body's function.\" While our bodies have an innate ability to heal, in order to do so, we need to give them the tools, says Demekhina. Besides nutrition, minimising excess demands on the body\u2014like living in a polluted environment or going through a stressful period in life\u2014 is also essential, she adds.

In her early 30s, while balancing a highly demanding job in finance and becoming a mother, she was getting sick often and had no energy. She'd visit doctors but would leave with \"bags of medication that made no difference\"\u2014and decided to consult a nutritionist. She began incorporating a wide variety of vegetables in her daily diet\u2014particularly cruciferous varieties\u2014and making them the main component of the meal instead of a side. This not only improved her physical well-being, but also sparked an interest in the field of nutrition. In 2017, she quit her job to pursue a master's degree in psychology at Harvard University; this was followed by a master's in nutrition at Middlesex University in the UK. She became a nutritionist in 2021. To find the root cause of a physical or emotional symptom, Demekhina considers a person's lifestyle, tests their food sensitivities and assesses how they react to ingredients to create tailored nutrition plans. \"I work with changing people's habits, and I love what I do,\" she says.
