Mus ic therapy may be implemented to reduce anxiety, help the child express himself/herself, and alleviate pain, among other goals. Parental opinions of programs and services provided for children are typically obtained only from mothers. Mothers and fathers interact differently wit h their child, so it is necessary to gather information from both mothers and fathers. This survey research examined the perceptions of mothers and fathers whose child receive music therapy. The sample consisted of 54 parents (44 mothers and 10 fathers) of a child who received music therapy while hospitalized within the last two years. Although both parents tended to rate music therapy highly, mothers were more likely to be knowledgeable of services and of what occurred in the sessions, while fathers were less likely to be aware that their child received mu sic therapy and more likely to trust the mother's opinion. Findings suggest further research is necessary to more completely understand how parental gender differences affect perspective. 1 INTRODUCTION Parents of Hospitalized Children For parents of a child admitted to a hospital, the initial response may be similar to a grief reaction. Parents may experience shock or disbelief, feel guilt and assign blame, or display avoidance and escape strategies (Diaz-Caneja, Gledhill, Weaver, Nadel, & Garralda, 2005). A child's hospitalization may be a major crisis in the lives of the parents, particularly if the child is admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, or PICU (Board & Ryan, Wenger, 2003; Rees, Gledhiss, Garralda, & Nadel, 2004). Lengthy hospitalizations can have long-term psychological effects for parents, with symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder (Judge, Nadel, Vergnaud, & Garralda, 2002). Parents often report that their relationship with the child changes as they become more vigilant of the child, or more lenient of certain behaviors (Diaz-Caneja, Gledhill, Weaver, Nadel, & Garralda, 2005). Although parents are typically allowed to visit their child in the hospital, other types of separation contribute significant stress. Parents are physically separated due to medical machinery and emotionally separated because they cannot provide the same level of comfort that they would at home. Parents are also separated from other children at home while they are caring for the hospitalized child; additionally, if one parent visits the hospital while the othe r parent remains home with siblings, parents experience spousal separation as well (Diaz-Canej a, Gledhill, Weaver, Nadel, & Garralda, 2005). The transition from having a healthy child to a severely ill child, as well as changes in the child's behavior, emotional state, and appearance also may be sources of extreme stress (Noyes, 1999). Several researchers have focused on what parents need from the medical team during this highly stressful time. According to Noyes (1999), parents report that participation in their 2 child's care is essential to their own needs, as well as the child's emotional and physical health. Many parents of children admitted to the PICU stated that when staff encouraged them to participate and ask questions, the experience was more positive. Parents also expressed feel ing that it was beneficial when they received support from staff, were regularly updated, and were provided with additional services. In addition to the medical staff, hospitals often impleme nt support services to meet the needs of patients and families. Hospital Support Services A child's admission to the hospital can be extremely stressful and a time of crisis for parents and families (Hazinki, 1992). Parents report that their level of stress is influenced by t he severity of the child's illness, parent-child relationships, and interactions with the medica l team (Diaz-Caneja, et al., 2005). The severity of the child's illness often correlates with sudden onse t of symptoms, sedation/unconsciousness, and potential complications, all of which are highly stressful for parents. Parents are often physically separated from their child during procedures, and may not be as involved in care as they would like. Moreover, parents of hospitalized children often feel that the medical staff did not attend to them enough to meet their needs (Hazinki, 1992). Many hospitals implement staff and programs to provide support to patients and families- mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Child Life Specialists Child life specialists are members of the healthcare team who collaborate with parent s and staff to meet the psychosocial needs of children. According to the Child Life Council, child life specialists create an environment centered on emotional support, helping the child to understand procedures and cooperate with staff by providing non-medical preparation and support. Child life specialists aim to ease the child's fear and anxiety with therapeutic, 3 developmentally appropriate play activities. Child life specialists also work to advocate for family -centered care, considering the needs of siblings who may be affected by a child's illness. When one child is hospitalized, parents are often forced to split time between the hospital a nd their \"normal\" life at home with the other children. Child life specialists can provide informa tion and resources to parents to help aid parents during this time. Chaplains In the pediatric hospital setting, chaplains provide emotional and spiritual support to patients and families of all faith traditions. As members of the interdisciplinary te am, chaplains are board-certified and specialize in pediatric chaplaincy in order to meet the needs of patie nts and families. Chaplains are available to assist with prayers and rituals, provide blessings, provide support in times of crisis, or simply talk with children and their parents. Teachers School is an integral part of every child's life. In addition to academics, school provides socialization, introduces the child to new opportunities, and provides a sense of structure to everyday life. Children who endure lengthy hospitalizations may miss long periods of these typical school experiences. For this reason, most pediatric hospitals implement a school program within the hospital to provide education and interaction with peers. Participating in a hospital school program provides children with a sense of normalcy, reduces stress, and helps the child cope (\"Hospital School Program\", 2015). Certified teachers meet with patients individually, or in a designated classroom setting within the hospital, to provide lessons that allow the child t o continue to meet academic goals. These teachers may also serve as liaisons for the pati ent and family as the child transitions back to school. 4 Volunteers Hospital volunteers are qualified individuals who donate their time to serve patient needs. Volunteers provide direct interaction with children, such as playing games or reading books in the patient's room, assisting child life specialists or other staff, and helping patients and families find their way around the hospital (\"Hospital Volunteer Program\", 2015). Volunteers receive intensive training and are safe, knowledgeable team members. Art Therapists According to the American Art Therapy Association, art therapy is \"a mental health profession in which clients, facilitated by the art therapist, use art media, the creative process, and the resulting artwork to explore their feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self - awareness, manage behavior and addictions, develop social skills, improve reality orientation, reduce anxiety, and increase self-esteem\". Art therapists work to enhance a patient's person al well being. Art therapists create a safe and non-threatening space for patients to express emotions, regain a sense of control, and cope with hospitalization. Pediatric Medical Music Therapy Music therapy has been shown to benefit children and adolescents during hospitalization. Medical music therapy has traditionally functioned as a non-threatening, evidence-based valid treatment option for patients with a variety of diagnoses (American Music Therapy Associati on). Music therapy can be used with children to promote positive coping, reduce anxiety, alleviate perceived pain, aid respiration needs, provide distraction during procedures, as well as serve other goals. Standley & Whipple (2003) performed a meta-analysis of empirical research involving music versus no music conditions during medical treatment of pediatric patients. From 5 the twenty-nine studies that met criteria, all results but one indicated positive benefi ts with an overall mean effect size of .64. Music therapy has been shown to be effective for reducing anxiety and pain perception before, during, and after invasive procedures. Patients may engage in music listening, both active and passive (Barker, 1991; Fowler-Kerry 1998; Davis & Thaus, 1989), active music making such as singing or playing an instrument (Edwards, 1994, 1995; McDonnell, 1983; Brown, Chen & Dworkin, 1989), and/or music assisted relaxation (Schneider, 1982; Robb, Nichols, Rutan, Bishop & Parker, 1995). Chetta's (1981) research with music therapy in pediatric surgery was one of the first studies to address the effects of music therapy on perceived pain. Research shows that parents rate music therapy highly in regards to reducing pain without anesthesia (Whitehead-Pleaux, A.M., Zebrowski, N., & Baryza, R.L, 2007), while Noguchi (2006) reported that parents stated that their children \"really like\" the music. Additionally, nurses have noted that music is succe ssful during invasive procedures (Grimm & Pefley, 1990; Klein & Winkelstein, 1996; Kouretas, 1999). In addition to providing procedural support and pain reduction, music therapy can assist with children's emotional needs during hospitalization. Research shows that music therapy can address motor activity and social development for preschool children hospitalized for an extended period of time (Barrickman, 1989). Dun (1995) explored how music therapy can help establish normalcy for pediatric patients, establish communication skills, and reduce st ress and anxiety. Active music therapy has been shown to improve immune function (Lane, 1991), increase verbalizations about illness (Froehlich, 1984), and decrease distress behaviors (Marle y, 1984). Several researchers have focused on the use of music with oncology patients (Aasgard, & Kennelly, 1999), finding that music helps express emotions and promote positive coping (Daveson, 2001; Brodsky, 1989). Contextual music therapy support may also provide support, the sense of security, and the sense of self-worth for pediatric patients who do not have supportive adults who meet their emotional needs (Connell & Wellborn, 1991). Music therapists receive specialized training and certification to work in the Neonata l Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Collins and Kuck (1991) observed that infants who listened to music had significantly increased oxygen saturation levels over infants in the silence conditi on. Cassidy and Standley (1994) found that music listening positively affects heart rate, respiration rate, and oxygen saturation levels. Furthermore, music may decrease overall time in hospital (Coleman, Pratt, Stoddard, Gerstmann, & Abel, 1997). In addition to music listening, NICU music therapists also use the Pacifier Activated Lullaby (PAL), which promotes non-nutriti ve sucking in infants (Standley, 2000). The PAL uses music to reinforce sucking endurance and effectiveness. NICU music therapists may also implement multimodal stimulation, w hich combines music, touch, and vestibular stimulation to facilitate neurological growth and development (Standley, 1998). 7 REVIEW OF LITERATURE Mothers' and Fathers' Perceptions of their Child's Behavior and Abilities Parents are viewed as reliable informants of their child's behavior and tendencies (Achenbach, McConaughy & Howell, 1987). Although many studies have addressed the accuracy of parent reports (Dale, Bates, Reznick, & Morisset, 1989; Dinnebeil & Rule, 1994; Gradel, Thompson, & Sheehan, 1981; Jackson & Roberts, 1999; Schafer, Bell, & Spalding, 1987; Miller, & Murdock, 1984; Suen, Logan, Neisworth, & Bagnato, 1995), the majority of this research uses the term \"parent\" while most of the information comes only from mothers (Keen, Couzen, Muspratt, & Rodger, 2010; Phares & Compas, 1992; Singh, 2003). Parents and healthcare professionals tend to perceive mothers' perceptions as the most accurat e identifier of the child's emotional and behavioral problems (Loeber, Green, & Lahey, 1990; Phares, 1997), and fathers' opinions have only recently been given the same consideration as mothers'. Although on some assessments mother and father inter-rater reliability is high, there are certain differences between how mothers and fathers perceive their child. Cepanec, Lice, and Simlesa (2012), found that mothers are likely to rate child's misbehavior as more frequent, but fathers are likely to rate problems as more severe. Fathers are more likely to report hyperactivity and conduct issues than mothers. Mothers are more likely to report and focus on one behavior, while fathers tend to identify two or more. Several factors influence the discordance between mother and father reports, including parent's level of education and child's age, developmental disabilities, and gender (Chen, Lee, Yeh, Lai, & Chen, 2004; Duhig, Renk, Epstein, & Phares, 2000; Gudmundsson & Gretarsson, Jackson & Roberts, 1999; Lin et al., 2011; Matson et al., 2011; Reilly et al., 2006; 8 Rosenbloom et al., 2011; Parade & Leerkes, 2008; Schroeder, Hood, & Hughes, 2010). Mothers and fathers tend to have higher levels of disagreement based on the gender of the child. Although parents agree that mothers perceive their child as having more problems than fathers (Calzada, Eyberg, Rich, & Querido, 2004) mothers are actually more likely to express concern and seek out additional support for girls, while fathers are more likely to express concern for boys. (Cepanec, Lice, & Simlesa, 2012). Conversely, this study found that fathers are four to five times more likely to rate the social skills of their daughters as \"below average\" tha n mothers. Mothers also rated daughters higher regarding fine motor skills, language expression, achievement, and self help (Germundsson & Gretarsson, 2009). In addition to parents, children have other informants, typically teachers. Mothers, fathers, and teachers have been found to differ in their assessments, though clinicians tend to believe that parents are the most important source of information for diagnosing children's emotional and behavioral problems (Achenbach, McConaughy, & Howell, 1987). However, fathers and teachers assessments are often more highly correlated than mother and teacher or mother and father assessments. Mothers tend to rate problems higher than both fathers and teachers (Solie, Larsson, & Morch, 2012). Although mothers' opinions are most likely to be considered, mothers are more likely to be influenced by their child's behavior (Webster-Stratton, 1988). Mothers of preschoolers with behavioral issues reported a greater negative impact of child problems on their lives, more daily hassles, and more negative feelings about parenting than did fathers (Calzada, Eyberg, Rich, & Querido, 2004). Mothers also report higher levels of stress, depression, and marital dissatisfaction due to parenting and their child's difficult temperament than did fathers (W ebster- Stratton, 1988). Mothers are more likely to attribute child concerns to a low sense of parenting 9 competence and lack of support for their spouses than fathers. Lahey, Conger, Atkeson, and Treiber (1984) suggest that mothers who are distressed may have a lower tolerance for child misbehavior, while fathers may be more adept at maintaining separation between stress and parenting. Mothers' and Fathers' Perceptions of Services The success of child programs-particularly programs that involve parent interaction- often depend on support from parents. Parent acceptability of these programs is correlated with improvements in child behavior and actions (MacKenzie, Fite, & Bates, 2004) as well as long- term sustainment of those improvements (Eyberg, 1993; Forehand, et al., 1983; McMahon & Forehand, 1983). Although there are several factors that influence parent satisfaction of programs, overall, fathers tend to report less acceptability of their child's services than mothers (Brannan, Sonnichsen, & Heflinger, 1996). Studies have also found a positive correlation between length of treatment and satisfaction for both mothers and fathers (Brannan et al., Furthermore, parents who believe their child's problem to be more serious tend to view services as less effective than parents who believe their child's problem to be less severe (Godley, Fiedler, & Funk, 1998). Mothers' and fathers' perceptions of specific characteristics within treatment infl uence overall acceptability. Tiano, Grate, and McNeil (2013) found that mothers rated group sessions, in-home treatment, the use of a one-way mirror, and daily \"homework\" for parents to be significantly more acceptable than fathers. Parent age negatively impacts acceptabi lity, as younger parents are more open to treatment and tend to view results higher than older parents. Socioeconomic status may also contribute to parent satisfaction, as parents of lower 10 socioeconomic status are more likely to rate treatments higher. Mothers and fathers tend to differ in approved techniques for their child, as mothers prefer techniques that increase positive behaviors with rewards rather than techniques that decrease negative behaviors with punishments (Calvert & McMahon, 1987). In contrast to previous beliefs, research shows no correlation between father involvement and treatment acceptability (Tiano, Grate, & McNeil, 2013). Parents of Children With Disabilities Parents of children with disabilities experience elevated levels of stress and, as a result, a decrease in quality of life which may put them at a higher risk for depression than the general public (Resch, Elliot, & Benz, 2012; Browne & Bramston, 1998). Olsson and Hwang (2001) found that parents report feeling helpless over not being able to change the situation and feel a sense of failure over not accomplishing their own goals while they are taking care of their child. A study by the National Alliance for Caregivers in Decline (2006) found that many family caregivers report not taking care of their own health by skipping or not scheduling medical appointments for themselves due to lack of time, and having poor eating and exercise habits. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2007), parents often spend at least 11 hours each week coordinating care for their child. Parents of a child with disabilities have an eighty percent chance of getting divorced, compared to a fifty percent chance of the general population (Griffin, 2000). The elevated levels of stress and depression that parents experience lead to reduced problem-solving abilities, lower family satisfaction, and lower physical health (Resch, Elliot, & Benz, 2012). However, the majority of studies that discuss \"parental depression\" focus solely on mothers; the studies t hat have included fathers typically find that they have fewer depressive symptoms than mothers (Bristol, Gallagher, & Schopler, 1988; Dumas, Wolf, Fisman, & Culligan, 1991; Veisson, 1999 ; 11 Gray & Holden, 1992). One of the reasons mothers experience more distress than fathers is that mothers often take a larger part of the extra duties associated with having a child with disabi lities (Bristol, Gallagher, & Schopler, 1988; Moes, Koegle, Schreibman, & Loos, 1992). Mothers are also typically the parent that gives up their job in order to care for the child, leaving mothers feeling unable to pursue their own interests (Breslau, Staruch, & Mortimer, 1982). Furthermore, in our present society, a mother's self-competence may be more directly related to her parenting role than father's self-competence (Olsson & Hwang, 2001). Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine, evaluate, and compare the opinions of mothers/female caregivers and fathers/male caregivers whose child has received music therapy services in the medical setting. This may provide knowledge for music therapists to better understand the families they work with in order to enhance their work. 12 METHODS Participants Participants consisted of parents of children hospitalized at a large Midwestern children's hospital between 2013 and 2014. Children must have been age seventeen or younger at time of services. Fifty-four parents completed the survey. For sensitivity purposes, parents were not included if their child passed away, either during hospitalization or since. Survey Instrument A 24-question survey was constructed by the researcher and edited by two music therapists from the researching hospital and one university professor (see Appendix A). The survey consisted of one question to determine if the participant was the mother/female caregi ver or father/male caregiver, eight demographic questions, three questions addressing the participant's knowledge of their child's music therapy services, twelve questions in which participants rated the perception of the music therapy services, and a comment section. Procedure Upon receiving approval from The Office of Research Integrity and Compliance, (ORIC), Institutional Review Board for the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (Appendix B) and from the FSU Human Subjects Committee (Appendix C), 475 eligible participants were contacted via telephone by the researcher to briefly explain the surve y and gather email addresses. Eighty-two eligible participants had previously provided an email address. The survey and prospective participants' email addresses were uploaded to Qualtrics survey system. All participants who provided an email address (n = 195) were emailed a link to the survey and preceding consent form as well a link to opt-out of the survey. The consent form detailed the purpose of the survey and instructions to complete, as well as informed participants 13 that participation was voluntary, they may quit at any time, and that their responses would be kept confidential and anonymous. 14 RESULTS Of the 195 surveys sent out, 44 mothers returned completed surveys. Two mothers who had provided an email address opted out, and another two contacted the researcher to state that they decline to participate because they could not recall their child receiving music therapy. Participants were asked eight basic information and demographic questions prior to completing music therapy related questions. Results are depicted in Table 1. Of the 44 mothers, most (56%) were between the ages of 31 to 40, while 20% (n = 8) were younger and 24% (n = 10) were older. Seventy-three percent hold a Bachelor's degree or higher, indicating that this sample consisted of highly educated mothers. The majority of mothers (73%) reported that they are Caucasian; 10% of mothers stated that they are Hispanic or Latino and 10% responded black of African American. At the time of hospitalization, most of the mothers (80%) reported being married. Forty-one percent of mothers reported working full time, 34% reported no work outside of home, and 24% responded either part time work or identified as a student. This sample appears to consist of affluent mothers, as 58% report a combined average household income of 50,000 to 99,999 or 100,000 or above, and 24% reported an income under 49,999.

Results found on Table 2. The majority of mothers (61%) reported that their child was age two or younger. Most (61%) reported that their child's hospitalization lasted for longer than one month, while 24% stated less than two weeks and 15% responded three to four weeks. Participants were asked approximately how many music therapy sessions their child received. Forty-nine percent said one to four sessions and 29% said 5 or more sessions. Five percent chose \"I did not know my child received music therapy\". Eighty-nine percent of mothers were present for at least one session. When asked if they participated in at least one session, 68% said yes and 32% said no. 16 TABLE 2 Mothers- Questions Related to Services Question n responses % Age of child at time of hospitalization 0 - 2 25 61 3 - 5 5 12 6 - 9 3 7 10 - 12 3 7 13 - 15 4 10 16 - 17 1 2.5 Approximate length of hospitalization 1 - 2 days 2 5 3 - 7 days 5 12 1 - 2 weeks 3 7 3 - 4 weeks 6 15 Over 1 month 25 61 Number of music therapy (MT) sessions 1 - 2 13 32 3 - 4 7 17 5 or more 12 29 Unknown number 7 17 I did not know my child received MT 2 5 Music therapy sessions you were present for 0 4 10 1 - 2 17 41 3 - 4 10 24 5 or more 10 24 Did you participate in at least one session? Yes 28 68 No 13 32 Participants were next asked to rate a series of statements from 1 to 5, where 1= strongly disagree, 2= disagree , 3= neutral , 4= agree , and 5 =strongly agree. Results can be found on Table 3. For the statement \"my child enjoyed music therapy\", most (85%) of mothers chose \"strongly while 15% selected \"not applicable\" or \"neutral\". The next two statements addressed the effectiveness of music therapy to reduce anxiety and percepti on of pain, respectively. Seventy-eight percent agreed or strongly agreed that music therapy helped to reduce their child's anxiety, and 55% felt it reduced their child's perception of pain. Just over 17 42% of mothers chose \"neutral\" or \"not applicable\" regarding music therapy's effectiveness for their child's pain management. Eighty-five percent of mothers agreed or strongly agreed that music therapy was beneficial for their child, and eighty-six percent believe that their child responded positively during music therapy. Seventy-percent agreed or strongly agreed that their child continued to respond positively after music therapy, while 17% felt neutral. When addressing music therapy's enhancement of coping skills, 76% strongly agreed or agreed, and 12% felt neutral. Almost 58% of mothers report doing more music at home with their child since experiencing music therapy. Just over twenty-seven percent feel neutral and 7.5% said disagree, indicating that almost two thirds of parents do more music at home since receiving services. Almost sixty-eight percent of mothers would want music therapy for their child again in the future, if applicable. The next two questions addressed the influence of music therapy services on participants' view of the hospital. Seventy-six percent of mothers were more likely to recommend the hospital to other families because of their music therapy program. Sixty-five percent of mothers felt that music therapy increased their overall satisfaction with the hospital, while 25% felt neutral. The final statement addressed whether the number of sessions the child received was adequate for his or her needs. Eighty-one percent felt the number of sessions was adequate, though 12.5% disagreed or strongly disagreed; this was the only statement for which a mother selected \"strongly disagree\".

Twelve mothers chose to comment. Comments are displayed in Table 4. TABLE 4 Mothers' Comments \"The music therapy was so wonderful for [child]. We have a very musical family so this made her feel right at home.\" \"[Child] had to have a very difficult procedure done and the therapist returned and played music with her during the procedure.\" \"After my son's brain tumor was removed he was very sick. The only thing that helped comfort him was music therapy.\" I'm lucky that my daughter's stay was short and a one-time event. Even in her short stay, the music therapy significantly improved her mood (mine too!). She still talks positively about the music therapy session almost a year later. Also since her session, we have used music to help her learn/concentrate, express her emotions.\" \"MORE sessions would have been great!\" [Child] LOVED Molly. She would smile and move her legs a million miles per hour while she sang to her. It was a joyous experience. \" \"We already do a great deal of music at home with our child, but there was still something incredibly special about my toddler's ability to connect with a masked stranger through music, when she was absolutely terrified of anyone else. The session offered my child control (she loved telling the music therapist what to play and watching her requests be honored) and helped ease her into a much needed nap.\" \"We now try to play more music and are working on improving her singing skills now that her vocabulary has recovered and improved even more.\" \"I felt my daughter responded well and thrived on any contact with music... it just would have made more sense to feed that drive to learn more about it. So I am disappointed.\" \"I thought the music therapy was great, but he experienced so many services while inpatient, it's difficult for me to say that the music therapy alone resulted in changes.\" \"When we were in critical care music therapy was more frequent.\" Of the 195 surveys distributed, 10 fathers returned completed surveys. None of the fathers who provided an email address opted out after receiving the email. Participants completed the same eight basic information and demographic questions prior to completing music therapy related questions as mothers. Results are depicted in Table 5. The majority of fathers (90%) were between the ages of 31 to 40, and 10% were between the ages of 41 to 50. Sixty-percent hold a Bachelor's degree or higher, indicating that- similar to the mothers- the sample consists of highly educated individuals. Eighty percent of fathers identified as 21 Caucasian, while 10% selected Hispanic or Latino and 10% said Asian/Pacific Islander. At t he time of their child's hospitalization, 90% of the fathers were married. Ninety percent of fa thers reported working full time, and two thirds reported a combined average household income of at least 50,000 to over 100,000, indicating that this sample appears to consist of affluent fathers.

Results can be found on Table 6. Most of the fathers (80%) said their child was age two or younger at the time of hospitalization, and 70% of reported that their child's hospitalization was for longer than one month. When asked how many music therapy sessions their child received, 50% said 5 or more sessions, while 10% selected \"I did not know my child 22 received music therapy\". Fifty percent of fathers were present for one or two sessions, while 20% of fathers were not present for any sessions. When asked if they participated in at least one session, 60% said no.

Yes 4 40 No 6 60 The following set of questions consisted of rating statement related to music therapy. Results can be found on Table 7. Ninety percent of fathers believed that their child enjoyed music therapy. Regarding anxiety reduction, eighty percent of fathers agreed or strongly agreed that music therapy was effective. Forty percent of fathers reported that music therapy helped reduce their child's perception of pain; 50% felt neutral or that it was not applicable. Eighty percent of fathers felt music therapy was beneficial for their child, and 70% said their child responded positively during music therapy. Sixty percent of fathers said neutral or \"not 23 applicable\" when asked how their child responded after music therapy, and 40% felt positively. For the statement \"music therapy helped my child cope better\", sixty percent agreed or strongly agreed. Forty percent of fathers agree or strongly agree that they do more music at home since experiencing music therapy, and thirty percent disagree. The next two questions addressed the role music therapy may play regarding general perceptions of the hospital. Eighty percent of fathers would want music therapy for their child again in the future, and fifty percent would recommend the hospital to other families because of it's music therapy program. Seventy percent of fathers reported that music therapy increased their overall satisfaction with the hospital.

His comments are detailed in Table 8. TABLE 8 Fathers' Comments \"I may have not been present for the music therapy but my child is thriving. We play music for him every night he sleeps. We play music for him during the day and he loves to dance.\" \"I like to think that the music therapy played a significant roll in his stay at the hospital. Thank you.\" 26 DISCUSSION Based on participant criteria specified in the IRB proposals, there were 557 eligible participants for this study. Eighty-two had provided email addresses. The remaining 475 were contacted via telephone by th e researcher. Twelve had invalid phone numbers, eighteen did not speak English, and 308 did not answer or respond. Twenty-four declined to provide an email address; six stated that they could not recall music therapy services, and five fathers asked t he researcher to contact their wife/the child's mother instead. Over four times as many mothers responded to the survey than fathers. This is consistent with related studies, where more mothers responded (Webster-Stratton, 1988) or only mothers responded (Phares, Compas, & Howell, 1989). It is also consistent with research in which the term \"parent\" is applied, however, the information comes only from mothers (Keen, Couzen, Muspratt, & Rodger, 2010; Phares & Compas, 1992; Singh, 2003). Whereas mothers were more likely to decline by saying, \"my child did not have music therapy\", fathers were more likely to say, \"ask my wife\" or \"his/her mom would know\". No mother told the researcher to ask the father. Although parents were only contacted if their child had received music therapy, when the mother was unaware of services, the response was typically that there was no music therapy, not that she was unaware. Fathers were much more likely to acknowledge that their child might have received a service that they had not been aware of. Five percent of mothers who completed the survey did not know their child received music therapy. Ten percent were not present for any sessions. Based on the comments, many of the mothers who knew their child received music therapy valued the experience and knew what had occurred in the sessions, even if they had not physically been there. The mothers reported a wide range of the age of their child and length of hospitalization. Eighty-percent of fathers had a child under the age of two, and seventy-percent 27 reported that the hospitalization was over one month. This means that fathers were much more likely to know and experience music therapy when their child was young or in an extended hospitalization, but mothers were likely to know throughout. Studies have found a positive correlation between length of services (Brannan et al., Phares, 2000) for both mothers and fathers; in this study, length of treatment and child's age were influencing factors primarily for fathers. Sixty-eight percent of mothers participated in at least one session com pared to forty percent of fathers. There is an extremely high rate of divorce among parents of a child with a disability. As previously discussed, mothers reported a greater negative impact of their child's problems on their lives than fathers (Calzada, Eyberg, Rich, & Querido, 2004); furthermore, mothers experience more distress than fathers due to taking on a larger part of the extra duties associate d with having a child with disabilities (Bristol, Gallagher, & Schopler, 1988; Moes, Koegle, Schreibman, & Loos, 1992). This can be seen in these results. Thirty-four percent of mothers reported no work outside home, while another seventeen percent work park time. Ninety percent of fathers reported working full time, and only ten percent stated that they do not work outside the home. Mothers were more likely to be present for sessions and to know what had occurred. The only statement in which mothers selected \"strongly disagree\" and \"disagree\" was for \"t he number of music therapy sessions my child received was adequate for his/her needs\", indicating that mothers would have preferred more music therapy sessions and were open to the support. No mother chose \"disagree\" or \"strongly disagree\" for the statement \"I would want music therapy for my child again in the future\". While fathers rated music therapy highly in general, it did not appear to influence their view of the hospital overall as much as mothers. It is possible 28 that this is because without seeing and engaging with the child in music therapy, it is more difficult to understand the value of the service. This is also consistent with research by Branna n, Sonnichsen, and Heflinger (1996) that found that fathers report less acceptability of their child's services. Additionally, parents who believe their child's problem to be more serious tend to view services as less effective than parents who believe their child's problem to be less seve re (Godley, Fiedler, & Funk, 1998), which is another possible explanation. Limitations of the Study This study required Internet access and an active email address, which may have limited participants. It also required English language skills, both to communicate with the researcher and to take the survey. The number of participants- particularly fathers- was low, and further research is needed in order to fully form a comparison of mothers and fathers. Implications for Future Research This study provides a general idea about the perceptions of mothers and fathers regarding music therapy for their child. It is apparent that more mothers are exposed to these services than fathers, and may view them more positively. Th e researcher suggests approaching participants before their child receives music therapy to ensure that both parents are present, though this would not be an accurate representation of the number of parents who experience music therapy. Additionally, research with single parents and same-sex parents may give a more rounded idea of parent perceptions. Conclusion The results of this study present an idea of the opinions of mothers and fathers regarding music therapy for their child in the hospital. Mothers are more likely to be involved with their child's services and are more likely to participate in sessions. Fathers tended to trust care a nd 29 services to the mother, but appeared to appreciate sessions. Further research is needed for a more direct comparison. 30 APPENDIX A SURVEY 31 32 33 34 35 APPENDIX B THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE IRB February 5, 2015 Molly Moses Non-Medicine Study Title: Mothers' and Fathers' Perceptions of Music Therapy for their Hospitalized Child: A Comparison IRB # IRB 2015-274 Dear Molly Moses, The Office of Research Integrity and Compliance, (ORIC), Institutional Review Board has reviewed the above-named study and has determined that it is exempt from IRB review.
