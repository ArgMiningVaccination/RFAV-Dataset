This initiative aims to develop a collaborative and community - focused effort in identifying a nd prioritizing health needs in our community by service providers. CHA/CHP refers to the two component parts of our Community Health Plan, the Community Health Assessment (CHA) phase and the Community Health Improvement Plan (CH IP) phase. The Austin/Travis County CHA is a community participatory research process which illustrate s our health status, strengths, and opportunities for the fu ture. Through the CHA , community activities and event s and the voices of our communities and public health partners contribute to an engaging and substantive process. We, as a community, work together to identify strengths, capacity, and opportunit ies to better address the many determinants of health. Following the assessment phase , partners work together to implement a n Improvement Plan to determine major health priorities, overarching goals, specific objectives , and actionable strategies to implement in a coordinated way across Austin/Travis County. This plan is intended to serve as a vision for the health of the community and a framework for organizations to use in leveraging resources, engaging partners, and identifying their own priorities and strategies for community health improvement. This initiative is driven by our community health partners and cannot succeed without your involvement. Year 3 Action Planning for Implementation Adopted in 2018, The Austin/Travis County Community Health Plan is beginning its third year of implementation . This is a pivo tal time to become active, and we welcome and encourage participation by organizations and individuals in workgroups to help address the four priority areas of Access to Care, Chronic Disease , Sexual Health, and Behavioral Health identified during the asse ssment phase by community members . The Austin/Travis County Community Health Plan partners, including core agencies, workgroups members , stakeholders, and community residents, continued implementation of the 2018 Community Health Plan by prioritizing str ategies for Year 3 (Y3), developing specific action steps , assigning lead responsible parties, and identifying resources for each priority area during the Year 3 Action Planning Sessions held in February and March of 2021 . These components form the Year 3 Action Plan for the detailed in the following document . We encourage partners to continue to engage by joining one our four workgroups addressing Y 3 strategies. As we know time is valuable, workgroup meetings are kept t o a minimum, however community engagement is essential to assure fulfillment of the plan's strategies and the building of a truly collaborative process and shared effort for obtaining community health. We thank you for your commitment.
