Many women often miss work, school, personal outings, and important celebrations to tend to their health care. Doctors are certainly aware of this disease's debilitating effects. Although, one study found conventional doctors [commonly dismissed symptoms](https://centrespringmd.com/endometriosis-101-the-mystery-diagnosis/), lacked crucial knowledge, and provided inconsistent advice on endometriosis (1). Holistic doctors provide medical advice on lifestyle changes, treatments, and nutritional counseling so [endometriosis](https://centrespringmd.com/conditions-we-treat/endometriosis/) does not take over your life. Holistic Medicine Medical doctors who incorporate a [holistic approach](https://centrespringmd.com/these-4-methods-make-your-holistic-care-more-powerful/) view the body as a whole person, and not separate parts. In other words, to completely heal a person, prescribing medication (if necessary) is only one part of holistic medicine. For long-term health and wellness, holistic doctors look at many different factors. To illustrate, a holistic doctor examines a patient's diet, exercise and sleep habits, daily routine, possible stress, and toxins (2). The main focus of holistic medicine is to heal the body in its entirety, and not just cure one specific ailing part. Specifically, health professionals acknowledged that with endometriosis, enhanced collaborative care and individualized treatment plans could be extremely effective (1). [Integrative, holistic medicine](https://centrespringmd.com/functional-and-integrative-medicine/) does just this by combining branches of medicine to treat endometriosis through diet, supplements, therapies, exercise, and more.
