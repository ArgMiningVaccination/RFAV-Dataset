Acupuncture is a form of medical therapy that has been practiced in China - on both human and animal patients - for thousands of years. Acupuncture techniques involve activating specific points on the body to stimulate the release of hormones and neurotransmitters. This release helps decrease pain, inflammation, and tension as well as promote blood flow and healing. The Chinese method for veterinary acupuncture was developed around 2000 years ago and spread to other Asian societies during the following centuries. It wasn't until very recently, however, that acupuncture has gained attention in Europe and North America. As drug regulations have become more stringent in equine competitions and owners have become more interested in alternative and holistic therapies, acupuncture has emerged as an increasingly popular treatment option. Types of acupuncture we offer: Common Cases: What to expect during an appointment: Is first appointment more of an assessment and then second actual treatment? The first appointment always begins with a thorough history-taking and general exam. Depending on the issue at hand, a more specific exam (lameness, neurologic, eye, etc) may also be conducted. Once points of concern have been identified, acupuncture needles are placed at points that are generally well tolerated and then progress to points that may be more sensitive. For horses that are reactive to the needles, a physical restraint (a chain or a twitch) may be used to give them an opportunity to get acclimated. If the horse is still nervous or reactive, sedation is administered and then weaned down in subsequent appointments. Especially during the first appointment, needles are placed slowly and the number is limited in order to gauge how the horse responds. Most horses respond well to the needles without restraint or sedation - many seem to find the treatments relaxing. Once the needles have been in place for 20-30 minutes, they are removed and the patient is returned to its daily routine. The only aftercare limitation following an acupuncture session is to refrain from riding for the rest of the day. The most common course of acupuncture treatments is 3 appointments, spaced one to two weeks apart (although this is variable from case to case.) After the initial series patients are maintained with follow up acupuncture sessions as needed from once every couple of months to once every couple of years. After the first session, the exam is abbreviated based on past findings as well as changes reported by the owner. It is at this point that electro-acupuncture or aqua-acupuncture may also be incorporated into the treatment plan. "}
