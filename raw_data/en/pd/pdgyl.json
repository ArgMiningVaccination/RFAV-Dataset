The principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine are based on disease prevention. For successful prevention of diseases and supporting good level of health it is necessary to know the laws of dialectics in nature and adapt this knowledge to humans, and to maintain the balance between a human and the environment with the help of these laws. Chinese doctors say that treating a disease is the same as to start digging a water well when you are thirsty. Since ancient times in Traditional Chinese Medicine medicinal and food plants have successfully been applied for prevention and treatment of diseases, also acupuncture, moxibustion and massage have successfully been used. We believe that using knowledge and apply -ing Traditional Chinese Medicine in their medical practice doctors of various clinical specialties expand the opportunities of rehabilitation measures and keeping health of the population in the Russian Federation. Key words: Chinese Medicine, Disease prevention, Health of population, Herbal, Yang, Yin.

The theories of Oriental medicine of many countries are based on General ideas about the relationship between health and nature.1 According to ancient concepts in Eastern philosophy, when the Universe was formed at the same time a huge mass, divided into two fields-Yin and Y ang, was formed. From blended Yin-Y ang the elements-air or metal, wood, water, fire, earth-arose. These elements combine: Heaven, Earth and HumanEach of these three forcescontain theAssociation and the balance between Yin-Y ang and Wu-Xing (its other name is theory of five elements). If there is absence of equilibrium between Yin and Y ang or the imbalance between Yin, Y ang, Chi and blood in the human body, a disease occurs.2 Treatment of a disease in TCM medicine is nothing but restoring Yin-Y ang balance in ahuman's body. Since ancient times, people saw a continuous change in the universe and came to the conclusion that a Yin-Y ang appeared there too. On these grounds, the ancient sages created the theory of Yin-Y ang. Yin-Y ang is not a specific material substance. It is a category, a process that has internallycontradictory nature, contained in all processes and phenomena. In General, all active, stimulating, external, outer, top and front areas, hot, bright, solid, refer to Y ang. All quiet, lethargic, cloudy, inner, directed backward and downward, cold, dark, passive are Yin. Everything in our world-from the heaven, earth, sun and smallthings and beings, such as micro-organisms, larvae, insects and grass,-embodies Yin and Y ang. The Y ang is the sun, day, spring, summer, south, east, top, heat, fire, light and Yin ismoon, night, autumn, winter, west, north, down, cold, water and darkness. Man's Y ang is outside, in back, in upper body, and so on, Yin is inside, in the front part of the chest and abdomen, below. Diseases involving Y ang usually proceed with symptoms of dryness, constipation, fever, convulsions, they are acute diseases. Diseases of Yin usually proceed with symptoms of humidity, diarrhea, cold, sweating, decreased motor activity, paralysis, weakness, they are chronic diseases. Yin and Y ang cannot exist without each other. They alwaysinteract and assist each other. Features of the theory and diagnosis of diseases in TCM in contrast to European medicine: the application of the theory of Yin-Yang in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) For successful disease prevention and healthmaintenanceit is essential to know the laws of dialectics in nature and adapt this knowledge to a human, and to maintain with their balance between human and the environment.2In TCM diagnosis the most important methods3 are: 1. Inspection of a patient's exterior: if the skin has hyperamylasemia, issmooth, elastic and moist, the eyes shine this disease belongs to Y ang. If the skin is pale, grey, yellow or black, dry, the motion is slow, the eyes are dull-the disease belongs to Yin. 2. Diagnosis by hearing: if the patient speaks with sighs, groans and loud voice, the disease belongs to Y ang. When the breath and the voice are quiet, the disease belongs to Yin. 3. Diagnosis method of the survey: if the patient is afraid of the cold, complains of diarrhea, cold hands and feet, the disease belongs to Yin. If he or she complains of high fever, thirst, constipation, the disease belongs to Y ang. 4. Diagnosis by pulse: if the artery is large, convex, fast, these diseases are related to Y ang, and if the artery is small, slow, located in the depth, the disease belongs to Yin. In the treatment of disease, the following principle is used: in sickness related to Yin, it is necessary to cure the Y ang, and vice versa before the settlement of the disease related to the Y ang-settlement of Yin and Y ang in the body is needed. During acupuncture treatment, for example, this rule is applied the following way: to treat illness Yin it is needed to use Y ang points for acupuncture, in the case of Y ang illness-Yin Physiology and Non-medicamental Methods, Faculty of Advanced Training of Medical Workers, Peoples Friendship University of Russia, Medical Institute, RUSSIA.TATARINTSEV A et al. : 201640 Pharmacognosy Communications, Vol 6, Issue 1, Jan-Mar, 2016Goals and objectives of the study: features of the use of medicinal and food plants in TCM Medicinal and food plants have been used in traditional Chinese medicine4-9 since ancient times. The first collection of the IV century on medicinal plants of the East included 365 names of plants, which were divided into 23 groups of medicinal raw material: weeds, grass, water grass, food products, wood, plants, pets, wild animals, birds, fish, reptiles, insects, minerals and much more.4 As a rule in TCM recipes, Chinese doctors combine several components5 Ancient doctors believed that as adynasty consists of the Emperor, his assistants, mandarins and officials; the recipe also should consist of the main and auxiliary components. Diseases were also divided into groups. In traditional Chinese medicine, there are 4 types of components: 1. the main component , which treats the main symptoms of the disease. Its dosedoesn't necessarily have to be higher than the other compo - nents in the recipe. As an active substance in it is strong a small dose of the main component is enough to cure. 2. auxiliary component, which improves the efficiency of the primary component.This component plays a dual role: - firstly, it reduces the toxicity of the main component, if the toxicity exceeds the norm;- secondly, it helps the basic component treat concomitantdiseases. 3. explorercomponentalso plays a dual role:firstly, it brings the bioac - tivity in the necessary channels and their corresponding organs; - secondly, it plays a supporting role in the recipe. 4. component, corrective taste, smell also plays a dual role: - firstly, it corrects the taste, smell - secondly, harmonizes the action of the components. However, any recipe does not necessarily have to contain all 4 types of components, because sometimes the main component is non-toxic or it plays both rolesitself (for example, treats inflammation and lowers temperature). Matherials and methods: forms of natural medicines used in the traditional medicine of China The flora of China is very rich and diverse. A great number of medicinal and food plants >2000) are used in TCM1-2, 4-7,9 Fees, consisting of herbal, animal and mineral raw materials, broken into small pieces orwhole, are boiled or, less often, infused on vodka or alcohol. Usually, these fees are boiled twice or three times for full extraction of active components. Pills are made of crushed powders of medicinal plants by mixing with honey or sugar syrup. This form is easy to use, but has rather low con - centration of active components; therefore the course of treatment lasts longer and is used to treat chronic diseases. In some cases, the pills have components that contain essential oils and they cannot be boiled, as they evaporate with the steam. If the manufacturing process and technology are correct, the pills can be preserved for a long time. The powders are produced by milling one or more medicinal herbs and are taken internallywith water or other liquid for topical appli - cation or injection into the cavity of the nose and ear. Thick extract is divided into two types: - for ingestion; - for external use as a patch. These medications are manufactured by evaporation to the desired consistency. The patches can be applied to impact on biologically active points or after acupuncture on the desired area. Small ballswere originally used for manufacturing of harmful and potent drugs, but at the present time, considering the convenience in use, this form is used for cooking any kind of balls from non- toxic ingredients. Small balls are made for ingestion with different ingredients. Alcohol extracts are rarely used in TCM (balms are multi- component extracts; elixirs - are single-component extracts). For the extraction of substances from herbs, 35-40% alcohol or vodka is commonlyused. The extraction process using vodka or alcohol lasts from several days to several months (about 100 days) or in a water bath (express method). Alcohol extractionrelatively rapid and the extracts can be preserved for a long time. However, if some components are not soluble in alcohol or alcohol extracts are not tolerated by the patient, this form is not used. Pencils aremade by grinding the powder with adhesives. They are given the shape of a short pencil with rounded ends. They are used for inhalation in the mouth or nose, or for external application to wounds. Inhalations. There are 2 types: fire and water. Candles . While burning their smoke is used as inhalation in various diseases. Therapeutic strips containing medicinal plants, minerals, oil, etc. are used for the treatment of diseases of women and men that are not typical of European medicine. Ointments and oils for application via the navelbymassage not typical of European medicinal systems. RESUL TS AND DISCUSSION Some medicinal and food plants are used in the interests of preserving health in Russia. Currently, the state-owned pharmaceutical enterprises in China manufacturea wide variety of unique TCM drugs, such as Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, Xiao Y ao Wan, Ke Lin, Hu Gan Wan, etc. related to the category of herbs that have been certified by the quality of the state sanitary and epidemiological supervision of Russia. Russian doctors achieve good results in complex application for the prevention and treatment of many diseases, using these wonderful biologically active supplements that restore the balance of Yin and Y ang in the body and help maintain health, prevent development of acute and chronic diseases, relieve tension, fatigue, regulate disturbed sleep, have a healing effect. When assigning balms, pills etc., we propose to consider the system Wu-Xing (it's other name is five elements theory), existing in Oriental medicine and in the very principle of selecting the components of each pill or broth, dry or liquid. For optimal selection of biologically active substances, we propose pulse diagnostic like chinese doctors use during 5000 years. CONCLUSION TCMis the integrated method and is easy to perform, andallows to follow the dynamics of changes in the body at the time of treatment and after it. It helps tomake a right choice of treatment regimen, as well as enables to select a correct Yin-treatment (medicinal herbs in the system Wu-Xing, diet) and Y ang-treatment (heating, massages) andoptimizes work of a doctor of any clinical specialty. It conducts directed research work under the supervision of clinical laboratory diagnostics, functional diagnostics to verify methods and assessment of the state of the organism for the implementation of such approaches and their use for the prevention and rehabilitation. Knowledge and application of the TCM methods in doctor's practice of the Russian Federation expand the opportunities of rehabilitation measures and the TATARINTSEV A et al. : 2016Pharmacognosy Communications, Vol 6, Issue 1, Jan-Mar, 2016 41preservation of public health. A human is a part of nature and therefore it is better for a human being to use opportunities given by nature. REFERENCES 1. Nikolaev N. A.
