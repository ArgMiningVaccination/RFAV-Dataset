In the Emergency Department, patients and visitors are asked to continue masking, and masking may be required in outpatient areas based on screening and symptoms. Patients who are feeing unwell should also wear a mask at all times. Masks will still be widely available throughout and we encourage visitors and patients to wear a mask in any area they choose. Visiting the hospital The Ottawa Hospital is currently allowing visitors, in accordance with our Visitors and Family Presence policy. This policy encourages patients, families and care teams to determine how many people should be present at any time. Essential Care Partners (ECPs) and visitors will still be expected to complete screening before entering the facility (see below for more information) and must always wear a mask. There are no defined visiting hours as part of this policy, and loved ones are welcome to visit patients at The Ottawa Hospital at times that work best for patients in collaboration with care teams. Due to space limitations, we recommend only a fully vaccinated Essential Care Partner may accompany a patient to their outpatient appointment. It may not always be possible to wait with the patient due to space limitations in waiting rooms. Yes. Patients who are coming to the hospital for appointments, Essential Care Partners and visitors will be given a disposable medical mask when they enter the hospital. Masks must be worn at all times while in the hospital. Masks help prevent the spread of respiratory illness, including COVID-19, when important measures such as physical distancing are not possible. Important information about [properly and safely wearing a mask](/en/2019-novel-coronavirus/safely-wearing-a-mask/). Essential Care Partners and social visitors are not the same. An Essential Care Partner is a support person whose presence is considered essential to the safety and wellbeing of a patient while they are in the hospital. Learn more about The Ottawa Hospital's [Essential Care Partner Program](https://www.ottawahospital.on.ca/en/patients-visitors/essential-care-partners/) While a unit is experiencing an outbreak, there may be increased precautions on that unit to ensure the safety of patients, staff and Essential Care Partners. This means that in some cases, visitors may not be allowed on that particular unit. Before visiting a unit experiencing an outbreak at The Ottawa Hospital, visitors are advised to consult with unit staff. Entrance screening staff will verify all visitors with unit staff.

This will help reduce risk because we know that it can be difficult for children to wear a mask properly and maintain physical distancing. We know that sometimes children need to visit patients. In those cases we will work with you to see if a visit can be done safely. If you would like to bring a child to visit someone in the hospital, please talk to your loved one's care team in advance.
