BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Extending the half-life a therapeutic agent, whether being a therapeutic protein, peptide or small molecule, often requires specialized formulations or modifications to the therapeutic agent itself. Conventional modification methods such as pegylation, adding to the therapeutic agent an anti\u00ad body fragment or an albumin molecule, suffer from a number of profound drawbacks. While these modified forms can be prepared on a large scale, these conventional methods are generally plagued by high cost of goods, complex process of manufacturing, and low purity of the final product. Often\u00ad times, it is difficult, if not impossible, to purify to homoge\u00ad neity of the target entity. This is particularly true for pegyla\u00ad tion, where the reaction itself cannot be controlled precisely to generate a homogenous population of pegylated agents that carry the same number or mass of polyethylene-glycol. Fur\u00ad ther, the metabolites of these pegylated agents can have sever side effects. For example, PEGylated proteins have been observed to cause renal tubular vacuolation in animal models (Bendele, A., Seely, J., Richey, C., Sennello, G. & Shopp, G. Short communication: renal tubular vacuolation in animals treated with polyethylene-glycol-conjugated proteins. Toxi\u00ad col. Sci. 1998. 42, 152-157). Renally cleared PEGylatedpro\u00ad teins or their metabolites may accumulate in the kidney, caus\u00ad ing formation of PEG hydrates that interfere with normal glomerular filtration. In addition, animals and humans can be induced to make antibodies to PEG (Sroda, K. et al. Repeated injections of PEG-PE liposomes generate anti-PEG antibod\u00ad ies. Cell. Mol. Biol. Left. 2005. 10, 37-47). [0003] Thus, there remains a considerable need for alterna\u00ad tive compositions and methods useful for the production of highly pure form of therapeutic agents with extended half-life properties at a reasonable cost. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004] The present invention addresses this need and pro\u00ad vides related advantages. The compositions and methods dis\u00ad closed herein not only are useful as therapeutics but are also particularly useful as research tools for preclinical and clinal development of a candidate therapeutic agent. In some asepects, the present invention addresses this need by, in part, generating extended recombinant polypeptide (XTEN) reagents that can be purified to homogeneity with one or a few simple steps, and/or that are amenable to chemical conjuga\u00ad tion with payload peptides, proteins and small molecules with reactive groups using a wide diversify of conjugation meth\u00ad ods. The use of the XTEN reagents generates high-yield product of XTEN-Iinked agent that are superior in one or more aspects including high homogeneity, high solubility, long stability, and enhanced terminal half-life compared to unconjugated product.[0005] The present invention relates, in part, to novel com\u00ad positions comprising substantially homogeneous extended recombinant polypeptides (XTEN) useful as conjugation partners for linking to one or more payload pharmacologi\u00ad cally- or biologically-active agents, resulting in XTEN-pay- Ioad compositions. In one aspect, the invention provides XTEN engineered for covalent linking to the one or more payloads either directly or via cross-linkers, resulting in XTEN-payload composition that comprise I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more molecules of one, two, three or more types of payloads. It is an object of the present invention to provide such engineered XTEN polypeptides for use in creating con\u00ad jugates with payload agents of interest as compositions with enhanced pharmaceutical properties, including enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. The invention provides XTEN that are substantially homogeneous in length and sequence that are useful for preparing the conjugates comprising the XTEN linked to one or more payloads such that the resulting XTEN-payload conjugates have a high degree of purify. Such conjugates of high purity are useful in preparing pharmaceu\u00ad tical compositions for subjects having a medical condition for which the one or more payloads have utility in the prevention, treatment or amelioration of the condition. [0006] In a first aspect, the invention provides substantially homogenous XTEN polypeptide compositions useful as con\u00ad jugation partners to create XTEN-cross-linker intermediates and XTEN-payload compositions. In some embodiments, the invention provides a substantially homogenous population of polypeptides comprising an extended recombinant polypep\u00ad tide (XTEN), and least 94%, or 95% of individual polypeptide molecules in said population have identical sequence length. In one embodi\u00ad ment of the foregoing, the XTEN is characterized in that: the total XTEN amino acid residues is at least 36 to about 3000 amino acid residues; the stun of glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate (E) and proline (P) resi\u00ad dues constitutes more than about 90% of the total amino acid residues of the XTEN; the XTEN sequence is substantially non-repetitive such that (i) the XTEN sequence contains no three contiguous amino acids that are identical unless the amino acids are serine, (ii) at least about 80%, or about 90%, or about 95% of the XTEN sequence consists of non-over- lapping sequence motifs, each of the sequence motifs com\u00ad prising about 9 to about 14 amino acid residues, wherein any two contiguous amino acid residues does not occur more than twice in each of the sequence motifs; or (iii) the XTEN sequence has a subsequence score of less than 10; the XTEN formation as determined by GOR algorithm; the XTEN sequence has less than 2%, or 3%, or 4%, or 5% alpha helices; the sequence 2%, or 3%, 4%, or 5% beta-sheets as determined by Chou-Fasman and the XTEN sequence lacks a predicted T-cell when analyzed by TEPITOPE algorithm, wherein the TEPITOPE algorithm prediction for epitopes within the XTEN sequence is based on a score of -8, or -9, or -10. In another embodiment of the foregoing, the XTEN comprises a sequence having at least about 90%, or at least about 91%, or at least about 92%, or at least about 93%, or at least about 94%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 96%, or at least about 97%, or at least about 98%, or at least about 99%, or 100% sequence identify to a sequence selected from the group consisting of the sequences set forth in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Tables 22-25. US 2015/0037359 Al 2Feb. enous XTEN polypeptide compositions comprise one or more affinity tags. In one embodiment, the invention provides a substantially homogenous XTEN polypeptide composition comprising a first affinity tag wherein the first affinity tag has binding affinity for a chromatography substrate selected from the group consisting of hydrophobic interaction chromatog\u00ad raphy (HIC), cation exchange, anion exchange, immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), and immobilized antibody. In one embodiment of the foregoing, the first affin\u00ad ity tag has at least about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, or at least about 95% sequence identity to a sequence selected from the group consisting of the sequences set forth in Table 7.

[0038] FIG. 3 shows a conjugation reaction utilizing thiol groups and an N-maleimide. The maleimide group reacts specifically with sullhydryl groups when the pH of the reac\u00ad tion mixture is between pH 6.5 and 7.5, forming a stable thioether linkage that is not reversible. [0039] FIG. 4 shows a conjugation reaction utilizing halo- acetyls. most commonly group that reacts with groups at physiological pH. The reaction of the iodoacetyl group with a sulfhydryl proceeds by nucleophilic substitution of iodine with a thiol producing a stable thioether linkage in the XTEN- payload. [0040] FIG. reaction utilizing pyridyl disulfides. Pyridyl disulfides react with sulfhydryl groups over a broad pH range (the optimal pH is 4-5) to form disulfide bonds linking XTEN to payloads. [0041] FIG. 6 shows a conjugation reaction utilizing zero- length cross-linkers wherein the cross-linkers are used to directly conjugate carboxyl functional groups of one mol\u00ad ecule (such as a payload) to the primary amine of another molecule (such as an XTEN). [0042] FIG. 7 shows different configurations of XTEN pre\u00ad cursors that are multifunctional (or reactive moieties can be designed using a scaffold polymer, either linear (forming a \"comb\" configuration) or branched (forming a \"dendrimer\" configuration), for multivalent display.

The result of this reaction is a native amide bond at the ligation site of the XTEN-payload composition. [0048] FIG. 13 shows a conjugation reaction utilizing expressed protein ligation (EPL) methodology. The EPL method is based on protein splicing, the process in which a protein undergoes an intramolecular rearrangement resulting in the extrusion of an internal sequence (intein) and the join\u00ad ing of the lateral sequences (exteins). In the method, the fused protein undergoes an N\u2014S shift when the side chain of the first cysteine residue of the intein portion of the precursor protein nucleophilically attacks the peptide bond of the resi\u00ad due immediately upstream (that is, for example, the final residue of XTEN) to form a linear thioester intermediate,followed by a rearrangement to form to form an amide bond between the XTEN-cross-linker and the payload. [0049] FIG. 14 shows a conjugation reaction utilizing traceless Staudinger ligation, like Native Chemical Ligation (NCL), resulting in a native amide bond at the ligation site [0050] FIG. 15 showsaconjugationreaction utilizing enzy\u00ad matic ligation. Transglutaminases are enzymes that catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the y-carboxa- mide group of glutamine of a payload peptide or protein and the 6-amino group of a lysine in a lysine-engineered XTEN (or an N-terminal amino group), thereby creating inter- or intramolecular cross-links between the XTEN and payload.

FIG. 19C illustrates the nomenclature of the reaction products of two XTEN segment precursors. In the top version, a IA was reacted with a IB to create a dimeric XTEN linked at the N-termini, with the residue of the cross\u00ad linker indicated by I Ajj-I Bjj, while the bottom version is also a dimeric XTEN linked at the N-termini, with the residue of the cross-linker indicated by 2AR-2QR. [0055] FIG. 20 illustrates the creation of various XTEN precursor segments. FIG. 20A shows the steps of making an XTEN polypeptide, followed by reaction of the N-terminus with the cross-linker with 2B-1A reactive groups, with the IA reacting with the N-terminal IB (e.g., an alpha amino acid) to create the XTEN precursor 2 with the reactive group 2B. FIG. 20B shows the sequential addition cross-linkers with 2A groups to XTEN, result\u00ad ing in XTEN precuror 4, which is then reacted with a cross\u00ad linker at the N-terminus between a reactive IB and the IA of a cross-linker, resulting in precuror 5, with 15Feb. 4B and 3B. In such case, the XTEN-precurors 5 then could serve as a reactant with two different payloads or XTEN. [0056] FIG. 21 illustrates examples of multimeric conju\u00ad gates. FIG. 21A illustrates how three molecules of an XTEN with a conjugated payload A can be conjugated to a trimeric cross-linker, resulting in a trimeric XTEN-payload conjugate with payloads.

The amino group in the XTEN precursor acts as reactive group 2B and the thiol group as reactive group IB. The XTEN precursor can be cross-linked using cross-linker that can react with group IB. The valency of the cross-linker controls the valency of the resulting intermediate. This cross- linked intermediate can be reacted with a payload carrying a reactive group 2A that can react with the amino group form\u00ad ing the conjugation link 2A-BR. FIG. 22A is pre\u00ad 22B gate. FIG. is a illustrates examples of multivalent XTEN conjugates that can originate from XTEN precursors with a single cysteine. The amino group in the XTEN precursor acts as reactive group IB and the thiol group as reactive group 2B. The XTEN precursor can be cross-linked using cross linker that can react with group IB. The valency of the cross linker controls the valency of the resulting intermediate. This cross linked intermediate can be reacted with a payload carrying a reactive group 2A that can react with the thiol group forming the conjugation link 2A-BR. FIG. 23A illustrates the thiol group located close to the C-terminus of XTEN. As a result the payload is located at the distal ends of the final trimeric conjugate. FIG. 23B illustrates that the thiol group is located close to the N-terminus of XTEN.

[0061] FIG. 26 illustrates various examples of conjugates with high valency. Conjugations sites of payloads can grouped (FIG. 26A) or interspersed (FIG. 26B). [0062] FIG. 27 illustrates the preparation of bispecific con\u00ad jugates from an XTEN precursor carrying both amino and thiol groups in which many chemistries can be used and the order of payload addition can vary. One can generate linker- conjugates as precursors. FIG. 27A shows the creation of a single XTEN precursor to which two different payloads are attached. FIG. 27B shows a segment approach starting fromtwo XTEN precursor molecules. This approach allows one to conjugate both payloads to XTEN using the same type of linker chemistry. In this case, the figure shows thiol as the group to which payloads are conjugated, and then the N-ter- minus of each segment is modified with a cross-linker to enable head-to-head segment conjugation, resulting in a dimeric, bispecific conjugate final product. [0063] FIG. 28 shows examples of multivalent conjugates combining an antibody, XTEN, and a payload. Such con\u00ad structs can have different valencies and provide many benefits in that the XTEN can have a cleavable linker, XTEN can provides solubility to the composition, and it can allow adjustment of the drug load per IgG, and the XTEN can be pre-conjugated with drug to simplify manufacturing. FIG. 28A illustrates two XTENs conjugated to IgG at Cys residues in the hinge region. FIG. 28B illustrates four XTEN conju\u00ad gated to IgG using FIG. 28C illus\u00ad trates XTEN conjugated outside of hinge. This can be done by inserting Cys to control conjugation site or by random con\u00ad jugation to Lys side chains. [0064] FIG. 29 shows examples of the construction of con\u00ad jugates combining an antibody, XTEN, and a payload. The antibody can have one or multiple reactive groups IB. XTEN can be conjugated to one or multiple Payloads A. In addition XTEN can carry a reactive group IA that preferentially reacts with the reactive group IB on the antibody. The location of reactive groups IB in the antibody controls the number and location of XTENs that are conjugated to the antibody, result\u00ad ing in the final product.

[0067] FIG. 32 shows examples of conjugates comprising a targeting moiety, XTEN, and a multiple different payloads. [0068] FIG. 33 shows examples of combinatorial XTEN conjugates. Payloads A, B, C, and D carry reactive group 2A that reacts with reactive group 2B on the XTEN precursor. In the next step, Payloads E and F carry a reactive group IA that reacts with reactive group IB on XTEN, resulting in a library of different permutations of bispecific conjugates. In this case, the reactive groups and 2B are thiol- and amino- groups, respectively. [0069] FIG. 34 shows an example of the creation of a com\u00ad binatorial XTEN conjugate library. Payloads A, B, C are conjugated to XTEN carrying reactive group I A, resulting in one set of XTEN-precursor segments. Payloads E, F, and G are conjugated to XTEN carrying reactive group IB, resulting in a second set of XTEN-precursor segments. These segments are subjected to combinatorial conjugation and then are puri\u00ad fied from reactants. This enables the formation of combina\u00ad torial products that can be immediately subjected to in vitro and in vivo testing. In this case, reactive groups IAand IB are the alpha-amino groups of XTEN with or without a bi specific cross-linker. In one example, the IA is an azide and IB is an alkyne or vice versa, while the payloads are attached to XTEN via thiol groups in XTEN. [0070] FIG. 35 shows an example of the creation of a com\u00ad binatorial XTEN conjugate library that optimizes Al 16Feb. 5,2015 between two payloads. Each library member carries a differ\u00ad ent ratio of payload A and payload E. [0071] FIG. 36 shows an example of the creation of a com\u00ad binatorial XTEN conjugate library that creates combinations of targeting moieties and payloads. The targeting moieties I , 2, and 3 are conjugated to XTEN carrying reactive group I A. Payloads E, F, and G are conjugated to XTEN carrying reac\u00ad tive group IB. These segments are subjected combinatorial conjugation, enabling the formation of combinatorial prod\u00ad ucts where each library member comprises targeting moieties and payloads. All XTEN segments carrying payloads and conjugation groups can be purified as combinatorial products that can be immediately subjected to in vitro and in vivo testing. [0072] FIG. 37 shows an example of an XTEN conjugate comprising targeting moieties and payloads that exert selec\u00ad tive action on the surface of a target cell, such as a tumor cell. The particular design of the dimeric XTEN conjugate com\u00ad the LFiRFi-receptor on that is over-expressed on many cancer cells. Receptor binding results in internalization followed by proteolytic break down and the intracellular liberation of doxorubicin, which is toxic to the cell. [0073] FIG. 38 is a schematic flowchart of representative steps in the assembly, production and the evaluation of a XTEN. [0074] FIG. 39 is a schematic flowchart of representative steps in the assembly of an XTEN polynucleotide construct encoding a fusion protein. Individual oligonucleotides 501 are annealed into sequence motifs 502 such as a 12 amino acid motif (\"12-mer\"), which is ligated to additional sequence motifs from a library to create a pool that encompasses the desired length of the XTEN 504, as well as ligated to a smaller concentration of an oligo containing BbsI, and KpnI restric\u00ad tion sites 503. The resulting pool of ligation products is gel- purified and the band with the desired length of XTEN is cut, resulting in an isolated XTEN gene with a stopper sequence 505. The XTEN gene is cloned into a staffer vector. In this case, the vector encodes an optional CBD sequence 506 and a GFP gene 508. Digestion is then performed with BbsI/ HindIII to remove 507 and 508 and place the stop codon. The resulting product is then cloned into a BsaEHindIII digested vector, resulting in gene 500 encoding an XTEN. [0075] FIG. 40 is a schematic flowchart of representative steps in the assembly of a gene encoding XTEN, its expres\u00ad sion, conjugation with a payload and recovery as an XTEN- paylad, and its evaluation as a candidate product.

[0077] FIG. 42 shows a generalized scheme for purification of XTEN with, in this illustrative embodiment, two tags in which a two-step purification method to capture first one tag and then the second can be utilized to remove truncated XTEN from fermentation, resulting in the highly purified target XTEN entity.

The program is hardcoded to generate scores for subsequences of lengths 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10; Block\u2014this variable holds a string of length BlockLen. The string is composed of letters from an input XTEN sequence and is determined by the position of the i counter; SubSeqList\u2014this is a list that holds all of the generated subsequence scores. [0115] FIG. 80 depicts the application of the algorithm SegScore to a hypothetical XTEN of 11 amino acids in order to determine the repetitiveness.

[0131] FIG. 96 illustrated the production of XTEN seg\u00ad ments from a precursor that contains three repeat copies of XTEN of identical length and sequence. In FIG. 96A, the XTEN precursor comprises three identical copies of XTEN that are flanked by identical protease cleavage sites. In FIG. 96B, the XTEN precursor further comprises N- and C-termi- nal affinity purification tags to facilitate purification of full- length precursor molecules. Following purification of the precursor it is cleaved by protease that acts on all the incor\u00ad porated cleavage sequences to release the tags from the XTEN, which is followed by purification to separate the individual units of XTEN, facilitating the high-yield produc\u00ad tion of XTENs with short and intermediate lengths from long-chain precursor molecules. [0132] FIG. 97 illustrates different embodiments of trim- eric, branched XTEN-payload conjugates in which all conju\u00ad gates shown can be prepared from the identical XTEN mol\u00ad ecules via conjugation to its N-terminal amino group and a functional group, such as the thiol of cysteine, that is located close to the C-terminus. FIGS. 97A and B illustrates conju\u00ad gates having a single payload molecule, with FIG. 97A using a 4-arm cross-linker with all the XTEN conjugated in close proximity to the payload, resulting in significant shielding of payload interactions with other molecules. FIG. 97B illus\u00ad trates a configuration in where the payload is conjugated to a single XTEN arm that is branched at the distal end of the configuration, resulting in reduced payload shielding com\u00ad pared to the configuration of FIG. 97A. FIG. 97C illustrates a conjugate with two payloads that can result in increased avid\u00ad ity or increased potency. FIGS. 97D and E illustrates configu\u00ad rations with three identical payloads to further increase potency and/or avidity. FIG. 97F illustrates a configuration with one payload A and two identical copies of payload B for high-avidity binding or interactions. FIG. 97G illustrates a configuration with 3 different payloads enabling the inclusion of three different functions into a single XTEN conjugate. [0133] FIG. 98 illustrates a scheme for synthesis of a con\u00ad jugate between a branched XTEN and a single payload mol\u00ad ecule. Initially, the thiol group in XTEN is blocked by reac\u00ad tion with iodoacetamide (alternatively, one can start the synthesis using XTEN which lacks a thiol group). Next, a DBCO group is added to the alpha-amino group of XTEN, then is reacted with a tetrafunctional cross linker that com\u00ad prises one iodoacetyl group The US 2015/0037359 Al 20Feb. 5,2015 resulting XTEN is next reacted with a payload that carries a free thiol group resulting in the final XTEN-payload conju\u00ad gate. [0134] FIG. 99 illustrates a scheme for synthesis of a con\u00ad jugate between a branched XTEN and a single payload mol\u00ad ecule. An intermediate is produced by reacting XTEN with a trifunctional linker comprising two azide functions and an NEiS function followed by the addition of payload A to the thiol group via maleimide chemistry (the order of these two steps can be inverted). A second intermediate is produce by reacting XTEN with a cysteine with iodoacetamide to block the free thiol group followed by addition of DBCO to the alpha-amino group via NEiS activation (the order of these two steps can be inverted). Subsequently, the two intermediate molecules are conjugated using a click chemistry reaction, resulting in the final XTEN-payload conjugate. [0135] FIG. 100 illustrates a scheme for synthesis of a conjugate having a branched XTEN and two identical pay- load molecules. An intermediate is produced by adding a DBCO group to the alpha-amino group of an XTEN via NEiS chemistry. A second intermediate is produced by blocking the free thiol group of an XTEN with iodoacetamide followed by addition of a trifunctional cross-linker (2 N-maleimide groups and a carboxyl group that is activated by NEiS) to the alpha amino-group (the order of these two steps can be inverted). The two intermediates are reacted resulting in the branched conjugate, and then two payload A molecules are added via click chemistry reaction resulting in the final prod\u00ad uct XTEN-payload conjugate. [0136] FIG. 101 illustrates a scheme for synthesis of a conjugate having a branched XTEN and three identical pay- load molecules. An intermediate is produced by adding a DBCO group to the alpha-amino group of an XTEN via NEiS chemistry. Another intermediate is produced by conjugating payload A to the thiol group of an XTEN via a N-maleimide functional group. The three molecules are linked together via a trifunctional cross-linker comprising three azide functions, resulting in the final XTEN-payload conjugate. [0137] FIG. 102 illustrates a scheme for synthesis of a conjugate having a branched XTEN and three identical pay- load molecules. An intermediate is produced by adding a DBCO group to the thiol group of an XTEN A via N-male- imide chemistry. In the next step, payload A is conjugated to the alpha amino-group of the XTEN intermediate via NEiS chemistry. Three molecules of the resulting XTEN are linked via a trifunctional cross-linker comprising three tions, resulting in the final XTEN-payload conjugate. [0138] FIG. 103 illustrates a scheme for synthesis of a conjugate having a branched XTEN and two PayloadA and one Payload B molecules per conjugate. An intermediate is produced by adding Payload A to the thiol group of an XTEN using an N-maleimide functional group, followed by the addition of a trifunctional cross linker (two azide groups and a carboxyl group that is activated by NEiS) to the alpha amino- group (the order of these two steps can be inverted). A second intermediate is produced by adding DBCO to the alpha amino-group of an XTEN via NEiS activation followed by the addition of Payload B to the free thiol group of the XTEN using an N-maleimide group (the order of these two steps can be inverted). Two molecules of the second intermediate are reacted with one molecule of the first intermediate to form the final XTEN-payload conjugate. [0139] FIG. 104 illustrates a scheme for synthesis of a conjugate having a branched XTEN and three different pay\u00adloads. An intermediate is produced by adding Payload A to the thiol group on an XTEN using an N-maleimide functional group followed by the addition of a trifunctional cross linker (one azide group, one N-maleimide group and one carboxyl group that is activated by NEiS) to the alpha amino-group (the order of these two steps can be inverted). A second interme\u00ad diate is produced by adding Payload B to the alpha amino- group of XTEN via NEiS chemistry. A third intermediate is produced by adding DBCO to the alpha amino-group of an XTEN via NEiS activation followed by the addition of pay- load C to the free thiol group of the XTEN using an N-male- imide group (the order of these two steps can be inverted). The three intermediates are reacted with each other to form the final XTEN-payload conjugate. [0140] FIG. 105 illustrates a scheme for synthesis of a conjugate having a dimeric or tetrameric branched XTEN and Payload A molecules. An intermediate is produced by adding DBCO to the thiol group of an XTEN using N-maleimide functional group followed by the addition Payload A to the amino group of the XTEN using NEiS (the order of these two steps can be inverted). Subsequently the intermediate is mul- timerizedby addition of azide cross-linkers. Use of a the and a tetrava- Ient cross-linker yields the tetrameric configuration of the final product. [0141] FIG. 106 illustrates a scheme for synthesis of a conjugate having a branched XTEN and three different pay- loads. An intermediate is produced by adding Payload A to the thiol group of an XTEN using N-maleimide functional group, followed by the addition of a trifunctional cross linker (one azide group, one N-maleimide group and one carboxyl group that is activated by NEiS) to the alpha amino-group (the order of these two steps can be inverted). A second interme\u00ad diate is produced by adding Payload B to the free thiol group of an XTEN via an N-maleimide functional group. A third intermediate is produced by adding DBCO to the alpha amino-group of an XTEN via NEiS activation followed by the addition of Payload C to the free thiol group using a N-ma- leimide group (the order of these two steps can be inverted). The three intermediates are reacted with each other to form the final XTEN-payload conjugate.

Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. [0154] Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scien\u00ad tific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Althoughmethodsandmaterials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the prac\u00ad tice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. In case of conflict, the patent specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. DEFINITIONS [0155] In the context of the present application, the follow\u00ad ing terms have the meanings ascribed to them unless specified otherwise: [0156] As used throughout the specification and claims, the terms \"a\", \"an\" and \"the\" are used in the sense that they mean \"at least one\", \"at least a \"a plurality\" of the referenced components or steps, except in instances wherein an upper limit is thereafter specifically stated. There\u00ad fore, a \"payload\", as used herein, means \"at least a first payload\" but includes a plurality of payloads. The operable limits and parameters of combinations, as with the amounts of any single agent, will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. [0157] The terms \"polypeptide\", \"peptide\", and \"protein\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be inter\u00ad rupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified, for example, by disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetyla\u00ad tion, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation, such as conjugation with a labeling component. [0158] As used herein, the term \"amino acid\" refers to either natural and/or unnatural or synthetic amino acids, including but not limited to both the D or L optical isomers, and amino acid analogs and peptidomimetics. Standard single or three letter codes are used to designate amino acids. [0159] A \"pharmacologically active\" agent includes any drug, compound, composition of matter or mixture desired to be delivered to a subject, e.g. therapeutic agents, diagnostic agents, or drug delivery agents, which provides or is expected to provide some pharmacologic, often beneficial, effect that can be demonstrated in vivo or in vitro. Such agents may include peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, nucleosides, oligonucleotides, and small molecule synthetic analogs thereof. [0160] The term \"natural L-amino acid\" means proline acid and threonine (T). [0161] The term \"non-naturally occurring,\" as applied to used herein, means polypeptide or poly\u00ad nucleotide sequences that do not have a counterpart to, are not complementary to, or do not have a high degree of homology with a wild-type or naturally-occurring sequence found in a mammal. For example, a non-naturally occurring polypep\u00ad tide or fragment may share 99%, 98%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50% or even less amino acid sequence identity as compared to a natural sequence when suitably aligned. [0162] The terms \"hydrophilic\" and \"hydrophobic\" refer to the degree of affinity that a substance has with water. A hydrophilic substance has a strong affinity for water, tending to dissolve in, mix with, or be wetted by water, while a hydrophobic substance substantially lacks affinity for water, tending to repel and not absorb water and tending not to dissolve in or mix with or be wetted by water. Amino acids can be characterized based on their hydrophobicity. A number of scales have been developed. An example is a scale devel\u00ad oped by Levitt, M, et ah, J Mol Biol (1976) 104:59, which is listed in Flopp, T P, et ah, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1981) 78:3824. alanine, asparagine, and glutamine. particular are hydrophilic amino acids aspartate, glutamate, and serine, and glycine. to a biologically active protein, is a truncated form of a the biologically active protein that retains at least a portion of the therapeutic and/or biologi\u00ad cal activity. A \"variant,\" when applied to a biologically active protein is a protein with sequence homology to the native biologically active protein that retains at least a portion of the therapeutic and/or biological activity of the biologically active protein. For example, a variant protein may share compared with the refer\u00ad ence biologically active protein. As used herein, the term \"biologically active protein variant\" includes proteins modi\u00ad fied deliberately, as for example, by site directed mutagen\u00ad esis, synthesis of the encoding gene, insertions, or acciden\u00ad tally through mutations and that retain activity. [0164] The term \"sequence variant\" means polypeptides that have been modified compared to their native or original sequence by one or more amino acid insertions, deletions, or substitutions. Insertions may be located at either or both termini of the protein, and/or may be positioned within inter\u00ad nal regions of the amino acid sequence. A non-limiting example is insertion of an XTEN sequence within the sequence of the biologically-active payload protein. Another non-limiting example is substitution of an amino acid in an XTEN with a different amino acid. In deletion variants, one or more amino acid residues in a polypeptide as described herein are removed. Deletion variants, therefore, include all frag\u00ad ments of a payload polypeptide sequence. In substitution variants, one ormore amino acidresidues of a polypeptide are removed and replaced with alternative residues. In one aspect, the substitutions are conservative in nature and con\u00ad servative substitutions of this type are well known in the art. [0165] The term \"moiety\" means a component of a larger composition or that is intended to be incorporated into a largercomposition, such as a functional group of a drug molecule or a targeting peptide joined to a larger polypeptide. [0166] As used herein, \"terminal XTEN\" refers to XTEN sequences that have been fused to or in the N- or C-terminus of the payload when the payload is a peptide or polypeptide. [0167] The term \"XTEN release site\" refers to a cleavage sequence in XTEN-payload that can be recognized and cleaved by a protease, effecting release of an XTEN or a portion of an XTEN from the XTEN-payload polypeptide. As used herein, \"mammalian protease\" means a protease that normally exists in the body fluids, cells or tissues of a mam\u00ad mal. XTEN release sites can be engineered to be cleaved by various mammalian proteases (a.k.a. sub\u00ad ject. Other equivalent proteases (endogenous or exogenous) that are capable of recognizing a defined cleavage site can be utilized. The cleavage sites can be adjusted and tailored to the protease utilized. [0168] The term \"within\", when referring to a first polypep\u00ad tide being linked to a second polypeptide, encompasses link\u00ad ing that connects the N-terminus of the first or second polypeptide to the C-terminus of the second or first polypep\u00ad tide, respectively, as well as insertion of the first polypeptide into the sequence of the second polypeptide. For example, when an XTEN is linked \"within\" a payload polypeptide, the XTEN may be linked to the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or may be inserted between any two amino acids of the payload polypeptide. [0169] \"Activity\" as applied to form(s) of a XTEN-payload composition provided herein, refers to an action or effect, including but not limited to receptor binding, antagonist activity, agonist activity, a cellular or physiologic response, or an effect generally known in the art for the payload, whether measured by an in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo assay or a clinical effect. [0170] As used herein, the term \"ELISA\" refers to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described herein or as otherwise known in the art. [0171] A \"host cell\" includes an individual cell or cell culture which can be or has been a recipient for the subject vectors such as those described herein. Flost cells include progeny of a single host cell. The progeny may not necessar\u00ad ily be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic of total DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells transfected in vivo with a vector of this inven\u00ad tion. [0172] \"Isolated\" when used to describe the various polypeptides disclosed herein, means polypeptide that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a com\u00ad ponent of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypep\u00ad tide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other pro\u00ad teinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. As is apparent to those of skill in the art, a non-naturally occurring polynucle\u00ad otide, peptide, polypeptide, protein, antibody, or fragments thereof, does not require \"isolation\" to distinguish it from its naturally occurring counterpart. In addition, a \"concen\u00ad trated\", \"separated\" or \"diluted\" polynucleotide, fragments thereof, is dis\u00ad tinguishable from its naturally occurring counterpart in that US 2015/0037359 Al 23Feb. 5,2015 the concentration or number of molecules per volume is gen\u00ad erally greater than that of its naturally occurring counterpart. In general, a polypeptide made by recombinant means and expressed in a host cell is considered to be \"isolated.\" [0173] An \"isolated\" nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid. For example, an isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the specific polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. Flowever, an isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule includes polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express the polypeptide where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal or extra-chromosomal location different from that of natural cells. [0174] A \"chimeric\" protein contains at least one fusion polypeptide comprising at least one region in a different posi\u00ad tion in the sequence than that which occurs in nature. The regions may normally exist in separate proteins and are brought together in the fusion polypeptide; or they may nor\u00ad mally exist in the same protein but are placed in a new arrangement in the fusion polypeptide. A chimeric protein may be created, for example, by chemical synthesis, or by creating and translating a polynucleotide in which the peptide regions are encoded in the desired relationship. [0175] \"Fused,\" and \"fusion\" are used interchangeably herein, and refers to the joining together of two or more peptide or polypeptide sequences by recombinant means. [0176] \"Operably linked\" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and in reading phase or in-frame. An \"in-frame fusion\" refers to the joining of two ormore open reading frames (ORFs) to form a continuous longer ORF, in a manner that maintains the correct reading frame of the origi\u00ad nal ORFs. For example, a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence for a polypeptide if it affects the transcription of the polypeptide sequence. Thus, the resulting recombinant fusion protein is a single protein containing two or more segments that correspond to polypeptides encoded by the original ORFs (which segments are not normally so joined in nature). [0177] \"Crosslinking\" and refer to the covalent joining of two different molecules by a chemical reaction. The crosslinking can occur in one or more chemical reactions, as described more fully, below. [0178] The term \"conjugation partner\" as used herein, refers to the individual components that can be linked or are linked in a conjugation reaction. [0179] The term \"conjugate\" is intended to refer to the heterogeneous molecule formed as a result of covalent link\u00ad ing of conjugation partners one to another, e.g., a biologically active payload covalently linked to a XTEN molecule or cross-linker \"cross-linking agent\" are used interchangably and in their broadest context to mean a chemical entity used to covalently join two ormore entities. For example, a cross-linker joins two, three, four or more XTEN, or joins a payload to an XTEN, as the entities are defined herein. A cross-linker includes, but is not limited to, the reaction product of small molecule zero-length, homo- orhetero-bifunctional, and multifunctional cross-linker com\u00ad pounds, the reaction product of two click-chemstry reactants. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that a cross\u00ad linker can refer to the covalently-bound reaction product remaining after the crosslinking of the reactants. The cross\u00ad linker can also comprise one or more reactants which have not yet reacted but which are capable to react with another entity. [0181] In the context of polypeptides, a \"linear sequence\" or a \"sequence\" is an order of amino acids in a polypeptide in an amino to carboxyl terminus direction in which residues that neighbor each other in the sequence are contiguous in the primary structure of the polypeptide. A \"partial sequence\" is a linear sequence of part of a polypeptide that is known to comprise additional residues in one or both directions. [0182] \"Fleterologous\" means derived from a genotypi\u00ad cally distinct entity from the rest of the entity to which it is being compared. For example, a glycine rich sequence removed from its native coding sequence and operatively linked to a coding sequence other than the native sequence is a heterologous glycine rich sequence. The term \"heterolo\u00ad gous\" as applied to a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, means that the polynucleotide or polypeptide is derived from a geno\u00ad typically distinct entity from that of the rest of the entity to which it is being compared. [0183] The terms \"polynucleotides\", \"nucleic acids\", \"nucleotides\" and \"oligonucleotides\" are used interchange\u00ad ably. They refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or analogs thereof. Polynucleotides may have any three-dimen\u00ad sional structure, and may perform any function, known or unknown. The following are non-limiting examples of poly\u00ad nucleotides: coding or non-coding regions of a gene or gene fragment, loci (locus) defined from linkage analysis, exons, recombinant polynucleotides, branched polynucleotides, plasmids, vectors, isolated DNA of any sequence, isolated RNA of any sequence, nucleic acid probes, and primers. A polynucleotide may If present, modifications to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component. [0184] The term \"complement of a polynucleotide\" denotes a polynucleotide molecule having a complementary base sequence and reverse orientation as compared to a ref\u00ad erence sequence, such that it could hybridize with a reference sequence with complete fidelity. [0185] \"Recombinant\" as applied to a polynucleotide means that the polynucleotide is the product of various com\u00ad binations of recombination steps which may include cloning, restriction and/or ligation steps, and other procedures that result in expression of a recombinant protein in a host cell. [0186] The terms \"gene\" and \"gene fragment\" are They refer to a polynucleotide con\u00ad taining at least one open reading frame that is capable of encoding a particular protein after being transcribed and translated. A gene or gene fragment may be genomic or cDNA, as long as the polynucleotide contains at least one open reading frame, which may cover the entire coding region US 2015/0037359 Al 24Feb. 5,2015 or a segment thereof. A \"fusion gene\" is a gene composed of at least two heterologous polynucleotides that are linked together. [0187] \"Homology\" or \"homologous\" \"sequence iden\u00ad tity\" refers to similarity or interchangeability between two or more polynucleotide sequences or between two or more polypeptide sequences. When using a program such as BestFit to determine sequence identity, similarity or homology between two different amino acid sequences, the default settings may be used, or an appropriate scoring matrix, such as blosum45 or blosum80, may be selected to optimize identity, similarity or homology scores. Preferably, polynucleotides that are homologous are those which hybrid\u00ad ize under stringent conditions as defined herein and have at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95%, more preferably 97%, more pref\u00ad erably 98%, and even more preferably 99% sequence identity compared to those sequences. Polypeptides that are homolo\u00ad gous preferably have sequence identities that are at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, even more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95-99% identical. [0188] \"Ligation\" as applied to polynucleic acids refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two nucleic acid fragments or genes, linking them together. To ligate the DNA fragments or genes together, the ends of the DNA must be compatible with each other. In some cases, the ends will be directly compatible after endonuclease diges\u00ad tion. However, it may be necessary to first convert the stag\u00ad gered ends commonly produced after endonuclease digestion to blunt ends to make them compatible for ligation. [0189] The terms \"stringent conditions\" or \"stringent hybridization conditions\" reference to conditions under which a polynucleotide will hybridize to its target sequence, to a detectably greater degree than other sequences (e.g., at least 2-fold over background). Generally, stringency of hybridization is expressed, in part, with reference to the temperature and salt concentration under which the wash step is carried out. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.5 M Na ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30\u00b0 C. for short polynucleotides (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60\u00b0 C. for long polynucleotides (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides)\u2014for example, \"stringent conditions\" can include hybridization in 50% formamide, I MNaCl, 1% SDS at 37\u00b0 C., and three washes for 15 min each in 0.1xSSC/l% SDS at 60\u00b0 C. to 65\u00b0 C. Alternatively, temperatures of about 65\u00b0 C., 60\u00b0 C., 55\u00b0 C., or 42\u00b0 C. may be used. SSC concen\u00ad tration may be varied from about 0.1 to 2xSSC, with SDS being present at about 0.1%. Such wash temperatures are typically selected to be about 5\u00b0 C. to 20\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. An equa\u00ad tion for calculating Tm and conditions for nucleic acid hybridization are well known and can be found in Sambrook, J. et ah, \"Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,\" Y d edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001. Typi\u00ad cally, blocking reagents are used to block non-specific hybridization. Such blocking reagents include, for instance, sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA at about 100-200 pg/ml. Organic solvent, such as formamide at a concentration of about 35-50% v/v, may also be used under particular cir\u00adcumstances, such as for RNA:DNA hybridizations. Useful variations on these wash conditions will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. [0190] The terms \"percent identity,\" percentage of sequence identity,\" as applied to polynucle\u00ad otide sequences, refer to the percentage of residue matches between at least two polynucleotide sequences aligned using a standardized algorithm. Such an algorithm may insert, in a standardized and reproducible way, gaps in the sequences being compared in order to optimize alignment between two sequences, and therefore achieve a more meaningful com\u00ad parison of the two sequences. Percent identity may be mea\u00ad sured over the length of an entire defined polynucleotide sequence, or may be measured over a shorter length, for example, over the length of a fragment taken from a larger, defined polynucleotide sequence, for instance, a fragment of at least 45, at least 60, at least 90, at least 120, at least 150, at least 210 or at least 450 contiguous residues. Such lengths are exemplary only, and it is understood that any fragment length supported by the sequences shown herein, in the tables, fig\u00ad ures or Sequence Listing, may be used to describe a length over which percentage identity may be measured. The per\u00ad centage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of matched positions (at which iden\u00ad tical residues occur in both polypeptide sequences), dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison (Te., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percent\u00ad age of sequence identity. When sequences of different length are to be compared, the shortest sequence defines the length of the window of comparison. Conservative substitutions are not considered when calculating sequence identity. [0191] \"Percent (%) sequence identity,\" with respect to the polypeptide sequences identified herein, is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a query sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues of a second, reference polypeptide sequence or a portion thereof, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity, thereby resulting in optimal alignment. Alignment for pur\u00ad poses of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNAS- TAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appro\u00ad priate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve optimal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. Percent identity may be measured over the length of an entire defined polypeptide sequence, or may be measured over a shorter length, for example, over the length of a fragment taken from a larger, defined polypeptide sequence, for instance, a fragment of at least 15, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 70 or at least 150 contiguous residues. Such lengths are exem\u00ad plary only, and it is understood that any fragment length supported by the sequences shown herein, in the tables, fig\u00ad ures or Sequence Listing, may be used to describe a length over which percentage identity may be measured. [0192] \"Repetitiveness\" used in the context of polynucle\u00ad otide sequences refers to the degree of internal homology in the sequence such as, for example, the frequency of identical US 2015/0037359 Al 25Feb. 5,2015 nucleotide sequences of a given length. Repetitiveness can, for example, be measured by analyzing the frequency of identical sequences. [0193] A \"vector\" is a nucleic acid molecule, preferably self-replicating in an appropriate host, which transfers an inserted nucleic acidmolecule into and/or between host cells. The term includes vectors that function primarily for inser\u00ad tion of DNA or RNA into a cell, replication of vectors that function primarily for the replication of DNA or RNA, and expression vectors that function for transcription and/or translation of the DNA or RNA. Also included are vectors that provide more than one of the above functions. An \"expression vector\" is a polynucleotide which, when introduced into an appropriate host cell, can be transcribed and translated into a polypeptide(s). An \"expression system\" usually connotes a suitable host cell comprised of an expression vector that can function to yield a desired expression product. [0194] \"Serum degradation resistance,\" as applied to a polypeptide, refers to the ability of the polypeptides to with\u00ad stand degradation in blood or components thereof, which typically involves proteases in the serum or plasma. The serum degradation resistance can be measured by combining the protein with human (or mouse, rat, monkey, as appropri\u00ad ate) serum or plasma, typically for a range of days (e.g. 0.25, 0.5, I, 2,4, 8,16 days), typically at about 37\u00b0 C. The samples for these time points can be run on a Western blot assay and the protein is detected with an antibody. The antibody can be to a tag in the protein. If the protein shows a single band on the western, where the protein's size is identical to that of the injected protein, then no degradation has occurred. In this exemplary method, the time point where 50% of the protein is degraded, as judged by Western blots or equivalent tech\u00ad niques, is the serum degradation half-life herein the termi\u00ad nal half-life calculated as ln(2)/Ke Z . Ke Z is the terminal elimi\u00ad nation rate constant calculated by linear regression of the terminal linear portion of the log concentration vs. time curve. Half-life typically refers to the time required for half the quantity of an administered substance deposited in a living organism to be metabolized or eliminated by normal biologi\u00ad cal processes. [0196] \"Active clearance\" means the mechanisms by which a protein is removed from the circulation other than by filtra\u00ad tion, and which includes removal from the circulation medi\u00ad ated by cells, receptors, metabolism, or degradation of the protein. [0197] \"Apparent molecular weight factor\" and \"apparent molecular weight\" are related terms referring to a measure of the relative increase or decrease in apparent molecular weight exhibited by a particular amino acid or polypeptide sequence. The apparent molecular weight is determined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or similar methods by com\u00ad paring to globular protein standards, and is measured in \"apparent kD\" units. The apparent molecular weight factor is the ratio between the apparent molecular weight and the actual molecular weight; the latter predicted by adding, based on amino acid composition, the calculated molecular weight of each type of amino acid in the composition or by estimation from comparison to molecular weight standards in an SDS electrophoresis gel. Determination of both the apparentmolecular weight and apparent molecular weight factor for representative proteins is described in the Examples. [0198] The terms \"hydrodynamic radius\" or \"Stokes radius\" is the effective radius (Ri in nm) of a molecule in a solution measured by assuming that it is a body moving through the solution and resisted by the solution's viscosity. In the embodiments of the invention, the hydrodynamic radius measurements of the XTEN polypeptides correlate with the \"apparent molecular weight factor\" which is a more intuitive measure. The \"hydrodynamic radius\" of a protein affects its rate of diffusion in aqueous solution as well as its ability to migrate in gels of macromolecules. The hydrody\u00ad namic radius of a protein is determined by its molecular weight as well as by its structure, including shape and com\u00ad pactness. Methods for determining the hydrodynamic radius are well known in the art, such as by the use of size exclusion chromatography (SEC), as described inU.S. Pat. Nos. 6,406, 632 and 7,294,513. Most proteins have globular structure, which is the most compact three-dimensional structure a pro\u00ad tein can have with the smallest hydrodynamic radius. Some proteins adopt a random and open, unstructured, or 'linear' conformation and as a result have a much larger hydrody\u00ad namic radius compared to typical globular proteins of similar molecular weight. [0199] \"Physiological conditions\" refers to a set of condi\u00ad tions in a living host as well as in vitro conditions, including temperature, salt concentration, pH, that mimic those condi\u00ad tions of a living subject. A host of physiologically relevant conditions for use in in vitro assays have been established. Generally, a physiological buffer contains a physiological concentration of salt and is adjusted to a neutral pH ranging from about 6.5 to about 7.8, and preferably from about 7.0 to about 7.5. A variety of physiological buffers are listed in Sambrook et al. (2001). Physiologically relevant temperature ranges from about 25\u00b0 C. to about 38\u00b0 C., and preferably from about 35\u00b0 C. to about 37\u00b0 C. [0200] A \"single atom residue of a payload\" means the atom of a payload that is chemically linked to XTEN after reaction with the subject XTEN or XTEN-Iinker composi\u00ad tions; typically a sulfur, an oxygen, a nitrogen, or a carbon atom. For example, an atom residue of a payload could be a sulfur residue of a cysteine thiol reactive group in a payload, a nitrogen molecule of an amino reactive group of a peptide or polypeptide or small molecule payload, a carbon or oxygen residue or a reactive carboxyl or aldehyde group of a peptide, protein or a small molecule or synthetic, organic drug. [0201] A \"reactive group\" is a chemical structure that can be coupled to a second reactive group. Examples of reactive groups are amino groups, carboxyl groups, sulfhydryl groups, hydroxyl groups, aldehyde groups, azide groups. Some reactive groups can be activated to facilitate conjuga\u00ad tion with a second reactive group, either directly or through a cross-linker. As used herein, a reactive group can be a part of an XTEN, a cross-linker, an azide/alkyne click-chemistry reactant, or a payload so long as it has the ability to participate in a chemical reaction. Once reacted, a conjugation bond links the residues of the payload or cross-linker used interchangeably to refer to an agent capable of extending the duration of release of a polypeptide of the invention relative to the duration of release when the polypeptide is administered US 2015/0037359 Al 26Feb. 5,2015 in the absence of agent. Different embodiments of the present invention may have different release rates, resulting in differ\u00ad ent therapeutic amounts. [0203] The term \"payload\" as used herein refers to any protein, peptide sequence, small molecule, drug or composi\u00ad tion of matter that has a biological, pharmacological or thera\u00ad peutic activity or beneficial effect when administered in a subject or that can be demonstrated in vitro. Payload also includes a molecule that can be used for imaging or in vivo diagnostic purposes. Examples of payloads include, but are not limited to, cytokines, enzymes, hormones, blood coagu\u00ad lation factors, and growth factors, chemotherapeutic agents, antiviral compounds, toxins, anti-cancer drugs, radioactive compounds, and contrast agents, as well as targeting peptides, proteins, antibodies, antibody fragments, or compounds used to bind to receptors or ligands. [0204] The terms to the struc\u00ad ture or binding determinant that an antibody fragment or an antibody fragment-based therapeutic binds to or has specific\u00ad ity against. [0205] The term \"antagonist\", as used herein, includes any molecule that partially or fully blocks, inhibits, or neutralizes a biological activity of a native polypeptide disclosed herein. Methods for identifying antagonists of a polypeptide may comprise contacting a native polypeptide with a candidate antagonist molecule and measuring a detectable change in one or more biological activities normally associated with the native polypeptide. In the context of the present invention, antagonists may include proteins, nucleic acids, carbohy\u00ad drates, antibodies or any other molecules that decrease the effect of a biologically active protein. [0206] A \"defined medium\" refers to a medium comprising nutritional and hormonal requirements necessary for the sur\u00ad vival and/or growth of the cells in culture such that the com\u00ad ponents of the medium are known. Traditionally, the defined medium has been formulated by the addition of nutritional and growth factors necessary for growth and/or survival. Typically, the defined medium provides at least one compo\u00ad nent from one or more of the following categories: a) all essential amino acids, and usually the basic set of twenty amino acids plus cysteine; b) an energy source, usually in the form of a carbohydrate such as glucose; c) vitamins and/or other organic compounds required at low concentrations; d) free fatty acids; and e) trace elements, where trace elements are defined as inorganic compounds or naturally occurring elements that are typically required at very low concentra\u00ad tions, usually in the micromolar range. The defined medium may also optionally be supplemented with one or more com\u00ad ponents from any of the following categories: a) one or more mitogenic agents; b) salts magnesium, and phosphate; c) nucleosides and for example, adenosine and thymidine, hypoxan- thine; and d) protein and tissue hydrolysates. [0207] The term \"agonist\" is used in the broadest sense and includes any molecule that mimics a biological activity of a native polypeptide disclosed herein. Suitable agonist mol\u00ad ecules specifically include agonist antibodies or antibody fragments, fragments or amino acid sequence variants of native polypeptides, peptides, small organic molecules, etc. Methods for identifying agonists of a native polypeptide may comprise contacting a native polypeptide with a candidateagonist molecule and measuring a detectable change in one or more biological activities normally associated with the native polypeptide. [0208] \"Inhibition constant\", or \"Ki\", are used the dissociation constant of the enzyme-in\u00ad hibitor complex, or the reciprocal of the binding affinity of the inhibitor to the enzyme. [0209] As used herein, are used and mean admin\u00ad istering a drug or a biologic to achieve a therapeutic benefit, to cure or reduce the severity of an existing condition, or to achieve a prophylactic benefit, prevent or reduce the likeli\u00ad hood of onset or severity the occurrence of a condition. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying condition being treated or one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying con\u00ad dition such that an improvement is observed in the subject, notwithstanding that the subject may still be afflicted with the underlying condition. [0210] A \"therapeutic effect\" or \"therapeutic benefit,\" as used herein, refers to a physiologic effect, including but not limited to the mitigation, amelioration, or prevention of dis\u00ad ease in humans or other animals, or to otherwise enhance physical or mental wellbeing of humans or animals, resulting from administration of a polypeptide of the invention other than the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by the biologically active protein. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a subject at risk of developing a particular disease, condition or symptom of the disease (e.g., a bleed in a diagnosed hemophilia A subject), or to a subject reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made. [0211] The terms \"therapeutically effective amount\" and \"therapeutically effective dose\", as used herein, refer to an amount of a drug or a biologically active protein, either alone or as a part of a polypeptide composition, that is capable of having any detectable, beneficial effect on any symptom, aspect, measured parameter or characteristics of a disease state or condition when administered in one or repeated doses to a subject. Such effect need not be absolute to be beneficial. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. [0212] The term \"therapeutically effective dose regimen\", as used herein, refers to a schedule for consecutively admin\u00ad istered multiple doses (Te., at least two or more) of a biologi\u00ad cally active protein, either alone or as a part of a polypeptide composition, wherein the doses are given in therapeutically effective amounts to result in sustained beneficial effect on any symptom, aspect, measured parameter or characteristics of a disease state or condition. I). General Techniques [0213] The practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of immunology, biochemistry, chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, genomics and recombinant DNA, which are within the skill of the art. See Sambrook, J. et ah, \"Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,\" 3rrf edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001; \"Current protocols in molecular biology\", R M. Ausubel, et al. eds., 1987; the series \"Methods in Enzymology,\" Academic Press, San Diego, US 2015/0037359 Al 27Feb. 5,2015 Calif.; \"PCR 2: a practical approach\", M. J. MacPherson, B. D. Hames and G. R. Taylor eds., Oxford University Press, 1995; \"Antibodies, a laboratory manual\" Harlow, E. and Lane, D. eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988; \"Good\u00ad man & Gilman's The Pharmacological Edition, and Freshney, R, I., \"Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique,\" 4th edition, John Wiley & Sons, Somerset, N.J., 2000, the con\u00ad tents of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. [0214] Host cells can be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's FlO (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium (MEM, Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Sigma) are suitable for culturing eukaryotic cells. In addition, animal cells can be grown in a defined medium that lacks serum but is supplemented with hormones, growth factors or any other factors necessary for the survival and/or growth of a particular cell type. Whereas a defined medium supporting cell survival maintains the viability, morphology, capacity to metabolize and potentially, capacity of the cell to differentiate, a defined medium promoting cell growth pro\u00ad vides all chemicals necessary for cell proliferation or multi\u00ad plication. The general parameters governing mammalian cell survival and growth in vitro are well established in the art. Physicochemical parameters which may be controlled in dif\u00ad ferent cell culture systems are, e.g., pH, p 0 2, temperature, and osmolarity. The nutritional requirements of cells are usu\u00ad ally provided in standard media formulations developed to provide an optimal environment. Nutrients can be divided into several categories: amino acids and their derivatives, carbohydrates, sugars, fatty acids, complex lipids, nucleic acid derivatives and vitamins. Apart from nutrients for main\u00ad taining cell metabolism, most cells also require one or more hormones from at least one of the following groups: steroids, prostaglandins, growth factors, pituitary hormones, and pep\u00ad tide hormones to proliferate in serum-free media (Sato, G. H., et al. in \"Growth of Cells in Hormonally Defined Media\", Cold Spring Harbor Press, N.Y., 1982). In addition to hor\u00ad mones, cells may require transport proteins such as transfer\u00ad rin (plasma iron transport protein), ceruloplasmin (a copper transport protein), and high-density lipoprotein (a lipid car\u00ad rier) for survival and growth in vitro. The set of optimal hormones or transport proteins will vary for each cell type. Most of these hormones or transport proteins have been added exogenously or, in a rare case, a mutant cell line has been found which does not require a particular factor. Those skilled in the art will know of other factors required for maintaining a cell culture without undue experimentation. [0215] Growth media for growth of prokaryotic host cells include nutrient broths (liquid nutrient medium) or LB medium (Luria Bertani). Suitable media include defined and undefined media. In general, media contains a carbon source such as glucose needed for bacterial growth, water, and salts. Media may also include a source of amino acids and nitrogen, for example beef or yeast extract (in an undefined medium) or known quantities of amino acids (in a defined medium). In some embodiments, the growth medium is LB broth, for example LB Miller broth or LB Lennox broth. LB broth comprises peptone (enzymatic digestion product of casein), yeast extract and sodium chloride. In some embodiments, a selective medium is used which comprises an antibiotic. In this medium, only the desired cells possessing resistance to the antibiotic will grow.II). XTEN Protein Polymer and Conjugate Compositions [0216] The present invention relates, in part, to substan\u00ad tially homogeneous compositions comprising extended recombinant polypeptides (XTEN). In a first aspect, the invention provides XTEN compositions that are substantially homogeneous in length. Such compositions are useful as reagent conjugation partners to create XTEN-cross-linker intermediates and XTEN-payload compositions. Addition\u00ad ally, it is an obj ect of the present invention to provide methods to create the substantially homogeneous XTEN composi\u00ad tions. The present invention also provides methods to create such substantially homogeneous XTEN compositions at high yield. [0217] In a second aspect, the invention provides XTEN. For example, the XTENs capable of linking to one or more payload conjugation partners, resulting in payload-XTEN conjugates are specifically engineered to incorporate defined numbers of reactive amino acids for linking to the payloads either directly or via cross-linkers or azide/alkyne reactants. The present invention also provides methods to create such engineered XTEN polymers for use in creating conjugates with payload agents of interest as compositions with enhanced pharmaceutical properties, including enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic properties, as well as reduced toxicity. [0218] In another aspect, the invention provides substan\u00ad tially homogeneous polymers conjugation partners in monomeric and multimeric configu\u00ad rations and methods of the preparation of such reactants. The XTEN derivatives comprising cross-linkers or azide/alkyne reactants are used as reactants in the conjugation of payload agents to result in XTEN-payload conjugate exhibiting the desired physical, pharmaceutical, and pharmacological prop\u00ad erties. [0219] In another aspect, the invention provides composi\u00ad tions of XTEN-payload in which one or more XTEN are chemically linked to one or more payloads, including com\u00ad binations of different payloads, in defined numbers in either monomeric or multimeric configurations to provide compo\u00ad sitions with enhanced pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacologic properties. Such compositions linked to such payloads may have utility, when administered to a subject, in the prevention, treatment or amelioration of diseases or con\u00ad ditions due to a pharmacologic or biologic effect of load. [0220] I . XTEN: Extended Recombinant Polypeptides [0221] one aspect, the invention provides substantially homogeneous XTEN polypeptide compositions that are use\u00ad ful as conjugation partners to link to one or more payloads, either directly or via a cross-linker reactant resulting non-repetitive sequences having a low degree or no secondary or tertiary structure under physiologic conditions. XTEN typically have from about 36 to about 3000 amino acids, of which the majority or the entirety are small hydrophilic amino acids. As used herein, \"XTEN\" specifi\u00ad cally excludes whole antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. single-chain antibodies and Fe fragments). XTEN polypep\u00ad tides have utility as a conjugation partners in that they serve in various roles, conferring certain desirable properties when linked to a payload. The resulting XTEN-payload conjugates have enhanced properties, such as Al 28Feb. 5,2015 netic, physicochemical, pharmacologic, and pharmaceutical properties compared to the corresponding payload not linked to XTEN, making them useful in the treatment of certain conditions for which the payload is known in the art to be used. [0223] The unstructured characteristic and physicochemi\u00ad cal properties of the XTEN result, in part, from the overall amino acid composition that is disproportionately limited to 4-6 types of hydrophilic amino acids, the linking of the amino acids in a quantifiable non-repetitive design, and the length of the XTEN polypeptide. In an advantageous feature common to XTEN but uncommon to native polypeptides, the proper\u00ad ties of XTEN disclosed herein are not tied to absolute primary amino acid sequences, as evidenced by the diversity of the exemplary sequences of Table 2 that, within varying ranges of length, possess similar properties, many of which are docu\u00ad mented in the Examples. Accordingly, XTEN have properties more like non-proteinaceous, hydrophilic polymers than they do proteins. The XTEN of the present invention exhibit one or more of the following advantageous properties: conforma\u00ad tional flexibility, reduced or lack of secondary structure, high degree of aqueous solubility, high degree of protease resis\u00ad tance, low immunogenicity, low binding to mammalian receptors, a defined degree of charge, and increased hydro- dynamic (or Stokes) radii; properties that are similar to cer\u00ad tain hydrophilic polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol) that make them particularly useful as conjugation partners. [0224] The XTEN component(s) of the subject conjugates designed to behave like denatured peptide sequences under physiological conditions, despite the extended length of the polymer. \"Denatured\" describes the state of a peptide in solution that is characterized by a laige conformational free\u00ad dom of the peptide backbone. Most peptides and proteins adopt a denatured conformation in the presence of high con\u00ad centrations of denaturants or at elevated temperature. Pep\u00ad tides denatured conformation have, for example, charac\u00ad teristic circular dichroism (CD) spectra and are characterized by a lack of long-range interactions as determined by NMR. \"Denatured conformation\" are the XTEN sequences that, under physiologic conditions, resemble denatured sequences that are largely devoid of secondary structure. In other cases, the XTEN sequences are substantially devoid of secondary structure under physiologic conditions. \"Largely devoid,\" as used in this context, means that less than 50% of the XTEN amino acid residues of the XTEN sequence contribute to secondary structure as measured or determined by the means described herein. \"Substantially devoid,\" as used in this context, means that at least about 60%, or about 70%, or about 80%, or about 90%, or about 95%, or about 97%, or at least about 99% of the XTEN amino acid residues of the XTEN sequence do not contribute to secondary structure, as measured or determined by the methods described herein. [0225] A variety of methods and assays are known in the art for determining the physicochemical properties of the subj ect XTEN. Such properties include but are not limited to second\u00ad ary or tertiary structure, solubility, protein aggregation, sta\u00ad bility, absolute and apparent molecular weight, purity and uniformity, melting properties, contamination and water con\u00ad tent. The methods to measure such properties include analyti\u00ad cal centrifugation, EPR, ElPLC-ion exchange, be measured spectrophotometri- cally, e.g., by circular dichroism spectroscopy in the \"far- UV\" spectral region (190-250 nm). Secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helix and beta-sheet, each give rise to a characteristic shape and magnitude of CD spectra, as does the lack of these structure elements. Secondary structure can also be predicted for a polypeptide sequence via certain com\u00ad puter programs or algorithms, such as the well-known Chou- Fasmanalgorithm (Chou, P Y., et J F, Robson B. (1996), GOR method for predicting protein secondary structure from amino acid sequence. Methods Enzymol 266:540-553), as described in US Patent Application Publication No. 20030228309A1. For a given sequence, the algorithms can predict whether there exists some or no secondary structure at all, expressed as the total and/or percentage of residues of the sequence that form, for example, alpha-helices or beta-sheets or the percentage of residues of the sequence predicted to result in random coil formation (which lacks secondary struc\u00ad ture) . be analyzed using the Chou- Fasman algorithm using sites on the world wide web at, for example, fasta.bioch.viiginia.edu/fasta_www2/fasta_www. cgi?rm=misc I and the Gor algorithm at npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi- bin/npsa_automat.pl?page=npsa_gor4.html (both accessed on Sep. 5, 2012). Additional methods are disclosed in Arnau, et ah, Prot Expr and Purif In the XTEN sequences used in the subject conjugates have an alpha-helix percentage rang\u00ad ing from 0% to less than about 5% as determined by the Chou-Fasman algorithm. In another embodiment, the XTEN sequences have a beta-sheet percentage ranging from 0% to less than about 5% as determined by the Chou-Fasman algo\u00ad rithm. jugates have an alpha-helix percentage ranging from 0% to less than about 5% and a beta-sheet percentage ranging from 0% to less than about 5% as determined by the Chou-Fasman algorithm. In one embodiment, the XTEN sequences of the conjugates have an alpha-helix percentage less than about 2% and a beta-sheet percentage less than about 2%. The XTEN sequences of the conjugate compositions have a high degree of random coil percentage, as determined by the GOR algo\u00ad rithm. In some embodiments, an XTEN sequence has at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 90%, more prefer\u00ad ably at least about 91%, more preferably at least about 92%, more preferably at least about 93%, more preferably at least about 94%, more preferably at least about 95%, more prefer\u00ad ably at least about 96%, more preferably at least about 97%, more preferably at least about 98%, and most preferably at least about 99% random coil, as determined by the GOR algorithm. In one embodiment, the XTEN sequences of the conjugate compositions have an alpha-helix percentage rang\u00ad ing from 0% to less than about 5% and a beta-sheet percent\u00ad age ranging from 0% to less than about 5% as determined by the Chou-Fasman algorithm and at least about 90% random coil, as determined by the GOR algorithm. In another embodiment, the XTEN sequences of the disclosed compo\u00ad sitions have an alpha-helix percentage less than about 2% and a beta-sheet percentage less than about 2% at least about 90% random coil, as determined by the GOR algorithm. In US 2015/0037359 Al 29Feb. 5,2015 embodiment, the XTEN sequenes of the compositions are substantially lacking secondary structure as measured by cir\u00ad cular dichroism. [0227] The selection criteria for the XTEN to be linked to the payload used to create the conjugate compositions gener\u00ad ally relate to attributes of physicochemical properties and conformational structure of the XTEN that is, in turn, used to confer enhanced pharmaceutical, pharmacologic, and phar\u00ad macokinetic properties to the compositions. I . Non-Repetitive Sequences [0228] It is specifically contemplated that the sequences included in the subject non-repetitive. In gen\u00ad eral, repetitive amino acid sequences have a tendency to aggregate or form higher order structures, as exemplified by natural repetitive sequences such as collagens and leucine zippers. These repetitive amino acids may also tend to form contacts resulting in crystalline or pseudocrystaline struc\u00ad tures. In contrast, the low tendency of non-repetitive sequences to aggregate enables the design of long-sequence XTENs with a relatively low frequency of charged amino acids that would otherwise be likely to aggregate if the sequences were repetitive. The non-repetitiveness of a subject XTEN can be observed by assessing one or more of the following features. In one embodiment, a substantially non- repetitive XTEN sequence has no three contiguous amino acids in the sequence that are identical amino acid types unless the amino acid is serine, in which case no more than three contiguous amino acids are serine residues. In another embodiment, as described more fully below, a substantially non-repetitive XTEN sequence in which 80-99% of the sequence is comprised of motifs of 9 to 14 amino acid resi\u00ad dues wherein the motifs consist of 3, 4, 5 or 6 types of amino acids selected from glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threo\u00ad nine (T), glutamate (E) and proline (P), and wherein the sequence of any two contiguous amino acid residues in any one motif is not repeated more than twice in the sequence motif. [0229] The degree of repetitiveness of a polypeptide or a gene can be measured by computer programs or algorithms or by other means known in the art. According to the current invention, algorithms to be used in calculating the degree of repetitiveness of a particular polypeptide, such as an XTEN, are disclosed herein, and examples of sequences analyzed by algorithms are provided (see Examples, below). In one embodiment, the repetitiveness of a polypeptide of a prede\u00ad termined length can be calculated (hereinafter \"subsequence score\") according to the formula given Isubsequence score = -------------m [0230] wherein: (amino acid length of subsequence)+l; and Count, =Cumulative number of occurrences of each unique subsequence within [0231] sequence, [0232] An algorithm termed \"SegScore\" was developed to apply the foregoing equation to quantitate repetitiveness of polypeptides, such as an XTEN, providing the subsequence score wherein sequences of a predetermined amino acidlength \"n\" are analyzed for repetitiveness by determining the number of times (a \"count\") a unique subsequence of length \"s\" appears in the set length, divided by the absolute number of subsequences within the predetermined length of the sequence. FIG. 79 depicts a logic flowchart of the SegScore algorithm, while FIG. 80 portrays a schematic of how a sub\u00ad sequence score is derived for a fictitious XTEN with 11 amino acids and a subsequence length of 3 amino acid residues. For example, a predetermined polypeptide length of 200 amino acid residues has 192 overlapping 9-amino acid subse\u00ad quences and 198 3-mer subsequences, but the subsequence score of any given polypeptide will depend on the absolute number of unique subsequences and how frequently each unique subsequence (meaning a different amino acid sequence) appears in the predetermined length of the sequence. [0233] In the context of the present invention, \"subse\u00ad quence score\" means the sum of occurrences of each unique 3-mer frame across 200 consecutive amino acids of the cumu\u00ad lative XTEN polypeptide divided by the absolute number of unique 3-mer subsequences within the 200 amino acid sequence. Examples of such subsequence scores derived from 200 consecutive amino acids of repetitive and non- repetitive polypeptides are presented in Example 45. In one embodiment, the invention provides a XTEN-payload com\u00ad prising one XTEN in which the XTEN has a subsequence score less than 12, more preferably less than 10, more pref\u00ad erably less than 9, more preferably less than 8, more prefer\u00ad ably less than 7, more preferably less than 6, and most pref\u00ad erably less than 5. In another embodiment, the invention provides XTEN-cross-linker conjugates comprising an XTEN in which the XTEN have a subsequence score of less than 10, more preferably less than 9, more preferably less than 8, more preferably less than 7, more preferably less than 6, and most preferably less than 5. In another embodiment, the invention provides XTEN-click-chemistry conjugates com\u00ad prising an XTEN in which the XTEN have a subsequence score of less than 10, more preferably less than 9, more preferably less than 8, more preferably less than 7, more preferably less than 6, and most preferably less than 5. In yet another embodiment, the invention provides XTEN conju\u00ad gate compositions comprising at least two linked XTEN in which each individual XTEN has a subsequence score of less than 10, or less than 9, or less than 8, or less than 7, or less than 6, or less than 5, or less. In yet another embodiment, the invention provides XTEN conjugate compositions compris\u00ad ing at least three linked XTEN in which each individual XTEN has a subsequence score of less than 10, or less than 9, or less than 8, or less than 7, or less than 6, or less than 5, or less. In the embodiments of the XTEN compositions described herein, an XTEN with a subsequence score of 10 or less (i.e., 9, 8, 7, etc.) is characterized as substantially non- repetitive. [0234] In one aspect, the non-repetitive characteristic of XTEN of the present invention together with the particular types of amino acids that predominate in the XTEN, rather than the absolute primary sequence, confers one or more of the enhanced physicochemical and biological properties of the XTEN and the resulting XTEN-payload conjugates. These enhanced properties include a higher degree of expres\u00ad sion of the XTEN protein in the host cell, greater genetic stability of the gene encoding XTEN, a greater degree of solubility, less tendency to aggregate, and enhanced pharma\u00ad cokinetics of the resulting conjugate compared to payloads to proteins having repetitive sequences. These enhanced properties per\u00ad mit more efficient manufacturing, greater uniformity of the final product, lower cost of goods, and/or facilitate the for\u00ad mulation of XTEN-comprising pharmaceutical preparations containing extremely high protein concentrations, in some cases exceeding 100 mg/ml. In some embodiments, the XTEN polypeptide sequences of the conjugates are designed to have a low degree of internal repetitiveness in order to reduce or substantially eliminate immunogenicity when administered to a mammal. Polypeptide sequences composed of short, repeated motifs largely limited to only three amino acids, such as glycine, serine and glutamate, may result in relatively high antibody titers when administered to a mam\u00ad mal despite the absence of predicted T-cell epitopes in these sequences. This may be caused by the repetitive nature of polypeptides, as it has been shown that immunogens with repeated epitopes, including protein aggregates, cross-linked immunogens, and repetitive carbohydrates are highly immu\u00ad nogenic and can, for example, result in the cross-linking of B-cell receptors causing B-cell activation. (Johansson, J., et al. (2007) Vaccine, 25: 1676-82; al. (2006) BiochemBiophys Res C. T., et al. CancerRes, BachmannM F, et al. Eur J Immunol. (1995) 25(12):3445-3451). 2. Exemplary Sequence Motifs [0235] The present invention encompasses XTEN used as conjugation partners that comprise multiple units of shorter sequences, or motifs, in which the amino acid sequences of the motifs are substantially non-repetitive. The non-repetitive property can be met even using a \"building block\" approach using a library of sequence motifs that are multimerized to create the XTEN sequences, as shown in FIGS. 18-19. While an XTEN sequence may consist of multiple units of as few as four different types of sequence motifs, because the motifs themselves generally consist of non-repetitive amino acid sequences, the overall XTEN sequence is designed to render the sequence substantially non-repetitive. [0236] In one embodiment, an XTEN has a substantially non-repetitive sequence of greater than about 36 to about 3000, or about 100 to about 2000, or about 144 to about 1000 amino acid residues, wherein at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 97%, or about 99% to about 100% of the XTEN sequence consists of non-overlapping sequence motifs, and wherein each of the motifs has about 9 to 36 amino acid residues. As used herein, \"non-overlapping\" means that the individual motifs do not share amino acid residues but, rather, are fused to other motifs or amino acid residues in a linear fashion. In other embodiments, at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 97%, or about 99% to about 100% of the XTEN sequence consists of non-overlapping sequence motifs wherein each of the motifs has 9 to 14 amino acid residues. In still other embodiments, at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 97%, or about 99% to about 100% of the XTEN sequence consists of non-overlapping sequence motifs wherein each of the motifs has 12 amino acid residues. In these embodiments, it is preferred that the sequence motifs are composed of substantially (e.g., 90% or more) or exclu\u00ad sively small hydrophilic amino acids, such that the overall sequence has an unstructured, flexible characteristic.Examples of amino acids that are included sequences have predominately four to six types of amino acids selected from glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate (E) or proline (P) that are arranged in a substantially non-repetitive sequence that is about 36 to about 3000, or about 100 to about 2000, or about 144 to about 1000 amino acid residues in length. In some embodiment, an XTEN sequence is made of 4, 5, or 6 types of amino acids selected from the group consisting of glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate proline (P). In some embodiments, XTEN have sequences of about 36 to about 1000, or about 100 to about 2000, or about 400 to about 3000 amino acid residues wherein at least about 80% of the sequence consists of non-overlapping sequence motifs wherein each of the motifs has 9 to 36 amino acid residues and wherein at least 90%, or at least 91%, or at least 92%, or at least 93%, or at least 94%, or at least 95%, or at least 96%, or at least 97%, or 100% of each of the motifs consists of 4 to 6 types of amino acids selected from glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate (E) and proline (P), and wherein the content of any one amino acid type in the full-length XTEN does not exceed 30%. In other embodiments, at least about 90% of the XTEN sequence consists of non-overlapping sequence motifs wherein each of the motifs has 9 to 36 amino acid residues wherein the motifs consist of 4 to 6 types of amino acids selected from glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate (E) and proline (P), and wherein the content of any one amino acid type in the full-length XTEN does not exceed 40%, or about 30%, or 25%, or about 17%, or about 12%, or about 8%. In other embodiments, at least about 90% of the XTEN sequence consists of non-overlapping sequence motifs wherein each of the motifs has 12 amino acid residues con\u00ad sisting of 4 to 6 types of amino acids selected from glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate (E) and proline (P), and wherein the content of any one amino acid type in the full-length XTEN does not exceed 40%, or 30%, or about 25%, or about 17%, or about 12%, or about 8%. In yet other embodiments, at least about 90%, or about 91%, or about 92%, or about 93%, or about 94%, or about 95%, or about 96%, or about 97%, or about 98%, or about 99%, to about 100% of the XTEN sequence consists of non-overlap- ping sequence motifs wherein each of the motifs has 12 amino acid residues consisting of glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate (E) and proline andXTEN-click-chem- istry reactant conjugates comprising one, or two, three, or four or more substantially non-repetitive XTEN sequence(s) of about 36 to about 1000 amino acid residues, or cumula\u00ad tively about 100 to about 3000 amino acid residues wherein at leastabout 80%, or at leastabout 90%, or about 91%, or about 92%, or about 93%, or about 94%, or about 95%, or about 96%, or about 97%, or about 98%, or about 99% to about 100% of the sequence consists of multiple units of four or more non-overlapping sequence motifs selected from the amino acid sequences of Table I, wherein the overall sequence remains substantially non-repetitive. In some embodiments, the XTEN comprises non-overlapping sequence motifs in which about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or about 91%, or about 92%, or about 93%, or about 94%, or about 95%, or about 96%, or about US 2015/0037359 Al 31Feb. 5,2015 97%, or about 98%, or about 99% or about 100% of the sequence consists of multiple units of non-overlapping sequences selected from a single motif family selected from Table I, resulting in a family sequence. Family, as applied to motifs, means that the XTEN has motifs selected from a single motif category from Table I ; i.e., AD, AE, AF, AG, AM, AQ, BC, or BD. In other embodiments, the XTEN comprises multiple units of motif sequences from two or more of the motif families of Table I selected to achieve desired physi\u00ad cochemical characteristics, including such properties as net charge, hydrophilicity, lack of secondary structure, or lack of repetitiveness that may be conferred by the amino acid com\u00ad position of the motifs, described more fully below. In the embodiments hereinabove described in this paragraph, the motifs or portions of the motifs incorporated into the XTEN can be selected and assembled using the methods described herein to achieve an XTEN of about 36, about 42, about 72, about 144, about 288, about 576, about 864, about 1000, about 2000 to about 3000 amino acid residues, or any inter\u00ad mediate length. Non-limiting examples of XTEN family sequences useful for incorporation into the subject conjugates are presented in Table 2. It is intended that a specified sequence mentioned relative to Table 2 has that sequence set forth in Table 2, while a generalized reference to an AE144 sequence, for example, is intended to encompass any AE sequence having 144 amino acid residues; e.g., AE144 _I A, AE144 _2A, etc., or a generalized reference to an AG144 sequence, for example, is intended to encompass any AG sequence having 144 amino acid residues, e.g., AG144 _I, AG144 _2, AG144_A, AG144_B, AG144_C, etc. TABLE I XTEN S e q u e n c e M o t i f s o f 1 2 A m in o A c i d s a n d M o t i f F a m i l i e s M o t i f F a m i l y

selected from glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate (E) and proline (P), or less than 100% of the sequence consisting of the sequence motifs from Table I or the XTEN sequences of Tables 2, 3 and 22-25 the other amino acid residues of the XTEN are selected from anyof the other 14 natural L-amino acids, but are preferentially selected from hydrophilic amino acids such that the XTEN sequence contains at about 99% hydrophilic amino acids. An individual amino acid or a short sequence of amino acids other than glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate (E) may be incorpo\u00ad US 2015/0037359 Al 50Feb. 5,2015 rated into the XTEN to achieve a needed property, such as to permit incorporation of a restriction site by the encoding nucleotides, or to facilitate linking to a payload component, or incorporation of a cleavage sequence. As one exemplary embodiment, described more fully below, the invention pro\u00ad vides XTEN that incorporates from I to about 20, or I to about 15, or I to about 10, or I to 5 lysine residues wherein the reactive lysines are utilized for linking to cross-linkers or payloads, as described herein. In another embodiment, described more fully below, the XTEN incorporates from I to about 20, or I to about 15, or I to about 10, or I to 5 cysteine residues wherein the reactive cysteines are utilized for linking to cross-linkers or payloads, as described herein. In another embodiment, the XTEN incorporates from I to about 20 cysteine and lysine residues wherein the lysines and cysteines are utilized for linking to different cross-linkers or payloads, as described herein. In another embodiment, the XTEN incor\u00ad porations I, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more arginine residues that are not followed by proline residues to provide cleavage sequences that can be cleaved by trypsin to create XTEN segments, described more fully herein, below. The XTEN amino acids that are not glycine (G), alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), glutamate (E) and proline (P) are either interspersed through\u00ad out the XTEN sequence, are located within or between the sequence motifs, or are concentrated in one or more short stretches of the XTEN sequence such as at or near the N- or C-terminus. As hydrophobic amino acids impart structure to a polypeptide, the invention provides that the content of hydrophobic amino acids in the XTEN utilized in the conju\u00ad gation constructs will typically be less than 5%, or less than 2%, or less than 1% hydrophobic amino acid content. Flydro- phobic residues that are less favored in the XTEN sequences to contain less than 5% or less than 4% or less than 3% or less than 2% or less than 1% or none of the following amino acids: methionine (to avoid oxidation), asparagine and glutamine (to avoid desamidation). In other embodiments, the amino acid content of methionine and tryp\u00ad tophan in the XTEN component used in the conjugation con\u00ad structs is typically less than 5%, or less than 2%, and most preferably less than 1%. In other embodiments, the XTEN of the subject XTEN conjugates will have a sequence that has less than 10% amino acid residues with a positive chaige, or less than about 7%, or less that about 5%, or less than about 2% amino acid residues with a positive charge, the sum of methionine and tryptophan residues will be less than 2%, and the sum of asparagine and glutamine residues will be less than 5% of the total XTEN sequence. 3. Cysteine- and Lysine-Engineered XTEN Sequences [0239] In another aspect, the invention provides XTEN with defined numbers of incorporated \"cysteine-engineered XTEN\" and \"lysine-engineered XTEN\", of the invention to pro\u00ad vide XTEN with defned numbers of cysteine and/or lysine residues to permit conjugation between the thiol group of the cysteine or the epsilon amino group of the lysine and a reac\u00ad tive group on a payload or a cross-linker to be conjugated to the XTEN backbone. In one embodiment of the foregoing, the XTEN of the invention has between about I to about 100 lysine residues, or about I to about 70 lysine residues, or about I to about 50 lysine residues, or about I to about 30 lysine residues, or about I to about 20 lysine residues, orabout I to about 10 lysine residues, or about I to about 5 lysine residues, or I to about 3 lysine residues, or alternatively only a single lysine residue. In another embodiment of the foregoing, the XTEN of the invention has between about I to about 100 cysteine residues, or about I to about 70 cysteine residues, or about I to about 50 cysteine residues, or about I to about 30 cysteine residues, or about I to about 20 cysteine residues, or about I to about 10 cysteine residues, or about I to about 5 cysteine residues, or I to about 3 cysteine residues, or alternatively only a single cysteine residue. In another embodiment of the foregoing, the XTEN of the invention has about I to about 10 lysine residues and about I to about 10 cysteine residues. Using the foregoing lysine- and/or cys\u00ad teine-containing XTEN, can be constructed that comprise XTEN, an optional cross-linker, plus a payload useful in the treatment of a condition in a subject wherein the maximum number of molecules of the payload agent linked to the XTEN component is determined by the numbers of lysines, cysteines or other amino acids with a reactive side group (e.g., a terminal amino or thiol) incorporated into the XTEN. [0240] In one embodiment, the invention provides cys\u00ad teine-engineered XTEN where nucleotides encoding one or more amino acids of an XTEN are replaced with a cysteine amino acid to create the cysteine-engineered XTEN gene. In another embodiment, the invention provides cysteine-engi\u00ad XTEN where nucleotides encoding one or more cys\u00ad teine amino acids are inserted into an-XTEN encoding gene to create the cysteine-engineered XTEN gene. In other cases, oligonucleotides encoding one or more motifs of about 9 to about 14 amino acids comprising codons encoding one or more cysteines are linked in frame with other oligos encoding XTEN motifs or full-length XTEN to create the cysteine- engineered XTEN gene. In one embodiment of the foregoing, where the one or more cysteines are inserted into an XTEN sequence during the creation of the XTEN gene, nucleotides encoding cysteine can be linked to codons encoding amino acids used in XTEN to create a cy steine-XTEN motif with the cysteine(s) at a defined position using the methods described herein (see Example 61 and FIG. 40-41), or by standard molecular biology techniques, and the motifs subsequently assembled into the gene encoding the full-length cysteine- engineered XTEN. In such cases, where, for example, nucle\u00ad otides encoding a single cysteine are added to the DNA encoding a motif selected from Table I , the resulting motif would have 13 amino acids, while incorporating two cys\u00ad teines would result in a motif having 14 amino acids, etc. In other cases, a cysteine-motif can be created de novo and be of a pre-defined length and number of cysteine amino acids by linking nucleotides encoding cysteine to nucleotides encod\u00ad ing one or more amino acid residues used in XTEN (e.g., G, S, T, E, P, A) at a defined position, and the encoding motifs subsequently assembled by annealing with other XTEN-en- coding motif sequences into the gene encoding the full-length XTEN, as described herein and illustrated in FIGS. 7-8. In cases where a lysine-engineered XTEN is utilized to make the conjugates of the invention, the approaches described above would be performed with codons encoding lysine instead of cysteine. Thus, by the foregoing, a new XTEN motif can be created that could comprise about 9-14 amino acid residues and have one or more reactive amino acids; i.e., cysteine or lysine. Non-limiting examples of motifs suitable for use in an engineered XTEN that contain a single cysteine or lysine Al 51Feb. 5,2015 G G SPAG SCTSP G AS A S C AP S TG T A E A A G C G T A E A A G PE P TC P A PS G GGSP A G S K T S P G ASAS K AP S TG However, the invention contemplates motifs of different lengths, such as those of Table 5 and Table 11, for incorpo\u00ad ration into XTEN. [0241] In such cases where a gene encoding an XTEN with one or more cysteine and/or lysine motifs is to be constructed from existing XTEN motifs or segments, the gene can be designed and built by linking existing \"building block\" poly\u00ad nucleotides encoding both of Examples 1-4, and Tables 22-25, which can be fused in frame with the nucleotides encoding the cysteine-and/or lysine-containing motifs or, alternatively, the cysteine- and/or lysine-encoding nucelotides can be PCR'ed into an existing XTEN sequence (as described more fully below and in the Examples) using, for example, nucleotides encoding the islands of Tables 4 and 5 to build an engineered XTEN in which the reactive cysteine and/or lysines are placed in one or more designed locations in the sequence in the desired quan\u00ad tity. Non-limiting examples of such engineered XTEN are provided in Table 3. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides an XTEN sequence having at least about 80% sequence identity, or at least about 90%, or about 91%, or about 92%, or about 93%, or about 94%, or about 95%, or about 96%, or about 97%, or about 98%, or about 99% sequence identity, or is identical to a sequence or a fragment of a sequence selected from of Table 3, when optimally aligned. However, application of the cysteine- or lysine-en\u00ad gineered methodology to create XTEN encompassing cys\u00ad teine or lysine residues is not meant to be constrained to the precise compositions or range of composition identities of the foregoing embodiments. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the precise location and numbers of incor\u00ad porated cysteine or lysine residues in an XTEN can be varied without departing from the invention as described.

inserts of lysine as part of a longer sequence defined as a lysine island. Examples of lysine island are shown in Table 4. The benefit of flanking all lysine residues in an XTEN with similar or identical sequence is that it results in a more uni\u00ad form chemical reactivity for each lysine. Another benefit results from the ability to perform peptide mapping to mea\u00ad sure the degree of payload linking. Examples include the islands I_L6,1_L7, and I_L8 of Table 4. These islands com\u00ad prise glutamate residues that facilitate peptide mapping another embodiment, the invention pro\u00ad vides inserts of cysteine as part of a longer sequence defined as a cysteine island. Examples of cysteine island are shown in Table 5. The benefit of flanking all cysteine residues in an XTEN with similar or identical sequence is that it results in a more uniform chemical reactivity for each cysteine. Another benefit results from the ability to perform peptide mapping to measure the degree of payload conjugation. Examples include islands I_C4,1_C7,1_C8, and I_C9 of Table 5. These islands comprise glutamate residues that facilitate peptide mapping using GluC protease. The islands can be inserted into constructs encoding the existing XTEN by conventional PCR methods, as described above and in the Examples. Oli\u00ad gonucleotides encoding the islands can be inserted into con\u00ad structs encoding the existing XTEN by conventional PCR methods. For example, in one embodiment, where an existing full-length XTEN gene is to be modified with nucleotides encoding one or more reactive cysteine or lysine residues, an oligonucleotide can be created that encodes a cysteine or lysine and that exhibits partial homology to and can hybridize with one or more short sequences of the XTEN, resulting in a recombination event and substitution of a cysteine or the lysine codon for an existing codon of the XTEN gene (see, e.g., Examples 6 and 7 for a description of the general meth\u00ad ods). In one exemplary embodiment, the recombination results in a replacement with the amino acid sequence GGSPAGSCTSP of the I_C1 island. However, the oligo\u00ad nucleotides can be designed to place the cysteine (or lysine) in a different location in the motif or to include a second cysteine (or lysine) in the motif. The cysteine- or lysine-encoding oligonucleotides can be designed to hybridize with a given sequence segment at different points along the known XTEN sequence to permit their insertion into an XTEN-encoding gene. Thus, the invention contemplates that multiple XTEN gene constructs can be created with cysteines or lysines inserted at different locations within the XTEN sequence bythe selection of restriction sites within the XTEN sequence and the design of oligonucleotides appropriate for the given location and that encode a cysteine or lysine, including use of designed oligonucleotides that result in multiple insertions in the same XTEN sequence. By the design and selection of one or more such oligonucleotides in consideration of the known sequence of the XTEN, and the appropriate use of the meth\u00ad ods of the invention, the potential number of substituted reac\u00ad tive cysteine or lysine residues inserted into the full-length XTEN can be estimated and then confirmed by sequencing the resulting XTEN gene.

ID. This enables one to conjugate two different payloads to the same XTEN polymer using conjugations methods tailored to react with the functional group or linker attached to the cys\u00ad teine or lysine. Such mixed payloads can have additive and/or syneigistic pharmacologic effects when administered to a subject in a single composition. Alternatively, the mixed pay- loads can be a combination of a targeting moiety and an active payload in order to deliver the pharmacophore to a desired location in the subject. By controlling the number and posi\u00ad tion of lysine and cysteine residues one can control the num\u00ad ber and position of conjugated payloads. This enables one to adjust the relative potency or selectivity of the payloads in the resulting XTEN-payload conjugate. [0244] The design, selection, and preparation methods of the invention enable the creation of engineered XTEN that are reactive with electrophilic functionality. The methods to make the subject conjugates provided linker or payload molecules added in a quantified fashion at designated sites, as illustrated schematically in FIG. I. Pay- loads, cross-linkers, and azide/alkyne reactants may be site- specifically and efficiently linked to the N- or C-terminus of XTEN, to cysteine-engineered XTEN with a thiol-reactive reagent, XTEN of the invention with an amine-reactive reagent, and to an alpha amino group at the N-terminus of XTEN, as described more fully, below, and then are purified and characterized as shown schematically in FIG. 40 using, for example, the non-limiting methods described more specifically in the Examples. 4. Length of Sequence [0245] In another aspect, the invention provides XTEN of varying lengths for incorporation into the compositions wherein the length of the XTEN sequence(s) are chosen based on the property or function to be achieved in the com\u00ad position. Depending on the intended property or function, the XTEN-payload conjugates comprise short or intermediate length XTEN or longer XTEN sequences, or multimers of short, intermediate or longer XTEN that can serve as carriers. While not intended to be limiting, the XTEN or fragments of XTEN include short segments of about 6 to about 99 amino acid residues, intermediate lengths of about IOOto about 399 amino acid residues, and longer lengths of about 400 to about 1000 and up to about 3000 amino acid residues. Thus, the XTEN utilized as conjugation partners for incorporation into the subject conjugates encompass XTEN or fragments ofXTEN with lengths of about 6, or about 12, or about 36, or about 40, or about 48, or about 72 or about 96, or about 144, or about 288, or about 400, or about 432, or about 500, or about 576, or about 600, or about 700, or about 800, or about 864, or about 900, or about 1000, or about 1500, or about 2000, or about 2500, or up to about 3000 amino acid residues in length. In other cases, the XTEN sequences can be about 6 to about 50, about 50 to about 100, about 100 to 150, about 150 to 250, about 250 to 400, about 400 to about 500, about 500 to about 900, about 900 to 1500, about 1500 to 2000, or about 2000 to about 3000 amino acid residues in length. The precise length of an XTEN incorporated into the subject XTEN-payload conjugates can vary without adversely affect\u00ad ing the biological activity of the conjugate. In one embodi\u00ad ment, one or more of the XTEN may be selected from one of the XTEN family sequences; e.g., AD, AE, AF, AG, AM, AQ, BC, or BD. In some embodiments, the XTEN utilized to create the subject conjugates comprise XTEN selected from any one of the sequences in Table 2, Table 3, and Tables 22-25, which may be linked to the payload component directly or via cross-linkers disclosed herein. In other embodiments, the one or more XTEN utilized to create the subject conjugates individually comprise an XTEN sequence having at least about 80% sequence to an XTEN selected from Tables 2, 3, 22-25 or a fragment thereof, when optimally aligned with a sequence of comparable length. In some embodiments, the subject conjugates comprise 2, 3, 4, or more XTEN sequence, wherein the cumulative length of the residues in the XTEN sequences is greater than about 100 to about 3000, or about 400 to about 2000, or about 800 to 1000 amino acid residues and the XTEN can be identical or they can be differ\u00ad ent in sequence or in length. As used herein, cumulative length is intended to encompass the total length, in amino acid residues, when more than one XTEN is incorporated into the conjugate. [0246] As described more fully below, methods are dis\u00ad closed in which the XTEN-payload conjugates are designed by selecting the length of the XTEN and a method of linking with a cross-linker reactant or the payload to confer a physi\u00ad cochemical property (e.g., stability or solubility) or to result in a target half-life or retention of activity when an XTEN- payload conjugate is administered to a subject. [0247] XTEN are used as a carrier in the compositions, the invention taking advantage of the discovery that increasing the length of the non-repetitive, unstructured polypeptides enhances the unstructured nature of spondingly enhances the physicochemical and pharmacoki\u00ad netic properties of constructs comprising the XTEN carrier. In general, XTEN as monomers or as multimers with cumu\u00ad lative lengths longer that about 400 residues incorporated into the conjugates result in longer half-life compared to shorter cumulative lengths, e.g., shorter than about 280 residues. As described more fully in the Examples, proportional increases in the length of the XTEN, even if created by a repeated order of single family sequence motifs (e.g., the four AE motifs of Table I), result in a sequence with a higher percentage of random coil formation, as determined by GOR algorithm, or reduced content of alpha-helices or beta-sheets, as deter\u00ad mined by Chou-Fasman algorithm, compared to shorter XTEN lengths. In addition, increasing the length of the unstructured polypeptide fusion partner, as described in the US 2015/0037359 Al 92Feb. 5,2015 Examples, results in a construct with a disproportionate increase in terminal half-life compared to polypeptides with unstructured polypeptide partners with shorter sequence lengths. In some embodiments, where the XTEN serve pri\u00ad marily as a carrier, the invention encompasses XTEN conju\u00ad gate compositions comprising two, three, four or more XTEN wherein the cumulative XTEN sequence length of the XTEN proteins is greater than about 100, 200, 400, 500, 600, 800, 900, or 1000 to about 3000 amino acid residues, wherein the construct exhibits enhanced pharmacokinetic properties when administered to a subject compared to a payload not linked to the XTEN and administered at a comparable dose. In one embodiment of the foregoing, the two or more XTEN sequences more identity to a sequence selected from any one of Table 2, Table 3, or Tables 22-25, and the remainder, if any, of the carrier sequence(s) contains at least 90% hydrophilic amino acids and less than about 2% of the overall sequence consists of hydrophobic or aromatic amino acids or cysteine. The enhanced pharmaco\u00ad kinetic properties of the XTEN-payload conjugate, in com\u00ad parison to payload not linked to XTEN, are described more fully, below. 5. XTEN Segments from XTEN Precursors [0248] In another aspect, the invention provides methods to create XTEN of short or intermediate lengths from longer \"donor\" XTEN sequences, wherein the longer donor XTEN sequence is truncated at the N-terminus, or the C-terminus, or segments are created by protealysis of XTEN comprising cleavage sequences, thereby resulting in a short or interme\u00ad diate length XTEN. In non-limiting examples, an AG864 sequence of 864 amino acid residues can be truncated to yield anAG144 with 144 residues, an AG288 with 288 residues, an AG576 with 576 residues, or other intermediate lengths, while the AE864 sequence can be truncated to yield multiple AE144 sequences, anAE288 sequence or an AE576 sequence with 288 or 576 residues or other shorter or intermediate lengths. Similarly, the DNA encoding the longer \"donor\" sequences can be manipulated to incorporate cysteine or lysine residues intended for use in conjugates with short or intermediate length XTEN. It is specifically contemplated that such an approach can be utilized with any of the XTEN embodiments described herein or with any of the sequences listed in Tables 2,3,21 and 22 to result in XTEN of a desired length. [0249] In another aspect, the invention provides XTEN with cleavage sequences incorporated internal to the sequence at defined intervals such that the XTEN can be processed by cleavage into 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 shorter XTEN of uniform lengths. As illustrated in FIG. 96A, a monomeric XTEN is designed with two internal cleavage sequences that, when treated with a protease under conditions effective to result in the cleavage of all cleavage sequences, results in three XTEN segments of uniform length. In addition, theXTEN are designed with a sequence such that the resulting XTEN segments also have the identical amino acid sequence, inclusive of the residual cleavage sequence. In one embodi\u00ad ment, the invention provides an XTEN with a defined, sequence comprising I, 2, 3, 4, or 5 arginine (R) residues internal to the XTEN sequence and spaced at uniform inter\u00ad vals along the XTEN sequence bridging identical XTEN segments wherein treatment with trypsin results in cleavage of the XTEN into XTEN segments to having an identical length and sequence. In the foregoing embodiment, the argi\u00ad nine residue does not have a proline residue at the adjacent P I' position. Thus, by treatment of the foregoing with trypsin, an XTEN with I internal arginine would result in 2 identical XTEN segments, an XTEN with 2 internal argninines would result in 3 identical XTEN segments, etc. In another embodi\u00ad ment, each arginine of the foregoing embodiments is replaced with lysine residues. In another embodiment, the invention provides an XTEN with a defined sequence comprising 1,2, 3, 4, or 5 cleavage sequences internal to the XTEN sequence and spaced at uniform intervals along the XTEN sequence, wherein each cleavage sequence is SASRSA, and wherein treatment with trypsin results in cleavage of the XTEN into XTEN segments to having an identical length and sequence. In another embodiment, the invention provides an XTEN with at least about 90%, or at least about 91 %, or at least about 92%, or at least about 93%, or at least about 94%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 96%, or at least about 97%, or at least about 98%, or at least about 99% sequence identity to a sequence selected from the group of sequences set forth in Table 6. In another embodiment, the invention provides an XTEN with at least about 90%, or at least about 91%, or at least about 92%, or at least about 93%, or at least about 94%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 96%, or at least about 97%, or at least about 98%, or at least about 99% sequence identity to a sequence selected from the group of sequences set forth in Table 6, wherein the XTEN further comprises a first and a second affinity tag wherein each affinity tags are linked to the XTEN by a cleavage sequence at the N- and C-termini of the XTEN, respectively, wherein each cleavage sequence is capable of being cleaved by trypsin, and wherein the first affinity tag is different from the second affinity tag and each is independently selected from the group consisting of the affinity tags set forth in Table 7. The foregoing embodi\u00ad ment is illustrated in FIG. 96B, wherein the treatment with protease of the XTEN with two internal cleavage sequences and an N-terminal and a C-terminal affinity tag each linked to the XTEN by cleavage sequence results in cleavage of the construct into three XTEN segments of uniform length and liberation of the two affinity tags, the resulting preparation of which can be subsequently processed into substantially homogeneous XTEN as described herein, below. Variations of XTEN comprising such uniform cleavage sequences and their distribution in the sequence are contemplated by the invention.

Net Charge [0250] In other embodiments, the XTEN polypeptides have an unstructured characteristic imparted by incorporation of amino acid residues with a net charge and containing a low percentage or no hydrophobic amino acids in the XTEN sequence. The overall net charge and net charge density is controlled by modifying the content of charged amino acids in the XTEN sequences, either positive or negative, with the net chaige typically represented as the percentage of amino acids in the polypeptide contributing to a charged state beyond those residues that are cancelled by a residue with an opposing chaige. In some embodiments, the net charge den\u00ad sity of the XTEN of the conjugates may +0.1 or below\u20140.1 chaiges/residue. By \"net charge density\" of a protein or peptide herein is meant the net charge divided by the total number of amino acids in the protein. In other embodiments, the net chaige of an XTEN can be about 0%, about 1%, 2%, about 18%, about 19%, or about 20% or more. Based on the net chaige, some XTENs have an isoelectric point (pi) of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, or even 6.5. In one embodiment, the XTEN will have an isoelectric point between 1.5 and 4.5 and carry a net negative charge under physiologic conditions. [0251] Since most tissues and surfaces in a human or ani\u00ad mal have a net negative charge, in some embodiments the XTEN sequences are designed to have a net negative charge to minimize non-specific interactions between the XTEN containing compositions and various surfaces such as blood vessels, healthy tissues, or various receptors. Not to be bound by a particular theory, an XTEN can adopt open conforma\u00ad tions due to electrostatic repulsion between individual amino acids of the XTEN polypeptide that individually carry a net negative charge and that are distributed across the sequence of the XTEN polypeptide. In some embodiments, the XTEN sequence is designed with at least 90% to 95% of the charged residues separated by other non-charged residues such as serine, alanine, threonine, proline or glycine, which leads to a more uniform distribution of charge, better expression or purification behavior. Such a uniform distribution of net nega\u00ad tive chaige in the extended sequence lengths of XTEN also contributes to the unstructured conformation of the polymer that, in turn, can result in an effective increase in hydrody\u00ad namic radius. In preferred embodiments, the negative charge of the subject XTEN is conferred by incorporation of glutamic acid residues. Generally, the glutamic residues are spaced uniformly across the XTEN sequence. In some cases, the XTEN can contain about 10-80, or about 15-60, or about 20-50 glutamic residues per 20 kDa of XTEN that can result in an XTEN with charged residues that would have very similar pKa, which can increase the charge homogeneity ofthe product and sharpen its isoelectric point, enhance the physicochemical properties of the resulting XTEN-payload for, and hence, simplifying purification procedures. For example, where an XTEN with a negative charge is desired, the XTEN can be selected solely from an AE family sequence, which has approximately a 17% net charge due to incorporated glutamic acid, or can include varying propor\u00ad tions of glutamic acid-containing motifs of Table I to provide the desired degree of net chaige. Non-limiting examples of AE XTEN include, but are not sequences of Tables 2 and 21 or fragments thereof. In one embodiment, an XTEN sequence of Tables 2 or 3 can be modified to include additional glutamic acid residues to achieve the desired net negative charge. Accordingly, in one embodiment the invention provides XTEN in which In some cases, the XTEN can contain about 10-80, or about 15-60, or about 20-50 glutamic residues per 20 kDa of XTEN that can result in an XTEN with charged residues that would have very similar pKa, which can increase the charge homogeneity of the product and sharpen its isoelectric point, enhance the physicochemical properties of the resulting XTEN conjugate composition, andhence, simplifying purification procedures. In one embodiment, the invention contemplates incorpora\u00ad tion of up to 5% aspartic acid residues into XTEN in addition to glutamic acid in order to achieve a net negative chaige. [0252] Not to be bound by a particular theory, the XTEN of the XTEN-payload conjugates with the higher net negative charge are expected to have less non-specific interactions with various negatively-chaiged surfaces such as blood ves\u00ad sels, tissues, or various receptors, which would further con\u00ad tribute to reduced active clearance. Conversely, it is believed that the XTEN of the XTEN-payload conjugates with a low (or no) net chaige would have a higher degree of interaction with surfaces that can potentiate the activity of the associated conjugate in the vasculature or tissues. [0253] In other embodiments, where no net chaige is desired, the XTEN can be selected from, for example, AG XTEN components, such as the AG motifs of Table I, or those AM motifs of Table I that have no net charge. Non-limiting examples of AG XTEN include, but are not limited to 36, 42, 144, 288, 576, and 864 AG family sequences of Tables 2 and 22, or fragments thereof. In another embodiment, the XTEN can comprise varying proportions of AE and AG motifs in order to have a net chaige that is deemed optimal for a given use or to maintain a given physicochemical property. [0254] The XTEN of the conjugates of the present inven\u00ad tion generally have no or a low content of positively charged amino acids. In some embodiments, the XTEN may have less than about 10% amino acid residues with a positive charge, or less than about 7%, or less than about 5%, or less than about 2%, or less than about I % amino acid residues with a positive US 2015/0037359 Al 95Feb. 5,2015 charge. However, the invention contemplates constructs where a defined number of amino acids with a positive charge, such as lysine, are incorporated into XTEN to permit conjugation between the epsilon amine of the lysine and a reactive group on a payload or a cross-linker to be conjugated to the XTEN backbone. In one embodiment of the foregoing, the XTEN of the subject conjugates has between about I to about 100 lysine residues, or about I to about 70 lysine residues, or about I to about 50 lysine residues, or about I to about 30 lysine residues, or about I to about 20 lysine resi\u00ad dues, or about I to about 10 lysine residues, or about I to about 5 lysine residues, or about I to about 3 lysine residues, or alternatively only a single lysine residue. Using the fore\u00ad going lysine-containing XTEN, conjugates con\u00ad XTEN, an optional linker, plus a pay- load useful in the treatment of a condition in a subject wherein the maximum number of molecules of the payload agent linked to the XTEN component is determined by the numbers of lysines with a reactive side group (e.g., a terminal amine) incorporated into the XTEN. 7. Low immunogenicity [0255] In another aspect, the invention provides XTEN compositions having a low degree of immunogenicity or are substantially non-immunogenic. Several factors can contrib\u00ad ute to the low immunogenicity of XTEN, e.g., the non-repeti- tive sequence, the unstructured conformation, the high degree of solubility, the low degree or lack of self-aggregation, the low degree or lack of proteolytic sites within the sequence, and the low degree or lack of epitopes in the XTEN sequence. [0256] Conformational epitopes are formed by regions of the protein surface that are composed of multiple discontinu\u00ad ous amino acid sequences of the protein antigen. The precise folding of the protein brings these sequences into a well- defined, stable spatial configurations, or epitopes, that can be recognized as \"foreign\" by the host humoral immune system, resulting in the production of antibodies to the protein or the activation of a cell-mediated immune response. In the latter case, the immune response to a protein in an individual is heavily influenced by T-cell epitope recognition that is a function of the peptide binding specificity of that individual's HLA-DR allotype. Engagement of a MHC Class II peptide complex by a cognate T-cell receptor on the surface of the T-cell, together with the cross-binding of certain other co\u00ad receptors such as the CD4 molecule, can induce an activated state within the T-cell. Activation leads to the release of cytok\u00ad ines further activating other lymphocytes such as B cells to produce antibodies or activating T killer cells as a full cellular immune response. [0257] The ability of a peptide to bind a given MHC Class II molecule for presentation on the surface of an APC (antigen presenting cell) is dependent on a number of factors; most notably its primary sequence. In one embodiment, a lower degree of immunogenicity is achieved by designing XTEN sequences that resist antigen processing in antigen presenting cells, and/or choosing sequences that do not bind MHC recep\u00ad tors designed to reduce binding with MHCII receptors, as well as avoiding formation of epitopes for T-cell receptor or antibody binding, resulting in a low degree of immunogenicity. Avoid\u00ad ance of immunogenicity can attribute to, at least in part, a result of the conformational flexibility of XTEN sequences; i.e., the lack of secondary structure due to the selection andorder of amino acid residues. F or example, of particular inter\u00ad est are sequences having a low tendency to adapt compactly folded conformations in aqueous solution or under physi\u00ad ologic conditions that could result in conformational epitopes. The administration of polypeptides comprising XTEN, using conventional therapeutic practices and dosing, would generally not result in the formation of neutralizing antibodies to the XTEN sequence, and also reduce the immu\u00ad nogenicity of the payload in the conjugates. [0258] In one embodiment, the XTEN sequences utilized in the subject polypeptides can be substantially free of epitopes recognized by human T cells. The elimination of such epitopes for the purpose of generating less immunogenic proteins has been disclosed previously; see for example WO 98/52976, WO 02/079232, and WO 00/3317 which are incor\u00ad porated by reference herein. Assays for human T cell epitopes have been described (Stickler, M., et al. (2003) J Immunol Methods, 281: 95-108). Of particular interest are peptide sequences that can be oligomerized without generating T cell epitopes or non-human sequences. This is achieved by testing direct repeats of these sequences for the presence of T-cell epitopes and for the occurrence of 6 to 15-mer and, in par\u00ad ticular, 9-mer sequences that are not human, and then altering the design of the XTEN sequence to eliminate or disrupt the epitope sequence. In some embodiments, the XTEN sequences are substantially non-immunogenic by the restric\u00ad tion of the numbers of epitopes of the XTEN predicted to bind MHC receptors. With a reduction in the numbers of epitopes capable of binding to MHC receptors, there is a concomitant reduction in the potential for T cell activation as well as T cell helper function, reduced B cell activation or upregulation and reduced antibody production. The low degree of predicted T-cell epitopes can be determined by epitope prediction algo\u00ad rithms such as, e.g., TEPITOPE (Sturniolo, T., et al. (1999) Nat Biotechnol, 17: 555-61), as shown in Example 46. The TEPITOPE score of a given peptide frame within a protein is the log of the Krf (dissociation constant, affinity, off-rate) of the binding of that peptide frame to multiple of the most common human MHC alleles, as disclosed in Sturniolo, T. et al. (1999) Nature Biotechnology 17:555). The score ranges over at least 20 logs, from about 10 to about - 10 (correspond\u00ad ing to binding constraints of 10 e1 0 Krfto IOe-10 Kr f ), and can be reduced by avoiding hydrophobic amino acids that serve as anchor residues during peptide display on MHC, such as M, I, L, V, E In some embodiments, an XTEN component incor\u00ad not have a predicted T-cell epitope at a TEPITOPE threshold score of about -5, or -6, or -7, or -8, or -9, or at a TEPITOPE score of -10. As used herein, a score of \"-9 \" is a more stringent TEPITOPE threshold than a score of -5. 8. Increased Hydrodynamic Radius [0259] In another aspect, a subj ect XTEN useful as a fusion partner has a high hydrodynamic radius; a property that con\u00ad fers a corresponding increased apparent molecular weight to the XTEN-payload composition compared to the payload without the XTEN. As detailed in Example 26, the linking of XTEN to therapeutic protein sequences results in composi\u00ad tions that can have increased hydrodynamic radii, increased apparent molecular weight, and increased apparent molecular weight factor compared to a therapeutic protein not linked to an XTEN. For example, in therapeutic applications in which prolonged half-life is desired, compositions in which one or US 2015/0037359 Al 96Feb. 5,2015 more XTEN with a high hydrodynamic radius are conjugated to a payload can effectively enlarge the hydrodynamic radius of the conjugate beyond the glomerular pore size of approxi\u00ad mately 3-5 nm (corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of about 70 kDa) (Caliceti. 2003. 55:1261-1277), result\u00ad ing in reduced renal clearance of circulating proteins with a corresponding increase in terminal half-life and other enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. The hydrodynamic radius of a protein is conferred by its molecular weight as well as by its structure, including shape or compactness. Not to be bound by a particular theory, the XTEN can adopt open conformations due to the electrostatic repulsion between individual charges of incorporated charged residues in the XTEN as wells as because of the inherent flexibility imparted by the particular amino acids in the sequence that lack poten\u00ad tial to confer secondary structure. The open, extended and unstructured conformation of the XTEN polypeptide has a greater proportional hydrodynamic radius compared to polypeptides of a comparable sequence length and/or molecular weight that have secondary or tertiary structure, such as typical globular proteins. Methods for determining the hydrodynamic radius are well known in the art, such as by the use of size exclusion chromatography (SEC), as described inU.S. Pat. Nos. 6,406,632 and 7,294,513. Example 26 dem\u00ad onstrates that increases in XTEN length result in proportional increase in the hydrodynamic radius, apparent molecular weight, and/or apparent molecular weight factor, and thus permit the tailoring of an XTEN-payload to desired cut-off values of apparent molecular weights or hydrodynamic radii. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the XTEN-payload can be configured with an XTEN such that the resulting conjugate can have a hydrodynamic radius of at least about 5 nm, or at least about 8 nm, or at least about 10 nm, or about 12 nm, or about 15 nm, or about 20 nm, or about 30 nm or more. In the foregoing embodiments, the large hydrodynamic con\u00ad ferred by the XTEN in a XTEN-payload conjugate can lead to reduced clearance of the resulting conjugate, an increase in terminal half-life, and an increase in mean residence time. As described in the Examples, when the molecular weights of the XTEN-containing compositions are derived from size exclu\u00ad sion chromatography analyses, the open conformation of the XTEN due to the low degree of secondary structure results in an increase in the apparent molecular weight of the conju\u00ad gates into which they are incorporated. In one embodiment, the present invention makes use of the discovery that the increase in apparent molecular weight can be accomplished by the linking not ony of a single XTEN of a given length, but also by the linking of 2, 3, 4 or more XTEN of proportionally shorter lengths, either in linear fashion or as a trimeric or tetrameric, branched configuration, as described more fully, below. In some embodiments, the XTEN comprising a pay- load and one or more XTEN exhibits an apparent molecular weight of at least about 400 kD, or at least about 500 kD, or at least about 700 kD, or at least about 1000 kD, or at least about 1400 kD, or at least about 1600 kD, or at least about 1800 kD, or at least about 2000 kD. Accordingly, the XTEN-payload conjugate exhibits an apparent molecular weight that is about 1.3-fold greater, or about 2-fold greater, or about 3-fold greater or about 4-fold greater, or about 8-fold greater, or about 10-fold greater, or about 12-fold greater, or about 15-fold, or about 20-fold greater than the actual molecular weight of the conjugate. In one embodiment, the isolatedXTEN-payload conjugate of any of the embodiments dis\u00ad closed herein exhibit an apparent molecular weight factor under physiologic conditions that is greater than about 1.3, or about 2, or about 3, or about 4, or about 5, or about 6, or about 7, or about 8, or about 10, or greater than about 15. In another embodiment, the XTEN-payload has, under physiologic con\u00ad ditions, an apparent molecular weight factor that is about 3 to about 20, or is about 5 to about 15, or is about 8 to about 12, or is about 9 to about 10 relative to the actual molecular weight of the conjugate. Generally, the increased apparent molecular weight of the subject XTEN-payload conjugates enhances the pharmacokinetic properties of the composition by a combination of factors, which include reduced active clearance, reduced renal clearance, and reduced loss through capillary and venous junctions. 9. Compositions and Methods of Purifying XTEN as Substantially Elomogeneous Preparations [0260] It is an object of the invention to provide composi\u00ad tions of XTEN and methods of making preparations compris\u00ad ing XTEN with a high level of purity and uniformity in the length and composition of the XTEN described herein. [0261] The expression of recombinant XTEN protein or a recombinant fusion protein comprising XTEN in a host cell normally, like any globular protein, results in a mixture of different compounds in which a portion are truncated ver\u00ad sions of the desired protein length. The truncation can be the result of early termination of translation, mRNA instability, or proteolysis in the host cell. Because globular proteins generally have efficient or complete folding into their three- dimensional structure while truncated versions do not, typical purification and recovery processes can successfully separate and remove the truncated versions such that a high level of product homogeneity is achieved in a given preparation of globular proteins. However, protein polymers such as XTEN are unique in that, given their unstructured nature, generally lack three-dimensional structures. It has been difficult to obtain a homogeneous preparation of full-length XTENs due to one or more of the above-mentioned reasons. This is because incomplete or truncated XTEN chains differ only slightly in their physicochemical properties from the desired full-length sequences such that traditional processes that would be sufficient for purification of globular proteins are not effective in the removal of truncated XTEN from the expression product in order to obtain a substantially homo\u00ad geneous preparation of full-length sequences. While the sub\u00ad of the invention, including XTEN linked to pay- load, can be purified to a moderate degree of homogeneity by conventional means used for proteins, such as salt fraction\u00ad ation, ion electrophoresis, these methods alone do not result in preparations wherein the XTEN are substantially homogeneous in sequence length. [0262] The subject methods provided herein permit pro\u00ad duction of substantially homogenous preparation of XTENs via one or a few simple purification steps. In one embodiment, the practice of any of such methods of the present invention can utilize an XTEN designed to further comprise, as a fusion protein, affinity tags located at either or both of the N- and C-termini of the XTEN such that the expressed product can be subject to purification methods to selectively capture the full- length expressed polypeptide, thereby removing truncated XTEN 2015/0037359 Al 97Feb. 5,2015 examples of affinity tags that can be added to the termini of XTEN are presented in Table 7. Non-limiting examples of methods of the design, expression, and purification methods to achieve substantially homogeneous XTEN are described in the Examples. [0263] In some embodiments, the invention provides sub\u00ad stantially homogeneous polypeptide compositions with XTEN fused directly to one affinity tag (such as, but not limited to the tags of Table 7) linked to either the N- or C-terminus of the XTEN. In other embodiments, the substantially homogeneous polypeptide com\u00ad positions with XTEN fused to one affinity tag (such as, but not limited to the tags of Table 7) by a cleavage sequence linked to either the N- or C-terminus of the XTEN. In other embodi\u00ad ments, the invention provides substantially homogeneous polypeptide compositions with XTEN fused directly to one or two different affinity tags (such as, but not limited to the tags of Table 7) linked to the N- and/or C-termini of the XTEN, as shown in FIG. 41. In other embodiments, the invention pro\u00ad vides substantially homogeneous compositions with XTEN fused to one or two cleavage sequences (such as, but not limited to the cleavage sequences of Table 8 or Table 9) which, in turn, are each fused to different affinity tags (such as, but not limited to the tags of Table 7) linked to the N- or C-termini or both the N- and C-termini of the XTEN, as shown in FIG. 41. In yet other embodiments, the invention provides substantially homogeneous polypeptide composi\u00ad tions with XTEN fused directly to one or two different affinity tags (such as, but not limited to the tags of Table 7) linked to the N- and/or C-termini of the XTEN that further comprise a helper sequence (such as, but not limited to the sequences of Table 12) fused to the N-terminus of the protein. As used in the context of the proteins described herein, \"substantially homogeneous\" means that at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 91%, or at least about 92%, or at least about 93%, or at least about 94%, or at least about 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or even higher of the polypeptide sequences of the preparation have identical sequence length. The percent values are based on the area percentage of the chromatogram of the preparation analyzed by HPLC or the area percentage of the scan of the preparation analyzed by SDS-PAGE, or by other such standard procedures known in the art for assessing the purity of proteins. [0264] In one embodiment, the invention provides a sub\u00ad stantially homogenous polypeptide having the configuration of formula I: (HS)-(ATl)-(CSl)-(XTEN) I wherein HS is the helper sequence, ATl is the first affinity tag, CSl is the first cleavage sequence, and XTEN is the extended recombinant polypeptide. [0265] In another embodiment, the invention provides a substantially homogenous polypeptide having the configura\u00ad tion of formula II (HS)-(CS1)-(XTEN)-(CS2)-(AT1) II wherein HS is the helper sequence, ATl is the first affinity tag, CS I is the first cleavage sequence, CS2 is the second cleavage sequence and XTEN is the extended recombinant polypep\u00ad tide. [0266] In another embodiment, wherein the composition has the configuration of formula III: (HS)-(AT1)-(CS1)-(XTEN)-(CS2)-(AT2) IIIwherein HS is the helper sequence, ATl is the first affinity tag, AT2 is the second affinity tag, CSl is the first cleavage sequence, CS2 is the second cleavage sequence and XTEN is the extended recombinant polypeptide. [0267] The polypeptide constructs comprising affinity tags have the advantageous property, compared to XTEN not linked to affinity tags, of being able to be purified to substan\u00ad tially homogeneous length by use of chromatography sub\u00ad strates to which the affinity tags will bind. In some embodi\u00ad ments, the categories of chromatography substrates used in the method of purification are selected from the chromatog\u00ad raphy substrates set forth in Table 7, which are utilized for the purification of XTEN linked to the corresponding the indi\u00ad cated affinity tag in the tables. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the categories of chromatography substrate can encompass different chemical groups linked to different matrices or resins; e.g., anion exchange substrates include substrates include sulfo or sulfopropyl or carboxymethyl or phosphate groups to HIC substrates include ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, phenyl or IMAC substrates include iminodiacetic acid and nitriloacetic acid groups bound to resins. The foregoing substrates are listed for illustrative pur\u00ad poses and are not intended to limit the scope of substrates that can be employed to practice the invention. [0268] In some embodiments, the invention provides sub\u00ad stantially homogeneous XTEN prepared from the a polypep\u00ad tide comprising an XTEN fused to a first or a first and a second affinity tag by cleavage sequences (such as, but not limited to the cleavage sequences of Table 8) capable of being cleaved by a protease, wherein the preparation is treated with the protease to cleave the cleavage sequences to release the XTEN from the polypeptide, followed by a chromatography step to bind and then elute, and then recover the substantially homogeneous XTEN. In one embodiment of the foregoing, the protease is trypsin and the sequences are capable of being cleaved by trypsin, non-limiting examples of which are listed in Tables 11 and 15. In another embodiment of the foregoing, the protease is TEV and the cleavage sequences are capable of being cleaved by TEV. In another embodiment of the foregoing, the cleaved XTEN is purified by binding to MacoCap SP chromatography substrate followed by elution with a salt or buffer solution such as, but not limited to, sodium phosphate/NaCl, resulting in the substantially homogenous XTEN. As used in the context of XTEN and/or polypeptides comprising XTEN, a preparation that is \"sub\u00ad stantially purified\" means that at least about 85%, and more preferably at least about 90%, and more preferably at least about 91%, and more preferably at least about 92%, and more preferably at least about 93%, and more preferably at least about 94%, and more preferably at least about 95% or more of the individual molecules of a given preparation have identical sequence length; in other words, the same number of amino acids. The methods that can be utilized to assay for homoge\u00ad neity of length include mass spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography/HPLC, or SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining; the methods can be used individually or collectively to quantitate the degree of homogeneity. A generalized scheme for purification of polypeptides comprising XTEN with affinity tag sequences optimized for purification is shown in FIGS. 41-42. After purification the tags can be proteolytically cleaved (FIG. 41B) or retained (FIG. 41C). US 2015/0037359 Al 98Feb. 5,2015 The XTEN can be purified from contaminants due to the unique amino acid composition of XTEN, as illustrated in FIG. 42. [0269] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method to produce a substantially purified preparation of a polypeptide comprising an XTEN, comprising the steps of designing a gene encoding an XTEN and a first affinity tag, creating an expression vector suitable for transforming a host cell comprising the encoding gene operably linked to control sequences, transforming the host cell with the expression vector, culturing the host cell under conditions suitable for the expression of the XTEN with linked affinity tag, subjecting the crude expression product to a purification process that comprises an affinity purification step wherein the crude expression product is loaded onto a first chromatography substrate that selectively binds the first affinity tag, washing the chromatography substrate to elute material not bound to the chromatography substrate, eluting the retained protein under appropriate conditions and recovering the eluate wherein the recovered polypeptide is substantially homoge\u00ad neous in length. In another embodiment, the invention pro\u00ad vides a method to produce a substantially homogeneous preparation of a polypeptide comprising an XTEN, compris\u00ad ing the steps of designing a gene encoding an XTEN com\u00ad prising a first and a second affinity tag, creating an expression vector suitable for transforming a host cell comprising the encoding gene operably linked to control sequences, trans\u00ad forming the host cell with the expression vector, culturing the host cell under conditions suitable for the expression of the polypeptide, subjecting the crude expression product to a purification process that comprises an affinity purification step wherein the lysate is loaded onto a first chromatography substrate that selectively binds the first affinity tag, washing the chromatography substrate to elute material not bound to the chromatography substrate, eluting the retained protein under appropriate conditions and recovering the eluate, load\u00ad ing the recovered XTEN polypeptide onto a second chroma\u00ad tography substrate under conditions effective to capture the polypeptide with the second affinity tag onto the chromatog\u00ad raphy substrate, washing the chromatography substrate to elute material not bound to the chromatography substrate, eluting the XTEN polypeptide under conditions effective to elute the XTEN polypeptide with the second affinity tag, recovering the eluate containing the polypeptide comprising the XTEN polypeptide with the first and the second affinity tag wherein the recovered polypeptide is substantially homo\u00ad geneous in length. In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method to produce a substantially homogeneous preparation of a polypeptide comprising an XTEN, compris\u00ad ing the steps of designing a gene encoding an XTEN com\u00ad prising a first affinity tag linked by a cleavage sequence to the N-terminus of the encoded XTEN and a second affinity tag linked by a cleavage sequence to the C-terminus of the encoded XTEN, creating an expression vector suitable for transforming a host cell comprising the encoding gene oper\u00ad ably linked to control sequences, transforming the host cell with the expression vector, culturing the host cell under con\u00ad ditions suitable for the expression of the polypeptide, subject\u00ad ing the crude expression product to a purification process that comprises an affinity purification step wherein the lysate is loaded onto a first chromatography substrate that selectively binds the first affinity tag, washing the chromatography sub\u00ad strate to elute material not bound to the chromatography substrate, eluting the retained protein under appropriate con\u00additions and recovering the eluate, loading the recovered polypeptide onto a second chromatography substrate under conditions effective to capture the polypeptide with the sec\u00ad ond affinity tag onto the chromatography substrate, washing the chromatography substrate to elute material not bound to the chromatography substrate, eluting the polypeptide under conditions effective to elute the polypeptide with the second affinity tag, then treating the recovered polypeptide with a protease under conditions effective to release the XTEN from the polypeptide and loading the material onto a chromatog\u00ad raphy substrate capable of capturing the XTEN but not the affinity tags, washing the chromatography substrate to elute material not bound to the chromatography substrate, eluting the XTEN, recovering the eluate containing the XTEN polypeptide wherein the recovered XTEN is substantially homogeneous in length. In one embodiment of the foregoing methods described in this paragraph, the first and second affinity tags are selected from the group of affinity tags set forth in Table 7. In one embodiment of the method, the first affinity tag linked to the XTEN as a fusion protein comprises the sequence RPRPRPRPRPRPR and the chromatography substrate used to bind the polypeptide is MacroCap SP In another embodiment of the foregoing methods, the first affin\u00ad ity tag linked to a first terminus of the XTEN as a fusion protein comprises the sequence RPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPR, the second affinity tag linked to a second terminus of the XTEN comprises the sequence HHHHHHHH, the first chromatography substrate used to bind the polypeptide is MacroCap SP, and the second chromatography substrate used to bind the polypeptide is a immobilized metal on affinity (IMAC) substrate. In another embodiment of the foregoing methods, the first affinity tag fused to a cleavage sequence fused to a first terminus of the XTEN as a fusion protein comprises the sequence RPRPRPRPRPRPR or RPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPR, the second affinity tag fused to a cleavage sequence to a second terminus of the XTEN comprises the sequence HHH- HHH or HHHHHHHH, the first chromatography substrate used to bind the polypeptide is MacroCap SP, the second chromatography substrate used to bind the polypeptide is a immobilized metal on affinity (IMAC) substrate, the cleavage sequences comprise an arginine or lysine (including, but not limited to the sequences of Tables 8 and 9) and are cleaved by trypsin, and Macrocap Q is the chromatography substrate used to bind the XTEN freed from the affinity tags or, in the alternative, the freed XTEN is captures as flow-through by passing the protease-treated preparation through one or more of cation exchange, HIC and/or IMAC to capture the cleavage products and protease, leaving the XTEN in the flow-through, which is then recovered as a substantially homogeneous preparation. [0270] It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that the order and specific conditions of the steps of the method will vary depending on the composition of the XTEN-affinity tag polypeptide as well as the starting expression level and degree of contamination of truncated contaminants. For example, with certain XTEN compositions, the use of a single affinity tag linked to the XTEN will be sufficient to achieve a prepa\u00ad ration in which the polypeptide molecules are substantially homogeneous in length. In such cases, in one embodiment the single affinity tag is selected from the affinity tags set forth in Table 7. WithotherXTEN compositions, the use of a first and a second affinity tag will be sufficient to achieve a preparation in which the polypeptide molecules are substantially homo\u00ad US 2015/0037359 Al 99Feb. 5,2015 geneous in length and in such cases, in one embodiment, the first and second affinity tags are different and each is selected from the affinity tags set forth in Table 7. It will be further appreciated by one of skill in the art that once the polypep\u00ad tides comprising cleavage sequences are purified, the recov\u00ad ered polypeptide can be subsequently treated by proteolysis to release the one or two affinity tags, followed by passing the treated XTEN through a chromatography substrate to recover the XTEN without linked affinity tags. A schematic of the method is illustrated in FIG. 42 and exemplary methodolo\u00ad gies are described in the Examples. Many different proteases can be utilized for the release of terminal purification tags, depending on the sequence linking the affinity tag to the XTEN, including but not limited to a protease selected from Table 9. In one embodiment, the protease is selected from the group consisting of trypsin, chymotrypsin, tobacco etch mosaic virus another embodiment, the cleavage sequence incorporated into the polypeptide comprises an arginine residue that can be cleaved and the affinity tag removed by treatment with trypsin, thereby releasing the XTEN that is subsequently recovered in substantially purified form by chromatography such as, by capture using anion exchange (including but not limited to, MacroCap Q) or recovered as flow-through wherein the non-XTEN cleavage products and protease are captured by one or more of FlIC, cation exchange, or IMAC chromatography, leaving substantially homogeneous XTEN in the flow-through.

Payloads [0273] The present invention relates in part to XTEN con\u00ad jugates linked to one or more payload molecules. It is con\u00ad templated that XTEN can be linked to a broad diversity of payload molecules, including biologically active peptides, proteins, polymers, pharmacologically active small-mol\u00ad ecules, polynucleic acids, targeting peptides and proteins, targeting small molecules, antibodies and antibody frag\u00ad ments, and imaging small-molecule payloads, as well as com\u00ad binations of these types of payloads resulting in compositions with 2, 3, 4 or more types of payloads. The invention addresses a long-felt need in increasing the terminal half-life of exogenously administered therapeutic and diagnostic pay- loads to a subject in need thereof, as well as combinations of payloads that may include a therapeutic component and a targeting component. [0274] Non-limiting examples of functional classes of pharmacologically active payload agents for use in linking toan XTEN of the invention may be any one or more of the following: hypnotics and sedatives, psychic energizers, tran\u00ad quilizers, hormones, exocrine insulin, glucose-regulating peptides, anti-cancer cardiovascular antineoplastics, hypoglycemics, nutritional agents and supplements, growth supplements, antienteritis agents, vaccines, antibodies, diagnostic agents, contrasting agents, and radioactive imaging agents. US 2015/0037359 Al 104Feb. 5,2015 [0275] More particularly, the active payload may fall into one of a number of structural classes, including but not lim\u00ad ited to small molecule drugs, biologically active proteins (peptides, polypeptides, proteins, recombinant proteins, anti\u00ad glycoproteins), steroids, Forthe XTEN-payload conjugation compositions, it is specifically contemplated that a payload can be a pharmacologically active agent that possesses a suitably reactive functional group, including, but not limited to a native amino group, a sulfydryl group, a carboxyl group, an aldehyde group, a ketone group, an alkene group, an alkyne group, an azide group, an alcohol group, a heterocycle, or, alternatively, is modified to contain at least one of the foregoing reactive groups suitable forcouplingto eitheranXTEN, XTEN-cross- linker, or of the invention using any of the conjugation methods described herein or are otherwise known to be useful in the art for conjugating such reactive groups. Specific functional moieties and their reac\u00ad tivities are described in Organic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Thomas Sorrell, University Science Books, Elemdon, Va. (2005). Fur\u00ad ther, it will be understood that any payload containing a reactive group or that is modified to contain a reactive group will also contain a residue after conjugation to which either the XTEN, the XTEN-cross-linker, or the XTEN-click- chemistry reactant is linked. [0276] Exemplary payloads suitable for XTEN XTEN-cross-linker, orXTEN-click-chemistry reactant include biologically active proteins and pharmacologically active small molecule drugs with activity. Exemplary drugs suitable for the inventive com\u00ad positions can be found as set forth in the official United States Pharmacopeia, official Flomeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, in the Physi\u00ad cian's Desk Reference (PDR) and in the Orange Book main\u00ad tained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Preferred drugs are those having the needed reactive func\u00ad tional group or those that can be readily derivatized to provide the reactive functional group forconjugationandwillretainat least a portion of the pharmacologic activity of the unconju\u00ad gated payload when conjugated to XTEN. [0277] I . Drugs as Payloads some embodiments, the drug payload for conju\u00ad gation to either the subject XTEN, the XTEN-cross-linkers, or the XTEN-click-chemistry reactants described herein is one or more agents described herein or selected from the payloads of Table 11, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, acid or derivative or agonist thereof. In one embodiment, the drug is derivatized to introduce a reactive group for conjuga\u00ad tion to the subject duce a cleavable linker such but not limited to, valine- citrulline-PAB, wherein the linker is capable of being cleaved by a circulating or an intracellular protease after administra\u00ad tion to a subject, thereby freeing the drug from the conjugate.

In some embodiments of XTEN-payload conjugates, the payload is any pharmacologically active peptide or polypeptide that can be expressed recombinantly as a fusion protein linked to one or more XTEN. In other embodiments of XTEN-payload conjugates, the payload is any pharmacologically active pep\u00ad tide or polypeptide that can be conjugated to one or more XTEN. The conjugates may be in a configuration as described herein, below. The exemplary peptide or polypeptide pay- loads are meant to encompass analogs, agonists, antagonists, inhibitors, and isomers. It will be understood that the subject peptides and proteins encompass synthetic, semi-synthetic, recombinant, native, glycosylated, and non-glycosylated forms, as well as biologically active fragments, sequence variants, species variants, homologs and mutations thereof as long as the resulting variant protein retains a portion of activ\u00ad ity of the parent or native protein. [0281] Biologically active protein sequences can be obtained from publicly available databases, patents, or litera\u00ad ture references and other such sources that are well known in the art. For example, sequences can be obtained from Univer\u00ad sal Protein Resource (UniProt)/Swiss-Prot, European Bioin\u00ad formatics Institute (EBI), the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinfor\u00ad matics, the Protein Information Resource (PIR).

CNP is a selective agonist for the B-type natriuretic receptor (NPRB) and is reported to be a potent stimulator of endochondral bone growth. CNP binds to its receptor, initiates intracellular signals & ultimately inhibit the overactive FGFR3 pathway. Use of CNP is indi\u00ad cated for achondroplasia, a common form of skeletal dyspla\u00ad sia or short-limbed dwarfism, and human disorders caused by FGFR3 mutations, including S. Hum Mutat. (2012) 33:29). The half-life of CNP-22 is reported to be 2.6 min, being rapidly metabolized by neutral endopeptidase & cleared by a clear\u00ad ance receptor (Prickett T., 2004, Clinical Science, 106:535), its utility. [0286] \"Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone\" or \"LHRH\" means the human protein (UniProt No. POl 148) encoded by the GNRHl gene that is processed in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus from a 92-amino acid preprohormone into the linear decapeptide end-product having the sequence pyroGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2, as well as species and synthetic variations thereof, having at least a portion of the biological activity of the native peptide. LHRH plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the pituitary/ gonadal axis, and thus reproduction. LHRH exerts its effects through binding to high-affinity receptors on the pituitary gonadotroph cells and subsequent release of FSH and LH. LHRH is found in organs outside of the hypothalamus and pituitary, and because a high percentage of certain cancer tissues have LHRH binding sites and because sex steroids have been implicated in the development of breast and pros\u00ad US 2015/0037359 Al 111Feb. 5,2015 tate cancers, hormonal therapy with LHRH agonists are approved or are considered for the treatment of sex-steroid- dependent conditions such as estrogen-dependent breast can\u00ad cer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer and androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma. Because the half- life is reported to be less than 4 minutes, (Redding T W, et al. The Half-life, Metabolism and Excretion of Tritiated as a means pen- tapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Dphe-NmeVal selective for av integrins, which are important in angiogenesis (forming new blood vessels). The binding of such ligands activates the integrins to regulate tumor cell invasion, migration, proliferation, survival & angiogenesis. Hence, the use of cilengitide is under investigation for the treatment of glioblastoma by inhibiting angiogenesis (Burke P, et al. Cilengitide targeting of av|33 integrin receptor syn- eigizes with radioimmunotherapy to increase efficacy and apoptosis in breast cancer xenografts\", Cancer Res (2002) 62(15): 4263-4272). Because cilengitide has a short half-life of 3-5 h, and poor solubility limiting the maximum drug concentration to 15 mg/mL (O'Donnell P H. A phase I study of continuous infusion cilengitide in patients with solid tumors. Invest New Drugs (2012) 30:604), its utility as a therapeutic is limited. [0288] \"Growth hormone releasing hormone\" or \"GHRH\" or somatocrinin\" means the 44-amino acid peptide hormone produced in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus having the sequence YADAIFTNSYRKV- LGQLSARKLLQDIMSRQQGESNQERGARARL, as well as species and synthetic variations thereof, having at least a portion of the biological activity of the native peptide, includ\u00ad ing the biologically active 1-29 YADAIFTNSYRKVLGQLSARKLLQDIMSR. GHRH is released from neurosecretory nerve terminals and is carried by the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system to the ante\u00ad rior pituitary gland where it acts on GHRH receptor to stimu\u00ad late pulsatile growth hormone release. The GHRH analog tesamorelin is a drug approved for the treatment of lipodys\u00ad trophy in HIV patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, and is also considered for use in cachexia, abdominal obesity in growth-hormone deficient patients, muscle wasting related to certain chronic diseases, mild cognitive impair\u00ad ment, and growth hormone replacement in growth hormone deficient patients. Because the half-life is reported to be less than 15 minutes, (Chapman I M. J Endocrinol (1991) 128: 369-374), its utility as a therapeutic is synthetic versions and species and non-natural sequence variants having at least a portion of the biological activity of mature PYY As used herein, \"PYY\" includes both major forms of the human full length, 36 amino acid peptide, PYY1 ^ 6 and the predominant circulating form PYY306 (\"PYY3-36\") which have the PP fold structural motif. PYY3-36 has the sequence IKPEAPGEDASPEELNRYYASLRHYLNLVTRQRY- NH2. PYY is produced by specialized endocrine cells(L-cells) in the gut after a person eats and inhibits gastric motility and increases water and electrolyte absorption in the colon. PYY may also suppress pancreatic secretion. The naturally occurring PYY3-36 is a MnselectiveYl5Y2, & Y5 agonist. PPY-containing fusion proteins of the invention may find particular use in the treatment of diabetes for glucose regulation, insulin-resistance disorders, and obesity. Analogs of PYY have been prepared, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,604,203, 5,574,010 and 7,166,575. Because the half-life is reported to be less than I h, (Addison ML. A role for metal- loendopeptidases in the breakdown of the gut hormone, PYY 3-36. Endocrinology (2011) 152(12):4630-4640) and is typi\u00ad cally administered by the intranasal route three times daily, its utility as a therapeutic is limited. [0290] \"Leptin\" means the naturally occurring leptin (Unit- Prot No. P41159) encoded by the Ob(Lep) gene, synthetic versions and species and non-natural sequence variants hav\u00ad ing at least a portion of the biological activity of the mature leptin. Leptin bridge between residues 97 and 147. Leptin plays a key role in regulating energy intake and energy expenditure, including appetite, metabolism, and body weight. Leptin-containing polypeptides of the invention may find particular use in the treatment of diabetes for glu\u00ad cose regulation, Leptin described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,659, and leptin analogs and fragments in U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,283, U.S. Pat. No. 5,532, 336, PCT/US96/22308 and PCT/US96/01471. Because the commercially available form, metreleptin has a half-life reported to be 8-30 min (Klein S., et al. Adipose tissue leptin production and plasma leptin kinetics in humans. Diabetes (1996) 45:984-987) and the majority of current leptin thera\u00ad pies require lx-2x/day dosing, its utility as a therapeutic is limited. [0291] \"Pramlintide\" means the synthetic amylin mimetic having the sequence KCNTATCATNRLANFLVHSSNNFG- PILPPTNVGSNTY-NH2, and sequence variants having; at least a portion of the biological activity of pramlintide or native amylin. The pramlintide has a sequence wherein amino acids from the rat amylin sequence are substituted for amino acids in the human amylin sequence. Amylinis a37aa peptide secreted co-released with insulin in pulsatile fashion, typically in a molar ratio of 100 insulin to I amylin. Amylin functions to inhibit gastric emptying, glu\u00ad cagon secretion, promote satiety & meal termination (Kong M F, et al. Infusion of pramlintide, a human amylin analogue, delays gastric emptying in men with IDDM. Diabetologia. (1997) 40:82-88). Pramlintide is used as an adjunct to insulin therapy in TID and T2D and shows improvement in glycemic control and reduction in insulin requirements, and also dem\u00ad onstrate modest reduction in body weight (Neary M T, Bat- terham R L. Gut hormones: Implications for the treatment of obesity. Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2009)124:44-56). Because pramlintide has a half-life reported to be 20 min (McQueen, J. Pramlintide acetate. Am. J. Health-System Pharmacy (2005) 22:2363-2372) and requires 2x-3x/day dosing, its utility as a therapeutic is limited. [0292] \"Oxytocin\" means the mammalian hormone pep\u00ad tide (UniProt No. POl 178) having the sequence CYIQNC- US 2015/0037359 Al 112Feb. 5,2015 PLG-NH2 and a disulfide bridge between residues I and 6, and synthetic versions, such as pitocin. Oxytocin acts prima\u00ad rily as a neuromodulator in the brain, having a structure very similar to that of vasopressin, which are the only known hormones released by the human posterior pituitary gland to act at a distance. Oxytocinhas uterine-contracting properties mediated by specific, high-affinity oxytocin receptors expressed in the mammary gland and the hence its role in parturition and lactation. Oxytocin-containing polypep\u00ad tides of the invention may find particular use in the treatment of autism, fragile X syndrome, chronic daily headache, and male infertility. [0293] \"Relaxin\" means the protein hormone that is a het\u00ad erodimer of two peptide chains of 24 & 29 amino acids linked by disulfide, bridges created from the 185 amino acid precur\u00ad sor protein (UniProt No. P04090); the B chain having the sequence DSWMEEVIKLCGRELVRAQIAICGMSTWS and the A chain having the sequence QLYSALANKCCFl- VGCTKRSLARFC, with the disulfide bridges between BlO- AlO and B23-A24, and includes synthetic and recombinant versions. Relaxin is produced by the corpus luteum during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy in women and by the prostate in men. Relaxin orchestrates many of the maternal physi\u00ad ological responses to pregnancy, acts as a systemic and renal vasodilator, is a cardioprotective & antifibrotic agent. Relaxin vates PKC, P13K &. endothelin type B receptor resulting in increased nitric oxide production, and also activates MAPK, which may play a role in relaxin induced VEGF expression. Relaxin-containing polypeptides of the invention may find particular use in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADFlF). Because the reported half-life of relaxin in humans is less than 10 min (Dschietzig T, et al. Intravenous recombinant human relaxin in compensated heart failure: a safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic trial. J Card Fail. 2009; 15:182-190), the utility of the unmodified protein as a therapeutic is limited. [0294] \"Cenderitide\" and \"CD-NP\" means a RIGSMSGLGCPSLRDPRPNAPSTSA, bridges between residues 6 and 22. The chimeric peptide has vasoprotective and RAAS suppressing actions via activation of the receptors guanylyl cyclase (GC)-A and GC-B, and may potentiate renal enhancement and cardiac unloading while having minimal hypotensive effects. Accordingly, it may have use in treatment of cardiorenal disease such as acute decompensated heart failure (ADFlF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly the \"post-acute\" ment period. [0295] \"Peginesatide\" or \"hematide\" is a peptide composed of two synthetic 2 1 amino-acid peptides having the sequence GlyGlyLeuTyrAlaCysFlisMetGlyProIleThrlNalValCys GlnProLeuArgSarLys that are linked at lysine with a branched polyethylene glycol. Peginesatide is a novel analog of erythropoietin that has erythropoietic properties and is being developed for medical use as a treatment for anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients not on dialy\u00ad sis. [0296] \"Oxyntomodulin\" or means human oxyn- tomodulin, sythetic versions and sequence variants thereof having at least a portion of the biological activity of mature oxyntomodulin. Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptidehaving the sequence HSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQD- FVQWLMNTKRNRNNIA, is produced postprandially from intestinal L-cells in the colon and contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy- terminal extension. Oxyntomodulin is an agonist at both the glucagon receptor and the GLP-IR, with its anorectic effect probably mediated via the latter receptor. OXM has been found to suppress appetite. OXM-containing polypeptides of the invention may find particular use in the treatment of diabetes for glucose regulation, insulin-resistance disorders, obesity, and can be used as a weight loss treatment. As native oxyntomodulin has been reported to have a half-life of -12 min in human plasma (measured with a cross-reacting gluca\u00ad gon assay; Schjoldager B T. mone from the distal gut. Pharmacokinetics and effects on gastric acid and insulin secretion in man. Eur J Clin Invest. (1988) 18(5):499-503.), the utility of the unmodified protein as a therapeutic is limited. [0297] \"POT4\" or \"APL-1\" means the synthetic cyclic pep\u00ad tide having the sequence Fl-Ile-[Cys-Val-Val-Gln-Asp-Trp- Gly-Flis-F[is-Arg-Cys]-Thr-NF[2. POT4 is a more potent C3 complement inhibitor than compstatin, which inhibits the cleavage of native C3 to its active fragments C3a and C3b, and has extended circulating in vivo half-life of 8 hours. It is considered for use to prevent inflammation, damage and upregulation of angiogenic factors like VEGF in diseases No. Q8IU54 (20-200)) encoded by the SSPVFPGNWDL RLLQVRERPVALEAELALTLKV- LEAAAGPALEDVLDQPLHTLHHILSQLQACIQPQPTAG CLEASVTFNLFRLLTRDLKYVADGNLCLRTSTHPE ST, recombinant and synthetic versions and sequence variants thereof having at least a portion of the biological activity of mature IL-29. A type III interferon, IL-29 signals through a heterodimer receptor complex (IL-10R2 &IL-28Ra receptor chains) distinct from type I IFN (IFNAR1/IFNAR2 receptor complex), and plays an important role in anti-viral immunity. Notably, the IL-29 receptor is highly expressed on hepato- cytes, the primarysite of FlCV infection, but is not signifi\u00ad cantly expressed on immune or bone marrow cells. Pegylated versions have an estimated half-life of 50-70 h. [0299] \"Interferon-beta\" or \"IFN-|3\" means the human pro\u00ad tein encoded CLKDRMNFDIPEEIKQLQQFQKEDAALTI YEMLQNIFAIFRQDSSSTGWNETIVEN- LLANVYHQINHLKTVLEEKLEKEDFTRGKLMSS TIVRVEILRNFYFINRLTGYLRN, and recombinant and synthetic versions and sequence variants thereof having at least a portion of the biological activity of mature IFN-|3. IFN-|3 is produced by various cell types including fibroblasts &. macrophages, and mediates antiviral, antiproliferative & immunomodulatory activities in response to viral infection &. other biological inducers. The binding of IFN-|3 to specific receptors on the surface of human cells initiates a cascade of intracellular events that leads to the expression of numerous interferon-induced gene products suchas 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, US 113Feb. 5,2015 products are routinely used as biomarkers in clinical setting. IFN-|3 is used in treatment of various forms of multiple scle\u00ad rosis (MS), including elapse remitting MS, secondary pro\u00ad gressive MS, primary progressive MS, juvenile onset MS, and clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of MS. Com- mercially-available forms of IFN-|3 have reported half-lives of 4 to 67 h and require frequent dosing, such that their utility as a therapeutic is limited. [0300] \"C-peptide\" means the human pancreatic protein having the sequence EAEDLQNTGQVELGGGPGAGSLQ- PLALEGSLQ, and recombinant and synthetic versions and sequence variants thereof having at least a portion of the biological activity of native C-peptide. C-peptide is the middle segment of proinsulin that is between the N-terminal B-chain and the C-terminal A-chain, and is cleaved from mature insulin is formed and secreted. Ciru- lating C-peptide binds to a receptor that is likely G-protein- coupled, and the signal activates Ca2+-dependent intracellu\u00ad lar signaling such as MAPK, PLCy, and PKC, leading to upregulation of a range of transcription factors as well as eNOS and Na+K+ATPase activities. C-peptide is considered for use in diabetic complications and diabetic nephropathy. Since the reported half-life is about 30 minutes (Matthews D R. The half-life of endogenous insulin and C-peptide in man assessed by somatostatin suppression. Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). (1985) 23(1):71-79), the utility of the unmodified protein as a therapeutic is limited. [0301] \"Ghrelin\" means the human hormone having the sequence GSSFLSPEHQRVQQRKESKKPPAKLQPR, truncated versions, recombinant and synthetic versions and sequence variants thereof having at least a portion of the biological activity of native ghrelin, including the native, processed 27 or 28 amino acid sequence and homologous sequences. Ghrelin induces satiation, or species and non\u00ad natural sequence variants having at least a portion of the biological activity of mature ghrelin, including the native, processed 27 or 28 amino acid sequence and homologous sequences. Ghrelin is produced mainly by P/Dl cells lining the fundus of the human stomach and epsilon cells of the pancreas that stimulates hunger, and is considered the coun\u00ad terpart hormone to leptin. Ghrelin levels increase before meals and decrease after meals, and can result in increased food intake and increase fat mass by an action exerted at the level of the hypothalamus. Ghrelin also stimulates the release of growth hormone. Ghrelin is acylated at a serine residue by n-octanoic acid; this acylation is essential for binding to the GFlSla receptor and for the agonist activity and the GFl- releasing capacity of ghrelin. Ghrelin-containing polypep\u00ad tides of the inventionmay find particular use as agonists; e.g., to selectively stimulate motility of the GI tract in gastrointes\u00ad tinal motility disorder, to accelerate gastric emptying, or to stimulate the release of growth hormone. The invention also contemplates unacylated forms and sequence variants of ghrelin, which act as antagonists. Ghrelin analogs with sequence substitutions or truncated variants, such as described inU.S. Pat. No. 7,385,026, may find particular use as fusion partners to XTEN for use as antagonists for improved glucose homeostasis, treatment of insulin resis\u00ad tance and treatment of cachexia, post-opera\u00ad tive ileus, bowel disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. The isolation and characterization of ghrelin has been reported (Kojima M, et ah, Ghrelin is growth-hormone-releasing acylated stomach. Nature. 1999; 656-660) and synthetic analogs have been prepared by pep\u00adtide synthesis, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,967,237. As ghrelin has a reported terminal half-life of 10-30 min (Aka- mizu T, et al. Pharmacokinetics, safety, and endocrine and appetite effects of ghrelin administration in young healthy subjects. Eur J. Endocrinology (2004)150(4):447-455), the utility of the unmodified protein as a therapeutic is limited, and analogs with, at position 3, the native serine amino acid with an octyl side group instead of the native octanoyl side group may confer added resistant to proteases. [0302] \"Follistatin,\" also known as \"activin-binding pro\u00ad tein\" or \"FSFl-suppressing protein (FSP),\" means the protein that, in humans, is encoded by the FST gene. As used herein, \"follistatin\" includes homologs, species variants, sequence variants and fragments thereof. The mature protein form in humans has 315 amino acids, is referred to as FS-315 and has been cloned (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,041,538 and 5,182,375). Fol\u00ad listatin contains two potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn95 and Asn259, however it has been demonstrated that mutation at these sites followed by testing of the recombinant product for their ability to inhibit FSFl secretion and to bind activin resulted in each mutant having a similar property as the non- mutated recombinant hFS-315, suggesting that glycosylation of the follistatin molecule has no effect in these functions (Inouye, S., et al. Site-specific mutagenesis of human follista\u00ad tin. USA 84: 8282-8286 (1987) and bovine follistatin is disclosed in Robertson et ah, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 149:744-749 (1987). As hone mor\u00ad and growth/differentiation factors such as activin and myostatin have the ability to induce the growth, formation, differentiation and maintenance of various tissues, including bone, cartilage, tendon/ligament, muscle, neural, and various organs, their neutralization by follistatin and follistatin agonists have therapeutic value (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,616,5,041,538, andAU9675056). As follistatin admin\u00ad istered to a subject is rapidly eliminated from the circulation, with a terminal half-life of just over 2 hours in rats (Kogure K, et al. Intravenous administration of follistatin: delivery to the liver and effect on liver regeneration after partial hepatec- tomy. Flepatology. (1996) 24(2):361-366), the utility of the unmodified protein as a therapeutic is limited.

The VIP peptide is produced in many tissues, including the gut, pancreas and suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus in the brain. VIP stimulates con\u00ad tractility the heart, causes vasodilation, increases glyco- genolysis, lowers arterial blood pressure and relaxes the smooth muscle of trachea, stomach and gall bladder, Changes in concentration are associated with myocardial fibrosis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension, and its deficiency in the respiratory system is considered to be a pathogenetic factor in pulmonary disease (Said SI, 2007, Circulation, 115: 1260; Said S I, 2008, Ann N Y Acad Sci, 1144:148; Petkov V et. al, 2003, J Gin Invest, 111:1339). VIP is considered for use in treating resistant hypertension, pri\u00ad mary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAFl), asthma, COPD, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, and female sexual dys\u00ad function. As its half-life is reported to be approximately I minute (Domschke S, et al.

Fuzeon and multimers thereof or conjugates with related peptides are used or are being considered for use in treating resistant forms of FlIV infection. As fuzeon has a half-life of 3.8 h in patients, requiring frequent injection administrations, its utility is limited. [0305] \"KAI-4169\" means the peptide agonist of the human cell surface calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) under development by KAI Pharma for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SFlPT) in kidney disease patients and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) patients.

Pasireotide is a multi-receptor somatosta\u00ad tin analogue with high binding affinity for somatostatin-R- subtypes R l, 2,3 & 5 that suppresses growth hormone, IGF-I and adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. In addition to treatment of Cushing's Disease, it is also considered for use in acromegaly, neuroendocrine disease, liver disease, progressive meningioma, and other endocrine disorders. As a commercially-available form has a reported half-life of 12 to 17 h (Petersenn, S. et al.

Irisin mediates beneficial effects of muscular exercise, and induces browning of white adipose tissue by up-regulating UCPl expression through activation of the nuclear receptor PPARA. Mildly increased irisin levels have been shown to result in increased eneigy expenditure, reduced body weight and improved diet-induced insulin resistance (Bostrom P, 2012, Nature, 481:463). Irisin is con\u00ad sidered for use in treating obesity, and metabolic \"TXA127\" the sequence NRVYIHP and PanCyte is an cyclic analog linking the 4th and 7th residues with dAla and Ala, respectively, with the result that it is more resistant to degradation and has a longer half-life.

IL-7 IL-7 stimulates the sion of CD4/CD8 T cells. IL-7 limits the production of sup\u00ad pressor regulatory T cells and T cell energy through TGF-B antagonism, and supports production of central memory T cells. IL-7 is considered for use in treating lymphopenia in HIV, oncology, transplant, HBV and HCV infection, as well as treating minimal residual disease or advanced tumors, and may have roles in immune reconstitution or enhancement of immunotherapy. As the reported half-life of IL-7 in humans is approximately 10 h (Sportes, C. et al. Phase I Study of Recombinant Human Interleukin-7 Administration in Sub\u00ad jects with Refractory Malignancy.

F GF -18 is a protein member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. FGF family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities, and are involved in a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth, and invasion. It has been shown in vitro that this protein is able to induce neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells. FGF-18 stimulates the proliferation of chondrocyte & osteo\u00ad blasts (cells that produce and maintain bone and cartilage) and its use is considered for the repair and generation of the cartilage, for example in the knee joints (Ellsworth J L. Fibro\u00ad blast growth factor-18 is a trophic factor for mature chondro\u00ad cytes and their progenitors. Osteoarthritis Cartilage (2002) 10:308-320).

Alpha-MSH is a non-selective agonist of the MC3, MC4 & is exclusive for ACTH). Alpha-MSH stimulates melanocytes to produce & release melanin which has a photo-protective effect; it signals the brain, which has effects on appetite and sexual arousal. It is considered for use in treating erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP, intolerant to sun), keratosis (AK, polymorphous light eruption (PLE/PMLE), post-surgery kidney damage, erectile dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction.

PNAS (2001) 98:6336-6341). More recently, humanin was found to help improve insulin action and lower blood glucose levels (Muzumdar R H, Humanin: A Novel Central Regulator of Peripheral Insulin Action. PLoS One (2009) 4:e6334). Humanin s considered for use in treating Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and vascular & cardiovascular diseases. [0314] \"Glucagon\" means the human glucagon glucose regulating peptide having the sequence HSQGTFTSDYSKY- LDSRRAQDFVQWLMNT, and recombinant and synthetic versions and sequence variants thereof having at least a por\u00ad tion of the biological activity of native glucagon. The term \"glucagon\" as used herein also includes peptide mimetics of glucagon. Native glucagon is produced by the pancreas, released when blood glucose levels start to fall too low, caus\u00ad ing the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream. While the action of glucagon is opposite that of insulin, which signals the body's cells to take in glucose from the blood, glucagon also stimulates the release of insulin, so that newly-available glucose in thebloodstream can be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues. Glucagon-containing polypeptides of the invention may find particular use in increasing blood glucose levels in individuals with extant hepatic glycogen stores and maintain\u00ad ing glucose homeostasis in diabetes.

Plasma FXIII circulates as aheterotetramercomposedof2 A subunits and 2 B subunits noncovalently linked together and bound to fibrinogen. The B subunit, which appears to stabilize the structure of the A subunit and to protect the A subunit from proteolysis, is normally present in excess hi plasma as free FXIII-B subunit. Most patients with FXIII deficiency have mutations in the FXIII-A subunit; few cases of patients with FXIII-B subunit mutations reported (Mikkola, is treating hemophilia and FXIII deficiency, and acquired FXIII defi\u00ad ciency due to chronic liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and post-surgery bleeding.

Factor X is the first member of the final common (or thrombin) pathway. Factor X is used to treat factor X defi\u00ad ciency, hemophilia A & B using bypass strategies due to FVIII and FIX patients developing inhibitory antibodies to FVIII and FIX replacement therapies), emergency treatment of patients with hemorrhages due to oral anticoagulants over\u00addose or unknown causes of critical bleeding, and patients who develop acquired FX deficiency caused by lack of vitamin K, amyloidosis, severe liver disease & use of anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin). While the half-life of mature factor X is 40-45 h, the plasma half-life of activated factor X (Fxa) is <1-2 min ((Bunce M W, 2008, Blood, 117:290), making its utility in unmodified form limited, being rapidly inactivated by anti\u00ad thrombin TFPl. [0320] 4. Nucleic Acids as Payloads [0321] The invention also contemplates the use of nucleic acids as payloads in the XTEN conjugates. In one embodi\u00ad ment, the invention provides XTEN-payload conjugates wherein the payload is selected from the group consisting of aptamers, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozyme nucleic acids, nucleic acids. Such nucleic acids used as therapeutics are know in the art (Edwin Jarald, Nucleic acid drugs: a novel approach. African Journal of Biotechnology Vol. 3 (12):662-666, 2004; Joanna B. Opalinska. Nucleic-acid therapeutics: basic prin\u00ad recent applications. Nature Discov\u00ad ery 1:503-514, 2002). IV). XTEN-Cross-Linker and XTEN-Payload Conjugates and Methods of Making Such Conjugates [0322] The present invention relates in part to highly puri\u00ad fied preparations of XTEN-cross-linker conjugate composi\u00ad to which payloads are conjugated, as described herein. The invention also relates to highly purified preparations of payloads linked to one or more XTEN using the XTEN-cross-linker conjugation partners. The present invention encompasses compositions and meth\u00ad ods of making the XTEN-payload conjugates formed by link\u00ad ing of any of the herein described XTEN with a payload, as well as reactive compositions and methods of making the compositions formed by conjugating XTEN with a cross\u00ad linker or other chemical methods described herein. It is spe\u00ad cifically intended that the terms \"XTEN-payload\" and \"XTEN-cross-linker\" encompass the linked reaction prod\u00ad ucts remaining after the conjugation of the reactant conjuga\u00ad partners, including the reaction products of cross-linkers, click-chemistry reactants, or other methods described herein. [0323] In some embodiments, the XTEN utilized to create the subject conjugates comprise XTEN selected from any one of the sequences in Table 2, Table 3, and Tables 22-25, which may be linked to the payload component directly or via cross\u00ad linkers disclosed herein. In other embodiments, the one or more XTEN utilized to create the subject conjugates indi\u00ad vidually comprise an XTEN sequence having at least an XTEN selected from Tables 2,3, and 22-25 or a fragment thereof, when optimally aligned with a sequence of comparable length.

In another embodiment, the subject conjugates are US 2015/0037359 Al 117Feb. 5,2015 multimeric in that they comprise a first, a second, and a third XTEN sequence, wherein the XTEN are the same or they are different and wherein each individually comprises an XTEN sequence having at least about 80% sequence to an XTEN selected from Tables 2, 3, 22-25 or a fragment thereof, when optimally aligned with a sequence of comparable length. In yet another embodiment, the subject conjugates are multim\u00ad eric in that they comprise 3, 4, 5, 6ormoreXTEN sequences, wherein the XTEN are the same or they are different and wherein each individually comprises an XTEN sequence hav\u00ad ing at least about 80% compared to an XTEN selected from Tables 2, 3, and 22-25 or a fragment thereof. In the multimeric conjugates, the cumulative length of the residues in the XTEN sequences is greater than about 200 to about 3000 or about 400 to about 1000 amino acid residues, and the XTEN can be identical or they can be different in sequence or in length. As used herein, cumulative length is intended to encompass the total length, in amino acid residues, when more than one XTEN is incorporated into the conjugate. [0324] In one aspect, the invention provides compositions of XTEN covalently linked to a small molecule payload drug, resulting in an XTEN-drug conjugate (\"XTEN-D\"). In another aspect, the invention provides compositions of XTEN covalently linked to a payload biologically active protein (which encompasses peptides or polypeptides), resulting in an XTEN-peptide/polypeptide conjugate (\"XTEN-P\"). In another aspect, the invention provides compositions of one or more XTEN recombinantly linked to a payload peptide or polypeptide, resulting in an XTEN-peptide/polypeptide recombinant fusion protein (\"XTEN-PR\"). In another aspect, the invention provides compositions of one or more XTEN linked to payloads of one or more drugs and one or more proteins that can be biologically active or can be targeting moieties. In particular, the invention provides isolated XTEN-D, XTEN-P, XTEN-PR, and XTEN-D-P composi\u00ad tions useful in the treatment of a condition for which the administration of a payload drug and/or protein is known in the art to be useful in the treatment, amelioration or preven\u00ad tion of a disease or condition in a subject. The XTEN-D conjugates generally comprise one or more of the following components: I) XTEN; 2) cross-linker; and 3) payload to which the XTEN is chemically conjugated either directly or by use of a cross-linker, such as commercially-available cross-linkers described herein, or by use of click-chemistry reactants, or in some cases, may be created by conjugation between reactive groups in the XTEN and payload without the use of a linker as described herein. The XTEN-P generally comprise one or more of the following components: I) XTEN; 2) cross-linker; and 3) biologically active protein payload, and are also generally created by conjugation with the use of a cross-linker or click-chemistry reactants. The XTEN-PR conjugates generally comprises one or more of the following components: I) one or more XTEN; 2) a spacer sequence and 3) payload. The XTEN-D-P generally comprise one or more of the following components: I) XTEN; 2) optional linker; 3) biologically active protein; and 4) drug, wherein the payloads are generally created by conjugation with the use of a cross-linker or click-chemistry reactants, asdescribed above. Eiowever, in some cases of foregoing types of compositions, the composition can be created without the use of a cross-linker provided the components are otherwise chemically reactive. [0325] The conjugation of XTEN to payloads confers sev\u00ad eral advantages on the resulting compositions compared to the payloads not linked to XTEN. As described more fully below, non-limiting examples of the enhanced properties include increases in the overall solubility and metabolic sta\u00ad bility, reduced susceptibility to proteolysis in circulation, reduced immunogenicity, reduced rate of absorption when administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, reduced clearance by the kidney, enhanced interactions with substrate, reduced toxicity, targeted delivery of payload, and enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. Enhanced pharmacokinetic properties of the conjugates compared to payload not linked to XTEN include longer terminal half-life (e.g., two-fold, three-fold, four-fold or more), increased area under the curve (AUC) (e.g., 25%, 50%, 100% or more), lower volume of distribution, slower absorption after subcutaneous or intra\u00ad muscular inj ection (an advantage compared to commercially- available forms of payload that must be administered by a similar route) such that the Cmax is lower, which, in turn, results in reductions in adverse effects of the payload that, collectively, results in an increased period of time that a conjugation composition administered to a subject provides therapeutic activity. In some embodiments, the conjugation compositions comprise cleavage sequences (described more fully, below) that permits sustained release of active payload, such that the administered XTEN-payload acts as a depot when subcutaneously or intramuscularly administered. It is specifically contemplated that XTEN-payload conjugates can exhibit one or more or any combination of the improved properties disclosed herein. As a result of these enhanced properties, the XTEN-payload conjugates permit less fre\u00ad quent dosing, more tailored dosing, and/or reduced toxicity compared to payload not linked to XTEN and administered in a comparable fashion. Such XTEN-payload conjugates have utility to treat certain conditions known in the art to be affected, ameliorated, or prevented by administration of the payload to a subject in need thereof., as described herein.

In particular, the herein-described XTEN-cross-linker conjugate partners are useful for conju\u00ad gation to payload agents or surfaces bearing at least one thiol, amino, carboxyl, aldehyde or alcohol or any other reactive group available and suitable, as known in the art, for reaction between the components described herein. [0328] In another aspect, the invention relates to methods of making conjugates of XTEN-cross-linker reactants and XTEN-click-chemistry azide/alkyne reactants, resulting in conjugates that can be utilized to prepare the subject XTEN- payload compositions. In particular, the herein-described methods for making XTEN-cross-linkers and XTEN-azide/ alkyne reactants are useful wherein the payload agent or a reaction surface bears at least one thiol, amino, carboxyl, aldehyde, alkene, alkyne, heterocycle, for reaction. [0329] Exemplary embodiments of XTEN have been described above, including preparations of substantially US 2015/0037359 Al 118Feb. 5,2015 homogeneous XTEN. The invention provides XTEN that further serve as a platform to which payloads can be conju\u00ad gated, such that they serve as a \"carrier\", conferring certain desirable pharmacokinetic, chemical and pharmaceutical properties to the compositions, amongst other properties described below. In other embodiments, the invention pro\u00ad vides polynucleotides that encode XTEN that can be linked to genes encoding peptide or polypeptide payloads that can be incorporated into expression vectors and incorporated into suitable hosts for the expression and recovery of the subject XTEN-payload recombinant fusion proteins. [0330] In some embodiments, the XTEN components as described herein, above, are engineered to incorporate a defined number of reactive amino acid residues that can be reacted with cross-linking agents or can further contain reac\u00ad tive groups that can be used to conjugate to payloads. In one embodiment, the invention provides cysteine-engineered XTEN wherein the cysteine, each of which contains a reactive thiol group, are conjugated to a cross-linker, resulting in XTEN-cross-linker conjugate. In another embodiment, invention provides lysine-engineered XTEN wherein lysine, each of which contains a positively charged hydrophilic E-amino group, are conjugated to a cross-linker, of cys\u00ad XTEN, each comprises about I to about 100 cysteine amino acids, or from I to about 50 cysteine amino acids, or from I to about 40 cysteine amino acids, or from I to about 20 cysteine amino acids, or from I to about 10 cysteine amino acids, or from I to about 5 cysteine amino acids, or 9 cysteines, or 3 cysteines, or a single cysteine amino acid that is available for conjugation. In the embodiments of lysine- engineered XTEN, each comprises about I to about 100 lysine amino acids, or from I to about 50 lysine amino acids, or from I to about 40 lysine engineered amino acids, or from I to about 20 lysine engineered amino acids, or from I to about 10 lysine engineered amino acids, or from I to about 5 lysine engineered amino acids, or 9 cysteines, or 3 cysteines, or a single lysine that is available for conjugation. In another embodiment, the engineered XTEN comprises both cysteine and lysine residues of the foregoing ranges or numbers. [0331] Generally, XTEN cysteine thiol or hydroxyl groups. In addition, cysteine residues are generally found in smaller numbers in a given protein; thus are less likely to result in multiple conju\u00ad gations within the same protein. Cysteine residues have been introduced into proteins by genetic engineering techniques to form covalent attachments to ligands or to form new intramo\u00ad lecular disulfide bonds (Better et al (1994) J. Biol. 13:9644-9650; Bernhard et al (1994) Bioconjugate Chem. 5:126-132; Greenwood et al (1994) Therapeutic Immunology 1:247-255; (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 96:4862-4867; Kanno et al (2000) J. of Biotechnology, 76:207-214; Chmura et al (2001) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 98(15):8480-8484; U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,564). [0332] In one embodiment, the invention provides an iso\u00ad composition comprising a cysteine-engineered XTEN conjugated to homobifunctional or het\u00ad erobifunctional cross-linkers. In another embodiment, the provides an isolated composition comprising a lysine-engineered XTEN conjugated by a cross-linker, wherein amine-reactive homobifunctional or heterobifunctional cross-linkers. Cross\u00adlinking is the process of chemically linking two or more molecules by a covalent bond. The process is also called conjugation or bioconjugation with reference to its use with proteins and other biomolecules. For example, proteins can be modified to alter N- and C-termini, and amino acid side chains on proteins and peptides in order to block or expose reactive binding sites, inactivate functions, or change func\u00ad tional groups to create new targets for cross-linking [0333] In one aspect, the invention provides methods for the site-specific conjugation to XTEN polymer, accom\u00ad plished using chemically-active amino acid residues or their derivatives (e.g., the N-terminal a-amine group, the 6-amine group of lysine, cysteine, the carboxyl group, carboxyl groups of glutamic acid and aspar\u00ad tic acid. Functional groups suitable for reactions with primary a- and 6-amino groups Phys. 195, 203-209 (1994); Roberts, M. J. et. al. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 54, 459-476 (2002)). N-hydroxysuccinimide esters (NFIS-esters and their water soluble analogs sulfo-NFIS-esters) are commonly used for protein conjugation (see FIG. 2). NFIS-esters yield stable amide products upon reaction with primary amines with rela\u00ad tively efficient coupling at physiological pH. The conjugation reactions are typically performed in 50-200 mM phosphate, bicarbonate/carbonate, HEPES or borate buffers (pH between 7 and 9) at 4\u00b0 C. to room temperature from 0.5 to 2 hrs. NHS-esters are usually used at two- to 50-fold molar excess to protein. Typically, the concentration of the reagent can vary from 0.1-10 mM, while the optimal protein concen\u00ad tration is 50-100 pM. [0334] In another method, given that XTEN polypeptides possess only a single N-terminal a-amino group, the XTEN can be engineered to contain additional 6-amino group(s) of intentionally incorporated lysine residues; exemplary sequences of which are provided in Table 3. The a- and 6-amino groups have different pKa values: approximately 7.6 to 8.0 for the a-amino group of the N-terminal amino acid, and approximately 10-10.5 for the 6-amino group of lysine. Such a significant difference in pKa values can be used for selective modification of amino groups. Deprotonation of all primary amines occurs at pH above pH 8.0. In this environ\u00ad ment, the nucleophilic properties of different amines deter\u00ad reactivity. the more groups are generally more reactive toward electrophiles than a-amino groups. On the other hand, at a lower pH (for example pH 6), the more acidic a-amino groups are generallymore deprotonated thane-amino groups, and the order of reactivity is inverted. For example, the FDA- approved drug Neulasta (pegfilgranstim) is granulocyte colony-stimulating by covalent 20 kDa PEG-aldehyde. Specific modification of the protein's N-terminal amino acid was accomplished by exploiting the lower pKa of a-amino group as compared to e-amino groups of internal lysines (Molineaux, G. Curr Pharm. XTEN polypeptides comprising cysteine resi\u00ad dues can be genetically engineered using recombinant meth\u00ad ods described herein (see, e.g., Examples) or by standard US 2015/0037359 Al 119Feb. 5,2015 methods known in the art. Conjugation to thiol groups can be carried using highly specific reactions, leading to the forma\u00ad tion of single conjugate species joined by cross-linking agents. Functional groups suitable for reactions with cysteine sulfhy- dryl groups when the pFl of the reaction mixture is between pFl 6.5 and 7.5, forming a stable thioether linkage that is not reversible (see FIG. 3). At neutral pFl, maleimides react with sulfhydryls 1,000-fold faster than with amines, but when the pFl is raised to greater than 8.5, the reaction favors primary amines. Maleimides do not react with tyrosines, histidines or methionines. For reaction solutions, thiols must be excluded from reaction buffers used with maleimides as they will com\u00ad pete for coupling sites. Excess maleimides in the reaction can be quenched at the end of a reaction by adding free thiols, while EDTA can be included in the coupling buffer to mini\u00ad mize oxidation of sulfhydryls. [0336] In another embodiment, the invention contemplates use of haloacetyl reagents that are useful for cross-linking sulfhydryls groups or payloads to prepare ject conjugates. The most commonly used haloacetyl that reacts with sulfhy- groups at physiological pFl. The reaction of the iodoacetyl group with a sulfhydryl proceeds by nucleophilic substitution of iodine with a thiol producing a stable thioether linkage (see FIG. 4). Using a slight excess of the iodoacetyl group over the number of sulfhydryl groups at pFl 8.3 ensures sulfhydryl selectivity. If a large excess of iodoacetyl group is used, the iodoacetyl group can react with other amino acids. Imidazoles can react with iodoacetyl groups at pH 6.9-7.0, but the incubation must proceed for longer than one week. Histidyl side chains and amino groups react in the unproto- nated form with iodoacetyl groups above pH 5 and pH 7, respectively. In another embodiment, cross-linkers useful for sulfhydryls groups are pyridyl disulfides. Pyridyl disulfides react with sulfhydryl groups over a broad pH range (the optimal pH is 4-5) to form disulfide bonds linking XTEN to payloads (see FIG. 5). As a disulfide, conjugates prepared using these reagents are cleavable. During the reaction, a disulfide exchange occurs between the molecule's \u2014SH group and the 2-pyridyldithiol group. As a result, pyridine-2 - thione is released. These reagents can be used as crosslinkers and to introduce sulfhydryl groups into proteins. The disul\u00ad fide exchange can be performed at physiological pH, although the reaction rate is slower. [0337] The XTEN-payload conjugates comprising active synthetic peptides or polypeptides can be prepared using chemically active amino acid residues or their derivatives; e.g., the N-terminal a-amino group, the 6-amino group of lysine, a thiol group of cysteine, the carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid, a carboxyl group of aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Each peptide contains N-terminal a-amino group regardless of a primary amino acid sequence. If neces\u00ad sary, N-terminal a-amino group can be left protected/blocked upon chemical synthesis of the active peptide/polypeptide. The synthetic peptide/polypeptide may contain additional 6-amino group(s) of lysine that can be either natural or spe\u00ad cifically substituted for conjugation. As described above, a- and 6-amino groups can be selectively modified at different pH. Another approach to selectively modify either a- or 6-amino group in a synthetic peptide is a reversible protectionof amino groups with Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (BOC2). For example, selective BOC protection of vapreotide peptide (a synthetic somatostatin analog) has been achieved by modifi\u00ad cation at pH 6 (a-group protected) or pH 8.5 (e-group pro\u00ad tected) . The remaining free amino group was then specifically modified by PEG-N-hydroxysuccinimide or PEG-aldehyde. Finally, BOC protection was removed by acidic treatment to yield mono-modified peptides (Morpurgo, M. etal. Selective Alkylation and Acylation of a and e Amino Groups with PEG in a Somatostatin Analogue: Tailored Chemistry for Opti\u00ad less abundant in natu\u00ad ral peptide and protein sequences than lysines, the use of cysteines as a site for conjugation reduces the likelihood of multiple conjugations to XTEN-cross-linker molecules in a reaction. It also reduces the likelihood of peptide/protein deactivation upon conjugation. Moreoever, conjugation to cysteine sites can often be carried out in a well-defined man\u00ad ner, leading to the formation of single species XTEN poly\u00ad mer-peptide or XTEN polymer-polypeptide conjugates. In some cases cysteine may be absent in the amino acid sequence of the peptide to be conjugated. In such a case, cysteine residue can be added to the N- or C-terminus of the peptide either recombinantly or synthetically using standard methods. Alternatively, a selected amino acid can be chemi\u00ad cally or genetically modified to cysteine. As one example, serine modification to cysteine is considered a conservative mutation. Another approach to introduce a thiol group in cysteine-lacking peptides is chemical modification of the lysine 6-amino below). Once a unique thiol group is introduced in the peptide, it can be selectively modified by compounds con\u00ad such as between the XTEN polypeptide and a peptide, protein or small molecule drug payload may be achieved by a variety of linkage chemistries, including com\u00ad multifunctional cross-linker compounds, accord\u00ad ing to methods known and available in the art, such as those described, for example, inR. F. Taylor (1991) \"Protein immo\u00ad bilization. Fundamentals and Applications\", Dekker Hermansonet al. (1992) \"ImmobilizedAffin\u00ad ity Ligand Techniques\", Press, San Diego; G. T Hermanson (2008) \"Bioconjugate Techniques\", 2nd. ed. Elsevier, Inc., S. S. Wong (1991) \"Chemistry of Protein Con\u00ad jugation and Crosslinking\", CRC Press, Boca Raton. Suitable cross-linking agents for use in preparing the conjugates of the disclosure are commercially-available from companies like Sigma-Aldrich, Thermo Fisher Scientific (Pierce Protein Research Products), Invitrogen, ProteoChem, G-Bio- sciences. Preferred embodiments of cross-linkers functional group or an amino-reactive func\u00ad tional group. A list of exemplary cross-linkers is provided in Table 13. US 2015/0037359 Al spacer arms. cases where a native peptide bond is pre\u00ad ferred, the invention provides that a reaction can be carried out using zero-length cross-linkers that act via activation of a carboxylate group. In the embodiments thereof, in order to achieve reaction selectivity, the first polypeptide has to con\u00ad tain only a free C-terminal carboxyl group while all lysine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid side chains are protected and the second peptide/protein N-terminal a-amine has to be the only available unprotected amino group (requiring that any lysines, asparagines or glutamines be protected). In such cases, use of XTEN AG family sequences of Table 2 that are without glutamic acid as the first polypeptide in the XTEN- payload or XTEN-cross-linker is preferred. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides XTEN-cross-linker and XTEN-payload comprising AG XTEN sequences wherein the compositions payloads using a zero-length cross-linkers. Exemplary zero-length cross-link\u00ad ers utilized in the embodiment include but are not limited to DCC (N,N-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) and EDC (I -Ethyl-3- (3-dimethy laminopropy I) are used to directly conjugate car\u00ad boxyl functional groups of one molecule (such as a payload) to the primary amine of another molecule, such as a payload with that functional group (see FIG. 6). Sulfo-NHS (N-hy- droxysulfosuccinimide) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) are the carboxyl group to form an active O-acylisourea intermediate, allowing it to be coupled to the amino group in the reaction mixture. The O-acylisourea intermediate is unstable in aqueous solutions, making it ineffective in two- step conjugation procedures without increasing the stability of the intermediate using N-hydroxysuccinimide. This inter\u00ad mediate reacts with a primary amine to form an amide deriva\u00ad tive. The crosslinking reaction is usually performed between pH 4.5 to 5 and requires only a few minutes for many appli\u00ad cations. However, the yield of the reaction is similar at pH from 4.5 to 7.5. The hydrolysis of EDC is a competing reac\u00ad tion during coupling and is dependent on temperature, pH and buffer composition. 4-Morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) is an effective carbodiimide reaction buffer. Phos\u00ad phate buffers reduce the reaction efficiency of the EDC, but increasing the amount of EDC can compensate for the reduced efficiency. Tris, glycine and acetate buffers may not be used as conjugation buffers. [0342] The invention also provides compositions in which three XTENs are linked by trivalent cross-linkers, resulting in trimeric XTEN-cross-linker conjugates. Trimeric cross-link\u00ad ers can be created by connecting a symmetric trivalent core such as tertiary amine, trisubstituted methane or 1,3,5-trisub- benzene or a by spacers with various reac\u00ad tive side groups described in Table 14, using standard conju\u00ad gation techniques. In one embodiment, the invention provides compositions in which three XTENs are covalently linked by a trivalent cross-linker selected Tris-(succimimidyl aminotricetate) (TSAT) and TABLE 14 Trivalent Cross-linkers Trivalent Cross-linker* Trivalent Core Group core + any one of Group I + any one of Group 2 + any one o f Group 3 [0343] In other embodiments, XTEN and payloads can be conjugated using a broad group of cross-linkers, including those consisting of a spacer arm (linear or branched) and two or more reactive ends that are capable of attaching to specificfunctional groups (e.g., primary amines, sulfhydryls, etc.) on proteins or other molecules. Linear cross-linkers can be homobifunctional or heterobifunctional. Homobifunctional cross-linkers have two identical reactive groups which are used to cross-link proteins in one step reaction procedure. Non-limiting examples homobifunctional cross\u00ad linkers employed in the compositions and in the methods to create the XTEN-payload and/or XTEN-cross-linker compo\u00ad conjugates for conjugation to payloads, cross\u00ad con\u00ad trolled. As heterobifunctional cross-linkers possess two different reactive groups, their use in the compositions allows for sequential two-step conjugation. A heterobifunctional reagent is reacted with a first protein using the more labile group. In one embodiment, the conjugation of the heterobi- functional cross-linker to a reactive group in an XTEN results in an XTEN-cross-linker conjugate. After completing the reaction and removing excess unreacted cross-linker, the modified protein (such as the XTEN-cross-linker) can be added to the payload which interacts with a second reactive group of the cross-linker, resulting in an XTEN-payload con\u00ad jugate. Most commonly used heterobifunctional cross-link\u00ad ers contain an amine-reactive group at one end and a sulfhy\u00ad dryl-reactive group at the other end. Accordingly, these cross\u00ad linkers are suitable for use with cysteine- or lysine- engineered XTEN, or with the alpha-amino group of the of is a water soluble of SMCC that can be prepared in aqueous buffers up to IO mM concentration. The cyclohexane ring in the spacer arm of this cross-linker decreases the rate of hydrolysis of the maleimide group compared to similar reagents not containing this ring. This feature enables XTEN that have been maleim- ide-activated with SMCC or Sulfo-SMCC to be lyophilized and stored for later conjugation to a sulfhydryl-containing molecule. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides an XTEN-cross-linker having an XTEN having at least about 80% sequence identity, or at least about 90%, or about 91%, or about 92%, or about 93%, or about 94%, or about 95%, or about 96%, or about 97%, or about 98%, or about 99% sequence identity, or is identical to a sequence or a fragment of a sequence selected from of Table 3, when optimally aligned, wherein XTEN-cross-linker has one or more cross\u00ad linkers of sulfo-SMCC linked to the a-amino group of the XTEN or the 6-amine of a lysine-engineered XTEN. In another embodiment, the invention provides an XTEN-cross- linker having an XTEN having at least about 80% sequence identity, or at least about 90%, or about 91 %, or about 92%, or about 93%, or about 94%, or about 95%, or about 96%, or about 97%, or about 98%, or about 99% sequence identity, or is identical to a sequence or a fragment of a sequence selected from of Table 2, when optimally aligned., wherein the XTEN- cross-linker has one sulfo-SMCC linked to the amino group of the N-terminus of the XTEN. The foregoing described heterobifunctional cross-linkers conjugate two molecules via a single amine and a single cysteine. A special type of cross\u00ad linker was developed for site-specific conjugation to disulfide bridges in proteins (Balan S. et al. Site-specific PEGylation of protein disulfide bonds using a three-carbon bridge. (2007) Bioconjugate Chem. 18, 61-76; Brocchini S. et al. Disulfide bridge based PEGylation of proteins. (2008) Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 60,3-12). First, the linker is synthesized as an amine-specific 4-[2,2-bis[p-tolylsulfonyl)methyl]acetyl) benzoic acid-NHS ester. This molecule can be covalently the amino group of XTEN yielding XTEN-Bis (sulfone). Incubation of the latter molecule in 50 mM sodiumphosphate buffer, pH 7.8, will result in elimination of toluene sulfinic acid to generate XTEN-a,(3-unsaturated (I'-monosul- fone. The resulting molecule will react with a disulfide bridge-containing payload protein in a site-specific manner. In a first step the disulfide bridge is converted into two thiols by reduction. In a second step, the XTEN-monosulfone bis- alkylates two cysteines resulting in a chemically-stable three- carbon bridge. The same a,|3-unsaturated (I'-monosulfone can be used not only for conjugation to two thiol groups derived from a disulfide bridge but also for conjugation to polyhistidine tags (Cong Y. et al. Site-specific composi\u00ad the sulfo-SMCC usually performed in a two-step process. In one embodiment, the amine-containing protein is prepared in conjugation buffer of, e.g., phosphate-buffered saline (PBS=IOO mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2) or a comparable amine- and sulfhydryl-free buffer at pH 6.5-7.5. The addition of EDTA to 1-5 mM helps to chelate divalent metals, thereby reducing disulfide forma\u00ad tion in the sulfhydryl-containing protein. The concentration of the amine-containing protein determines the cross-linker molar excess to be used. In general, in protein samples of <1 mg/ml utilize an 40-80-fold molar excess, protein samples of I -4 mg/ml utilize a 20-fold molar excess, and protein samples of 5-10 mg/ml utilize a 5- to 10-fold molar excess of the cross-linker. The reaction mixture (amine-containing protein and cross-linker) is incubated for 30 minutes at room tem\u00ad perature or 2 hours at 4\u00b0 C. and then the excess cross-linker is removed using a desalting column equilibrated with conju\u00ad gation buffer. In the case of preparing a XTEN-cross-linker, the composition would be held at that point. In embodiments wherein the XTEN-cross-linker is conjugated to a payload, the sulfhydryl-containing payload and the XTEN-cross- linker conjugate are mixed in a molar ratio corresponding to that desired for the final conjugate (taking into account the number of expected cross-linkers conjugated to one or more amino groups per molecule of the XTEN) and consistent with the single sulfhydryl group that exists on the payload. The reaction mixture is incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes or 2 hours at 4\u00b0 C. Conjugation efficiency can be estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining or by appropriate analytical chromatography technique such as reverse phase HPLC or cation/anion exchange chromatogra\u00ad phy. [0347] In one embodiment, XTEN- conjugate compositions created using cross\u00ad linkers that are multivalent, resulting in compositions that have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more XTEN. In another embodiment, the invention provides XTEN-cross-linker-payload conjugate compositions created using cross-linkers that are multivalent, resulting in compositions that have 2,3,4, 5, 6 or more XTEN linked to I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more different payloads. Non\u00ad limiting moieties can be designed using a scaffold polymer, either linear or branched, for multivalent compositions. Examples are shown in FIG. 7, wherein the constructs can have any combination of homo- or heterofunctional reactive groups. O f particular interest are trimeric configurations, shown schematically in FIGS. 21-23 and 97-105, and tetrameric configurations, shown in FIGS. 21 and 105-106. Not to be bound by a par\u00ad US 2015/0037359 Al 124Feb. 5,2015 ticular theory, a XTEN linked by a trifimctional linker (with payloads linked, in turn to XTEN via incorporated lysine or cysteine residues) can utilize proportionally shorter XTEN for each \"arm\" of the construct compared to a monovalent XTEN-payload compo\u00ad sition wherein the same number of payloads linked to the incorporated cysteine or lysine or N-terminal amino residues of each XTEN, and the resulting trimeric XTEN-payload composition will have a comparable apparent molecular weight and hydrodynamic radius as the monomeric XTEN- payload composition, yet will have lower viscosity, aiding administration of the composition to the subject through small-bore needles, and will provide equal or better potency from the payloads due to reduced steric hindrance and increased flexibility of the composition compared to the monomeric XTEN-payload composition having an equiva\u00ad lent number of XTEN amino acids. [0348] In one embodiment, the invention provides a com\u00ad position comprising three XTEN linked by a trivalent cross\u00ad linker wherein a solution containing approximately 100 mg/ml of protein of the composition has a viscosity that is at least about 5 cP, or about 6 cP, or about 7 cP, or about 8 cP, or about 9 cP, or about 10 cP lowerthanthe corresponding linear XTEN of equal molecular weight and concentration. In another embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising four XTEN linked by a tetravalent cross-linker wherein a solution containing approximately 100 mg/ml of protein of the composition has a viscosity that is at least about 5 cP, or about 6 cP, or about 7 cP, or about 8 cP, or about 9 cP, or about 10 cP lower than the corresponding linear XTEN of equal molecular weight and concentration. [0349] Methods to make such compositions using the mul\u00ad tivalent cross-linkers can employ similar reaction conditions as described herein, above, while an exemplary method and supporting data are provided in the Examples, below. Addi\u00ad tionally, multivalent cross-linkers can be readily obtained by modification of lysine oligomers. For instance, the peptide Lys-Lys comprises three amino groups, one alpha-amino group and two epsilon amino groups at each Lys residue. These amino groups can be converted into many other reac\u00ad tive groups by reacting them with Bifunctional cross-linkers which have one amine-reactive group. For example the tion of Lys-Lys with DBCO-NF1S cross-linker yields a prod\u00ad uct that carries three DBCO groups. The reaction of Lys-Lys with NMal-NFlS cross linker yields product that carries three NMal groups. In similar way one can obtain tetravalent cross\u00ad linkers based on Lys-Lys-Lys and higher by using longer lysine peptides. [0350] Cross-linkers can be classified or \"heterobifunctional\" wherein homobifunc\u00ad tional cross-linkers have two or more identical reactive groups and are used in one-step reaction procedures to ran\u00ad domly link or polymerize molecules containing like func\u00ad tional groups, and heterobifunctional cross-linkers possess different reactive groups that allow for either single-step con\u00ad jugation of molecules that have the respective target func\u00ad tional groups or allow for sequential (two-step) conjugations that undesirable polymerization or self-conjuga\u00ad tion. In a preferred embodiment, where XTEN-cross-linkers are prepared and isolated as compositions for subsequent reaction, the XTEN-cross-linker is linked to a heterbifunc- tional cross-linker and has at least one reactive group avail\u00ad able for subsequent reaction.[0351] In one embodiment, the invention provides XTEN- Typically, the cleavage is effected disulfide bond reducing agents such as (3-mercaptoethanol, DTT, TCEP, however it is spe\u00ad cifically contemplated that such compositions would be cleavable endogenously in a slow-release fashion by condi\u00ad tions with endogenous reducing agents (such as cysteine and glutathione). The following non-limiting cleaved but would be expected to be cleaved endogenously such that the active payload would be released from the con\u00ad jugate. [0352] In general, the conjugation reagents described above assume that a cross-linker is reactive with the otherwise stable and inert groups such as amines, sulfhydryls and car\u00ad boxyls. In other embodiments, the invention provides a dif\u00ad ferent approach of conjugation based on separate modifica\u00ad tions of the XTEN and payload with two functional groups which are stable and inactive toward biopolymers in general yet highly reactive toward each other. Several orthogonal reactions have been grouped under the concept of click chem\u00ad istry, which provides XTEN-azide/alkyne reactants that have good stability properties and are therefor particularly suited as reagents for subsequent conjugation with payloads in a separate reaction (Kolb FI. C., Finn M. G., Sharpless K. B. Click chemistry: diverse chemical function from a few good reactions. (2001) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 40(11), 2004- 2021). Generally, click chemistry is used as a reaction con\u00ad cept which embraces reactions involving (I) alkyne-azide; (2) \"ene\"-thiol, and (3) aldehyde-hydrazide, and the inven\u00ad tion contemplates use of all three. One example is the Fluis- gen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of alkynes to azides to shown in FIG. 8. Azide and alkyne moieties can be introduced into peptide/protein or 2015/0037359 Al 125Feb. 5,2015 drug payloads or XTEN by modification N-terminal a-amino groups, 6-amino groups of lysine, and sulfhydryl groups of cysteine. Table 15 provides non-limiting examples of click chemistry reactants contemplated foruse in the making of the conjugate compositions, wherein one com\u00ad ponent of the intended conjugate (and XTEN or a payload) is reacted with a reactant I of the Table and the second compo\u00ad nent (a payload or an XTEN) is reacted with a azide reactant 2 of the Table. For example, one molecule is modified with an alkyne moiety using an alkyne such as acetylene-PEG4-Maleimide, DBCO-Maleim- ide, or DBCO-PEG4-Maleimide. used inter\u00ad changeably; they are biologically unique, stable and inert towards biological molecules and aqueous environments. When mixed, the azide and alkyne reactants form an irrevers\u00ad ible covalent bond without any side reactions (Moses J. E. and Moorhouse A. D. The growing applications of click chemis\u00ad try. (2007) Chem. Soc. Rev. 36, 1249-1262; Breinbauer R. and Kohn M. Azide-alkyne coupling: Engl. 41(14), 2596- 2599). In one embodiment, the invention provides a conju\u00ad gate comprising a first XTEN conjugated to a second XTEN wherein the first XTEN is linked to a alkyne reactant I from Table 15, the second XTEN is linked to a azide reactant 2 from Table 15, and then the first XTEN and the second XTEN are linked under conditions effective to react the alkyne reac\u00ad tant I and the azide reactant 2, resulting in the XTEN-XTEN conjugate. In another embodiment, the invention provides a conjugate comprising a first XTEN conjugated to a payload wherein the XTEN is linked to a alkyne reactant I from Table 15, the payload is linked to a azide reactant 2 from Table 15, and then the XTEN and the payload are linked under condi\u00ad tions effective to react the alkyne reactant I and the azide reactant 2, resulting in the XTEN-payload conjugate. In another embodiment, the invention provides a conjugate comprising a first XTEN conjugated to a payload wherein the XTEN is linked to a azide reactant 2 from Table 15, the payload is linked to a alkyne reactant I from Table 15, and then the XTEN and the payload are linked under conditions effective to react the alkyne reactant I and the azide reactant 2, resulting in the XTEN-payload conjugate. In the foregoing embodiments, the conditions to effect the reactions are those described herein or are reaction conditions known in the art for the conjugation of such reactants. The invention also contemplates the various combinations of the foregoing con\u00ad jugates; e.g., an XTEN-XTEN conjugate in which the XTEN are linked by click chemistry reactants and in which oneXTEN further comprises one or more molecules of a payload conjugated to the XTEN using click chemistry, an XTEN- XTEN conjugate in which the XTEN are linked by click chemistry reactants in which one XTEN further comprises one or more molecules of a first payload conjugated to the XTEN using click chemistry and the second XTEN further comprises one or more molecules of a second payload con\u00ad jugated to the XTEN using click chemistry. Additional varia\u00ad tions on these combinations will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. TABLE 15 _____________ Alkyne XTEN-payload conjugates are conjugated using thio-ene based click chemistry that proceeds by free radical reaction, termed thiol-ene reaction, or anionic reaction, termed thiol Michael addition (see FIG. 9) (Hoyle C. E. and Bowman C N Thiol-ene click chemistry. (2010) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 49, 1540-1573). It particular, is believed that thiol Michael addition is better suited for XTEN-payload conjugates wherein the payload is a protein (Pounder R. J. et. al. Metal free thiol-maleimide 'Click' reaction as a mild func\u00ad tionalisation polymers. (2008) Chem Commun (Camb). 41, 5158-5160). As at least one molecule needs to contain a free thiol group, a cysteine-engineered XTEN can be utilized if the payload does not contain cys\u00ad teine. Alternatively, the thiol group can be introduced by chemical modification of N-terminal a-amino group or the lysine 6-amino groups of either the XTEN or the in the art (Carlsson J. et al. (1978) Biochem. J. 173, 723-737; Wang D. et al. (1997) Bioconjug. Chem. 8, 878-884; Traut R. R. et al. (1973) Biochemistry 12(17), 3266-3273; Duncan, R. J. S. et. al. (1983 ) Anal. Biochem. 132. 68-73; U.S. Pat. No. 5,708, 146). The second component of thiol-Michael addition reac\u00ad tion requires a reagent with are commonly used as sulfhydryl-reactive functionalities and can be introduced into the payload protein or the XTEN molecule via N-terminal a-amino group or Lys 6-amino group modification using (N-(a-Maleimidoacetoxy)-succinimide ester), BMPS (N-((3-Maleimidopropyloxy)succinimide others described above. two molecules contain\u00ad ing free thiol and maleimide moieties, respectively, form a stable covalent bond under mild conditions, resulting in a XTEN-payload linked by maleimide. [0354] In other embodiments, XTEN-XTEN conjugates and XTEN-payload conjugates are created utilizing click chemistry based on reactions between hydrazides and alde\u00ad hydes, such as described by Ganguly et al. and as shown in FIG. 10 (Ganguly T. et al. The hydrazide/hydrazone click reaction as a biomolecule labeling strategy for M(CO)3 (M=Re, 99 mTc) radiopharmaceuticals. (2011) Chem. Com- mun. 47,12846-12848). For example, anXTEN can be modi\u00ad fied to have a hydrazine or hydrazide that is mixed with a payload having an aldehyde group to yield the desired XTEN- payload conjugate. In one embodiment, the invention pro\u00ad least or hydrazide intro\u00ad duced in either the a-N-terminal amino group or, alternatively one or more lysine 6-amino groups are modified to provide an XTEN suitable as a reagent for conjugation to a target payload as it is considered to be stable. The resulting bis-arylhydrazones formed from aromatic hydrazines and aromatic aldehydes are stable to 92\u00b0 C. and a wide range of pTl values from 2.0-10.0 (Solulink, Inc., Protein-Protein Con\u00ad jugation Kit, Technical Manual, Catalog # S-9010-1). The leaving group in the reaction is water and no reducing agents (e.g., sodium cyanoborohydride) are required to stabilize the bond. Molecules modified with either hydrazine/hydrazide or aldehyde moieties have good stability in aqueous environ\u00ad ments and remain active without special handling require\u00ad ments. The amino group(s) of the XTEN reaction, a protein is prepared as 1-5 mg/ml solution in modification buffer (100 mM Phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pFl 7.4) and the modifying agent is added in a 5- to 20-fold molar excess and the reaction is carried out for 2 hrs at room temperature. Separately, the payload molecule is modified with NFIS-ester/aldehyde SFB (succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate) or C6-SFB (C6-Succinimidyl 4-formyl- benzoate) under conditions. Both modified molecules are then desalted into conjugation buffer (100 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pFl 6.0). The resulting components are mixed together using I mole equivalent of a limiting protein and 1.5-2 mole equivalents of a protein that can be used in abun\u00addance. A catalyst buffer of 100 mM aniline in 100 mM phos\u00ad phate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0 is added to adjust the final concentration of aniline to 10 mM and the reaction is carried out for 2 hrs at room temperature. [0355] In another embodiment, the XTEN-payload conju\u00ad gate can be produced by reaction between an aldehyde and primary amino group followed by reduction of the formed Schiff base with sodium borohydride or cyanoborohydride. As a first step in the method, an XTEN molecule, such as XTEN with a primary a-amino group or Lys-containing XTEN with an 6-amino in an coupling buffer such as 0.1M sodium phosphate, 0.15M NaCl, pH 7.2. The resulting modified alde- hyde-XTEN can either be held at this point as an XTEN- cross-linker composition or can be used as a reagent to create an XTEN-payload conjugate. To make the XTEN-payload, the modified aldehyde-XTEN is mixed with a payload with a reactive amino-group and a mild reducing agent such as 20-100 mM sodium cyanoborohydride. The reaction mixture is incubated up to 6 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Umeacted aldehyde groups are then blocked with 50-500 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.4 and 20-100 mM sodium cyanoborohydride, permitting separation of the conjugated purified XTEN-payload. [0356] In other embodiments, the invention provides XTEN-payload conjugates comprising peptides or protein payloads wherein the payload is conjugated via chemical ligation based the reactivity of the peptide/protein C-ter- minal acyl azide of the payload. As an example, when the peptide or protein is produced using solid-phase peptide syn\u00ad thesis (SPPS) with hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (HMBA) resin, the final peptide can be cleaved from the resin by a variety of nucleophilic reagents to give access to peptides with diverse C-terminal functionalities. In one embodiment, the method includes hydrazinolysis of the peptidyl/protein resins to yield peptide or protein hydrazides. Nitrosation nitrite in acid then azides. The resulting carbonyl azide (or acyl azide) is an activated carboxylate group (esters) that can react with a primary amine of an XTEN to form a stable amide bond, resulting in the XTEN-payload conjugate. In alternative embodiments, the primary amine could be the a-amine of the XTEN N-terminus or one or more 6-amine of engineered lysine residues in the XTEN sequence. In the conjugation reaction, the azide function is the leaving group, shown in FIG. 11. The conjugation reaction with the amine groups occurs by attack of the nucleophile at the electron-deficient carbonyl group (Meienhofer, J. (1979) The Peptides: Analy\u00ad sis, Synthesis, Biology. Vol. I, Academic Press: N.Y.; ten Kortenaar P B. W. et. al. Semisynthesis of horse heart cyto\u00ad chrome c analogues from two or three fragments. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 8279-8283) [0357] In embodiments, the invention provides XTEN-cross-linker and XTEN-payload conjugates in which the conjugation is performed by orthogonal protein ligation in which an initial chemoselective capture is followed by an intramolecular acyl rearrangement, as shown in FIG. 12. The chemo selective capture requires a nucleophile or electrophile proximally placed at spe\u00ad cifically contemplated that the XTEN can serve as either Proteinl or Protein2 in FIG. 12. Thus, in alternative embodi\u00ad ments, the XTEN can be reacted with appropriate reagents to produce the thioester on the C-terminus or introduce a cys\u00ad teine on the N-terminus to produce alternative In using the XTEN-cross- linker conjugates make the XTEN-payload, the chemoselective of the nucleophile and electrophile pair forming an ester or a thioester brings the N-terminal amino group and C-terminal ester of the respective reactants into such a close proximity to permit a spontaneous intramo\u00ad lecular acyl transfer to form an amide bond. Most orthogonal ligation reactions do not require protection of side-chain groups and take place under mild conditions that are compat\u00ad ible with biological environments (Tam J. P, Xu J., Eom K. D. Methods and strategies of peptide ligation. (2001) Biopoly\u00ad mers (Peptide the conjugates can be cre\u00ad ated by a method reaction known as Native Chemical Liga\u00ad tion (NCL) involving a C-terminal N-terminal cysteine as a nucleophile. The result of this reaction is a native amide bond at the ligation site of the XTEN-payload conjugate (Dawson P E., Muir T. W., Clark- Lewis I., Kent S. B. Synthesis of proteins by native chemical ligation. (1994) Science 266, 776-779; Tam J. P; LuY. A.; Liu C. F.; Shao, J. Peptide synthesis using unprotected peptides through orthogonal coupling methods. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 92,12485-12489; Johnson, E. C. B.; Kent, S. B. FI. J. Insights into the mechanism and catalysis of the native chemical ligation reaction. (2006) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 6640-6646; Kent S. B. (2009) Total chemical synthesis of proteins. (2009) Chem. Soc. Rev. 38:338-351). The first amino acid of the C-terminal component in NCL reaction (shown as Protein2 in FIG. 12) is cysteine. Such a protein can be XTEN with cysteine in the first position or any other protein prepared by conventional recombinant protein bio\u00ad synthesis, including a peptide/protein payload. The N-termi- nal component (shown as Payload in FIG. 13) is prepared as C-terminal thioester by chemical synthesis. Examples of thioester synthesis methods are known and available in the art, such as those described, for example, in Li X., Kawakami T., Aimoto S., Direct preparation of peptide thioesters method. of peptide C-terminal thioesters by Fmoc/tBu 11374); Int. Ed. 40, J., Albericio F., Jensen K. J., peptide thioesters by (2005) Org. Lett., 7, 2647-2650. Usually, a-alkylth- ioesters are preferred because of ease of preparation and storage. However, because they are rather unreactive, the ligation reaction is catalyzed by in situ transthioesterification with thiol additives, with the common is typi\u00ad cally complete in few hours and with high yields. While all 20 natural amino acids are suitable as the last residue of N-ter-minal component, the highest ligation rates were reported for glycine and histidine, making XTEN particularly suited for this reaction as the exemplary XTEN of Table 2 are nearly all glycine N-terminal polypeptides (Hackeng T. M. et al. Pro\u00ad tein synthesis by native chemical ligation: expanded scope by using straightforward methodology. (1 999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 10068-10073). In Y. A.; Liu C. E; Shao, J. Peptide synthesis using unprotected peptides through orthogonal coupling methods. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Cys- perthioester (Liu, Lett., 37, 933-936); (3) C-terminal thioester P, Yu Q. Methionine ligation strategy in the biomimetic synthesis of C-terminal thioacid Tam J. P (1997) Tetrahedron. Lett. 38, 3-6). In the method, the preparation of C-terminal thioesters by chemical synthesis constrains the size of N-ter- minal component in NCL reaction. However, use of expressed protein ligation (EPL) methodology overcomes size limitations of peptide a-thioester imposed by the need of chemical synthesis (Muir T. W.; Sondhi D.; Cole P A. Expressed protein ligation: a method for protein engi\u00ad neering. (1998) Proc. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 6705-6710; T. W. Semisynthesis of proteins by expressed protein ligation. (2003) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 72, 249-289). The EPL method is based on protein splicing, the process in which a protein undergoes an intramolecular rearrangement resulting in the extrusion of an internal sequence (intein) and the join\u00ad ing of the lateral sequences (exteins). The latter process involves a formation of ester or thioester intermediates. In practicing the invention, the commercially available Escheri\u00ad chia coli protein expression vectors allows one to produce proteins of interest, such as XTEN, expressed in frame fused with an intein-chitin binding domain (CBD) sequence. In the method, the fused protein undergoes an N\u2014S shift when the side chain of the first cysteine residue of the intein portion of the precursor protein nucleophilically attacks the peptide bond of the residue immediately upstream (that is, for example, the final residue of XTEN) to form a linear thioester intermediate, as shown in FIG. 13. The chemical ligation step is initiated by incubating the protein with thiophenol (or other thiol catalysts such as MESNa and MPAA) and a cysteine- containing synthetic peptide or protein. This results in the in situ generation of a highly reactive phenyl a-thioester deriva\u00ad tive of, for example, the XTEN protein that then rapidly ligates with the synthetic peptide/protein payload to result in the desired XTEN-payload conjugate. In another embodi\u00ad ment, an XTEN-thioester intermediate can be cleaved by 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNa) in 20 mM Na- HEPES, pH 8.5, 50-1000 mM NaCl, and I mM EDTA (op\u00ad tional) and the resulting MESNa-tagged protein can be puri\u00ad fied and stored -80\u00b0 C. in 5 mM Bis Tris, pH 6.5, 250 mM NaCl until use as an XTEN-cross-linker conjugate for NCL reaction as the N-terminal component in the above described conjugation. The C-terminal component can be a payload with either a natural or synthetic peptide/protein with an N-terminal cysteine. [0359] In yet other embodiments, the invention provides XTEN-cross-linker and XTEN-payload conjugates in which the conjugation between the XTEN and payload is performed US 2015/0037359 Al 128Feb. resulting in a native amide bond at the ligation site. In an advantage to the method, a cysteine is not required at the ligation juncture (Saxon, E.; Armstrong, C. R.; Ber- a 2, 1939-1941). Instead, a C-terminal thioester using diphe- nylphosphinemethanethiol (see FIG. 14), while a C-terminal Protein 2 is prepared as an N-terminal azide that can be generated via a diazo-transfer reaction (Cavender C. J.; Shiner V. J., Jr. (1972) J Org. Chem. 22, 3567-3569; Lun- dquist J. T., IV, Pelletier J. C. Improved solid-phase peptide synthesis method utilizing alpha-azide-protected amino acids. (2001) Org. Lett. 3, 781-783). A phosphine residue reacts with the azide of Protein2 to form an iminophospho- rane after elimination of nitrogen (Staudinger reaction). The resulting iminophosphorane with its highly nucleophilic nitrogen atom can also be regarded as an aza-ylide. The nucleophilic nitrogen atom of the aza-ylide then attacks the carbonyl group of Proteinl, cleaving the thioester. It is spe\u00ad cifically intended that either XTEN or the payload can be either Proteinl or Protein2 in this reaction. Eiydrolysis of the rearranged XTEN-payload product finally produces a native amide and liberates phosphine component as liga\u00ad tion and integration with Protein Ligation. (2007) JAm. Chem. Soc., 129, 1142111-430). [0360] In another embodiment, the invention provides XTEN-payload by enzymatic ligation. Transglutaminases are enzymes that catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the y-carboxamide group of glutamine of a payload peptide or protein and the 6-amino group of a lysine in a lysine-engineered XTEN, ating inter- or intramolecular cross-links between the XTEN and payload (see FIG. 15), resulting in the composition (Lo- rand L, Comad S. M. Transglutaminases. (1984) Mol. Cell Biochem. 58(1-2), 9-35). Non-limiting examples of enzymes that have been successfully used for ligations are factor XIIIa (Schense J. C., transglutaminase P B. modification transglutami\u00ad Bioconjug. Chem. 14(4), 748-755; Davis N. E., Karfeld-Sulzer L. S., Ding S., Barron A. E. Synthesis and characterization of a new class of cationic protein polymers for multivalent display and biomaterial 1125-1134). The glutamine sub\u00ad strate sequence GQQQL is known to have high specificity toward tissue transglutaminase (Flu B. H., Messersmith P B. Rational design of transglutaminase substrate peptides for rapid enzymatic formation of hydrogels. (2003) J.Am. Chem. Soc. 125(47), 14298-14299). Tissue transglutaminase sequence specificity was less stringent for an acyl acceptor (lysine) than for acyl donor (glutamine) (Greenberg C. Birckbichler P J., Rice R. H. Transglutaminases: multifunc\u00adtional cross-linking enzymes that stabilize tissues. (1991) FASEB J. 1991, 5, 3071-3077). [0361] In an alternative embodiment of an composition, the sortase A transpep\u00ad tidase enzyme Staphylococcus aureus is used to cata\u00ad lyze the cleavage of a short 5-amino acid recognition sequence LPXTG between the threonine and glycine residues of Proteinl, and transfers the acyl-fragment to anN-terminal oligoglycine nucleophile of Proteinl (see FIG. functionalizing the Protein2 to contain the oligogly\u00ad cine, it is possible to enzymatically conjugate the two proteins in a site-specific fashion to result in the desired XTEN-pay\u00ad load composition. The (poly)peptide bearing the sortase rec\u00ad ognition site (LPXTG) can be readily made using standard molecular biology cloning protocols. It is convenient to intro\u00ad duce glutamic acid in the X position of the recognition site, as this residue is commonly found in natural substrates of sor\u00ad tase A (Boekhorst J., de Been M. W., Kleerebezem M., Siezen R. J. Genome-wide detection and analysis of cell wall-bound proteins with LPxTG-Iike sorting motifs. (2005) J. Bacteriol. 187, 4928-4934). A high level of transacylation can be achieved by placing the sortase cleavage site both at the C-terminus of the substrate (Popp M. W., Antos J. M., Gro- tenbreg G. E., Ploegh H. L. Sortagging: A ver\u00ad satile method for protein labeling. (2007) Nat. Chem. Biol. 311,707-708) and in flexible loops (Popp M. W., Artavanis- Tsakonas K., Ploegh H. L. Substrate filtering by the active- site crossover loop in UCF1L3 revealed by sortagging and gain-of-function mutations. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284(6), 3593-3602). For proteins labeled at the C-terminus, it is important that the glycine in the minimal LPETG tag is not placed at the C-terminus; it must be in a peptide linkage with at least one further C-terminal amino acid. In addition, better linkage is achieved by adding an extra glycine to the C-ter- minus of the cleavage site to LPETGG WolfY., Kraetke T., Yamamoto T., Tsukiji S., Nagamune T. Site- specific protein modification on living cells catalyzed by sortase. (2008) Chembiochem 95, 802-807). Nucleophiles compatible with sortase-mediated transpeptidation have the single structural requirement of a stretch of glycine residues with a free amino terminus. Successful transpeptidation can be achieved with nucleophiles containing anywhere from one to five glycines; however, in a preferred embodiment, a maxi\u00ad mum reaction rate is obtained when two or three glycines are present. [0362] While the various embodiments of conjugation chemistry have been described in terms of protein-protein conjugations, it is specifically intended that in practicing the invention, the payload moiety of the XTEN-payload conju\u00ad gates can be a small molecule drug in those conjugation methods applicable to functional groups like amines, sulfhy- dryls, carboxyl that are present in the target small molecule drugs. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that one can apply even more broad chemical techniques compared to protein and peptides whose functionalities are usually limited to amino, sulfhydryl and carboxyl groups. Drug payloads can be conjugated to the XTEN through func\u00ad tional groups including, but not limited conjugated to XTEN-cross-linker conjugates using a het\u00ad erocycle ring system in which one or more ring atoms is a heteroatom, e.g. a nitrogen, an oxygen, a phosphorus or a sulfur atom. The heterocycle group comprises at least I to as many as 20 carbon atoms and I to 3 heteroatoms selected from N, O, P, and S. In the embodiment, the heterocycle may be a monocycle having 3 to 7 ring members (2 to 6 carbon atoms and I to 3 heteroatoms selected from N, O, P, and S) or a bicycle having 7 to 10 ring members (4 to 9 carbon atoms and I to 3 heteroatoms selected from N, O, P, and S), for example: a bicyclo[4,5], [5,5], [5,6], or [6,6] system. Hetero\u00ad Leo A. \"Principles of Mod\u00ad em Heterocyclic Chemistry\", W. A. Benjamin, New York, (1968); \"The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, A series of Monographs\" (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1950 to present), in particular Volumes 13, 14, 16, 19, and 28. Non-limiting examples of heterocycles that may be found in XTEN-payload conju\u00ad gates with dmgs as the payload, the drug molecules are attached to lysine- or cysteine engineered XTEN (such as the sequences of Table 3) by cross-linkers having two reactive sites for binding to the dmg and the XTEN. Preferred cross\u00ad linker groups are those that are relatively stable to hydrolysis in the circulation, are biodegradable and are nontoxic when cleaved from the conjugate. In addition, the use of cross\u00ad linkers can provide the potential for conjugates with an even greater flexibility between the dmg and the XTEN, or provide sufficient space between the dmg and the XTEN such that the XTEN does not interfere with the binding between the phar\u00ad macophore and its binding site. In one embodiment, a cross\u00ad linker has a reactive site that has an electrophilic group that isreactive to a nucleophilic group of a lysine- or cysteine-engineered XTEN is reactive to an electrophilic group on a cross-linker and forms a covalent bond to the cross-linker unit, resulting in an XTEN-cross-linker conju\u00ad gate. Useful electrophilic groups for cross-linkers include, but are not limited to, maleimide and haloacetamide groups, and provide a convenient site for attachment to the XTEN. In another embodiment, a cross-linker has a reactive site that has a nucleophilic group that is reactive to an electrophilic group present on a dmg such that a conjugation can occur between the XTEN-cross-linker and the payload dmg, resulting in an XTEN-dmg conjugate. Useful electrophilic groups on a dmg include, a nucleophilic group of a cross-linker can react with an electrophilic group on a dmg and form a covalent bond. Useful nucleophilic groups on a cross-linker include, but are not limited dmg provides a conve\u00ad nient site for attachment to a cross-linker. [0365] In a particular embodiment, the conjugation of dmgs to the lysine epsilon amino group of a subject lysine- engineered XTEN use of a residues of the subject lysine-engineered XTEN may be used to introduce free sulfhydryl groups through reaction with 2-iminothi- olane. Alternatively, targeting substance lysines of subject lysine-engineered XTEN may be linked to a heterobifunc\u00ad tional reagent having a free hydrazide or aldehyde with agent. esters can conjugate at physiological pH, but less reactive derivatives typically require higher pH values. Low tempera\u00ad tures may also be employed if a labile protein payload is being used. Under low temperature conditions, a longer reaction time may be used for the conjugation reaction. [0366] In another particular embodiment, the invention provides XTEN-payload conjugates with an amino group conjugation with lysine residues of a subject lysine-engi\u00ad neered XTEN wherein the conjugation is facilitated by the difference between the pKa values of the a-amino group of theN-terminal amino acid (approximately 7.6 to 8.0) andpKa of the 6-amino group of lysine (approximately 10). Conjuga\u00ad tion of the terminal amino group often employs reactive drug- aldehydes (such as dmg-propionaldehyde or dmg-butylalde- hyde), which are more selective for amines and thus are less likely to react with, for example, the imidazole group of histidine. In addition, amino residues are reacted with suc\u00ad cinic or other carboxylic imidazole carbamate or p-nitrophe- nyl carbonate, respectively. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Conjugation of a drug-aldehyde to the terminal amino group of a subject XTEN typically takes place in a suitable buffer performed at a pH which allows one to take advantage of the pKa differences between the 6-amino groups of the lysine residues and that of the a-amino group of the N-terminal residue of the protein. In the method of the embodiment, the US 2015/0037359 Al 130Feb. 5,2015 reaction for coupling uses a pH in the range of from about pH 7 up to about 8. Useful methods for conjugation of the lysine epsilon amino group have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,904,584 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,048,720. [0367] The person with ordinary skill in the art will be aware that the activation method and/or conjugation chemis\u00ad try to be used in the creation of the XTEN-payload conjugates depends on the reactive groups of the XTEN polypeptide as well as the functional groups of the drug moiety (e.g., being amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, aldehyde, sulfhydryl, the drug-cross- linker reactant, or the functional group of the XTEN-cross- linker reactant. The drug conjugation may be directed towards conjugation to all available attachment groups on the engineered XTEN polypeptide such as the specific engi\u00ad neered attachment groups on the incorporated cysteine resi\u00ad dues or lysine residues. In order to control the reactants such that the conjugation is directed to the appropriate reactive site, the invention contemplates the use of protective groups dur\u00ad ing the conjugation reaction. A \"protecting group\" is a moiety that prevents or blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending upon the type of chemically reactive group being protected as well as the reaction conditions to be employed, as well as the presence of additional reactive groups in the molecule. Non\u00ad limiting examples of functional groups which may be pro\u00ad tected include carboxylic acid groups, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, thiol groups, and carbonyl groups. Represen\u00ad tative protecting groups for carboxylic acids (such as a p-methoxybenzyl ester), amides groups, acetals and ketals; and the like. Such protecting groups are well-known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, ThirdEdition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein. The conjugation may be achieved in one step or in a stepwise manner (e.g., as described in WO 99/55377), such as through addition of a reaction intermediate cross-linker, using the cross-linkers disclosed herein or those known in the art to be useful for conjugation to cysteine or lysine residues of polypeptides to be linked to reactive functional groups on drug molecules. [0368] In some embodiments of the invention, the method for conjugating a cross-linker to a cysteine-engineered XTEN may provide that the XTEN is pre-treated with a reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) to reduce any cysteine to nucleophilic cysteine thiol groups (\u2014CH2SH). The reducing agent is subsequently removed by any conventional method, such as by desalting. The reduced XTEN thus reacts with drug-linker compounds, or cross-linker reagents, functional groups such as maleimide or a-halo carbonyl, according to, for example, the conjugation method of Klussman et al. (2004) Bioconjugate Chemistry 15(4), 765-773. Conjugation of a cross-linker or a drug to a cysteine residue typically takes place in a suitable buffer at pH 6-9 at temperatures varying from 4\u00b0 C. to 25\u00b0 C. for periods up to about 16 hours. Alter\u00ad natively, the cysteine residues can be derivatized. Suitable derivatizing agents and methods are well known in the art. For example, cysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with a-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as iodoace-tic acid or iodoacetamide, to give carboxymethyl or car- boxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are instances, the conjugation is performed under conditions aiming at reacting as many of the available XTEN attachment groups as possible with drug or drug- linker molecules. This is achieved by means of a suitable molar excess of the drug in relation to the polypeptide. Typi\u00ad cal molar ratios of activated drug or drug-linker molecules to polypeptide are up to about 1000-1, such as up to about 200-1 or up to about 100-1. In some cases, the ratio may be some\u00ad what lower, however, such as up to about 50-1, 10-1 or 5-1. Equimolar ratios also may be used. [0370] In the embodiments, the XTEN-payload conjugates of the disclosure retain at least a portion of the pharmacologic activity compared to the corresponding payload not linked to XTEN. In one embodiment, the XTEN-payload retains at least about 1%, or at least about 5%, or at least about 10%, or at least about 20%, or at least about 30%, or at least about 40%, or at least about 50%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95% of the pharmacologic activity of the payload not linked to XTEN. [0371] In one embodiment, XTEN-payload conjugates can be designed to release the payload in the body by unspecific or enzymatic hydrolysis of the linker, including disulfide by exogenous or endog\u00ad enous proteases, including the proteases of Table 9. Macro\u00ad molecules can be taken up by the cell either through receptor- mediated endocytosis, adsorptive endocytosis or fluid phase endocytosis (Jain R. K. Transport of molecules across tumor vasculature. (1987) Cancer Metastasis Rev. 6(4), 559-593; Jain R. K. Transport of molecules, particles, and cells in solid tumors. (1999) Ann. Rev. Biomed. Eng. I, 241-263; Mukher- jee S., Ghosh R. N., Maxfield F. R. Endocytosis. (1997) Physiol. Rev. 77(3), 759-803). Upon cellular uptake of XTEN-payload, the payload can be released by low pH values in endosomes (pH 5.0-6.5) and lysosomes (pH 4.5-5.0), as well as by lysosomal enzymes (e.g., Example of acid-sensitive cross-linker carri\u00ad ers. The hydrazone linker is rapidly cleaved at pH values <5 allowing a release of the payload in the acidic pH of endo\u00ad somes and lysosomes following internalization of the conju\u00ad gate (Trail R A. et al. Effect of linker variation on the stability, potency, and efficacy of carcinoma-reactive BR64-doxorubi- cin immunoconjugates. (1997) Cancer Res. 57(1), 100-105; Kratz E et al. Acute and repeat-dose toxicity studies of the (6-maleimidocaproyl)hydrazone derivative of doxorubicin albumin-binding mAh P67.6 against to the cytotoxic antibiotic agent cali- cheamicin. The linker between the antibody and the drug incorporates two labile bonds: a hydrazone and a sterically hindered disulfide. It has been shown that the acid-sensitive hydrazone bond is the actual cleavage site (Jaracz S., Chen J., US 2015/0037359 Al 131Feb. 5,2015 Kuznetsova L. V., Ojima I. in drug conjugates. [0372] For those XTEN-payload conjugates in which the payload is linked by a disulfide bond, the payload can be released from XTEN by reduction of disulfide bond within the labile linker. For example, huN901-DMl tumor- activated immunotherapeutic prodrug developed by Immu- noGen, Inc. for the treatment of small cell lung cancer. The prodrug consists of humanized anti-CD56 mAh (huN901) conjugated with maytansinoid l. An average of 3.5-3.9 molecules of DMl are bound to each antibody via hindered disulfide bonds. Although the disulfide link is stable in blood, it is cleaved rapidly on entering the cell targeted by huM901, thus releasing active DMl (Smith S. Pharmaceuticals MLN-591, an anti- prostate-specific membrane antigen mAh. DMl is linked to the antibody via a hindered disulfide bond that provides serum stability at the same time as allowing intracellular drug release on internalization (Henry M. D. et al. A prostate- specific membrane antigen-taigeted monoclonal antibody- chemotherapeutic conjugate designed for the treatment of prostate cancer. (2004) Cancer Res. 64(21), 7995-8001). [0373] Release of the payload from the carrier XTEN can be achieved by creating compositions using short cleavable peptides as linkers between the payload and XTEN. Example of the conjugate assessed clinically is doxorubicin-HPMA (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) conjugate in which doxorubicin is linked through its amino sugar to the HPMA copolymer via a tetrapeptide spacer proteases, such as cathepsin B (Vasey P A. et al. Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of PKl [N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer doxorubi\u00ad cin] : agents- drug-polymer conjugates. (1999) carrier-drug conjugates with pep\u00ad tide linkers that reached clinical stage of development are macromolecular platinum complexes. Two HPMA-based drug candidates consisted of a HPMA copolymer backbone to which the complexing et al.

Synthesis and [0374] A highly selective method was developed to target prostate cancer via prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protease which is almost exclusively expressed in prostate tissue and prostate carcinomas. A and was bound to endogenous and exogenous albumin. Albumin- bound form of the prodrug was cleaved by PSA releasing the paclitaxel-dipeptide Ser-Leu-PABC-paclitaxel. theincorporation of a PABC self-eliminating linker, this dipep\u00ad tide was rapidly degraded to liberate paclitaxel as a final cleavage product (Elsadek B. et al. Development of a novel prodrug of paclitaxel that is cleaved by prostate-specific anti\u00ad gen: an in vitro and in vivo evaluation (2010) Eur. J. Cancer 46(18), 3434-3444). [0375] Self-immolative spacers have gained significant interest due to their utility in prodrug delivery systems. Sev\u00ad eral reports described linear self-eliminating systems or den- drimeric structures which can release all of their units through a domino-like chain fragmentation, initiated by a single cleavage event (Haba K, et al. Single-triggered trimeric pro\u00ad drugs. Int. Ed. 44, Shabat D. Self-immolative dendrimers as novel drug delivery plat\u00ad forms. (200 6) J Polym. Sci., Part 44, 1569- 1578. a building block for oligomers with self-eliminating and multiple release properties. (2008)/. Org. Chem. 73, 1546- 1552; Sagi A. et al. Self-immolative polymers. (2008) J. Soc. 130, 5434-5435). Inone study, a self-immolative dendritic prodrug with four molecules the anticancer agent camptothecin and two molecules of PEG5000 was designed and synthesized. The prodmg was effectively activated by penicillin-G-amidase under physiological conditions and free camptothecin was released to the reaction media to cause cell-growth inhibition (Gopin A. et chemistry. (2006) Bioconjugate Chem. 17, 1432-1440). Incorporation of a specific enzymatic substrate, cleaved by a protease that is overexpressed in tumor cells, could generate highly efficient cancer-cell-specific activa\u00ad cleavable by proteases are listed in Table 9. [0376] In some embodiments, the invention provides XTEN-payload configurations, including dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric and higher order conjugates in which the payload is attached to the XTEN using a labile linker as described herein, above. In one embodiment of the foregoing, the com\u00ad position further includes a targeting component to deliver the composition to a ligand or receptor on a targeted cell. In another embodiment, the invention provides conjugates in which one, two, three, or four XTEN-payload compositions are conjugated with labile linkers to antibodies or antibody fragments, providing soluble compositions for use in targeted therapy of clinical indications such as, but not limited to, various treatment of tumors and other cancers wherein the antibody provides the targeting component and then, when internalized within the target cell, the labile linker permits the XTEN-payload to disassociate from the composition and effect the intended activity (e.g, cytotoxicity in a tumor cell). Hence, the inventive compositions are a type of immunocon- jugate. [0377] The unstructured characteristics and uniform com\u00ad position and charge of XTEN result in properties that can be exploited for purification of XTEN-payload conjugates fol\u00ad lowing a conjugation reaction. Of particular utility is the capture of XTEN conjugates by ion exchange, which allows the removal of un-reacted payload and payload derivatives. Of particular utility is the capture of conjugates by hydropho\u00ad bic interaction chromatography (HIC). Due to their Al 132Feb. 5,2015 philic nature, most XTEN polypeptides show low binding to HIC resins, which facilitates the capture of XTEN-payload conjugates due to hydrophobic interactions between the pay- load and the column material, and their separation from un\u00ad conjugated XTEN that failed to conjugate to the payload during the conjugation process. The high purity of XTEN and XTEN-payload conjugates offers a significant benefit com\u00ad pared to most chemical or natural polymers, particularly pegylated payloads. Most chemical and natural poylmers are produced by random- or semi-random polymerization, which results in the generation of many homologs. Such polymers can be fractionated by various methods to increase fraction of the target entity in the product. However, even after enrich\u00ad ment most preparations of natural polymers and their payload conjugates contain less than 10% target entity. Examples of PEG conjugates with G-CSF have been described in [Bagal, D., et al. (2008) Anal Chem, 80: 2408-18]. This publication shows that even a PEG conjugate that is approved for thera\u00ad peutic use contains more than 100 homologs that occur with a concentration of at least 10% of the target entity. [0378] The complexity of random polymers, such as PEG, is a significant impediment for the monitoring and quality control during conjugation and purification. In contrast, XTEN purified by the methods described herein have high levels of purity and uniformity. In addition, the conjugates created as described herein routinely contain target and in the intended con\u00ad figuration, resulting in easy to interpret mass spectra and chromatograms. [0379] 2.

[0389] 3. Dimeric, [0390] In one aspect, the invention provides conjugates wherein different numbers of XTEN or XTEN-payload con\u00ad jugation partners are joined multimeric.

In another embodiment, the bivalent conjugate comprises one, or two, or three, or four, or five molecules of a first payload and a single molecule of a second payload linked to the cysteine-lysine- engineered XTEN by linkers. In another embodiment, the bivalent conjugate comprises one, or two, or three, or four, or five molecules of a first payload and one, or two, or three, or four, or five molecules of a second payload linked to the cysteine-lysine-engineered XTEN by linkers. [0406] In another embodiment, the bivalent conjugate is created by reacting the cysteine- and lysine- engineered XTEN, such as those of Table 3, with a first linker appropriate for reaction with the cysteine-engineered XTEN, followed by a second reaction with a linker appropriate for reaction with the lysine-engineered XTEN, then reacting the XTEN-crosslinker backbone with a first payload with a thiol reactive group capable of reacting with the first linker, fol\u00ad lowed by a reaction of a second payload with an amino group capable of reacting with the second cross-linker, resulting in the final product. [0407] 6. XTEN-Cross-Linker and XTEN-Payload Conju\u00ad gates with Spacer and Release Groups [0408] In another aspect, the invention provides XTEN- crosslinker and XTEN-payload conjugates configured with one or more spacers incorporated into or adjacent to the XTEN that are designed to incorporate or enhance a function\u00ad ality or property to the composition, or as an aid in the assem\u00ad bly or manufacture of the compositions. Such properties include, but are not limited to, inclusion of a sequence capable of being proteolytically cleaved or a labile functional group to permit release of the payload, or a spacer can be introduced between an XTEN sequence and a payload component to decrease steric hindrance such that the payload component may interact appropriately with its target ligand. [0409] In one embodiment, the one or more spacers are incorporated into the linkers of the subject conjugates. For spacers and methods of identifying desirable spacers, see, for example, George, et al. (2003) Protein Engineering 15:871- 879, specifically incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment, the spacer comprises one or more peptide sequences that are between 1-50 amino acid residues in length, or about 1-25 residues, or about 1-10 residues in length. Spacer sequences, exclusive of cleavage sites, can comprise any of the 20 natural L-amino acids, and will pref\u00ad erably have XTEN-Iike properties in that the majority of residues will be hydrophilic amino acids that are sterically US 2015/0037359 Al 140Feb. 5,2015 unhindered. The spacer can be polyglycines or polyalanines, or is predominately a mixture of combinations of glycine, serine and alanine residues. In one embodiment, the spacer sequence is a sequence from Table 15. In another embodi\u00ad ment, the spacer sequence is GPEGPS. [0410] In addition, spacer sequences are designed to avoid the introduction of T-cell epitopes which can, in part, be achieved by avoiding or limiting the number of hydrophobic amino acids utilized in the spacer; the determination of epitopes is described above and in the Examples. [0411] In one embodiment, the spacer comprises a release group that permits the release of the payload from the conju\u00ad gate. In another embodiment, the cross-linker comprises a release group that permits the release of the payload from the conjugate. The release group may be any labile group provid\u00ad ing for such a releasable attachment. In one embodiment, the release group is a chemically cleavable linkage or labile chemical linkage. Such linkages may typically be cleaved by methods that are well known to those of skill in the art, such as by acid, base, oxidation, reduction, displacement or elimi\u00ad nation. In a particular embodiment, the chemistry cleavable linkage comprises a modified base, a modified sugar, a disul\u00ad fide bond, a chemically cleavable group incorporated into the cross-linker or spacer. Some examples of these linkages are described in PCT WO 96/37630 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,132,519, incorporated herein by reference. Release groups encom\u00ad passed by the invention also include groups or linkages cleav\u00ad able by an enzyme. Enzymatically-cleavable release groups include phosphodiester or amide linkages as well as restric\u00ad tion endonuclease recognition sites. In one embodiment, the invention provides compositions comprising one or more payloads in which a cleavable linker of valine-citrulline is between the payload and the XTEN, permitting cleavage by cathepsin when the composition is internalized intracellu- larly; e.g., inside a tumour cell. In another embodiment, release groups are cleavable by nucleases. These nucleases may typically be an exonuclease or a restriction endonu\u00ad clease. Typical exonucleases include exonucleases specific for both double-stranded and single-stranded polynucleic acids. Additionally, restriction endonucleases encompassed by certain embodiments include Type HS and Type II restric\u00ad tion endonucleases. In other embodiments the release group may be a sequence that is cleavable by a protease, wherein the sequence is selected from the sequences set fort in Table 9. Typical proteases acting on sequences suitable for inclusion in the inventive compositions include endoproteinases, including the proteinases of Table 9. [0412] 7. Libraries of XTEN-Payload Configurations [0413] In another aspect, the invention provides libraries of XTEN-payload precursors, methods to make the libraries, and methods to combine the library precursors in a combina\u00ad torial approach, as illustrated in FIGS. 34-35, to achieve optimal combinations of, as well as the optimal ratio of pay- loads. In one embodiment, the invention provides a library of individual XTEN each linked to I, or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 8, or 9, or 10 or more or more molecules of a given payload, including those described herein, to create the library of XTEN-payload precursors. In the method, a series of XTEN-payload precursors to be linked are further conju\u00ad gated to a linker, and then is subsequently mixed and reacted with the other XTEN-payload precursors capable of reacting with the linker under conditions to effect the conjugation, resulting in a library of the various permutations and ratios of payloads linked to XTEN. Such a library is then screened inan in vitro or in vivo assay suitable to assess a parameter in a given clinical indication (e.g., cancer, metabolic disorder, diabetes) in order to determine those compositions providing the optimal response. In one exemplary embodiment, one category of payload precursor includes various targeting modules, such as peptides (e.g., the targeting moieties of Table 17) with binding affinity to a tumor-associated antigen of Table 20, and the second category of precursor is one or more drugs, such as a cytotoxic drug or a drug chosen from Table 9. Each category of precursor to be linked is further conjugated to a linker, and, as illustrated in FIG. 36, is sub\u00ad sequently mixed and reacted with the other XTEN-payload precursors capable of reacting with the linker under condi\u00ad tions to effect the conjugation, resulting in a library of the various targeting moieties and drug permutations in varying ratios to each other. The XTEN-payload conjugates are designed to permit fixed ratios of one payload to another; e.g., is 1:1, or 1:1.5, or or 1:4, or 1:5 or 1:9 in the case of two different payloads. Similar ranges of ratios would be applied for library conjugates comprising 3, 4, 5 or more payloads. [0414] In other embodiments, the libraries are constructed using three or more payloads known to have a beneficial effect in the treatment of a common disease. In one embodi\u00ad ment, a library comprises payloads linked to XTEN, wherein each payload is a drug or biologically effective for ameliorat\u00ad ing a common disease. In another embodiment, a library comprises payloads linked to XTEN, wherein each drug or biologic is effective for treating different symptoms of a common disease. In another embodiment, a library comprises payloads linked to XTEN, wherein each drug or biologic mediates their therapeutic effect via a common biological pathway. In the foregoing embodiments of the libraries, the common disease is selected from cancer, cancer supportive care, cardiovascular, central nervous system, endocrine dis\u00ad ease, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, hematological, FHV infection, hormonal dis\u00ad infectious diseases, metabolic disease, musculoskeletal disease, nephrology disorders, ophthalmologic diseases, pain, and respiratory. With greater particularity, the disease for which the libraries are constructed with payloads known to have a beneficial effect is selected from Table 16. Payloads suitable for use in the treatment or prevention of such diseases include those described herein (e.g., the payloads of Tables 11, 12, 18, and 21), or can be found in commonly accessible databases or would otherwise be known to those of ordinary skill in the art. TABLE 16 Diseases for which Payloads are Indicated Disease Achondroplasia Acromegaly AIDS Alzheimer's disease Anemia Arthritis Asthma Atherosclerosis Autism Autoimmune disease Batten disease Bone & cartilage repair Cachexia Cancer (all types) US 2015/0037359 Al 141Feb. 5,2015 TABLE 16-continued Diseases for which Payloads are Indicated Disease Cardiovascular diseases Chemotherapy-induced diseases Chronic kidney disease-induced complication Coagulation disorder Colitis Crohn's Cystic fibrosis Diabetes Diabetes-induced complication neuropathy Diagnostic Eating disorder Erythropoietic protoporphyria Gastrointestinal disorder Gout Growth hormone deficiency Hemophilia Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hereditary emphysema HIV Hyperlipidemia/Dyslipidemia Hyp Phenylketonuria Psoriasis Pulmonary arterial hypertension Pulmonary hypertension Radiotherapy-induced diseases Sepsis Sexual dysfunction Short bowel syndrome Stroke Thrombocytopenia Thyroid disease Transplantation Viral infection [0415] In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 37, the bispecific conjugate has a drug module linked to the XTEN by a cleavable or labile linker, wherein the linker can be cleaved or disassociates after administration to a subject, including upon intracellular internalization in a cell targeted by the targeting modules. In another embodiment the drug is linked to XTEN by an non-cleavable linker but the conjugate remains susceptible to degradation. Upon internalization the XTEN is cleaved by proteases and the drug connected to its linker is liberated resulting in cytotoxicity.[0416] In one exemplary embodiment, the targeting mod\u00ad ule is luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (aka LHRH, GnRH, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone), the drug is doxorubicin, wherein the ratio of LHRH to doxorubicin is 1:1, 1:1.5, or 3:2, or 2:1, or 1.5:1. The conjugate can be generated starting from XTEN precursors. OneXTEN precursor can carry 1,2, or more drug molecules and a reactive cross-linker or click chemistry reac\u00ad tant or a reactive amino acid. A second XEN precursor carries I, 2, or more LHRH domains for targeting and a reactive cross-linker or click chemistry reactant or a reactive amino acid. Both precursor segments are then joined by reaction between reactive groups of the respective XTEN. In one exemplary embodiment the reactive group is an azide that is conjugated to the N-terminus of first XTEN segment via a cross-linker; and reactive group of the second XTEN is an alkyne that is conjugated to the N-terminus of the second XTEN segment via a cross-linker. In another embodiment of the LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate, the drug is maytansin. In another embodiment of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate the drug auristatin. Linked to Target\u00ad ing Moieties [0418] In another aspect, the present invention provides conjugate compositions comprising one or more XTEN-pay- Ioad compositions linked to targeting moieties. The subject targeted compositions find use in the treatment of a variety of conditions where selective delivery of a therapeutic or toxic payload to a cell, tissue or organ is desired. The invention contemplates a diversity of targeting moieties for use in the subject compositions, including antibodies, antibody frag\u00ad ments, and antibody mimetics including, but not limited to those set forth in Table 17, as well as peptides and small molecules capable of binding ligands or receptors associated with disease or metabolic or physiologic abnormalities. In one embodiment, the invention provides a conjugate compris\u00ad ing at least one targeting moiety from Tables 17, 18 or 21 linked to at least one XTEN. In another embodiment, the invention provides a conjugate comprising at least one target\u00ad ing moiety from Tables 17, 18 or 21 linked to each of at least two, or three, or four XTEN. In another embodiment, the invention provides a conjugate comprising at least one target\u00ad ing moiety from Tables 17, 18 or 21 linked to at least one XTEN and at least one drug or biologic payload selected from the group consisting of the payloads set forth in Table 11, Table 12, Table 18, or Table 21 linked to the at least one XTEN. In one embodiment, the invention provides targeting moiety-XTEN-drug conjugate compositions wherein the composition is selectively delivered to a ligand or receptor on a targeted cell, which can then be internalized into the cell, as illustrated in FIG. 37, resulting in a pharmacologic effect know in the art for the drug component. [0419] As illustrated in FIGS. 21-24, and 28-32, such con\u00ad jugate compositions can have different valencies, with one, two, three, or four or more XTEN-payload molecules linked to one or more targeting antibody or targeting moiety. In the case of antibody targeting moieties, in one embodiment the XTEN-payload is linked by a cross-linker to a cysteine in a hinge region of the antibody. In another embodiment, the XTEN-payload is linked by a disulfide bridge to a cysteine in a hinge region of the antibody. Accordingly, an antibody- XTEN-payload conjugate can comprise 1, 2, 3, or 4 or more XTEN-payload segments linked to the antibody, antibody fragment or mimetic. In another embodiment XTEN is con- US 2015/0037359 Al 142Feb. 5,2015 jugated outside of the hinge region, which includes inserting cysteine in the antibody to control conjugation sites or by conjugation to existing lysine side chains. The linking of XTEN-payload to create the antibody conjugates has many benefits: a) the XTEN payload serves as a cleavable linker, b) it provides solubility, c) it allows setting the ratio of drugload per IgG, and d) it can be pre-conjugated with drug to simplify manufacturing. TABLE 17 Targeting Moieties: Antibody fragments, scaffolds and mimetics Targeting MoietiesTABLE invention provides con\u00ad jugates comprising a targeting component as one payload and a toxin as a second payload, with one or more copies of each payload type linked to the XTEN of the composition. In a variation of the foregoing, the conjugate can optionally have the toxin linked to the XTEN with a labile or a cleavable linker such that the toxin is liberated when delivered to or is internalized within the target. In another variation of the foregoing, the targeting component is an antibody or antibody fragment, with one, two, three, or four XTEN-payload com\u00ad positions conjugated with linkers to the antibody (e.g., con\u00ad jugated to cysteines in the hinge region as illustrated in FIGS. 28-29), providing conjugates for use in targeted therapy of clinical indications such as, but not limited to, various treat\u00ad ment of tumors and other cancers wherein the antibody pro\u00ad vides the targeting component and the XTEN-payload effects the intended activity (e.g, cytotoxicity in a tumor cell). Elence, the inventive conjugates are a type of immunoconjugate. The targeted conjugates can be designed with targeting compo\u00ad nents that are derived from antibodies, or antibody mimetics, or are peptides or small molecules that bind ligands associ\u00ad ated with diseases cells or organs. Non-limiting examples of categories of antibody fragments, scaffolds and mimetics are provided in Table 17. Non-limited examples of specific tar\u00ad geting components, the targets to which they are directed, and toxins that may be utilized as payloads in the inventive con\u00ad jugates are provided in Table 18. It is specifically contem\u00ad plated that the targeted conjugate compositions of the present disclosure include compositions of any given targeting com\u00ad ponent that can be used in combination with one or more of any of the toxins of Table 18 or the payloads provided in Table 11 or Table 12. It is further contemplated that an XTEN- payload conjugate can comprise two or more targeting com\u00ad ponents, which may be identical or may be different. It is contemplated that such conjugates can be used in treatment of conditions such as, but not limited to those set forth in Table 15.

Alternatively, the LHRH and drug components can be conjugated to a mono\u00ad meric XTEN. Further, the drug components can optionally be linked to XTEN using labile or cleavable linkers that permit the drug to be liberated from the conjugate after administra\u00ad tion to a subject.

[0426] In another embodiment, the invention provides an XTEN-payload conjugate of any of the embodiments described herein for use in making a medicament useful for the treatment of a condition including, but not limited to the conditions set forth in Table 16. VI). Methods of Treatment [0427] The invention provides a method of treating a dis\u00ad ease in a subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of the XTEN-payload conjugate of any of the foregoing embodiments to a subject in need thereof. In one embodiment, the XTEN-payload comprises a single type of payload selected from Tables 11, 12, 18, 19, and 21. In another embodiment, the XTEN-payload comprises a two types of payloads selected from Tables 11, 12, 18, 19, and 21.In another embodiment, the XTEN-payload comprises a two types of payloads in which one payload is selected from Tables 11, 12, and 18 and the second payload is a targeting moiety with binding affinity to a target of Table 20 or is a targeting moiety of any one of Tables 18 ,19, or 21. In another embodiment, the XTEN-payload comprises more than three or more types of payloads selected from Tables 11,12,18,19, and 21. In the method, the payload of the conjugate is one that is known in the art to have a beneficial effect or has affinity to a disease taiget when administered to a subject with a par\u00ad ticular disease or condition. In one embodiment, the payload (s) of the composition mediate their therapeutic effect via a common biological pathway.

With greater particular\u00ad ity, the disease is selected from Table 16. [0428] In some embodiments of the method of treatment, the conjugate composition can be administered subcutane\u00ad ously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. In one embodiment, the composition is administered using a therapeutically effec\u00ad tive amount. In one embodiment, administration of two or more consecutive doses of the therapeutically effective amount results in a gain in time spent within a therapeutic window for the composition compared to the payload not linked to XTEN and administered using comparable doses to a subject. The gain in time spent within the therapeutic win\u00ad dow can be at least three-fold longer than unmodified pay- load, or alternatively, at least four-fold, or five-fold, or six\u00ad fold, or seven-fold, or eight-fold, or nine-fold, or at least 10-fold, or at least 20-fold, or at least about 30-fold, or at least about 50-fold, or at least about 100-fold longer than payload not linked to XTEN. [0429] In one embodiment of the method of treatment, a smaller moles/kg amount of about two-fold less, or about three-fold less, or about four-fold less, or about five-fold less, or about six-fold less, or about eight-fold less, or about 10-fold less or greater of the conjugate or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the conjugate is administered to a subject in need thereof in comparison to the corresponding payload(s) not linked to the XTEN under a dose regimen needed to maintain a therapeutic effect and the conjugate achieves a comparable area under the curve as the corre\u00ad sponding moles/kg amount of the payload(s) not linked to the XTEN needed to maintain a therapeutic effect. In another embodiment, the conjugate or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the conjugate requires less frequent administra\u00ad tion for routine treatment of a subject, wherein the dose of conjugate or pharmaceutical composition is administered about every four days, about every seven days, about every 10 days, about every 14 days, about every 21 days, or about monthly to the subject, and the conjugate achieves a compa\u00ad rable area under the curve as the corresponding payload(s) not linked to the XTEN and administered to the subject. In yet other embodiments, an accumulatively smaller amount of about 5%, or about 10%, or about 20%, or about 40%, or about 50%, or about 60%, or about 70%, or about 80%, or about 90% less of moles/kg of the conjugate is administered to a subject in comparison to the corresponding amount of the US 2015/0037359 Al 155Feb. 5,2015 payload(s) not linked to the XTEN under a dose regimen needed to maintain an effective blood concentration, yet the conjugate achieves at least a comparable area under the curve as the corresponding payload(s) not linked to the XTEN. The accumulatively smaller amount is measure for a period of at least about one week, or about 14 days, or about 21 days, or about one month. In some embodiments of the method, the therapeutic effect is a measured parameter, clinical symptom or endpoint known in the art to be associated with the under\u00ad lying condition of the subject to be treated or prevented. [0430] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a cancer cell in vitro, comprising admin\u00ad istering to a culture of a cancer cell a composition comprising an effective amount of an XTEN-payload composition, wherein a first payload is a targeting moiety and the second payload is a toxin of Table 21. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a cancer in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of an XTEN- payload composition wherein a first payload is a targeting moiety and the second payload is a toxin of Table 21.

In another embodiment of the method, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of non-small cell lung cancer or mesothelioma, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, and refrac\u00ad tory advanced tumors. In another embodiment of the method, the administration results in at least a 10%, or 20%, or 30%, or 40%, or 50%, or 60%, or 70%, or 80%, or 90% greater improvement of at least one, two, or three parameters asso\u00ad ciated with a cancer compared to an untreated subject wherein the parameters are selected from the group consist\u00ad ing of response rate as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), time-to-progression of the cancer (relapse), discovery of local recurrence, discovery of regional metastasis, discovery of distant metastasis, onset of symptoms, hospitalization, increase in pain medication requirement, requirement of salvage chemotherapy, require\u00ad ment of salvage surgery, requirement of salvage radiotherapy, time-to-treatment failure, and increased time of survival.

IX) . The Nucleic Acids Sequences of the Invention [0435] The present invention provides isolated polynucleic acids encoding the polypeptide components of the conjugates and sequences complementary to polynucleic acid molecules encoding the polypeptide components of the conjugates. In some embodiments, the invention provides polynucleic acids encoding the XTEN of any of the conjugate embodiments described herein, or the complement of the polynucleic acid. In one embodiment, the polynucleic acids encodes an XTEN selected from the group consisting of the XTEN set forth in Tables 2 and 3, or the complement of the polynucleic acid. [0436] In other embodiments, the invention provides poly\u00ad nucleic acids encoding the XTEN linked to cleavage sequences, affinity tags and helper sequences protein of any of the embodiments described herein, or the complement of the polynucleic acids. In one embodiment, the polynucleic acids encodes a protein payload selected from the group consisting of the protein payloads set forth in Tables 7,18,19, and 21, or the complement of the polynucleic acid. [0437] In one embodiment, the invention encompasses methods to produce polynucleic acids encoding the XTEN and the XTEN linked to cleavage sequences, affinity tags and helper sequences protein embodiments, or sequences complementary to the 2015/0037359 Al 156Feb. 5,2015 gous variants thereof. In general, and as illustrated in FIGS. 38 and 39, the methods of producing a polynucleotide sequence coding for an XTEN and expressing the resulting gene product include assembling nucleotides encoding the XTEN, ligating the components in frame, incorporating the encoding gene into an expression vector appropriate for a host cell, transforming the appropriate host cell with the expres\u00ad sion vector, and culturing the host cell under conditions caus\u00ad ing or permitting the XTEN to be expressed in the trans\u00ad formed host cell, thereby producing the XTEN polypeptide, which is recovered by methods described herein or by stan\u00ad dard protein purification methods known in the art. Standard recombinant techniques in molecular biology are used to make the polynucleotides and expression vectors of the present invention. [0438] In accordance with the invention, nucleic acid sequences that encode XTEN or XTEN linked to cleavage sequences, affinity tags and helper sequences protein (or its complement) are used to generate recombinant DNA mol\u00ad ecules that direct the expression in appropriate host cells. Several cloning strategies are suitable for performing the present invention, many of which are used to generate a construct that comprises a gene coding for an XTEN or a payload composition of the present invention, or its comple\u00ad ment. In one embodiment, the cloning strategy is used to create a gene that encodes an XTEN that comprises nucle\u00ad otides encoding the XTEN that is used to transform a host cell for expression of the XTEN composition. In the foregoing embodiments hereinabove described in this paragraph, the genes can further comprise nucleotides encoding cleavage sequeces, affinity tags, and helper sequences. In another embodiment, the cloning strategy is used to create a gene that encodes a protein payload that comprises nucleotides encod\u00ad ing the payload that is used to transform a host cell for expres\u00ad sion of the payload composition. [0439] In designing a desired XTEN sequences, it was dis\u00ad covered that the non-repetitive nature of the XTEN of the inventive compositions is achieved despite use of a \"building block\" molecular approach in the creation of the XTEN- encoding sequences. This was achieved by the use of a library of polynucleotides encoding peptide sequence motifs, described above, that are then ligated and/or multimerized to create the genes encoding the XTEN sequences (see FIGS. 38 and 39 and Examples). Thus, while the XTEN(s) of the expressed polypeptide may consist of multiple units of as few as four different sequence motifs, because the motifs them\u00ad selves consist of non-repetitive amino acid sequences, the overall XTEN sequence is that encode non- repetitive sequences, or motifs, operably linked in frame and in which the resulting expressed XTEN amino acid sequences are non-repetitive. [0440] In one approach, a construct is first prepared con\u00ad taining the DNA sequence corresponding to XTEN. Exem\u00ad plary methods for the preparation of such constructs are described in the Examples. The construct is then used to create an expression vector suitable for transforming a host cell, such as a prokaryotic host cell (e.g., E. coli) for the expression and recovery of the XTEN. Exemplary methods for the creation of expression vectors, the transformation of host cells and the expression and recovery of XTEN are described in the Examples.[0441] The gene encoding for the XTEN can be made in one or more steps, either fully synthetically or by synthesis combined with enzymatic processes, such as restriction enzyme-mediated cloning, PCR and overlap extension, including methods more fully described in the Examples. The methods disclosed herein can be used, for example, to ligate short sequences of polynucleotides encoding XTEN into longer XTEN genes of a desired length and sequence. In one embodiment, the method ligates two, three, four or more codon-optimized oligonucleotides encoding XTEN motif or segment sequences of about 9 to 14 amino acids, or about 12 to 20 amino acids, or about 18 to 36 amino acids, or about 48 to about 144 amino acids, or about 144 to about 288 or longer, or any combination of the foregoing ranges of motif or seg\u00ad ment lengths. Alternatively, the disclosed method is used to multimerize XTEN-encoding sequences into longer sequences of a desired length; e.g., a gene encoding 36 amino acids of XTEN can be dimerized into a gene encoding 72 amino acids, then 144, then 288, etc. Even with multimeriza- tion, XTEN polypeptides can be constructed such that the XTEN-encoding gene has low or virtually no repetitiveness through design of the codons selected for the motifs of the shortest unit being used, which can reduce recombination and increase stability of the encoding gene in the transformed host. Genes encoding XTEN with non-repetitive sequences are assembled from oligonucleotides using standard tech\u00ad niques of gene synthesis. The gene design can be performed using algorithms that optimize codon usage and amino acid composition. In one method of the invention, a library of relatively short XTEN-encoding polynucleotide constructs is created and then assembled, as described above. The resulting genes are then assembled with genes encoding payload pep\u00ad tide or polypeptide, and the resulting genes used to transform a host cell and produce and recover the XTEN-payload for evaluation of its properties, as described herein. [0442] The resulting polynucleotides encoding the XTEN and the peptide sequences to which it is linked can then be individually cloned into an expression vector. The nucleic acid sequence is inserted into the vector by a variety of pro\u00ad cedures. In general, DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site(s) using techniques known in the art. Vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Con\u00ad struction of suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are known to the skilled artisan. Such techniques are well known in the art and well described in the scientific and patent literature. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may, for example, be in the form of a plasmid, cosmid, viral particle, or phage that may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector, which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replica\u00ad tion, e.g., a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromo\u00ad some^) into which it has been integrated. Representative plasmids are illustrated in FIG. 17, with encoding regions for different configurations of FVIII and XTEN components por\u00ad trayed. US 2015/0037359 Al 157Feb. [0443] The invention provides for the use of plasmid expression vectors containing replication and control sequences that are compatible with and recognized by the host cell, and are operably linked to the gene encoding the polypeptide for controlled expression of the polypeptide. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as sequences that encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. Such vector sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. Useful expression vectors that can be used include, for example, segments of chromosomal, non-chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences. \"Expression vector\" refers to a DNA construct containing a DNA sequence that is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of effecting the expression of the DNA encoding the polypeptide in a suitable host. The requirements are that the vectors are replicable and viable in the host cell of choice. Low- or high-copy number vectors may be used as desired. [0444] Suitable vectors include, but are not limited to, derivatives of SV40 and pcDNA and known bacterial plas\u00ad mids such as col El, pCRl, pBR322, pMal-C2, pET, as described by Smith, etal., Gene 57:31-40 (1988), pMB9 and derivatives thereof, plasmids such as RP4, phage DNAs such as the numerous derivatives of phage I such as NM98 9, as well as other phage DNA such as Ml 3 and filamentous single stranded phage DNA; yeast plasmids such as the 2 micron plasmid or derivatives of the 2 m plasmid, as well as cento- meric and integrative yeast shuttle vectors; vectors useful in eukaryotic cells such as vectors useful in insect or mamma\u00ad lian cells; vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNAs, such as plasmids that have been modified to employ phage DNA or the expression control sequences; and the like. Yeast expression systems that can also be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, the non\u00ad fusion pYES2 vector (Invitrogen), the fusion pYESElisA, B, C (Invitrogen), pRS vectors and the like. The control sequences of the vector include a promoter to effect transcrip\u00ad tion, an optional operator sequence to control such transcrip\u00ad tion, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosome binding sites, and sequences that control termination of transcription and translation. The promoter may be any DNA sequence, which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Promoters suit\u00ad able for use in expression vectors with prokaryotic hosts include the (3-lactamase and (1980); EP 36,776], and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter [deBoer et ah, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, the DNA encoding CFXTEN polypeptides. Promoters for use in bacterial systems can also contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence, operably linkedto the DNA encoding CFXTEN polypeptides. EXAMPLES Example I Construction of XTEN_AD36 Motif Segments [0445] The following example describes the construction of a collection of codon-optimized genes encoding motif sequences of 36 amino acids. As a first step, a stuffier vectorpCW0359 was constructed based on a pET vector and that includes a T7 promoter. pCW0359 encodes a cellulose bind\u00ad ing protease recognition site fol\u00ad lowed by a stuffer sequence that is flanked by BsaI, BbsI, and KpnI sites. The BsaI and BbsI sites were inserted such that they generate compatible overhangs after digestion. The stuffer sequence is followed by a truncated version of the GFP gene and a His tag. The stuffer sequence contains stop codons and thus E. coli cells carrying the stuffer plasmid pCW0359 form non-fluorescent colonies. The stuffer vector pCW0359 with BsaI and KpnI to remove the stuffer seg\u00ad ment and the resulting vector fragment was isolated by aga\u00ad rose gel purification. The sequences were designated XTEN_ AD36, reflecting the AD family of motifs. Its segments have the amino acid sequence [X]3 where X is a 12 mer peptide with the sequences: GESPGGSSGSES, GSEGSSGPGESS, GSSESGSSEGGP, or GSGGEPSESGSS.

The products corresponding to the length of 36 amino acids were isolated from the mixture by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the Bsal/Kpnl digested stuffer vector pCW0359. Most of the clones in the resulting library designated LCW0401 showed green fluorescence after induction, which shows that the sequence of XTEN_ AD36 had been ligated in frame with the GFP gene and that most sequences of XTEN_AD36 had good expression levels. [0447] We screened 96 isolates from library LCW0401 for high level of fluorescence by stamping them onto agar plate containing IPTG. The same isolates were evaluated by PCR and 48 isolates were identified that contained segments with 36 amino acids as well as strong fluorescence. These isolates were sequenced and 39 clones were identified that contained correct XTEN_AD36 segments.

A collection of XTEN_AE72 segments was constructed from 37 different segments of XTEN_AE36. Cultures of E. coli harboring all 37 different 36-amino acid segments were mixed and plasmid was isolated. This plasmid pool was digested with Bsal/Ncol to generate the small fragment as the insert. The same plasmid pool was digested withBbsI/NcoI to generate the large fragment as the vector. The insert and vector fragments were ligated resulting in a doubling of the length and the ligation mixture was transformed into BL21Gold(DE3) cells to obtain colonies of XTEN_AE72. [0458] This library of XTEN_AE72 segments was desig\u00ad nated LCW0406. All clones from LCW0406 were combined and dimerized again using the same process as described above yielding library LCW0410 of XTEN_AE144. All clones from LCW0410 were combined and dimerized again using the same process as described above yielding library LCW0414 of XTEN_AE288. Two isolates LCW0414.001 and LCW0414.002 were randomly picked from the library and sequenced to verify the identities. All clones from LCW0414 were combined and dimerized again using the same process as described above yielding library LCW0418 of XTEN_AE576. We screened 96 isolates from library LCW0418 for high level of GFP fluorescence. 8 isolates with right sizes of inserts by PCR and strong fluorescence were sequenced and 2 isolates (LCW0418.018 and LCW0418. 052) were chosen for future use based on sequencing and expression data. [0459] The specific clone pCW0432 of was constructed by of XTEN_AE288 using the same dimer\u00ad ization process as described above. Example 6 Construction of XTEN_AG864 [0460] Using the several consecutive rounds of dimeriza\u00ad tion, we assembled a collection of XTEN_AG864 sequences starting from segments of XTEN_AD36 listed in Example I . These sequences were assembled as described in Example 3. Several isolates from XTEN_AG864 were evaluated and found to show good expression and excellent solubility under physiological conditions. A full length clone of XTEN_ AG864 had excellent solubility and showed half-life exceed\u00ad ing 60 h in cynomolgus monkeys. Example 7 Construction of CBD-XTEN-Cys, a Cysteine-Engineered XTEN [0461] A cysteine island (CysIsland) encoding the amino acid sequence GGSPAGSCTSP containing one cysteine was introduced by annealed oligos in the CBD-stuffer-GFP vector to obtain CBD-CysIsland-GFP, where CysIsland is flanked by the restriction sites BsaI and BbsL The CBD-stuffer-GFP vector is a pET30 derivative from Novagen with TEV pro\u00ad tease recognition site between CBD and the staffer. Con\u00ad structs were previously generated by replacing the staffer in CBD-stuffer-GFP vector with genes encoding XTEN_ AE288 and XTEN_AE576. The plasmid of CBD-XTEN_ AE288-GFP was digested with Bsal/Ncol to generate the small fragment as the insert. The plasmid of CBD-CysIsland- GFP was digested with Bbsl/Ncol to generate the large frag\u00ad ment as the vector. The insert and vector fragments were US 2015/0037359 Al 170Feb. 5,2015 Bbsl/Hindlll to remove the stop codon, the ligation mixture was electropo\u00ad rated into BL21-Gold (DE3) cells to obtain transformants of CBD-XTEN_AE576-Cyslsland-XTEN_AE288, which has the DNA and encoded amino acid sequences that follow in Table 26. Additional constructs can be created with cysteines inserted at different locations within the XTEN sequence by the selection of restriction sites appropriate for the given location, including multiple insertions. The method could also be utilized to create lysine-engineered XTEN by substi\u00ad tution of codons encoding lysine encoding cysteine in the oligonucleotides.

A second pair of primers was designed to introduce the restriction site BsaI and a partial cysteine island 2 of sequence GCGTAEAA at the N-terminus of XTEN_AE432- 2, and cysteine island 4 of sequence TAEAAGCGTAEAAR with an 8x His-tag (H8) and restriction The XTEN_AE432-1 con\u00ad tains 1-432 amino acid sequence and XTEN_AE432-2 contains the 433-864 amino acid sequence encoded by the XTEN_AE864 gene. These two pairs of primers were used to amplify the XTEN_AE432-1 and XTEN_AE432-2 gene,respectively, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products of correct sizes were gel-purified and digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI/BbsI and Bsal/Hindlll, respectively, as the inserts for ligation. A destination vector, a derivative of pET30 (Novagen) includes a CBD (cellulose binding domain)-stuffer with the flanking restriction sites BamHI and HindIII. The destination vector was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI/Hindlll to remove the stuffer and prepared as the vector. The vector was ligated with the BamHI/BbsI digested PCR product of XTEN_AE432-1 and Bsal/Hindlll digested PCR of XTEN_AE432-2 above. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli TOPlO compe\u00ad tent cells. Transformants were screened by DNA miniprep and the desired constructs were confirmed by DNA sequenc\u00ad ing. Thus, the final plasmid yields the CBD-cysteine island I -XTEN_AE432-cysteine island 2-XTEN_AE432-cysteine island 3-H8 gene under the control of a T7 promoter.

site BamHI and the amino acid sequence GRGSP at the N-terminus of XTEN_AE432-1, and the amino acid sequence TAEAAG and restriction site BbsI at the C-termi- nus of XTEN_AE432-1. A second pair of primers was designed to introduce the restriction site BsaI and an amino acid sequence with an incorporated lysine of GKPGTAEAA at the N-terminus of XTEN_AE432-2, and an amino acid sequence with an incorporated lysine of GKAT with an 8x His-tag C-terminus XTEN_AE432-1 contains the 1-432 amino acid sequence andXTEN_AE432-2 contains the 433- 864 amino acid sequence encoded by the XTEN_AE864 gene. These two pairs of primers were used to amplify theXTEN_AE432-1 andXTEN_AE432-2 gene, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products of right sizes were gel-purified and digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI/BbsI and Bsal/Hindlll, respectively, as the inserts for ligation. A destination vector, derivative of pET30 (Novagen), of CBD (cellulose binding domain)-stuffer with the flanking restriction sites BamHI and HindIII was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI/Hindlll to remove the stuffer and prepared as the vector. Ligate the vector with the BamHI/BbsI digested PCR product of XTEN_AE432-1 and Bsal/Hindlll digested PCR of XTEN_AE432-2 above. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli TOPlO compe\u00ad tent cells. Transformants were screened by DNA miniprep and the desired constructs were confirmed by DNA sequenc\u00ad ing. Thus, the final plasmid yields the CBD-GRGSP-XTEN_ AE432-TAEAAGKPGTAEAA-XTEN AE432-GKAT-H8 gene under the control of a T7 promoter. The DNA sequences and protein sequences are provided in Table 28.

site-XTEN_AE864- GFP under the promoter, and pLCW0970.030 expressing CBD-TEV site-XTEN_AE864- GFP under the control of the PhoA promoter, were trans\u00ad formed into both E. coli BL21 DE3 and E. coli BL21 DE3 rne-131 (Lopez, P J., et al. (1999) Mol. 199). The olytic activity of RNase et al. (1996) Journal of Bacteriology, 178: 3917-3925). Starter cultures of all six tranformants were prepared by picking single colonies to inoculate 2 mL of LB Broth media containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. The starter cultures were grown over\u00ad night and 0.5 mL was used to inoculate, in quadruplicate, 25 mL of 2xYT broth, for cells containing pCW1054 and pLCW0968.003, or 25 mLofPhoA induction broth for cells containing pLCW0970.030. The cul\u00ad tures were shaken for 3 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The temperature was then reduced to 26\u00b0 C. for all of the cultures; and for cells containing pCW1054 and pLCW0968.003 protein expres\u00ad sion was induced with IPTG at 1.0 mM final concentration. Induction of the PhoA promoter in pLCW070.030 is auto- induced upon depletion of phosphate from the culture media. The cultures were then shaken overnight at 26\u00b0 C. Samples of each culture were lysed and 20 pi of each lysate specifications, with Coomassie staining. Theresults (FIG. showed that when either CBD-TEV or CBD-TEV site-XTEN_AE864 is expressed under the con\u00ad trol of the T7/lac promoter the yield of the recombinant pro\u00ad tein is significantly higher in the E. coli BL21 DE3 me-131 compared to the E. coli BL21 DE3 cells. Cells were also measured for GFP fluorescence using a fluorescent plate reader. The results (FIG. 44) showed that expression in E. coliBL21 DE3 cells of CBD-TEV site-XTEN_AE864-GFP under the control of the PhoA promoter is nearly three times greater than the expression of CBD-TEV site-XTEN_ AE864-GFP under the control of the T7/lac promoter. In the E. coli BL21 DE3 rne-131 both the T7/lac and PhoA promot\u00ad ers yielded similar levels of expression. Therefore, only upon inhibition of Rnase E 3' riboendocleolytic activity does T7/lac titers similar to that obtained using PhoA induction. Likely the faster rate of T7 RNAP transcription (Studier, W., et al. (1986) Journal of Molecular Biology 189: 113-130), relative to translation results inmRNA susceptible to endonucleolytic attack, while in the case of Pho A induction where transcription is mediated by the native E. coli RNA polymerase II, the rate of transcription is closely coupled to the rate of translation protecting the mRNA from endonucle\u00ad olytic attack. Example 11 Construction of I x Amino-XTEN288 [0465] A pair of primers AE278BsaIfor-AACG PCR the PCR prod\u00ad uct XTEN_AE278. Gel-purification of the band of the right size was performed, followed by digestion with BsaEHindIII as the insert of XTEN_AE278-R-H8. A digestion of plasmid which (construct AC763), with BsaEHindIII fragment of AE432 _3Cys-R- H8 and gel-purify the laige fragment as the vector. Ligation of the vector with the insert was performed and was used to transform BL21 competent cells to obtain the construct of N-term-RPl I -R-AE288-R-H8. The XTEN length between the two trypsin digestion sites (R, Arginine) was calculated by XTEN_AE278 plus some flanking amino acids and equaled exactly 288 amino acids. Thus, the construct is designed to produce the precursor N-term-RPl I-R-AE288-R-H8 (se\u00ad quence in Table 29, below) and generate lx Amino- XTEN288 (Seg 178 of Table 3, with an N-terminal amino group for conjugation) after removal of the N-term-RPl I tag and C-term 8x His-tag by trypsin digestion.

Solutions of each DNA pair (107N-F and 107N-R, 108N-F and 108N-R, etc) was mixed at a I : I molar ratio, were denatured at 95\u00b0 C. for 3 min, followed by cooling to 25\u00b0 C. at 0.1\u00b0 C./min to allow double strand DNA annealing. The base vector LCW0970.030 (encoding CBD-AE864-GFP) was digested with Ndel/Bsal and the larger fragment was gel-purified as the vector. The vector was ligated with the annealed oligos oligos, and the ligation products were transformed into E. coli BL21 competent cells (New England Biolabs) to obtain the colonies designated pSD0107 to pSD118. The clones pSD0107-109, pSDOlll-112, and verified by DNA sequencing; clone pSDOl 10.001 had one mutation of frame-shift and was used as the staffer vector. [0469] The plasmid construct pCWl HO (encoding R P ll- AE864) was digested with Bsal/Notl and the smaller band of corresponding to the nucleotides encoding AE864 was gel- purified as the insert. pCW1139 (encoding MalEss-AE48- payload-AE864) was digested by XhoI/BstXI/Notl and the larger fragment was gel-purified as the vector. The annealed product of oligos of 119-AEN-F&R was ligated with the insert and vector, and then transformed into E. coli BL21 to obtain colonies with the plasmid, designated pSDOl 19. The clones were sequence verified. [0470] 2.

Screening and Analysis of the N-Terminal Helper Libraries LCW1157-1159 [0476] E. coli hosts transformed with the plasmids pSD0107 to pSD0118 were expressed in shake flasks and the expression levels in each were evaluated by measuring the fluorescence from the C-terminal GFP reporter. Briefly, an overnight culture was grown for each construct in SB media (with 12.5 pg/m tetracycline), which was then used to inocu\u00ad late a 200 ml culture of PhoA phosphate depletion autoinduc\u00ad tion media with 12.5 pg/m tetracycline (3 shake flasks were grown for each construct). After growing at 26\u00b0 C. with 225 rpm for 48 h, 100 pi aliquot was taken from each culture and the GFP expression level was measured with a fluorescence plate reader with excitation wavelength of 395 nm and emis\u00ad sion wavelength of 510 nm. Two readings were taken for each shake flask. Among the constructs tested, pSDOl 16 had the highest fluorescence signal, followed by pSDOl 14 (FIG. 81), but the expression levels of these two constructs were signifi\u00ad cantly lower than the LCW0970.030 (pLCW970) positive control. [0477] In order to further improve expression, three librar\u00ad ies (LCW1157, 1158, and 1159) were built based on pSD0106, and were screened in a high through-put format. Large numbers of colonies from these libraries (Table 32) were picked to grow individually in 500 pi SB media (with 12.5 pg/m tetracycline) in 96 deep well plates overnight at 37\u00b0 C. shaking with 300 rpm. 20 pi of the saturated culture was used to inoculate 500 pi of PhoA phosphate depletion auto\u00ad induction media (with 12.5 pg/m tetracycline) in 96 deep well plates that were incubated at 26\u00b0 C. shaking with 300 rpm for 22-24 h. Expression was then determined by placing 100 pi of the culture into a 96 well plate measuring the fluorescence from the C-terminal GFP reporter.

For all three libraries, clones having higher expression than thepSDOl 16 construct were identified (FIG. 82A-C), and the correlation between the original tests and retests was good (FIG. 82D-F). Among the 3 libraries tested, library LCW1159 gave higher expression level in general, and the highest expression construct from this round of screening (LCW1159.004) came from this library. [0479] The 8 constructs with the highest expression levels from these three libraries and controls were treated with Pop Culture (EMD Millipore), were heat treated, and the resulting lysates were analyzed with SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining (FIG. 83). Expression levels of the 8 constructs were con\u00ad firmed to be higher than controls (negative control, LSDOl 14 and LSDOl 16), and full-length proteins were produced from these constructs. Lysates of 4 top expression constructs (after Pop Culture and heat treatment) and a negative control (AP32, a purified XTEN-GFP protein without R P ll tag) were each loaded onto a MacroCap SP column at pFl of 8 andconductivity of 6.5 mS/cm. The column was washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pFl 8, 100 mM NaCl, and the protein was eluted with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pFl 8, 500 mM NaCl. The samples of the load, flow through, wash and elutate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel (FIG. 84). The results dem\u00ad onstrated that the expression protein of the four, which came from all three libraries, can be captured by MacroCap SP; thus the binding was contributed to the presence of the RPl I tag in the protein since the negative control (not containing the R P ll tag) didn't bind to the MacroCap SP column. [0480] The plasmids of the clones chosen for retests were minipreped and the DNA sequences of the N-terminal helpers were analyzed. Codon bias was observed at several locations (Table 33). For example, the 3rd amino acid of LCW1157, N, is encoded by AAC or AAT. Most of the high expression clones (77%) in LCWl 157 are encoded by AAT at the 3rd amino acid, while most of the low expression clones (88%) are encoded by AAC, indicating AAT is preferred over AAC at this position for high expression. Similarly, CCG is pre\u00ad ferred at the 4th amino acid, while GCG at the 7th amino acid is accumulated in low expression clones. These trends were also observed in libraries LCW1158 and LCW1159, as well.

Screening and Analysis of the N-Terminal Helper Library LCWl 163 [0482] Since library LCWl 159 had generally higher expression than LCW1157 and LCW1158, the next library design was based on LCWl 159, with the introduction of more variants in the N-terminal helper domain coding region. A total of 672 clones from this library (theoretical diversity of 55296) was screened and retested in the same way as libraries LCW1157-1159. Clones with higher expression than LCWl 159.004 (the highest from the previous round of screening) were observed (FIG. 85). The top expression clone, LCWl 163.029, achieved a 40% improvement from LCWl 159.004, while its expression level was 27% lower than the CBD control. The sequence of the high and low expression clones were analyzed, and the preferred nucle\u00ad otides for expression were identified and summarized (see Table 34). Most of the locations have shown a preference of codon A for high expression, while others have a preference for C.pared with LCW1171 and 1172. LCW1204 allowed more amino acid changes than LCW1203, which resulted in lower expression than LCW1203 in general (FIGS. 94C and D). These results suggest that the expression level is sensitive to amino acid changes in the helper domain sequences. [0487] 7. Screening of the N-Terminal Helper Libraries LCWl and N-terminal libraries (LCW1208, LCW1209, and LCW1210) were designed to investigate the effect of further elongation the N-terminal helper sequence (Table 35). LCWl 208 and LCWl 21 Ointroduced 4 more resi\u00ad dues to the helper domain, while LCW1209 introduced 8 more residues. The screening results showed a general trend that LCWl 209 had highest expression, followed by LCW l208, and then LCW l210 (FIG. 95), which confirmed the beneficial effect of adding more amino acid in the helper sequence.

Screening and analysis of the R P ll library LCWl 160 [0484] At the same time, 168 colonies from library LCW1160 (the library varying the coding region of RPl I tag without any N-terminal helper domain (total theoretical diversity of 8.8xl012) were screened and analyzed. However, this library had very low expression level in general (FIG. 86), and the one outlier with high expression was found to encode a truncated RPl I tag after performing plasmid miniprep and DNA sequencing analysis. The screening results of the library, under these experimental conditions, strongly suggest that an N-terminal helper is required to achieve high expres\u00ad sion levels. [0485] 6. Screening of the N-Terminal 171, 172, LCWl 172, LCWl 203, and LCWl 204) were screened and analyzed in the same way as those described above. LCWl 171 and 1172 were designed similarly, while LCWl 171 allowed more amino acid changes in the helper sequence than LCWl 172. The screening results showed that LCWl 171 in general had much lower expression level than LCW1172 (FIGS. 94A and B). LCW1203 and 1204 were designed similarly, focusing on randomizing a different region of the helper sequence com-TABLE 35 L i b r a r i e s L C W 1 2 0 8 -1 2 1 0 L i b r a r yN - t e r m i n a l H e l p e r S e q u e n c e ( a m i n o a c i d )D i v e r \u00ad s i t yN u m b e r S c r e e n e d L C W 1208 Mk k q e q e k e q a e e q b x b x r e e t (B = A / S , X = E /K /Q )2 3 0 4 3 3 6 L C W 1209 MKKOEOEKEOAEEOBXBXBXBXREET (B = A / S , X = E /K /Q )1 0 4 9 7 6 3 3 6 L C W 1210 M KKQEQEKEQAEEQZZZZREET (Z = a n y a m i n o a c i d )2 6 2 1 4 4 3 3 6 [0489] Additional Residues in the Helper Sequences were Underlined. [0490] Three new N-terminal libraries (LCW1208, LCW1209, and LCW1210) were designed to investigate the effect of further elongation the N-terminal helper sequence (Table 36). LCWl 208 and LCWl 21 Ointroduced 4 more resi\u00ad dues to the helper domain, while LCW1209 introduced 8 more residues. The screening results showed a general trend that LCW 1209 had highest expression, followed by LCW l208, and then LCW l210 (FIG. 95), which confirmed the beneficial effect of adding more amino acids in the helper sequence for improving expression. US 2015/0037359 Al 182Feb. 5,2015 [0491] The 4 top constructs with the highest expression levels from the three libraries were chosen from the retest and the sequence of their N-terminal helper sequences were ana\u00ad lyzed (Table 36). The current highest expressed construct (LCW 1209.029) achieved 90% of the expression level of the CBD control by comparing the average florescence after sub\u00ad tracting the negative control.

Example 13 Fermentation of XTEN Using PhoA Induction-Evaluation of Expression Yields [0493] BL21 strain. Three 10L fermen\u00ad tations were run for each of the 3 strains. Glycerol stocks were used to inoculate 125 mL of LB broth media containing 10 pg/mL tetracyclin. The starter cultures were then shaken overnight at 37\u00b0 C. The starter culture was used to inoculate 4 L of fermentation batch media containing\u201420 g ammonium sulfate, 10.4 g potassium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, 5 g sodium citrate dihydrate; 4.6 g sodium 106 g NZ BL4 soy peptone (Kerry Bioscience g yeast (Teknova #Y9020); 3.6 L water; 0.05 mL polypropylene glycol; 5.2 mL trace elements solution (Amunix recipe 144-1); 35 mL IM magnesium sul\u00ad fate; and mL Kanamycin (50 mg/mL)\u2014in 10 L glass jack\u00ad eted vessel with a B. Braun Biostat B controller. The fermen\u00ad tation control settings were: pH=6.9+/-0.1; dO2=10%; dissolved oxygen cascade in stirrer only mode with a range of 125-1180 rpm; air flow of 5 liters per minute of 90% oxygen; initial temperature 37\u00b0 C.; base control 13% ammonium hydroxide; and no acid control. After 6 hours of culture a 70% glycerol feed was initiated at a rate of 40 g/hr. Upon the cultures reaching an OD600 of 50+/-10 OD the culture tem\u00ad perature was lowered to 26\u00b0 C., 54 mL of IM magnesium sulfate was added, and a salt feed consisting of: 10 g/1 ammo\u00ad nium sulfate, phosphate monobasic anhydrous; 0.08% trace elements solution, was started at a rate of 33 g/L and continued for 6 hours. After a total fermentation run time of 64-70 hours the culture was harvested by centrifugation yielding cell pellets between 1.6- 2.3 kilograms in wet weight. The pellets were stored frozen at -80\u00b0 C. until further use. For titer analysis, end of run fer\u00ad mentation whole broth samples were frozen in a 0.2 mL volume, then later thawed, then 0.2 mL of water was added, then to lyse and flocculate host proteins the samples were incubated at 85\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes, then transferred to 4\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes, followed centrifugation for 10 minutes at 20,000 g. The resulting flocculated soluble lysates were assayed by Cl 8 reversed phased F1PLC, and the A214 absor\u00ad bance area corresponding of the peaks representing the Flelper-RPl I -XTEN-Flis8 was compared to that of purified reference standard. Next, to determine the dry cell weight (DCW), aliquots of cells were pelleted and the supernatant discarded. The cell pellet was washed once with water, and was then dried in an oven at 80\u00b0 C. for 3 days. The tubes containing cell pellets were weighed, the weight of the tube was subtracted from the measured weights, and the remaining weight was divided by the initial volume of each sample (0.0002 L) to obtain the DCW. The results of the fermentation growth, titer analysis, and dry cell weight are summarized in Table 37 below. In 96-well plate screening assays, when a library of RPl 1-XTEN-Flis8 constructs without an N-termi- nal helper, LCWl 160 were screened (Example 12, FIG. 86) the expression level of the LCW1160.006, the highest expres\u00ad sion construct, was only 50% of the expression of LCW1159. 004 or LCWl 172.033; constructs with helper sequences. Therefore, it is expected that XTEN constructs with N-termi- nal helper sequences will result in significantly higher expres\u00ad sion titers compared to XTEN constructs not having helper sequences.

After growth, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at -80\u00b0 C. until use. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0,3 ml buffer per gram cell paste). The cells were lysed by passing through an APV homogenizer three times at a pressure of 830-900 bar. Lysis buffer (I ml buffer per gram cell paste) was used as a chase to retrieve hold up volume from the homog\u00ad enizer. The homogenized lysate was incubated in a water bath at 85\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes, followed by quick cooling in ice water bath for 20 minutes. After the heating and cooling treatment, the lysate was centrifuged at 11000 RPM for 90 minutes in a SORVALL centrifuge. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through two CUNO Bio cap 25 (BC0025L90SP08A) filters. The clarified supernatant was stored at 4\u00b0 cap\u00ad ture step for binding the XTEN with an intact C-terminal His-tag. Briefly, the chromatography column BPGl 40/12 (GE Life Sciences) was packed with 2000 ml Toyopearl IMAC 650 M resin (TOSOH Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 2 column volumes (CVs) of equilibrium buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Clarified cell lysate was adjusted to a final NaCl concentra\u00ad tion of 500 mM using 5 M NaCl stock solution, and then was loaded onto the IMAC resin. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of equilibrium buffer, and then 2 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole pH 8.0, followed by 2 column volumes of 20 mMsodium phosphate, 5 mM imidazole pH 8.0 to remove salt. Elution was performed with 2 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM imidazole, pH 8.0. The flow through, wash and elution fractions were analyzed by non\u00ad reducing 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining and the fractions with desired 3. a pol\u00ad ishing step to ensure the N-terminal integrity of the product. MacroCap SP resin (GE Life Sciences) was selected among several cation exchange media due to its superior capacity and selectivity for the product. 1000 ml of MacroCap SP resin was packed in a BPG100/13 (GE Life Sciences) chromatog\u00ad raphy column and equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phos\u00ad phate pH 8.0,20 mM NaCl. The IMAC pool was loaded onto the column and the resin was washed with 2 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 and 2 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of linear gradient from 150 to 500 mM NaCl in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0. Fractions were collected and analyzed by 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. Fractions the with desired prod\u00ad uct were combined for the next step. [0500] 4. Trypsin Digestion of Macrocap SP Elution Pool [0501] Trypsin (Sigma, Trypsin from Bovine Pancreas) digestion of the SP elution pool was performed at 1:200 m/m enzyme/protein ratio overnight Q trypsin digestion, the cleaved tags were sepa\u00ad rated from the final product using Macrocap Q chromatogra\u00ad phy. The BPG100/19 column (GE Life Sciences) was packed with 1500 ml column volume of Macrocap Q resin (GE Life Sciences). The trypsin digested Macrocap SP elution pool was incubated for 15 min at 80\u00b0 C. with 20 mM DTT and 2 mM EDTA to reduce disulfide bonds and to inactivate trypsin. The cooled protein solution was diluted to a conductivity below 5 mS/cm with Milli-Q water and loaded onto the Mac\u00ad rocap Q column equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 2 column vol\u00ad US 2015/0037359 Al 184Feb. 5,2015 umes of 20mMHEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, then 2 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM TCEP, 150 mM NaCl pH7.0. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 150 mM NaCl to 500 mM NaCl in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 in 20 column volumes. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/ silver staining. [0504] 6. Concentration and Diafiltration (Final Formula\u00ad tion) [0505] Selected MacroCap Q fractions were combined and concentrated and using 10 KD Pellicon mini (Millipore) at a feed pressure <20 psi and retentate <8 psi, followed by IOx diafiltration with 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 to achieve a final protein concentration of >5 mg/ml. [0506] 9. Purity Analysis of Proteins Purified with Differ\u00ad ent Methods [0507] One batch (Batch I) was purified through three puri\u00ad fication steps as described above. Another batch (Batch 2) was purified from the same fermented material but the Mac- roCap SP polishing step was omitted. Truncated species of XTEN were detected by SDS-PAGE/silver staining in Mac- roCap Q elution fractions for Batch 2 (FIG. 87A), while the MacroCap Q elution fractions for Batch I were essentially free from truncations (FIG. 87B). These results support that, under the conditions employed, the MacroCap SP step based on the RPl I tag is essential to ensure N-terminal integrity and overall product quality. Example 15 Construction of lx Amino, 9x Thiol-XTEN432 [0508] XTEN_AE432 order to obtain I acid sequence TAEAAGCGTAEAA but with different codon usages. Gel-purification of the PCR products was performed to obtain bands of the right sizes, which were digested with restriction enzymes Sbfl/Bbsl, Bsal/Bbsl and Bsal/Aatll, respectively, as the inserts. Diges\u00ad tion the plasmid which I -R-XTEN_AE432 (C422)-R-H8, was per\u00ad formed with Sbfl/Aatll to remove the fragment of about 290 amino acids within XTEN_AE432 and gel-purification was performed on the remaining large fragment as the vector. Ligation of the vector with the three inserts of PCR products, above, was performed and used to transform BL21 competent cells in order to obtain the construct N-term-RPl I -R-XTEN_ AE432 (C319, C370, with primers CIlBsaIfor-TGGC&AatIICI3-2P to obtain a PCR product of around 360 bp in length. Gel- purification of the band of the right size was performed, followed by digestion with BsaI/AatII as the insert XTEN_ AE120-3Cys, which contains three Cysteine Islands. [0509] Simultaneously, the codon-optimized DNA frag\u00ad ment of XTEN_AE313-6Cys, containing six Cysteine Islands, was designed and synthesized (Genscript). The frag\u00ad ment was digested by the flanking restriction enzymes BsaI/ BbsI and gel-purified as the insert containing the first six Cysteine Islands of XTEN_AE432. Digestion of the plasmid with fragment of XTEN_AE432 _3 Cys andgel-purification was performed to obtain the laige fragment as the vector. Ligation of the vector with the Bsal/Bbsl digested insert of XTEN_AE313-6Cys and BsaI/AatII digested insert of XTEN_AE120-3Cys, above, was performed. The ligated product was used to transform BL21 competent cells in order to obtain the construct the precursor N-term- RPl I -R-AE432_9 Cys-R-H8 (sequence in Table 38, below), the product of which was used to generate I x Amino, 9-Thio- XTEN432 after removal of the N-term-RPl I tag and C-term 8x His-tag by trypsin digestion. The final product contains nine cysteines in the XTEN432 sequence (Seg 177).

The cultures were then shaken overnight at 37\u00b0 C. The starter culture was used to inoculate 2 L of fermentation batch media containing -12.5 g ammonium sulfate, 15 g potassium phos\u00ad phate dibasic anhydrous, 2.5 g sodium citrate BL4 soy g yeast #Y9020); 1.8 L water; 0.5 mL polypropylene gly\u00ad col; 2.5 mL trace elements solution (Amunix recipe 144-1); 17.5 mL IM magnesium sulfate; and 2 mL Kanamycin (50 mg/mL)\u2014in 5 L glass jacketed vessel with a B. BraunBiostat B controller. The fermentation control settings were: pH=6. 9+/-0.1; dO2=10%; dissolved oxygen cascade in stirrer only mode with a range of 125-1180 rpm; air flow of 5 liters per minute of oxygen; initial temperature 37\u00b0 C.; base con\u00ad trol 13% ammonium hydroxide; and no acid control. After 6 hours of culture a 50% glucose feed was initiated at a rate of 30 g/hr. After 20 hours of culture, 25 mL of IM magnesium sulfate and 3 mL of IM IPTG were added. After a total fermentation run time of 45 hours the culture was harvested by centrifugation yielding cell pellets between 0.45-1.1 kilo\u00ad grams in wet weight for all constructs. The pellets were stored frozen at -80\u00b0 C. until further use. Culture samples at mul\u00ad tiple time points in the fermentation were taken, the cells were lysed, then cell debris was flocculated with heat and rapid cooling, clarified soluble lysates were prepared by centrifu\u00ad gation and analyzed by a Bis-Tris manufacturer's specifications with Coomassie stain\u00ad ing. An example of the accumulation of XTEN fusion protein as a function of fermentation run time is shown in FIG. 45. The results showed that the XTEN fusion protein constructs were expressed at fermentation scale with titers >1 g/L, with an apparent MW of about 160 kDa (note: the actual molecular weight are 100 kDa. The observed migration in SDS-PAGE was comparable to that observed for other XTEN-containing fusion proteins). Example 18 Purification of lx Reagent with CBD and His8 describes the purification of a cys\u00ad teine-engineered XTEN comprising a single cysteine Methods: [0514] I . Clarification [0515] 20 gm of cell paste from the fermentation was resus\u00ad pended in 100 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate, pFl 8.0 (Lysis Buffer). Cell lysate was homogenized between 800-900 bars three times in a homogenizer. 50 ml of lysis buffer was used as a chase to retrieve hold-up volume from the homogenizer. The homogenized lysate was incubated in a water bath at 85\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes, followed by quick cooling in an ice water bath for 20 minutes. After the heating & cooling treatment, the lysate was centrifuged at 11000 RPM for 90 minutes in SORVALL centrifuge. After centrifugation, the supernatantwas filtered through two CUNO Bio cap 25 (BC0025L90SP08A) filters. Filters were chased with 40 ml of lysis buffer. The final volume of clarified material was 230 ml. The clarified supernatant was stored at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. [0517] Flydrophobic a first step using hydrophobic CBD tag of XTEN to ensure the capture protein. Toyopearl Phenyl 650M (Part #0014783, TOSOFl Bioscience) was used to pack X K l6 to 15 cm bed height (30 ml column volume). The chromatography was performed using AKTA FPLC (GE Bio- sciences). Toyopearl Phenyl resin was equilibrated with 2 column volume of 20 mM Sodium Phosphate, IM Sodium Sulfate, pFl 8.0 prior to loading. FlIC load was prepared by adding Sodium Sulfate to I M concentration to above clari\u00ad fied lysate (final volume-250 ml). The sample was loaded on FlIC resin (-4 mg/ml resin load) at 2 ml/min. Load was completed by chasing with -9 column volume of equilibrium buffer (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, IM Sodium Sulfate, pFl 8.0) till UV215 was stable. Proteinwas step eluted with 100% B (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, pFl 8.0). A total of 7 column volumes of elution buffer was applied to confirm complete elution (FIG. 46). [0518] Samples were analyzed by 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS- PAGE (non-reducing) to determine elution, fractions El, E2, E3 & E4 were pooled for further processing. The total protein was estimated to be 85 mg in FlIC elution pool, with a 65% step yield determined by step for binding to intact C-terminal Flis-tag of A chromatography column XK26 Toyopearl IMAC 650 M (Part #0014907, TOSOH Biosciences) with 15 cm bed height (85 ml Column volume). The column was equilibrated with 2 column volume of 20 mM sodium phos\u00ad phate, 10 mM imidazole, 0.25 M NaCl, pH 8.0 (equilibrium buffer). IMAC load was prepared by adding 5M NaCl to the HIC elution pool to make 0.25 M NaCl in the final volume. The sample was loaded on IMAC resin at 4 ml/min flow rate. The load was completed by 2 column volumes of equilibrium buffer. Resin was washed with 2 column volumes of 20 mM Sodium Phosphate, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0 to remove salt. A linear elution was performed from 0 to 100% B in 7 column volume with buffer A (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) and buffer B (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, 200 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) followed by 2 CV of 100% B. Presence of imidazole maintained UV 215 above 3500 mAu with AKTA FPLC, so an elution peak was not observed. The flow through, wash and elution fractions were analyzed by 4-12% Bis-Tris non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel (FIG. 48). The gel shows the successful removal of host cell protein and truncated XTEN species (FIG. 48A). Based on the second gel (FIG. 48B), fractions C5, C6 & C l were pooled. Atotal of70mg of protein was estimated in the IMAC elution 4. Trypsin per\u00ad formed at a 1:200 m/m ratio. 0.35 mg of bovine trypsin from pancreas (Sigma, cat # T1426) was incubated with 70 mg of Protein (IMAC elution pool) overnight at 37\u00b0 5,2015 ing SDS-PAGE was performed to confirm that cleavage of the CBD tag was completed as shown in FIG. 49. [0523] 5. Polishing Step: MacroCap Q Chromatography [0524] After separated using MacroCap Q chromatography. An XK 16 column was packed with 18 cm bed height with MacroCap Q (GE Life Sciences, Cat#l 7-5469-02). Trypsin digested IMAC elution pool was incubated for I hour at 37\u00b0 C. with 2 mM TCEP to reduce dimers of XTEN prior to loading on MacroCap Q column. Column was equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0. The sample was loaded at 4 ml/min (-2 mg/ml resin load). Column loading was completed with additional 2 col\u00ad umn volume of 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM TCEP pH 7.0. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of (20 mM HEPES, 2 mM TCEP, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.0). A linear gra\u00ad dient elution from 150 mM NaCl to 500 mM NaCl in 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM TCEP, pH 7.0 buffer was performed over 20 column volumes. UV 215 was observed at a high level during the entire chromatography (FIG. 50) due to presence of TCEP, but the elution peak was observed between 22 to 30 mS/cm. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, silver staining and Cl 8 RP-HPLC. Removal of cleaved CBD was observed in the flow through (FIG. 51A), while very faint bands of XTEN were observed in elution fractions (FIG. 51B) in elution fractions E were observed by silver staining in earlier elution fractions E ll, E12, F12 & F lI as species migrating faster than the main XTEN polypeptide (FIG. 51C). Based on the above results, elution fractions were further analyzed by C l8 RP-HPLC. FIG. 52 shows the stacked chromatography profiles of the RP-HPLC analysis. Earlier elution fractions had wide leading shoulder indicating significant presence of truncated species. Also, these earlier fractions (E12, F12 & F lI) were enriched with proteolysis tags. Based on the above analysis, elution fractions F10, F9, F8, F7 and F6 were pooled. elution pool was analyzed again by Cl 8 RP-HPLC (FIG. 53). The purified protein was found to be 97.5% pure. [0525] 6. Concentration and Diafiltration (Final Formula\u00ad tion) [0526] The MacroCap Q pool was concentrated using Amicon Ultracel-15 (MWCO 10 k) centrifugal device to 5 ml followed by 7x diafiltration with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0 to a final protein concentration of 8.13 mg/ml. Total of 43 mgs of protein was purified from 20 gm of cell pellet. The overall recovery for three step chromatography was estimated at -33%. Example 19 Purification of I x Amino-XTEN Reagent with CBD and His8 Tags [0527] Purification of amino-XTEN was performed essen\u00ad tially as described for the purification of the I x Thiol-XTEN containing one cysteine (see Example 15 for details). 20 gm of cell paste from fermentation was homogenized in 100 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (Lysis Buffer), heat treated and clarified by centrifugation and filtration. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography was used as a first step to capture N-terminal intact protein (FIG. 54). Fractions E2, E3, & E4 were pooled for further processing. IMAC affinity chroma\u00ad tography was used as a capture step to bind intact C-terminal His-tag of XTEN (FIG. 55). per\u00ad formed at 1:200 m/m ratio overnight at 37 C. After trypsin digestion cleaved tags were separated using MacroCap Q chromatography. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE fol\u00ad lowed by silver staining (FIG. 56) and C l8 RP-HPLC (FIG. 57). Based on above analysis elution fractions CIO, Cl I and C l2 were pooled. Elution pool was analyzed again by C l8 RP-HPLC (FIG. 58). Protein was found to be >98% pure. MacroCap Q pool was concentrated using Amicon Ultracel- 15 (MWCO 10 k) centrifugal device at 3000 RPM to 5 ml followed by 7x diafiltration with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0 to final protein concentration to 5.35 mg/ml. Example 20 Purification and Assessment of RPll/His8-XTEN Two-Tag System [0528] Using expression vectors as described above, two- tagged XTEN proteins were constructed to encode fusion proteins with the following amino acid sequences or compo\u00ad nents: MKIKTGARILALSALTTMMFSASA- LAAPTTAGAG-Tag-XTEN_AE869(Aml)-RHHHHH- HHH, where: MKIKTGARILALSALTTMMFSASALA is MalE recognition sequence that is cleaved from the polypep\u00ad tide expressed and transported to the host cell periplasm, APTTAGAG is a spacer, and Tag is from the following (tag name followed by sequence (RPRPKPRPK- PRPKPRPKPRPKPGR). All variations of the conducts with tags were made and the proteins were expressed in E. coli using the methods as described in Example 15. Soluble extracts were prepared from the host cell for SDS-PAGE/ Coomassie staining analysis. By analysis, the N-terminal tag length and amino acid composition did not affect protein expression noticeably (see FIG. 59) for expression of con\u00ad structs with RP7, RP9, R P ll and R6K5P11 Expressed proteins with the RP5, RP7, RP9 and RPl I tags proteins were further tested for binding to MacroCap SP resin. Proteins with longer tags bound more efficiently to cation exchange resin, and remained bound under more stringent wash conditions. Thus RPl I tag was selected as N-terminal tag for purification of XTEN using cation exchange chromatography. An addi\u00ad tional experiment showed that RPll-XTEN-His8 polypep\u00ad tide was efficiently expressed in fermenter and most of the expressed protein was found in the cell pellet fraction (FIG. 60). Example 21 Purification of I x Amino-XTEN Reagent with RP11/H8 Two-Tag System of lx Amino- XTEN was produced by expression in transformed E. coli using a 4 L fermention reaction as described. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at -80\u00b0 C. until use. [0531] 2. Lysis and Clarification [0532] 25 g of cell paste was resuspended in 75 mL of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA. Lysis was performed by passing the resuspended paste US 2015/0037359 Al 188Feb. 5,2015 through a homogenizer at 800-900 bar three times. Homoge\u00ad nate was held at 85\u00b0 C. in a water bath for 15 min before it was quickly cooled down using an ice/water bath until the tem\u00ad perature dropped to below 10\u00b0 C. The treated homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in SLA-3000 rotor for 60 minutes. Supernatant was collected and filtered using a 0.22 pm bottletop filter. [0533] 3. Cation Exchange Capture Step [0534] Cation exchange chromatography was used as a capture step to ensure N-terminal integrity of the product. MacroCap SP resin (GE Healthcare) was selected among several cation exchange media due to its superior capacity and selectivity for the product. A 20 mL MacroCap SP col\u00ad umn was packed in a Redi-Sep housing and equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 20 mM NaCl buffer. The lysate was loaded onto the column by gravity. Three column volumes (CV) of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl was applied as the wash step before protein was step- eluted with 3 CVs of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl. Half CV fractions (10 mL) were collected for elutions and analyzed by 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE (FIG. 61). Elution fractions 2-4 were combined for the subsequent chromatography step. 4. IMAC Polishing Step [0536] A 20-mL ToyoPearl AF-Chelate column was packed in a Redi-Sep column housing and charged with 100 mM nickel sulfate. The column was equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl before the Macro- Cap SP pool was loaded onto the column by gravity. Two wash steps were applied using 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole buffer followed by 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 5 mM imidazole. Product was then eluted from the column using 20 mM sodium phos\u00ad phate, I OOmM imidazole and half CV (IOmL) fractions were collected for 4 CVs of elution. Samples from each step were examined by 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE (FIG. 62). Basedon the gel, elutions 2 and 3 were pooled for further processing. The overall yield was 30%. [0537] 5. Trypsin Digestion of IMAC Elution Pool [0538] digestion of IMAC pool was performed at 1:200 and 1:500 m/m ratio by adding I mg/mL bovine trypsin (Sigma, Cat # Tl 426, Trypsin from Bovine Pancreas) to the IMAC pool. The reaction mixtures were held at 37\u00b0 C. overnight and the completion of digestion was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Pre- and post-digest samples were analyzed by 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE stained by both Coomassie and silver stain (FIG. 63). Fainter staining on Coomassie-stained gel as well as the shifting of the molecule weight for the post-digestion samples, when compared to pre-digestion sample, indicates the successful removal of both N- and C-terminal tags. A silver stained gel showed homogeneous bands after digestion, suggesting the absence of truncated species in the sample, supporting the conclusion that the RPl 1/H8 two-tag system and purification methods provides a homogeneous final XTEN product. Example 22 Purification of XTEN with RPl I and His8 Affinity Tags [0539] I . Expression [0540] The fusion protein RPll-XTEN-His8, with two affinity tags linked to XTEN at the N- and C-terminus, respec\u00adtively, was expressed in E. coli using a 4 L fermention reac\u00ad tion using conditions described. [0541] 2. Lysis and Clarification [0542] After growth, the cells were harvested by centrifu\u00ad gation and frozen at -80\u00b0 C. until use. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 3 ml buffer per gram cell paste). The cells were lysed by passing through an APV homogenizer three times at a pressure of 830-900 bar. Lysis buffer (I ml buffer per gram cell paste) was used as a chase to retrieve hold up volume from the homogenizer. The homog\u00ad enized lysate was incubated in a water bath at 85\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes, followed by quick cooling in ice water bath for 20 minutes. After the heating and cooling treatment, the lysate was centrifuged at 11000 RPM for 90 minutes in a SORVALL centrifuge. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through two CUNO Bio cap 25 (BC0025L90SP08A) filters. The clarified supernatant was stored at 4\u00b0 cap\u00ad ture step for binding the XTEN with an intact C-terminal His-tag. Briefly, the chromatography column BPG140/12 (GE Life Sciences) was packed with 2000 ml Toyopearl IMAC 650 M resin (TOSOH Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 2 column volumes (CVs) of equilibrium buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Clarified cell lysate was adjusted to a final NaCl concentra\u00ad tion of 500 mM using 5 M NaCl stock solution, and then was loaded onto the IMAC resin. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of equilibrium buffer, and then 2 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole pH 8.0, followed by 2 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate, 5 mM Imidazole pH 8.0 to remove salt. Elution was performed with 2 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0. The flow through, wash and elution fractions were analyzed by non\u00ad reducing 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining and the fractions with desired 4. a pol\u00ad ishing step to ensure the N-terminal integrity of the product. MacroCap SP resin (GE Life Sciences) was selected among several cation exchange media due to its superior capacity and selectivity for the product. 1000 ml of MacroCap SP resin was packed in a BPG100/13 (GE Life Sciences) chromatog\u00ad raphy column and equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phos\u00ad phate pH 8.0,20 mM NaCl. The IMAC pool was loaded onto the column and the resin was washed with 2 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 and 2 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of linear gradient from 150 to 500 mM NaCl in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0. Fractions were collected and analyzed by 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. Fractions the with desired prod\u00ad uct were combined for the next step. [0547] 5. Trypsin Digestion of Macrocap SP Elution Pool [0548] Trypsin (Sigma, Trypsin from Bovine Pancreas) digestion of the SP elution pool was performed at 1:200 m/m enzyme/protein ratio overnight Q trypsin digestion, the cleaved tags were sepa\u00ad rated from the final product using Macrocap Q chromatogra\u00ad phy. The BPG100/19 column (GE Life Sciences) was packed US 2015/0037359 Al 189Feb. 5,2015 with 1500 ml column volume of Macrocap Q resin (GE Life Sciences). The trypsin digested Macrocap SP elution pool was incubated for 15 min at 80\u00b0 C. with 20 mM DTT and 2 mM EDTA to reduce disulfide bonds and to inactivate trypsin. The cooled protein solution was diluted to a conductivity below 5 mS/cm with Milli-Q water and loaded onto the Mac\u00ad rocap Q column equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 2 column vol\u00ad umes of 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, then 2 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM TCEP, 150 mM NaCl pH7.0. Theproteinwas eluted with a linear gradient from 150 mM NaCl to 500 mM NaCl in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 in 20 column volumes. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/ silver staining. [0551] 7. Concentration and Diafiltration (Final Formula\u00ad tion) [0552] Selected MacroCap Q fractions were combined and concentrated and using 10 KD Pellicon mini (Millipore) at a feed pressure <20 psi and retentate <8 psi, followed by IOx diafiltration with 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 to achieve a final protein concentration of >5 mg/ml. [0553] 8. Purity Analysis of Proteins Purified with Differ\u00ad ent Methods [0554] One batch (Batch I) was purified through three puri\u00ad fication steps as described above. Another batch (Batch 2) was purified from the same fermented material but the Mac- roCap SP polishing step was omitted. Truncated species of XTEN were detected by SDS-PAGE/silver staining in Mac- roCap Q elution fractions for Batch 2 (FIG. 87A), while the MacroCap Q elution fractions for Batch I were essentially free from truncations (FIG. 87B). These results support that, under the conditions employed, the MacroCap SP step based on the RPl I tag is essential to ensure N-terminal integrity and overall product quality and that the RPl 1/H8 two-tag system and purification methods provides a homogeneous final XTEN product. Example 23 Conjugation of the DBCO-Mal 174)) cysteine-engineered XTEN segment was prepared for reaction as a 193 uM (16 mg/ml) solution in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. DBCO-Maleimide (Click Chemistry Tools, Inc., cat. # A108) was dissolved in DMF to a final concentration of 50 mM. An aliquot of the 3x Thiol- XTEN (5.1 mg, 320 pi) was reduced with 10 mM freshly reconstituted DTT at 70\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes. The protein sample was diluted to 600 pi total volume with water. 1200 pi of 100% acetonitrile was added and the mixture was centri\u00ad fuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed, 1000 pi of 80% acetonitrile was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for I minute. The wash step was repeated once more. The pellet was dissolved in 300 pl 100 mM HEPES pH 7.0. A 7.7 pl 50 mM solution of DBCO-Mal in DMF was added (1:6 molar ratio of 3x Thiol- XTEN to DBCO-Maleimide) and was incubated for 2 hours at 25\u00b0 C. Completion of modification was monitored by C18 RP-HPLC analysis (FIG. 64A). The protein mixture was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) using a 1.6 ml Toyopearl butyl column. Elution was per\u00ad formed with a 30 column volume descending gradient of ammonium sulfate from 1.05 M to 0.3 M in 20 mM Phos\u00adphate, pH 7.0 buffer at 0.5 ml/min flow rate (FIG. 64B). Chromatographic fractions were analyzed by Cl 8 RP-HPLC (FIG. 64C). Example 24 Trypsin Cleavage and Purification of Tagged Precursor [0556] [0557] A double-tagged (CBD/His8) precursor of Coomassie due to the pres\u00ad ence of CBD sequence, while a no-tagged version of XTEN_ AE870_Aml,Cl stains poorly with Coomassie, but can be detected by silver staining. Therefore, trypsin digestion com\u00ad pleteness was monitored using staining (FIG. 65A) and silver staining (FIG. 65B) techniques. The double tagged precursor of XTEN_AE870_Aml,Cl was digested with different ratios of bovine trypsin and proteom- ics grade porcine trypsin (positive control) in 20 mM phos\u00ad phate buffer, pH 8. Overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C. allowed more complete digestion than overnight incubation at 25\u00b0 C. based on detection of remaining Coomassie stained 160 kDa band of double tagged precursor (FIG. 65A: all ratios refer to mass/mass ratio of trypsin to substrate). FIG. 65B shows that 1:100, 1:200 and 1:500 ratio digests trypsin and digests with porcine trypsin resulting diges\u00ad tion XTEN precursor. [0558] MacroCap Q Purification of Trypsin Digested Double Tagged Precursor [0559] 1:200 ratio of bovine trypsin to double tagged pre\u00ad cursor (mass/mass) was used for digestion at 37\u00b0 C. over\u00ad night. FIG. 66A shows >90% conversion of double tagged precursor to digested product. This was demonstrated by disappearance of the Coomassie stained band at -160 kDa after digestion and appearance of 20 kDa CBD fragment. [0560] Trypsin digested material was subjected to step purification using MacroCap Q anion exchange resin and following buffers: A: 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 and B: 20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Digested material was loaded by gravity and eluted in a stepwise man\u00ad ner using 3 column cleaved CBD fragment didnot bind to MacroCap Q under used and was com\u00ad pletely separated from XTEN. Stepwise elution Q only partially separated truncated polypeptides. Better separation was achieved by gradient elu\u00ad tion of XTEN (FIG. 66C). [0561] Test for Residual Trypsin Activity [0562] To test the presence of residual trypsin activity in the final formulated XTEN preparations, a protein sample was mixed with synthetic [G2]GLP2 peptide at 10:1 mass/mass ratio. A positive control for digestion contained [G2]GLP2 peptide and bovine trypsin; A negative control contained [G2]GLP2 peptide only. All samples were incubated over\u00ad night at C. After incubation samples were with 1% TFA subjected HPLC grade Acetonitrile. Analysis was performed using a gradient of 5% B to 50% B over 45 min elution time. FIG. 67 shows the results of RP- HPLC analyses of residual trypsin activity in the XTEN_ AE869(Aml,C2) final preparation. FIG. 67A the US 2015/0037359 Al 190Feb. 5,2015 intact GLP2 peptide (41 min FIG. 67B shows tryptic digest of GLP2 peptide with two characteristic tryptic fragments (33.5 min and 34 min retention time). FIG. 67C shows that GLP2 peptide remained intact after overnight incubation with XTEN and no tryptic fragments were observed. This result indicates that final MacroCap Q purified preparations do not contain any residual trypsin activity. Example 25 Fermentation and Purification of Cysteine-Engineered XTEN for Conjugation [0563] E. coli containing AC292 on a plasmid was grown to saturation overnight in 2xYT and then 200 ml of this culture was used to inoculate a 25 L culture of 2xYT media in a wavebag. Both cultures were in the presence of 50 pg/ml kanamycin. The second culture was grown to an OD600 of - I . Oat 37\u00b0 C., chilled to 26\u00b0 C., and induced with 12 ml of IM IPTG overnight. The cell pellet was harvested at 4000 rpm in a SLA-3000 rotor spinning for 20 minutes. The cell pellet (184 g) was resuspended in 736 ml of20m M TrispH 6.8, 50 mM The cells were lysed with a microf- luidizer at 20,OOOpsi and then heated to 75\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes, followed by rapid cooling on ice for 30 minutes. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation. The clarified lysate was then loaded on to a DE52 column, previously sanitized with NaOH and equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 5 column volumes of 20 mM TrispH 6.8,150 mM NaCl and eluted with 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 6.8, 250 mM NaCl. The pooled elution fractions, were then loaded on to a macrocapQ column, pre\u00ad viously sanitized with NaOH and equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 9 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 9 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl and eluted with 9 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 6.8,250 mM NaCl. The pooled elution fractions were adjusted to a 15% w/v sodium sulfate and then loaded on to a octyl sepharose FF column column, previously sanitized with NaOH and equili\u00ad brated with Tris pH 7.5. The column was washed with 4 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 15% w/v sodium sulfate, and eluted with 4 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5% w/v sodium sulfate. The sample was stored at 4\u00b0 C. and given the lot # API 97. The purified cysteine-engineered XTEN could then serve as a suitable reactant for conjugation with a payload, such as a drug from Table 11, resulting in an XTEN-drug conjugate. Example 26 Conjugation of GLP2-Cys to I x of GLP2-XTEN [0564] A (XTEN_AE869(Aml)) was prepared 67 uM (5.35 mg/ml) solution in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. Sulfo-SMCC (Thermo Scientific, cat. #22322) was prepared fresh as 100 mM solution in DMSO. 10 mg of amino-XTEN (1.87 ml) was mixed with 15-molar excess of sulfo-SMCC (18.7 ul) and incubated for I hr at 25\u00b0 C. Excess cross-linker was removed by centrifugal filtration using Amicon Ultra-15, MWCO 5 k centrifugal device. A volume of 1.8 ml reaction mixture was mixed with 8 ml 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl and centrifuged for 20 min in Sorvall RT6000 centrifuge at 3000 rpm, 4\u00b0 C. The proce\u00addure was repeated two more times. F inal volume of recovered retentate was 1.8 ml. The GLP2-Cys peptide (CSBio, custom synthesis) was dissolved in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl to the final concentration 3 mg/ml. N-Maleimide- XTEN was mixed with 2.3-fold molar excess of GLP2-Cys peptide and was incubated for I hr at 25 \u00b0 C. Completion of the modification was monitored by Cl 8 RP-HPLC. 20 pg protein samples were loaded on Phenomenex Jupiter Cl 8 5 uM 300A 4.6 mmxl50 mm column. Proteins were eluted with 5-50% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and detected by absorbance at 214 nm. Essentially all N-maleim- ide-XTEN was converted into GLP2-Cys-XTEN and electrospray mass spectrom\u00ad etry (ESI-MS analysis of samples on 100 pg pro\u00ad tein samples desalted using NanoSep 3K Omega centrifugal devices (Pall Corp.).

Spectra were acquired in 800-1600 amu range and reconstructed into zero-charge spectra using Bayesian Protein Reconstruction Software) (FIG. 68). Umeacted XTEN and GLP2 peptide were sepa\u00ad rated from (MacroCap Q) and hydrophobic interaction (Toyopearl Phe\u00ad nyl) chromatographies. The results of RP-HPLC and MS analyses demonstrated the high yield and purity of the reac\u00ad tants and final product (FIG. 68). Example 122 uM (9.84 mg/ml) solution in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. GLP2-N-Maleimide peptide (CSBio, custom synthesis) was dissolved in DMSO to the final concentration 3 mg/ml. Ix Thiol-XTEN (8.8 mg in 900 pl) was mixed with 3-fold molar excess of GLP2-N-Mal peptide and incubated for I hr at 25\u00b0 C. Completion of the modification and the resulting conjugate was monitored by C l8 RP-HPLC (20 pg protein samples were loaded on Phe- nomenex Jupiter Cl 8 5 uM 300 A 4.6 mmxl 50 mm column. Proteins were eluted with 5-50% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid detected nm) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS analysis of samples was performed on 100 pg protein samples desalted using NanoSep 3K Omega centrifugal devices (Pall Corp.).

Spectra were acquired in 800-1600 amu range and reconstructed into zero-chaige spectra using Baye\u00ad sian Protein Reconstruction Software.) The results of the analysis are shown in FIG. 69. The GLP2-XTEN conjugate was purified by preparative 300 using 5-50% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA as mobile phase (see FIG. 70A). HPLC-purified GLP2-XTEN conjugate was analyzed using Phenomenex Jupiter C18 5 uM 300 A 4.6 mmx 150 mm column (see FIG. 70B). Theield of purified GLP2-XTEN conjugate was 6.2 prepared as a 150 uM (12 mg/ml) solution in 20 mM US 2015/0037359 Al 191Feb. 5,2015 HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. DBCO-Maleimide (Click Chemistry Tools, Inc., cat. # A108) was dissolved in DMF to a final concentration of 50 mM. A volume of 200 ul (2.4 mg) lx Thiol-XTEN was adjusted to 100 mM HEPES pH 7.0 using a IM stock solution. A 1.2 pi volume of 50 mM DBCO- Mal in DMF was added to the protein solution (1:2 molar ratio of lx Thiol-XTEN to DBCO-Maleimide reagent) and was incubated for I hr at 25\u00b0 C. Completion of the modification reaction was monitored by C l8 RP-HPLC (FIG. 71 A). The protein mixture was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) using a 1.6 ml Toyopearl Butyl col\u00ad umn. Elution was performed with a 30 column volume of a descending gradient of ammonium sulfate from 1.05 M to 0.3M in 20 mM Phosphate, pH 7.0 buffer at 0.5 ml/min flow rate (FIG. 71B). Chromatographic fractions were analyzed by C l8 RP-HPLC (FIG. 71C). Example 29 Preparation of a Bispecific from Monospecific XTEN Precursors Linked by the N-Termini [0567] The example describes the creation of an XTEN- payload composition by linking two different XTEN-payload precursors in an N- to N-terminus configuration; one with a payload A and one with a payload B, resulting in a bispecific conjugate. [0568] As a first step, XTEN molecules containing (cysteine-engineered XTEN) are prepared using a RPl I-His8 two-tag purification system, described above, and are formulated in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. A Payload A-maleimide is dissolved in aqueous solution 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, DMF or DMCO or any other appropriate solvent depending on reagent solubility. The Payload A-ma- leimide is added to the cysteine-engineered XTEN in a 2-6 molar excess over XTEN and incubated for I hr at 25\u00b0 C. Completion of modification is monitored by Cl 8 RP-HPLC. The resulting Payload A-XTEN conjugate is purified from contaminants unreacted RP-HPLC. mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. Next, the Payload A-XTEN conjugate is further DBCO-sulfo- NHS ester the XTEN and incubat\u00ad ing 1-2 hrs at 25\u00b0 C. Completion of the modification is moni\u00ad tored by analytical C l8 RP-HPLC. If the conjugation efficiency is low (for example, <90%) or multiple unspecific products are formed, the DBCO-PayloadA-XTEN conjugate purified significant side products, the DBCO-Payload A-XTEN conjugate is purified from excess reagent by buffer exchange using a 10-30 kDa MWCO centrifugal device, acetonitrile precipitation or anion exchange chromatography. [0569] To create the second XTEN-payload precursor, a Payload B-maleimide is dissolved in aqueous solution 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, DMF or DMCO or any other appropriate solvent depending on reagent solubility. Payload B-maleim- ide is added to the second cysteine-containing XTEN in 2-6 molar excess over XTEN concentration and incubated for I hr at 25\u00b0 C. Completion of modification is monitored by ana\u00ad lytical C l8 RP-HPLC. The resulting Payload B-XTEN C4-C18 RP-HPLC. The Payload B-XTEN conjugateis HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. Azide-PEG4-NHS ester is added in 10-50 molar excess to the Payload B-XTEN and incubated I -2 hrs at 25\u00b0 C. Completion of modification is monitored by Cl 8 RP-HPLC. If the con\u00ad jugation efficiency is low (for example <90%) or multiple unspecific products are formed, the azide-Payload B-XTEN conjugate is purified of DBCO-NHS ester conjugation is high (>90%) with no significant side products, the azide-Payload B-XTEN conjugate is purified from excess reagent by buffer exchange using a 10-30 kDa MWCO centrifugal device, acetonitrile precipitation or anion exchange chromatography. The final product is created by mixing purified and concen\u00ad trated DBCO-PayloadA-XTEN and azide-Payload B-XTEN proteins in an equilmolar ratio in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0 buffer, 50 mM NaCl and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for I hr or longer until the reaction is complete. Completion of modification is monitored by C4 or Cl 8 RP-HPLC. If necessary, the bispe\u00ad chromatog\u00ad raphy or of a Trimeric Conjugate Precursors Linked by the XTEN-payload precursors will be prepared as N-terminal fusions of a Payload A linked to an XTEN molecule; e.g. of lengths ranging from AE144 to AE890, containing a single cysteine at the C-terminus (pre\u00ad pared and purified as described in Example 25). Purified precursors are formulated in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. Tris-(2-maleimidoethyl)amine (TMEA, Thermo TMEA are mixed and incubated for I hr at 25\u00b0 C. Completion of the modification is monitored by C4 or Cl 8 RP-HPLC or size exclusion chromatography. The resulting trivalent Pay- load A-XTEN conjugate is purified from protein reactants or partial product mixture by hydrophobic interaction of [0571] Purified protein derived from AC272, lot # AP197, was labeled with FITC maleimide. The sample was reduced by incubating at room temperature with 5 mM TCEP for I hour. The sample was then desalted into PBS using DG-10 columns. The sample was labeled by adding a 25-fold molar excess of FITC-maleimide in DMSO and incubating at room temperature for 2 hours. Note that the volume adjusted such that the DMSO concentration was <5% of total solvent. The reaction was quenched by adding 2 mM DTT and then the sample was digested overnight with TEV protease. The sample was diluted two fold with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 and loaded onto a macrocapQ column, previously sanitized with NaOH and equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 135 mMNaCl, 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 175 mM NaCl and eluted with 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5,250 mM NaCl. The pooled elution fractions were then US 2015/0037359 Al 192Feb. 5,2015 digested with TEV over 60 hours at 4 C. to complete the digestion. The digested samples were then twice passed over a I ml perloza column previously sanitized with NaOH and equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 135 mM NaCl. To remove any free FITC the sample was then dialyzed against 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 135 mM NaCl using a 10,000 MWCO membrane. Co-migration of the OD214 protein signal and OD495 FITC signal in a SEC column indicate successful conjugation of the XTEN with the label, with minimal free dye contamination (FIG. 72B). The successful conjugation is also indicated by apparent large MW of the protein with FITC fluorescence in SDS PAGE (FIG. 72A). Example 32 Purification GFP-X-XTEN [0572] GFP cross-linker with an amine reactive group couple to the GFP lysines and a cysteine reactive group to couple to the free cysteine engineered into the XTEN in AC292. GFP was labeled with bi-functional cross-linker sulfo-SMCC by incubating at room temperature for 2 hours. The protein was desalted into PBS using DG-10 columns to remove free sulfo-SMCC. Purified protein derived from AC272, lot # A PI97 was reduced and desalted into PBS on DG-10 columns and mixed with the labeled GFP to allow for cross-linking. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 2 mM DTT and TEV added to remove the CBD domain in a overnight incubation at 4\u00b0 C. The following day additional TEV was added to complete the digestion with an additional 60 hour 4\u00b0 C. incubation. Following TEV digestion the sample was dilute to 100 ml in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 and loaded onto a macrocapQ column, previously sanitized with NaOH and equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 5 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl. The peak elution fractions were pooled and stored at 4\u00b0 C. Cross- linking was confirm by co-migration of the OD214 protein signal andOD395 GFP signal in a SEC column, with the SEC output shown as overlays in FIG. 73. Example 33 Pharmacokinetics of GFP-XTEN and FITC-XTEN FITC-XTEN cross-linked conjugates prepared as described in the Examples above were tested in cynomolgus monkeys. GFP-XTEN and FITC-XTEN were administered to male cynos IV at 2 mg/kg and dose volumes of 0.77 and 0.68 mL respectively. Blood samples (1.0 mL) were collected into prechilled heparinized tubes at predose, 2,4, 8,24,48,72,96, 120, 168, 216, 264, 336, 388, 432, 504 hour time points, and processed into plasma. Quantitation was performed by ELISA assay using the anti-XTEN antibody for both capture and detection in the case of GFP-XTEN and anti-XTEN capture and anti-FITC detection in the case of FITC-XTEN. A non-compartmental analysis was performed in WinNonLinwith all time points included in the fit to determine the PK parameters. The pharmacokinetic results are summarized in Table 40 and FIG. 74. The data show XTEN can extend the half-life of molecules to which it is chemically conjugated in a manner comparable to genetic fusions to payloads of similar size. TABLE in cynomolgus monkeys to deter\u00ad mine the effect of composition and length of the unstructured polypeptides on PK parameters. Blood samples were ana\u00ad lyzed at various times after injection and the concentration of GFP in plasma was measured by ELISA using a polyclonal antibody against GFP for capture and a biotinylated prepara\u00ad tion of the same polyclonal antibody for detection. Results are summarized in FIG. 75. They show a surprising increase of half-life with increasing length of the XTEN sequence. For example, a half-life of 10 h was determined for GFP-XTEN_ L288 (with 288 amino acid residues in the XTEN). Doubling the length of the unstructured polypeptide fusion partner to 576 amino acids increased the half-life to 20-22 h for multiple fusion protein constructs; Te., GFP-XTEN_L576, GFP- XTEN_AF576, GFP-XTEN_Y576. A further increase unstructured polypeptide fusion partner length to 836 resi\u00ad dues resulted in a half-life of 72-75 h for XTEN_AD836- GFP Thus, increasing the polymer length by 288 residues from 288 to 576 residues increased in vivo half-life by about 10 h. However, increasing the polypeptide length by 260 residues from 576 residues to 836 residues increased half-life by more than 50 h. These results show that there is a surprising threshold of unstructured polypeptide length that results in a greater than proportional gain in in vivo half-life. Thus, fusion proteins comprising extended, unstructured polypeptides are expected to have the property of enhanced pharmacokinetics compared to polypeptides of shorter lengths.

Example 40 Comparison of Viscosity in Solutions of Branched Versus Linear XTEN [0583] The viscosity of linear and branched XTENs (the latter as trimeric or tetrameric configurations) can be mea\u00ad sured using various types of viscometers and rheometers. For example one can measure the time required to draw I mL of liquid into a syringe through a 30 G needle as described by Miller, M. A., et al. (2010) Langmuir, 26:1067. In order to compare monomeric linear versus trimeric tetrameric con\u00ad figurations of XTENs to be for viscosity, constructs having equivalent molecular weights for the XTEN amino acid com\u00ad ponent are prepared and then solutions are made at fixed, equivalent concentrations of protein at 20, 50, 100 mg/ml each. The solutions are then are evaluated using the method of Miller. Using the method, data are obtained with known stan\u00ad dards to prepare a standard curve, and then the XTEN solu\u00ad tions are measured. It is expected that results will show that the viscosity of equimolar solutions of XTENs with similar molecular weight will be significantly decrease with increas\u00ad ing branching; a conjugate of 3 arms of XTEN288 will have significantly lower viscosity compared to an equal concen\u00ad tration of linear XTEN864, even though they have equivalent numbers of amino acids. Similarly, it is expected that a con\u00ad US 2015/0037359 Al 195Feb. 5,2015 figuration with 4 arms of XTEN216 will have even lower viscosity than a conjugate with 3 arms of XTEN288.

Also, the IA-XTEN con\u00ad Activity and Specificity [0586] LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugates are assessed for in vitro activity Each LHRH-XTEN-drug con\u00ad jugate, its corresponding non-targeting XTEN-drug molecule and its respective free drug control are tested in a CellTiter- Glo anti-proliferation assay against a panel of LHRH receptor positive and negative cell lines listed in Table 41. Appropriate assay conditions, including optimal cell density and incuba\u00ad tion time are determined using the respective free drug as control. LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugates are tested as follows: cells in log-phase are collected, counted and plated at pre\u00ad determined cell density in a 96-well microtiter assay plate. Adherent cells are allowed to attach to the plate by an over\u00ad night incubation at 37\u00b0 C. with an atmosphere CO2. The LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugates and corresponding con\u00ad trols are introduced using appropriate dose range dilutions, in duplicate, and the plates are incubated for an additional 2-5 days. After the appropriate incubation period, CellTiter-Glo reagent is added to each well, mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker. The plate is then centrifuged at 90xg and incubated at room temperature for an additional 10 minutes to stabilize the luminescent signal. Luminescence signals are then read on a luminometer and the IC50 (half maximal inhibi\u00ad tory concentration) values are calculated with GraphPad Prism or equivalent software. Quantitative comparisons of the IC50 values will enable ranking of the constructs' activity for inhibition of cell growth and selectivity against LHRH receptor positive versus negative cell lines. It is expected that the results would support the finding that the LHRH-XTEN- drug conjugates will show highly selective potent killing on LHRH receptor positive cells but not on LHRH receptor negative cells. This will be in contrast to the free drug moiety whereby no discrimination in cytotoxicity is expected between LHRH receptor positive and negative cell lines. The XTEN-drug control is expected to yield poor cytotoxic activ\u00ad ity. LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugates with favorable activity and cell line selectivity relative to controls will be further verified for LHRH receptor association by the addition of free competitive LHRH peptide in the assay, resulting in impaired LHRH-XTEN-drug cytotoxicity, further verifying the selec\u00ad tive activity of the constructs.

Each folate-XTEN- drug conjugate, its corresponding non-targeting XTEN-drug molecule and respective free drug control are tested in a CellTiter-Glo anti-proliferation assay against a panel of folate receptor positive and negative cell lines listed in Table 42. As culture media contain high folic acid content, cells will be grown and the assay performed in folic acid free-media calf of (heat-inactivated FCS sufficient for folate recep\u00ad tor expressing cells to survive and proliferate). Appropriate assay conditions are established, including optimal cell den\u00ad sity and incubation times, using folate-free media containing 5-10% FCS using the respective free drug as control. Folate- XTEN-drug conjugates are then tested as follows: cells in log-phase are collected, counted and plated at pre-determined cell density in 96-well microtiter assay plates. Adherent cells are allowed to attach to the plate by an overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2. Folate-XTEN-drug conjugates and controls are introduced using appropriate dose range dilutions, in duplicate, and the plates are incubated for an additional 2-5 days. After the appropriate incubation period, CellTiter-Glo reagent is added to each well and is mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker. The plate is then centrifuged at 90xg and incubated at room temperature for an additional 10 minutes to stabilize the luminescent signal.

The stability of LHRH-XTEN-dmg conjugate can be assessed either by the amount of free dmg released or the integrity of the LHRH-XTEN-dmg conjugate over time. Free dmg is quantitated with RP-HPLC and/or LC-MS/MS whereas the amount of intact LHRH-XTEN-dmg conjugate is determined using an XTEN/dmg and/or an LHRH/dmg ELISA. [0589] For RP-HPLC analysis, plasma samples are treated with organic solvents such as acetonitrile or acetone to pre\u00ad cipitate proteins. Soluble fractions are evaporated under vacuum, redissolved in loading solutions and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Analytes are detected by UV absorption at wave\u00ad lengths specific for the particular dmg, compared to known dmg standards. For example, doxombicin is detected at 480 nm. For LC-MS/MS analysis, plasma samples are treated with organic solvents such as acetonitrile or acetone to pre\u00ad cipitate proteins. Soluble fractions are evaporated under vacuum, redissolved in loading solutions and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Analytes are detected and quantitated by triple quadmpole tandem mass spectrometry, compared to known dmg standards. Parental ion-daughter ion pairs will be deter\u00ad mined experimentally for each dmg. For quantitative ELISA, optimal concentrations of antibodies for LHRH-XTEN-dmg conjugate in the ELISAs are determined using criss-cross serial dilution analysis. An appropriate capture antibody rec\u00ad ognizing one component of the conjugate is coated onto a 96-well microtiter plate by an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0 C. The wells are blocked, washed and semm stability samples added to the wells, each at varying dilutions to allow optimal capture of the LHRH-XTEN-dmg conjugate by the coated antibody. After washing, detection antibody recognizing another component of the conjugate is added and allowed to bind to the conjugate captured on the plate. Wells are then washed again and either streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (complementary to biotinylated version of detection anti\u00ad body) or an appropriate secondary antibody-horseradish per\u00ad US 2015/0037359 Al 197Feb. 5,2015 oxidase (complementary to non-biotinylated version of detection antibody) is then added. After appropriate incuba\u00ad tion and a final wash step, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) sub\u00ad strate is added and the plate read at 450 nM. Concentrations of intact conjugate are then calculated for each time point by comparing the colorimetric response to a calibration curve prepared with LHRH-XTEN-drug in the relevant plasma type. The tl/2 of the decay of the conjugate in human, cyno and mouse serum is then defined using linear regression analysis of the log concentrations vs. time. Example 46 InVitro Serum Stability of Folate-XTEN-Drug Conjugates [0590] As a measure of stability, folate-XTEN-drug conju\u00ad gates are incubated independently in normal human, cyno- molgus monkey and mouse plasma at 37\u00b0 C. for up to 2 weeks with aliquots removed at periodic intervals and stored at -80\u00b0 C. until analysis. The stability of folate-XTEN-drug conju\u00ad gate is assessed either by the amount of free drug or the integrity of the folate-XTEN-drug conjugate over time. Free drug is quantitated with FlPLC and/or LC-MS/MS whereas the amount of intact folate-XTEN-drug conjugate is deter\u00ad mined using an XTEN/drug and/or folate/drug ELISA. [0591] For RP-FlPLC analysis, plasma samples are treated with organic solvents such as acetonitrile or acetone to pre\u00ad cipitate proteins. Soluble fractions are evaporated under vacuum, redissolved in loading solutions and analyzed by RP-F1PLC. Analytes are detected by UV absorption at wave\u00ad length specific for a particular drug, compared to known drug standards. For example, doxorubicin is detected at 480 nm. For LC-MS/MS analysis, plasma samples will be treated with organic solvents such as acetonitrile or acetone to precipitate proteins. Soluble fractions will be evaporated in vacuum, redissolved in loading solutions and analyzed by RP-F1PLC. Analytes will be in-line detected and quantitated by triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Parental ion-daughter ion pairs will be determined experimentally for each drug. Calibration standards will be prepared by adding known amounts of free drug to corresponding plasma type and will be treated in parallel with experimental samples. For quanti\u00ad tative ELISA, optimal concentrations of antibodies for folate- XTEN-drug in the ELISAs is determined using criss-cross serial dilution analysis. An appropriate capture antibody recognizing one component of the conjugate is coated onto a 96-well microtiter plate by an overnight incu\u00ad bation at 4\u00b0 C. The wells are blocked, washed and serum stability samples added to the wells, each at varying dilutions to allow optimal capture of the folate-XTEN-drug conjugate by the coated antibody. After washing, detection antibody recognizing another component of the conjugate is added and allowed to bind to the conjugate captured on the plate. Wells are then washed again and either streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (complementary to biotinylated version of detec\u00ad tion antibody) radish peroxidase (complementary to non-biotinylated ver\u00ad sion of detection antibody) is then added. After appropriate incubation and a final wash step, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate is added and the plate is read at 450 nM. Concentrations of intact conjugate are then calculated for each time point by comparing the colorimetric response to a calibration curve prepared with folate-XTEN-drug in the rel\u00ad evant plasma type. The tl/2 of the decay of the conjugate inhuman, cyno and mouse serum is then defined using linear regression analysis of the log concentrations vs. time. Example 47 In Vivo and Ex Vivo Imaging of LHRH-XTEN-Cy5.5 Conjugate [0592] A Cy5.5 fluorescent tagged LFIRFl-XTEN molecule is used as a surrogate to investigate the targeting and biodis\u00ad tribution efficiency of LFIRH-XTEN-drug conjugates. Experiments will be carried out in nude mice bearing subcu\u00ad taneous grown xenografts of LITRE! receptor positive tumor cells using in vivo, followed by ex vivo, fluorescence imaging with IVIS 50 optical imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, Mass.). In brief, female nu/nu mice bearing LHRH receptor positive tumor cells are given a single intra\u00ad venous injection of high or low dose LHRH-XTEN-Cy5.5 and corresponding doses of non-targeting Cy5.5 tagged XTEN control. Whole body scans are acquired pre-injection and then at approximately 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-injec\u00ad tion on live anesthetized animals using the IVIS 50 optical imaging system. After measuring the distribution of fluores\u00ad cence in the entire animal at the last time point of 72 h, tumor and healthy organs including liver, lung, heart, spleen and kidneys are excised and their fluorescence registered and processed by the imaging system. Cy5.5 excitation (615-665 nm) and emission (695-770 nm) filters are selected to match the fluorescence agents' wavelengths. Small and medium binning of the CCD chip is used and the exposure time opti\u00ad mized to obtain at least several thousand counts from the signals observable in each mouse in the image and to avoid saturation of the CCD chip. To normalize images for quanti\u00ad fication, a background fluorescence image is acquired using background excitation and emission filters for the Cy5.5 spectral region. The intensity of fluorescence is expressed as different colors with blue color reflecting the lowest intensity and red being indicative of the highest intensity, and the resulting images are used to assess the uptake of the conju\u00ad gates and controls. Example 48 InVivo and ExVivo Folate-XTEN-Cy5.5 Conjugates [0593] A Cy5.5 fluorescent tagged folate-XTEN molecule is used as a surrogate to investigate the targeting and biodis\u00ad tribution efficiency of folate-XTEN-drug conjugates. Experi\u00ad ments will be carried out in nude mice bearing subcutaneous grown xenografts of folate receptor positive tumor cells using in vivo, followed by ex vivo, fluorescence imaging with IVIS 50 optical imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkin\u00ad ton, Mass.). As culture media contain high folate content, folate receptor positive tumor cells to be transplanted onto these mice will be grown in folate-free cell culture media containing 5-10% heat-inactivated FCS with no antibiotics. Similarly, normal rodent chow contains a high concentration of folic acid; nude mice used in this study will be maintained on folate-free diet 2 weeks prior to tumor implantation and for the duration of the imaging analysis to reduce serum folate concentration. [0594] In brief, female nu/nu mice bearing folate receptor positive tumor cells are given a single intravenous inj ection of high or low dose folate-XTEN-Cy5.5 and corresponding doses of non-targeting Cy5.5 tagged XTEN control. Whole US 2015/0037359 Al 198Feb. 5,2015 body scans are acquired pre-injection and then at approxi\u00ad mately 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-injection on live anesthe\u00ad tized animals using the IVIS 50 optical imaging system. After measuring the distribution of fluorescence in the entire ani\u00ad mal at the last time point of 72 h, tumor and healthy organs including liver, lung, heart, spleen and kidneys are excised and their fluorescence registered and processed by the imag\u00ad system. Cy5.5 excitation (615-665 nm) and emission filters are selected to match the fluorescence agents' wavelengths. Small and medium binning of the CCD chip is used and the exposure time optimized to obtain at least several thousand counts from the signals that were observable in each mouse in the image and to avoid saturation of the CCD chip. To normalize images for quantification, a background fluorescence image is acquired using background excitation and emission filters for the Cy5.5 spectral region. The inten\u00ad sity of fluorescence is expressed as different colors with blue color reflecting the lowest intensity and red being indicative of the highest intensity, and the resulting images are used to assess the uptake of the conjugates and controls. Example 49 Pharmacokinetic Analysis of LHRH-XTEN-Drug Conjugates [0595] The in vivo pharmacokinetics of LHRH-XTEN- drug constructs are assessed using standard methods for pro\u00ad tein compositions using mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys, and dogs. Compositions of LHRH-XTEN-drug constructs are provided in an aqueous buffer compatible with vivo saline). The are administered at appropriate doses and via multiple routes: most preferably via intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Blood samples are collected at appropriate time points rang\u00ad ing from 0.08 to 504 hours, and processed into plasma. Plasma samples are analyzed for concentration of LHRH- XTEN-drug conjugates by one of a variety of methods, including ELISA, HPLC and/or LC-MS/MS. ELISA analysis are performed using a sandwich ELISA format that can rec\u00ad ognize 2 components of recognizing one component of the LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate is coated onto wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The wells are blocked, washed and plasma samples are then added to the wells at varying dilutions to allow capture of the conjugate by the coated antibody. Wells are then washed extensively, and bound protein detected using either a bioti\u00ad nylated antibody or an appropriate secondary antibody against the second LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate compo\u00ad nent. Wells are then washed again and streptavidin-horserad- ish peroxidase (complementary to the biotinylated detection antibody) or a secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase (complementary to a non biotinylated detection antibody) is then added. After appropriate incubation and a final wash step, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate is added and the plate is read at 450 nM. Concentrations of conjugate are then calculated for each time point by comparing the colorimetric response to a LHRH-XTEN-drug calibration curve. Pharma\u00ad cokinetic parameters are calculated using the WinNonLin software package. [0596] For RP-HPLC analysis, plasma samples are treated with organic solvents such as acetonitrile or acetone to pre\u00adcipitate proteins. Soluble fractions are evaporated in vacuum, redissolved in loading solutions and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Analytes are detected by UV absorption at wavelength spe\u00ad cific for a particular drug.

Parental ion- daughter ion pairs are determined experimentally for each drug. Calibration standards are prepared by adding known amounts of free drug to corresponding plasma type and are assayed in parallel with experimental samples. [0598] It is expected that the results would support the finding that addition of an XTEN to LHRH and drug moiety will greatly increase the terminal half-life and enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of targeting and drug moiety not linked to XTEN. Example 50 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Conjugates [0599] The in vivo pharmacokinetics of folate-XTEN-drug constructs are assessed using standard methods for protein compositions using mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys, and dogs. As normal feed contains a high concentration of folic acid (approx. 6 mg/kg mouse chow), animals to be used in pharmacokinetic studies of folate conjugates will be main\u00ad tained on folate-free diet for 2 weeks prior to study initiation and for the duration of the study. The compositions are admin\u00ad istered at appropriate doses and via multiple routes: most preferably via intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Blood samples are collected at appropriate time points ranging from 0.08 to 504 hours, and processed into plasma. Plasma samples are analyzed for concentration of folate-XTEN-drug conju\u00ad gates by a variety of methods including ELISA, HPLC and/or LC-MS/MS. [0600] ELISA analysis are performed using a sandwich ELISA format that can recognize 2 components of the folate- XTEN-drug conjugate, recognizing one component of the folate-XTEN-drug conjugate is coated onto wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The wells are blocked, washed and plasma samples are then added to the wells at varying dilu\u00ad tions to allow capture of the conjugate by the coated antibody. Wells are then washed extensively, and bound protein detected using either a biotinylated antibody or an appropri\u00ad ate secondary antibody against the second folate-XTEN-drug conjugate component. Wells are then washed again and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (complementary to the biotinylated detection antibody) or a secondary antibody- horseradish peroxidase (complementary to a non biotinylated detection antibody) is then added. After appropriate incuba\u00ad tion and a final wash step, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) sub\u00ad strate is added and the plate is read at 450 nM. Concentrations of conjugate are then calculated for each time point by com\u00ad paring the colorimetric response to a Al 199Feb. bration curve. calculated using the WinNonLin software package. [0601] For RP-FlPLC analysis, plasma samples are treated with organic solvents such as acetonitrile or acetone to pre\u00ad cipitate proteins. Soluble fractions are evaporated in vacuum, redissolved in loading solutions and analyzed by RP-F1PLC. Analytes are detected by UV absorption at wavelength spe\u00ad cific for a particular drug. For example, doxorubicin is detected at 480 nm. Calibration standards are prepared by adding known amounts of free drug to corresponding plasma type and are assayed in parallel with experimental samples.

Example 51 In Vivo Efficacy and Toxicity Analysis of Conjugates [0604] LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate is intended for tar\u00ad highly potent toxin to LHRH receptor posi\u00ad tive tumor cells. As such, the in vivo pharmacologic activity of LHRH-XTEN-drug constructs can be assessed using human tumor cells expressing LHRH receptor transplanted into nude mice. [0605] Prior to beginning the efficacy study, an initial assessment in nude mice is carried out to establish the maxi\u00ad mum tolerated dose (MTD) of the LHRH-XTEN-drug can\u00ad didates. The MTD, the highest dose that is tolerated by the animal for the study duration, will then be used to calculate the dose range for the efficacy and toxicity study in the stan\u00ad dard xenograft model. Briefly, the MTD experiment is carried out with 5 mice per group evaluating the intravenous admin\u00ad istration of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugates at various dose level, interval and duration. The starting MTD dose and num\u00ad ber of dose groups required is based on scientific literature, knowledge of the targeting LHRH moiety, the nature of the drug moiety conjugated, toxicological properties of closely related compounds, and data from the initial pharmacokinetic studies (see, above). Standard MTD parameters such as reduction in body weight, food and water consumption and signs of piloerection, hunched, behavior patterns, respiratory pattern, tremors, convulsions, prostration and self-mutilation are monitored on a daily basis. The highest dose of LHRH- XTEN-drug that does not cause unacceptable toxicity will be assigned as the MTD. The tumor xenograft study will include 3 to 4 dosing levels of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate and will depend on the results from the MTD study; with other param\u00ad eters depending on the tumor cell line chosen. Table 42 pro\u00ad vides examples of tumor lines that can be used in the xenograft study. Thus, an appropriate number of LHRH receptor positive cells from the relevant human tumor line areinjected subcutaneously and allowed to form tumors, the size of which will be measured with calipers and the volume calculated as 0.5xLxW2, where L=measurement of longest axis in millimeters and W=measurement of axis perpendicu\u00ad lar to L in millimeters. Following randomization of mice containing tumor volume in the desired size range into groups of 8-10 animals, vehicle control, free drug control and LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate is administered intravenously at the chosen doses and interval. Cessation or regression of tumor growth is determined by measuring the tumor size and volume at selected time points with calipers. Body weights and food consumption are measured every I to 2 days to assess gross toxicity. Survival of animals is monitored daily. At the end of the study, all animals are sacrificed and clinical pathology and histopathology on major organs is performed. [0606] It is anticipated that the results would support the finding that the LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate will produce a positive therapeutic index as exhibited by potent efficacy and low systemic toxicity. In contrast, the non-LHRH targeted free drug dosed at equimolar doses is expected to be less potent but highly more toxic. It is expected that the vehicle control will display uncontrolled tumor growth and severe toxicity. Example 52 In Vivo Efficacy and Toxicity Analysis of Folate-XTEN-Drug Conjugates [0607] Folate-XTEN-drug conjugates are intended for tar\u00ad the toxin component to folate receptor posi\u00ad tive tumor cells. The in vivo pharmacologic activity of folate- XTEN-drug constructs is assessed using human tumor cell expressing folate receptor xenograft onto nude mice. Prior to beginning the efficacy study, an initial assessment in nude mice is carried out to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the folate-XTEN-drug candidates. The MTD, the highest dose that will be tolerated by the animal for the study duration, is then used to calculate the dose range for the efficacy and toxicity study in the standard xenograft model. As normal rodent chow contains a high concentration of folic acid (6 mg/kg chow), mice to be used in these studies are maintained on a folate-free diet for 2 weeks prior to study initiation and for the duration of the study. The MTD experi\u00ad ment is carried out with 5 mice per group evaluating the intravenous administration of folate-XTEN-drug conjugates at various dose level, interval and duration. The starting MTD dose and number of dose groups required is based on scien\u00ad tific literature, knowledge of the targeting folate moiety, the nature of the drug moiety conjugated, toxicological proper\u00ad ties of closely related compounds, and data from the initial pharmacokinetic studies (see PK Example above). Standard MTD parameters such as reduction in body weight, food and water consumption and signs of piloerection, hunched, behavior patterns, respiratory pattern, tremors, convulsions, prostration and self-mutilation are carefully monitored on a daily basis. The highest dose of folate-XTEN-drug that does not cause unacceptable toxicity is assigned as the MTD. [0608] The tumor xenograft study includes 3 to 4 dosing levels of folate-XTEN-drug, depending on the results from the MTD study, with other parameters depending on the tumor cell line chosen. Table 42 describes examples of tumor lines that can be used in the xenograft study. To reduce folate content, folate receptor positive tumor cells to be transplanted onto nude mice are grown in folate-free cell culture media US 2015/0037359 Al 200Feb. 5,2015 containing 5-10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum with no antibiotics. Similarly, to reduce serum folate concentration, mice used in the xenograft studies are maintained on folate- free diet 2 weeks prior to tumor implantation and for the duration of the study. An appropriate number of folate recep\u00ad tor positive cells from the relevant line are injected subcuta\u00ad neously and allowed to form tumors, the size of which are measured with calipers and the volume calculated as 0.5xLx W2, where L=measurement of longest axis in millimeters and W=measurement of axis perpendicular to L in millimeters. Following randomization of mice containing tumor volume in the desired size range into groups of 8-10 animals, vehicle control, free drug control and folate-XTEN-drug is adminis\u00ad tered intravenously at the chosen doses and intervals. Cessa\u00ad tion or regression of tumor growth is determined through measuring the tumor size and volume at selected time points with calipers. Body weight and food consumption is mea\u00ad sured every I to 2 days to assess gross toxicity. Survival of animals is monitored daily. At the end of study, all animals are sacrificed and major organs will be removed for clinical pathology and histopathology examination. [0609] It is anticipated that the targeted chemotherapeutic folate-XTEN-drug conjugate will be more effective and less toxic than free cytotoxic drug alone on folate receptor posi\u00ad tive tumors in the mouse model. Example 53 Human Clinical Trial Designs for Evaluating LHRH-XTEN-Drug Conjugates [0610] Targeted chemotherapy is a modem approach aimed at increasing the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy and reducing side effects. LHRH is a peptide that functions in reproductive organs. Because its receptors are particularly concentrated on certain tumors but are not expressed in most normal tissue, the LHRH receptor is an ideal target for selec\u00ad tive destmction of malignant tumors. Indeed, -52% of breast, -80% of ovarian and endometrial, and -85% of prostate cancer specimens is targetable via the LHRH receptor. Of note, LHRH-dependent therapies would be especially useful for triple negative breast tumors, which do not overexpress estrogen or progesterone receptors or HER2 and are therefore unsuitable for treatment with many available targeted dmgs. Patients with advanced endometrial, ovarian, or prostate can\u00ad cer often have particularly poor outcomes, as these malignan\u00ad cies can be prone to recurrence and/or resistant to current treatments. Fusion of a XTEN carrying >1 copy of LHRH to a XTEN bearing dmg molecules to create a targeted pep- tide-drug conjugate is expected to have vastly improved therapeutic index and half-life that will enable dosing at lev\u00ad els way below MTD, reduce dosing frequency and cost (re\u00ad duced dmg required dose). [0611] Clinical evaluation of a LHRH-XTEN-drug compo\u00ad sition is conducted in patients suffering from advanced breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate or bladder cancers, with trials designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of the LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate in humans. Such studies in patients would comprise three phases. First, a Phase I safety and pharmacokinetics study would be conducted to deter\u00ad mine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to characterize the dose-limiting toxicity, pharmacokinetics and preliminary pharmacodynamics in humans. These initial studies could be performed in patients with metastatic or unresectable cancers and for which standard curative or palliative measures couldnot be used or were no longer effective or tolerated, and LHRH receptor positive status in the patients would be an enrollment criteria. The scheme of the phase I study would be to use single escalating doses of LHRH-XTEN-dmg conju\u00ad gate and to measure the biochemical, PK, and clinical param\u00ad eters, permitting the determination of the MTD and the threshold and maximum concentrations in dosage and in cir\u00ad culating drug that constitute the therapeutic window to be used in subsequent Phase II and Phase III trials, as well as defining potential toxicities and adverse events to be tracked in future studies. [0612] Phase II clinical studies of human patients would be independently conducted in LHRH receptor positive advanced (stage 3 or 4) or recurrent breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate or bladder cancer patients. The trial would evaluate the efficacy and safety of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate alone and in combination with a current chemo\u00ad therapy employed in the specific indication. Patients will receive intravenously administered LHRH-XTEN-drug clinical candidate at a dose level and regimen pre-determined in Phase I with or without the standard chemotherapeutic agent. A control arm comprising of the chemotherapeutic agent plus placebo would be included. The primary endpoint would be response rate as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary endpoints will include safety and tolerability, time-to-progression and overall survival. [0613] A phase III efficacy and safety study is conducted in LHRH receptor positive advanced (resistant, recurrent) breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate or bladder cancer patients to test ability to reach statistically significant clinical endpoints such as progression-free-survival as measured by RECIST. The trial will also be statistically powered for over\u00ad all survival as a secondary endpoint with projected enroll\u00ad ment in excess of 400 patients. Efficacy outcomes are deter\u00ad mined using standard statistical methods. Toxicity and adverse event markers are also followed in the study to verily that the compound is safe when used in the manner described. Example 54 Human Clinical Trial Designs for Evaluating Folate-XTEN-Drug Conjugates [0614] Targeted chemotherapy is a modem approach aimed at increasing the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy and reducing its side effects. Folate, also known as folic acid, vitamin B9, is a vital nutrient required by all living cells for nucleotide biosynthesis and function as cofactor in certain biological pathways. The folate receptor is a focus for the development of therapies to treat fast dividing malignancies; in particular ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carci\u00ad noma. While folate receptor expression is negligible in nor\u00ad mal ovary, -90% of epithelial ovarian cancers overexpress the folate receptor, as do many lung adenocarinomas, thereby opening the possibility of directed therapies. Fusion of a XTEN carrying >1 copy of folate to a XTEN bearing >3 dmg molecules to create a targeted peptide-dmg conjugate is expected to improve the therapeutic index and the extended half-life will enable dosing at levels way below maximum tolerated dose (MTD), reduce dosing frequency and cost (re\u00ad duced dmg dose). [0615] Clinical evaluation of folate-XTEN-dmg composi\u00ad tion is conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced tumors or in patients suffering from platinum-re- US 2015/0037359 Al 201Feb. 5,2015 sistant ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma who have failed using other chemotherapies. Clinical trials are designed to determine the efficacy and advantages of the folate-XTEN-drug conjugate over standard therapies in humans. Such studies in patients would comprise three phases. First, a Phase I safety and pharmacokinetics study is conducted to determine the MTD and to characterize the dose-limiting toxicity, pharmacokinetics and preliminary pharmacodynamics in humans. These initial studies could be performed in patients with folate receptor positive status that have relapsed or have refractory advanced tumors and for which standard curative or palliative measures could not be used or were no longer effective or tolerated. The phase I study woulduse single escalating doses of folate-XTEN-drug conjugate and would measure biochemical, PK, and clinical parameters to permit the determination of the MTD and establish the threshold and maximum concentrations in dos\u00ad age and in circulating drug that constitute the therapeutic window to be used in subsequent Phase II and Phase III trials as well as defining potential toxicities and adverse events to be tracked in future studies. [0616] Phase II clinical studies of human patients would be independently conducted in folate receptor positive plati\u00ad num-resistant ovarian cancer patient population, non-small cell lung carcinoma patients having failed numerous chemo\u00ad therapies, and patients suffering from relapsed or refractory advanced tumors. The trials would evaluate the efficacy and safety of folate-XTEN-drug conjugate alone and in combina\u00ad tion with a current chemotherapy employed in the specific indication. Patients will receive intravenously administered folate-XTEN-drug conjugate at a dose level and regimen determined in the Phase I study with or without the standard chemotherapy agent. A control arm comprising of the che\u00ad motherapy agent plus placebo would be included. The pri\u00ad mary endpoint would be response rate as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary endpoints will include safety and tolerability, time-to-progression and overall survival. [0617] A phase III efficacy and safety study is conducted in folate-receptor positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients, non-small cell lung carcinoma patients, or advanced tumor relapsed or refractory patients cancer patients to test ability to reach statistically significant clinical endpoints such as progression-free-survival as measured by RECIST. The trial will also be statistically powered for overall survival as a secondary endpoint with projected enrollment in excess of 400 patients. Efficacy outcomes are determined using stan\u00ad dard statistical methods. Toxicity and adverse event markers are also followed in the study to verify that the compound is safe when used in the manner described. Example 55 Serum Stability of XTEN [0618] A fusion protein containing XTEN_AE864 fused to the N-terminus of GFP was incubated in monkey plasma and rat kidney lysate for up to 7 days at 37\u00b0 C. Samples were withdrawn at time 0, Day I and Day 7 and analyzed by SDS PAGE followed by detection using Western analysis and detection with antibodies against GFP as shown in FIG. 76. The sequence of XTEN_AE864 showed negligible signs of degradation over 7 days in plasma. Flowever, XTEN_AE864 was rapidly degraded in rat kidney lysate over 3 days. The in vivo stability of the fusion protein was tested in plasmasamples wherein the GFP_AE864 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS PAGE as described above. Samples that were withdrawn up to 7 days after injection showed very few signs of degradation. The results demonstrate the resistance of aaT-XTEN to degradation due to serum proteases; a factor in the enhancement of pharmacokinetic properties of the aaT- XTEN fusion proteins. Example 56 Characterization of Secondary Structure of XTEN Linked to Exendin-4 [0619] The XTEN_AE864-Ex4 was evaluated for degree of secondary structure by circular dichroism spectroscopy. CD spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) spectropolarimeter equipped with Jasco Peltier temperature controller (TPC-348WI). The concentration of protein was adjusted to 0.2 mg/mL in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. The experiments were carried out using HELLMA quartz cells with an optical path-length of 0.1 cm. The CD spectra were acquired at 5\u00b0, 25\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 65\u00b0 C. and processed using the J-700 version 1.08.01 (Build I) Jasco software for Windows. The samples were equilibrated at each temperature for 5 min before per\u00ad forming CD measurements. All spectra were recorded in duplicate from 300 nm to 185 nm using a bandwidth of I nm and a time constant of 2 sec, at a scan speed of 100 nm/min. The CD spectrum shown in FIG. 77 shows no evidence of stable secondary structure and is consistent with an unstruc\u00ad tured polypeptide. Example 57 Increasing Solubility and Stability of a Peptide Payload by Linking to XTEN [0620] In order to evaluate the ability of XTEN to enhance the physicochemical properties of solubility and stability, fusion proteins of glucagon plus shorter-length XTEN were prepared and evaluated. The test articles were prepared in Tris-buffered saline at neutral pH and characterization of the Gcg-XTEN solution was by reverse-phase HPLC and size exclusion chromatography to affirm that the protein was homogeneous and non-aggregated in solution. The data are presented in Table 43. For comparative purposes, the solubil\u00ad ity limit of unmodified glucagon in the same buffer was measured at 60 pM (0.2 mg/mL), and the result demonstrate that for all lengths of XTEN added, a substantial increase in solubility was attained. Importantly, in most cases the gluca- gon-XTEN fusion proteins were prepared to achieve taiget concentrations and were not evaluated to determine the maxi\u00ad mum solubility limits for the given construct. However, in the case of glucagon linked to the AF-144 XTEN, the limit of solubility was determined, with the result that a 60-fold increase in solubility was achieved, compared to glucagon not linked to XTEN. In addition, the glucagon-AF144 was evaluated for stability, and was found to be stable in liquid formulation for at least 6 months under refrigerated condi\u00ad tions and for approximately one month at 37\u00b0 C. (data not shown). [0621] The data support the conclusion that the linking of short-length XTEN polypeptides to a biologically active pro\u00ad tein such as glucagon can markedly enhance the solubility properties of the protein by the resulting fusion protein, as well as confer stability at the higher protein concentrations.

An exemplary assay used a TSKGel-G4000 SWXL (7.8 mmx30 cm) column in which 40 pg of purified glucagon fusion protein at a concentration of I mg/ml was separated at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min in 20 mM phosphate pH 6.8, 114 mM NaCl. Chromatogram profiles were monitored using OD214 nm and OD280 nm. Column calibration for all assays were performed using a size exclusion calibration standard from BioRad; the markers include thyroglobulin (670 Glucagon-Yl44, Glucagon-Y72, Glucagon-Y36 are shown as an overlay in FIG. 78. The data show that the molecular weight of each compound is proportional to the length of the attached XTEN sequence. However, the data also show that the apparent molecular weight of each con\u00ad struct is significantly larger than that expected for a globular protein (as shown by comparison to the standard proteins run in the same assay). Based on the SEC analyses for all con\u00ad structs evaluated, the apparent molecular weights, the appar\u00ad ent molecular weight factor (expressed as the ratio of appar\u00ad ent molecular weight to the calculated molecular weight) and the hydrodynamic radius (Ri7 in nm) are shown in Table 44. The results indicate that incorporation of different XTENs of 576 amino acids or greater confers an apparent molecular weight for the fusion protein of approximately 339 kDa to 760, and that XTEN of 864 amino acids or greater confers an apparent molecular weight greater than approximately 800 kDA. The results of proportional increases in apparent molecular weight to actual molecular weight were consistent for fusion proteins created with XTEN from several different motif families; i.e., AD, AE, AF, AG, and AM, with increases of at least four-fold and ratios as high as about 17-fold. Addi\u00ad tionally, the incorporation of XTEN fusion partners with 576 amino acids or more into fusion proteins with the various payloads (and 288 residues in the case of glucagon fused to Y288) resulted with a hydrodynamic radius of 7 nm or greater; well pore size of approxi\u00ad mately nm. Accordingly, it expected that fusion pro\u00ad teins comprising growth and XTEN have reduced renal clear\u00ad ance, contributing to increased terminal half-life and improving the therapeutic or biologic effect relative to a cor\u00ad responding un-fused biologic payload protein.

Y., et al. the Gamier-Os- J, Gibrat J F, Robson B. (1996). GOR method for predicting protein sec\u00ad ondary stmcture from amino acid sequence. Methods Enzy- mol 266:540-553). For a given sequence, the algorithms can predict whether there exists some or no secondary stmcture at all, expressed as total and/or percentage of residues of the sequence that form, for example, alpha-helices or beta-sheets or the percentage of residues of the sequence predicted to result in random coil formation. [0624] Several representative sequences from XTEN \"families\" have been assessed using two algorithm tools for the Chou-Fasman and GOR methods to assess the degree of secondary stmcture in these sequences. The Chou-Fasman tool was provided by William R. Pearson and the University ofVirginia, at the \"Biosupport\" internet site, URL located on the World Wide Web at .fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_ www2/fasta_www.cgi?rm=miscl as it existed on Jun. 19, 2009. The GOR tool was provided by Pole Informatique Lyonnais at the Network Protein Sequence Analysis internet site, URL located on the World Wide Web at .npsa-pbil.ibcp. fr/cgi-bin/secpred_gor4.pl as it existed on Jun. 19, 2008. [0625] As a first step in the analyses, a single XTEN sequence was analyzed by the two algorithms. The AE864 composition is a XTEN with 864 amino acid residues created from multiple copies of four 12 amino acid sequence motifs consisting of the amino acids G, S, T, E, P, and A. The sequence motifs are characterized by the fact that there is limited repetitiveness within the motifs and within the overall sequence in that the sequence of any two consecutive amino acids is not repeated more than twice in any one 12 amino acid motif, and that no three contiguous amino acids of full-length the XTEN are identical. Successively longer portions of the AF 864 sequence from the N-terminus were analyzed by the Chou-Fasman and GOR algorithms (the latter requires aminimum length of 17 amino acids). The sequences were analyzed by entering the FASTA format sequences into the prediction tools and running the analysis. The results from the analyses are presented in Table 45. [0626] The results indicate that, by the Chou-Fasman cal\u00ad culations, short XTEN of the AE and AG families, up to at least 288 amino acid residues, have no alpha-helices or beta sheets, but amounts of predicted percentage of random coil by the GOR algorithm vary from 78-99%. With increasing XTEN lengths of 504 residues to greater than 1300, the XTEN analyzed by the Chou-Fasman algorithm had pre\u00ad dicted percentages of alpha-helices or beta sheets of 0 to about 2%, while the calculated percentages of random coil increased to from 94-99%. Those XTEN with alpha-helices or beta sheets were those sequences with one or more instances of three contiguous serine residues, which resulted in predicted beta-sheet formation. Fiowever, even these sequences still had approximately 99% random coil forma\u00ad tion. [0627] The analysis supports the conclusion that: I) XTEN created from multiple sequence motifs of G, S, T, E, P, and A that have limited repetitiveness as to contiguous amino acids are predicted to have very low amounts of alpha-helices and beta-sheets; 2) that increasing the length of the XTEN does not appreciably increase the probability of alpha-helix or beta-sheet formation; and 3) that progressively increasing the length of the XTEN sequence by addition of non-repetitive 12-mers consisting of the amino acids G, S, T, E, P, and A results in increased percentage of random coil formation. Based on the numerous sequences evaluated by these meth\u00ad ods, it is concluded that XTEN created from sequence motifs of G, S, T, E, P, and A that have limited repetitiveness (defined as no more than two identical contiguous amino acids in any one motif) are expected to have very limited secondary struc\u00ad ture. With the exception of motifs containing three contigu\u00ad ous serines, generally any order or combination of sequence motifs from Table I can be used to create an XTEN polypep\u00ad tide that will result in an XTEN sequence that is substantially devoid of secondary structure, and that the effects of three contiguous serines is ameliorated by increasing the length of the XTEN. Such sequences are expected to have the charac\u00ad teristics described in the XTEN-containing composition embodiments of the invention disclosed herein.

Polypeptide Sequences for Repetitiveness [0628] Polypeptide amino acid assessed for repetitiveness by quantifying the number of times a shorter subsequence appears within the overall polypeptide. For example, a polypeptide of 200 amino acid residues has 192 overlapping 9-amino acid subsequences (or 9-mer \"frames\"), but the number of unique 9-mer subsequences will depend on the amount of repetitiveness within the sequence. In the present analysis, different sequences were assessed for repetitiveness by summing the occurrence of all unique 3-mer subsequences for each 3-amino acid frame across the first 200amino acids of the polymer portion divided by the absolute number of unique 3-mer subsequences within the 200 amino acid sequence. The resulting subsequence score is a reflection of the degree of repetitiveness within the polypeptide. [0629] The results, shown in Table 46, indicate that the unstructured polypeptides consisting of 2 or 3 amino acid types have high subsequence scores, while those of consisting of 12 amino acids motifs of the six amino acids G, S, T, E, P, and A with a low degree of internal repetitiveness, have sub\u00ad sequence scores of less than 10, and in some cases, less than 5. For example, the L288 sequence has two amino acid types and has short, highly repetitive sequences, resulting in a sub\u00ad sequence score of 50.0. The polypeptide J288 has three amino acid types but also has short, repetitive sequences, resulting in US 2015/0037359 Al 211Feb. 5,2015 a subsequence score of 33.3. Y576 also has three amino acid types, but is not made of internal repeats, reflected in the subsequence score of 15.7 over the first 200 amino acids. W576 consists of four types of amino acids, but has a higher degree of internal repetitiveness, e.g., \"GGSG\", resulting in a subsequence score of 23.4. The AD576 consists of four types of 12 amino acid motifs, each consisting of four types of amino acids. Because of the low degree of internal repetitive\u00ad ness of the individual motifs, the overall subsequence score over the first 200 amino acids is 13.6. In contrast, XTEN's consisting of four motifs contains six types of amino acids, each with a low degree of internal repetitiveness have lower subsequence scores; i.e., AE864 (6.1), AF864 (7.5), The results indicate that the combina\u00ad tion of 12 amino acid subsequence motifs, each consisting of four to six amino acid types that are essentially non-repetitive, into a longer XTEN polypeptide results in an overall sequence that is non-repetitive. This is despite the fact that each subsequence motif may be used multiple times across the sequence. In contrast, polymers created from smaller numbers of amino acid types resulted in higher subsequence scores, although the actual sequence can be tailored to reduce the degree of repetitiveness to result in lower subsequence scores.

sequence can be calculated by adding pocket potentials as described by Stumiolo [Stumiolo, T., et al. (1999) Nat Biotechnol, 17: 555]. In the present Example, separate Tepitope scores were calculated for individual ElLA alleles. Table 47 shows as an example the pocket potentials for HLA*0101B, which occurs in high frequency in the Caucasian population. To calculate the TEPITOPE score of a peptide with sequence P1-P2-P3- P4-P5-P6-P7-P8-P9, the corresponding individual pocket potentials in Table 47 were added. The HLA*0101B score of a 9mer peptide with the sequence FDKLPRTSG is the sum of 0 ,-1 .3 ,0 , 0.9, 0,-1.8, 0.09, 0, 0. [0632] To evaluate the TEPITOPE scores for long peptides one can repeat the process for all 9 mer subsequences of the sequences. This process can be repeated for the proteins encoded by other ElLA alleles. Tables 48-51 give pocket potentials for the protein products of ElLA alleles that occur with high frequency in the Caucasian population. [0633] TEPITOPE scores calculated by this method range from approximately - 10 to +10. Elowever, 9 mer peptides that lack a hydrophobic amino acid (FKLMVWY) in Pl position have calculated TEPITOPE scores in the range of -1009 to -989. This value is biologically meaningless and reflects the fact that a hydrophobic amino acid serves as an anchor resi\u00ad due for EiLA binding and peptides lacking a hydrophobic residue in Pl are considered non binders to EiLA. Because most XTEN sequences lack hydrophobic residues, all com\u00ad binations of 9 mer subsequences will have TEPITOPEs in the range in the range of -1009 to -989.

(2012) GLP2-2G-XTEN: a phar\u00ad maceutical protein with improved serum half-life e50630. The conjugate GLP2-2G-XTEN was prepared as described in Example 26 (FIG. 68) and purified by prepara\u00ad tive RP-HPLC (FIG. 70). A GPCR Ca2+ flux mobilization assay was performed using an EMD Millipore Che- miSCREEN human recombinant GLP-2 glucagon family receptor calcium-optimized stable cell line, used according to manufacturer's instructions, with results presented in FIG. HO. Both the recombinant and conjugated GLP2-2G-XTEN were profiled as an eight-point, three-fold serial dilution dose response curve. Dose response curves were fitted using a 4PL-regression plot with respective Y-axis RFU, with data expressed as a percentage of absolute maximum RFU against concentration on the X-axis. Both and 529 InVitro Plasma were independently US 2015/0037359 Al 216Feb. 5,2015 spiked into respective rat, cynomolgus monkey and human plasma. Samples were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for up to 10 days with an aliquot removed at appropriate time interval and stored at -80\u00b0 C. until analysis. The plasma stability of con\u00ad jugated GLP2-2G-XTEN in the various species was com\u00ad pared to that of recombinant GLP2-2G-XTEN on an anti- XTEN/GLP2 ELISA performed in the respective plasma matrices. The anti-XTEN/GLP2 ELISA comprised of the anti-XTEN mouse antibody as a capture antibody and a bioti\u00ad nylated anti-human GLP2 antibody as a detection antibody. As shown in FIG. I l l , the in vitro stability in human plasma of conjugate GLP2-2G-XTEN is comparable to that of recombinant GLP2-2G-XTEN having an calculated stability half-life of >240 h. Similarinvitro stability was also observed with the two GLP2-2G-XTEN proteins in rat and cynomolgus monkey plasma (data not shown). Example 64 Pharmacokinetics of Conjugate GLP2-2G-XTEN in Rats [0636] Female SD strain rats (200-220 g) were randomly assigned into groups of 3 animals each. Recombinant GLP- 2G-XTEN and conjugate GLP2-2G-XTEN were adminis\u00ad tered by subcutaneous injection at 2 mg/kg into each animal. Blood samples (0.2 ml) were collected in pre-chilled heparin\u00ad ized microtainer tubes at pre-dose, 0.08, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 hours after test compound administration. The blood was then processed to plasma and stored immediately at -80\u00b0 C. until analysis. Plasma samples were analyzed using an anti-XTEN/GLP2 ELISA that uses the mouse anti- XTEN antibody as a capture antibody and a biotinylated anti-human GLP2 antibody as a detection antibody. The ELISA was performed using relevant recombinant GLP2- 2G-XTEN or conjugate GLP2-2G-XTEN as the respective ELISA calibration standards (FIG. 112). The calculated half- life of recombinant GLP2-2G-XTEN (36 (\u00b17) h) and conju\u00ad gate GLP2-2G-XTEN (37 (\u00b17) h) was found to be similar. Example 65 Trimeric was prepared by procedure. An of the XTEN protein lx Amino5 Ix Thiol-XTEN432 (XTEN_AE432(Aml,C422)), with one internal cysteine residue, was prepared as a 587 pM (23.23 mg/ml) solution in 20 mM F1EPES, Tris-[2-maleimidoethyl]amine #33043) was dissolved anhydrous DMF to a final concentration 10 mM. TMEA was added to the protein solution to link to the thiol group of the XTEN (5x molar excess of protein over linker). The reaction mixture was incu\u00ad bated for 2 hrs at 25\u00b0 C. and the products of the reaction were analyzed by SEC-F1PLC (Phenomenex BioSep-SEC-s4000 600x7.80 mm, buffer: 50 mM NaCl, flow rate 0.5 ml/min, 70 min). Linear XTEN_432, XTEN_864 and XTEN_1296 (having 432, 864, and 1296 amino acids, respectively) were analyzed under the same conditions to identify reaction products (FIG. 113). Peak I eluted at 28 min, the same time as XTEN 1296 and was identified as a trimer of XTEN _432. Peak 2 eluted at 30.5 min, the same time as XTEN _864 and was identified as a dimer of XTEN _432. Peak 3 eluted at 35 min, the sametime as XTEN_432 and was identified as XTEN_432 for 3xXTEN _432 and the linear molecule XTEN _1296 suggest that the apparent molecular weight and hydrodynamic radius of an XTEN protein is not dependent on its geometric by the following procedure. [0639] I . Synthesis of I xDBCO-XTEN288 [0640] An aliquot of the protein lx Amino-XTEN288 (XTEN_AE288(Aml)) was prepared as a 758 pM (20 mg/ml) solution in 20 mM F1EPES, pFl 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. 2 ml of protein was mixed with 0.1 ml IM FlEPES pFl 8.0 and 0.152 ml of 50 mM DBCO-Sulfo-NHS (Click Chemistry Tools, cat. # A124) dissolved in anhydrous DMF to link the DBCO group to the N-terminal amino group of the XTEN. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 hours at 25\u00b0 C. and analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC (FIG. 114A). The reaction mixture was diluted to 15 mL with 0.01% TFA and pH adjusted to -3 using 10% TFA solution. The protein solution was divided into two equal parts and each fraction was loaded on a preparative C4 RP-HPLC column Vydac C4 250x10 mm Sciences, cat. #214TP510). The protein was eluted with a 180 ml linear 5-50% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.01% TFA at 2 ml/min flow rate. Fractions containing I xDBCO-XTEN288 were adjusted to pH -7 with I M HEPES pH 8 and were concentrated by vacuum evapo\u00ad ration. [0641] 2. Synthesis of 3x Azide-PEG4-TAEA [0642] cat. #225630) was diluted in anhydrous DMF to the final concentration 200 mM. Azido-PEG4-NHS ester (Click Chemistry Tools, cat. # AZ103) was dissolved in anhydrous DMF to the final concentration I M. Azido-PEG4-NHS was mixed in 5-fold molar excess with Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for I hour. 3x Azide-PEG4-TAEA was purified using Cl 8 RP-HPLC using Phenomenex Jupiter C18 5 u 300 A 150x4.60 mm column, buffer A 0.1% TFA in water, buffer B 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile, flow rate I ml/min, gradient 5 to 50% B in 45 min. Chromatographic peaks were collected and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and ESI-MS to detect the product with MW of 966 Da. 3x Azide-PEG4- TAEA was identified as a peak with retention time 33 min (FIG. 114B). The fraction was neutralized using IM HEPES pH 8.0 and concentrated by vacuum evaporation. [0643] 3. Synthesis of the Trimeric XTEN Conjugate [0644] lxDBCO-XTEN288 was prepared as a 7.85 mg/ml (293 uM) solution in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl. 3x Azide-PEG4-TAEA was RP-HPLC purified and formu\u00ad lated in the same buffer. A concentration of the synthesized linker was not determined, and lxDBCO-XTEN288 and 3x Azide-PEG4-TAEA were mixed empirically in various ratios and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 4 hours. Conjugation products using SEC-HPLC (Phenomenex BioSep- SEC-s4000 600x7.80 buffer: 50 mM mM NaCl, flow rate 0.5 ml/min, isocratic elution US 2015/0037359 Al 217Feb. 5,2015 864 were analyzed under the same conditions to identify reaction products (FIG. 115). Peak I eluted at 30.5 min, the same time as XTEN _864 and was identified as a trimer of XTEN288. Peak 2 eluted at 34 min, the same time as XTEN 576 and was identified as a dimer of XTEN _288. Peak 3 eluted at 39 min, the same time as XTEN _288 and was identified as XTEN _288 precursor. Peak 4 corresponded to low molecular weight compounds and was not included into quantitation of XTEN species. The yield of the trimeric XTEN conjugate under the optimized protein/linker ratio was 57%. Essentially identical retention times for trimeric conju\u00ad gate 3xXTEN_288 and linear molecule XTEN_864 con\u00ad firms the earlier observation that the apparent molecular weight and hydrodynamic radius of an XTEN protein is not dependent on its geometric configuration. Example 67 Selective Cytotoxicity of 3xFA(y),3xMMAE-XTEN on KB Cells [0645] The ability to selectively target and kill cells bearing folate receptors was evaluated. Test articles of free MMAE, a non-targeting 3xMMAE-XTEN conjugate using the folate receptor-positive KB cell line. As culture media contain high folic acid content, KB cells were grown in folic acid-free media containing 10% 37\u00b0 C., 5% C02 for at least 7 days prior to the commencement of the cell viability experi\u00ad ment, This medium was also utilized for the execution of the experiment. In brief, KB cells were plated at 10,000 cells per well onto a 96-well microtiter assay plate. KB cells were allowed to adhere to the plate by an overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C., 5% C02. The spent media was then removed and wells designated to contain folic acid competitor received assay medium containing folic acid, while wells not desig\u00ad nated to have folic acid competitor received assay medium only. The plate was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C., 5% C02 before the assay media was aspirated and plate with assay media. Free MMAE, 3xMMAE-XTEN and 3xFA(y), 3xMMAE-XTEN in the presence or absence of folic acid competitor was then added at an appropriate range of doses. The plate was then further incubated for 2-4 h at 37\u00b0 C., 5% C02. Media was then removed, the plate washed and fresh media introduced and the plate was allowed to incubate for an additional 48-72 h. After the appropriate incubation period, CellTiter-Glo reagent was added and the plate was read on a luminometer. The IC50 of each test article was determined using a 4 parameter logistic curve fit using GraphPad Prism. [0646] Results: As shown in FIG. 116, free MMAE drug moiety shows highly potent killing of KB cells, with an IC50 of 0.8 nM, while 3 copies of MMAE conjugated to non\u00ad targeting XTEN resulted in at least a 3 log reduction in cell killing (IC50>1,000 nM). Significantly, the addition of 3 copies of folate targeting domains to the 3xMMAE-XTEN conjugate restored the cell killing, with an IC 50 of 4.2 nM; a level of activity close to that observed for free MMAE. Of equal importance, the introduction of folic acid as a competi\u00ad tor to the targeted conjugate impaired the observed cell killing activity of 3xFA(y),3xMMAE-XTEN on the KB cell line. This reduction from potent cell killing of the folate-XTEN drug conjugate (from 4.2 nM to >1,000 nM) supports the conclusion that the detected cell toxicity was, under theexperimental conditions, facilitated by use of the folate as the targeting mechanism for the drug conjugate against the KB cell line. Example 68 InVitro Cell-Based Screening of Folate-XTEN-Drug Conjugates for Activity and Specificity [0647] The ability to selectively target and kill cells bearing folate receptors using targeted folate-XTEN-drug conjugates is evaluated using an vitro-based ing non-targeting XTEN-drug molecule and respective free drug control will be tested in a CellTiter-Glo anti-prolifera\u00ad tion assay against a panel of folate receptor positive and negative cell lines. Choice of cell lines is based on relevance to proposed clinical application and includes KB, IGROV, culture media contain high folic acid content, cells will be grown and assay per\u00ad formed in folic acid free-media inactivated endogenous level of folic acid sufficient for folate receptor expressing cells to survive and proliferate. Appropriate assay conditions including optimal cell density and incubation time are pre-determined in folate- free media containing 5-10% FCS using the respective free drug as control. Folate-XTEN-drug conjugates are then tested as follows: cells in log-phase are collected, counted and plated at pre-determined cell density onto each well of a 96-well microtiter assay plate. Adherent cells are allowed to attach to the plate by an overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2. Folate-XTEN-drug conjugates and corresponding con\u00ad trols are introduced in a dose range in duplicates and plate incubated for an additional 2 to 5 days. Alternatively, cells can also be pulsed with folate-XTEN-drug conjugates and corre\u00ad sponding controls for 2-6 h, washed, fresh media introduced and allowed to incubate for an additional 48-72 h. After the appropriate incubation period, CellTiter-Glo reagent is added to each well, mixed for 2 minute on an orbital shaker. Plate is then centrifuged at 90 g and incubated at room temperature for an additional 10 minutes to stabilize the luminescent signal. Luminescence signals are then read on a luminometer & IC50S (half maximal inhibitory concentration) calculated with GraphPad Prism or equivalent software. Quantitative comparisons of IC50S will enable ranking of the compounds' activity for inhibition of cell growth and selectivity against folate receptor positive versus negative cell lines. [0649] It is expected that the results would support the finding that the folate-XTEN-drug conjugates will show highly selective potent killing on folate receptor positive cells but not on folate receptor negative cells. This will be in contrast to the free drug moiety whereby no discrimination in the strong cytotoxicity is expected between folate receptor positive and negative cell lines. The XTEN-drug control is expected to yield poor cytotoxic activity. The folate-XTEN- drug conjugate with the most favorable activity and cell line selectivity relative to controls will be further verified for folate receptor association by the addition of free competitive folic acid in the assay and demonstrating impaired folate- XTEN-drug cytotoxicity. US 2015/0037359 Al Vitro Cell-Based Screening of LHRH-XTEN-Drug Conjugates for Activity and Specificity [0650] The ability to selectively target and kill cells bearing LHRH receptors using targeted LHRH-XTEN-drug conju\u00ad gates is evaluated using an in vitro-based molecule and respective control are tested in a CellTiter-Glo anti-prolifera\u00ad tion assay against a panel of LHRH receptor positive and negative cell lines. Choice of cell lines is based on relevance to proposed clinical application and optimal cell density and incubation time, are pre-determined using the respective free drug as control. LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugates are tested as follows: cells in log-phase are collected, counted and plated at pre\u00ad determined cell density onto each well of a 96-well microtiter assay plate. Adherent cells are allowed to attach to the plate by an overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C., 5% C02. LHRH-XTEN- drug conjugates and corresponding controls are introduced in a dose range in duplicates and plate incubated for an addi\u00ad tional 2 to 5 days depending on cell lines used. After the appropriate incubation period, CellTiter-Glo reagent is added to each well, mixed for 2 minute on an orbital shaker. Plate is then centrifuged at 90xg and incubated at room temperature for an additional 10 minutes to stabilize the luminescent signal. Luminescence signals are then read on a luminometer & IC50s maximal inhibitory concentration) software. Quantita\u00ad tive of IC50s will enable ranking of the com\u00ad pounds' activity for inhibition of cell growth and selectivity against LHRH receptor positive versus negative cell lines. [0651] It is expected that the results would support the finding that the LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugates will show highly-selective and potent killing of LHRH receptor positive cells but not on LHRH receptor-negative cells. This will be in contrast to the free drug moiety whereby no discrimination in the strong cytotoxicity is expected between LHRH receptor positive and negative cell lines. The XTEN-drug control with\u00ad out the LHRH targeting moiety is expected to yield poor cytotoxic activity. The LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate with the most favorable activity and cell line selectivity relative to controls are further verified for LHRH receptor association by the addition of free competitive LHRH peptide in the assay and demonstrating impaired LHRH-XTEN-drug 69 InVitro Serum Stability of LHRH-XTEN-Drug conjugates are incubated independently in human, cynomolgus monkey and rodent plasma at 37\u00b0 C. for up to 2 weeks with an aliquot removed at periodic interval and stored at -80\u00b0 C. till analysis. The stability of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate can be assessed either by the amount of free drug released or the integrity of the LHRH-XTEN- drug conjugate over time. Free drug is quantitated with RP- HPLC and/or LC-MS/MS whereas the amount of intact LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate is determined by a XTEN/ drug and/or LHRH/drug ELISA. For RP-HPLC analysis, plasma samples are treated with organic solvents such as acetonitrile or acetone to precipitate proteins. Soluble frac\u00ad tions are evaporated in vacuum, redissolved in loading solu\u00ad tions and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Analytes are detected by UV absorption at wavelength specific for a particular drug. For example, doxorubicin is detected at 480 nm. Calibration standards are prepared by adding known amounts of free drug to corresponding plasma type and are treated in parallel with experimental samples. For LC-MS/MS analysis, plasma samples are treated with organic solvents such as acetonitrile or acetone to precipitate proteins.

Parental ion-daughter ion pairs are determined experimen\u00ad tally for each drug. Calibration standards are prepared by adding known amounts of free drug to corresponding plasma type and is treated in parallel with experimental samples. For quantitative ELISA, optimal concentrations of antibodies for LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate in the ELISAs are determined using criss-cross serial dilution analysis. An appropriate cap\u00ad ture antibody recognizing one component of the conjugate is coated onto a 96-well microtiter plate by an overnight incu\u00ad bation at 4\u00b0 C. The wells are blocked, washed and serum stability samples added to the wells, each at varying dilutions to allow optimal capture of the LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate by the coated antibody. After washing, detection antibody recognizing another component of the conjugate is added and allowed to bind to the conjugate captured on the plate. Wells are then washed again and either streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (complementary to biotinylated version of detec\u00ad tion antibody) radish peroxidase (complementary to non-biotinylated ver\u00ad sion of detection antibody) is then added. After appropriate incubation and a final wash step, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate is added and plate read at 450 nM. Concen\u00ad trations of intact conjugate are then calculated for each time point by comparing the colorimetric response to a calibration curve prepared with LHRH-XTEN-drug in the relevant plasma type. The tl/2 of the conjugate in human, cyno and mouse serum is then defined using linear regression analysis of the log concentrations vs. time.

The stability of folate- XTEN-drug conjugate can be assessed either by the amount of free drug or the integrity of the folate-XTEN-drug conju\u00ad gate over time. Presence of free drug is quantitated with HPLC, LC-MS/MS and/or with the anti-proliferation assay as described in the relevant section above. The amount of intact folate-XTEN-drug conjugate is determined by a US 2015/0037359 XTEN/drug and/or folate/drug ELISA.

Parental ion-daughter ion pairs are determined experimen\u00ad tally for each drug. Calibration standards are prepared by adding known amounts of free drug to corresponding plasma type and is treated in parallel with experimental samples. When using the anti-proliferation assay as a detection method for the presence of de-conjugated free drug, folate receptor positive or negative cell line could be employed. Folic acid inhibitor is added when assessment is performed in receptor positive cell line and not required when done in receptor negative cell line. In either receptor cell type, increasing concentration of de-conjugated free drug contributes to increased cell toxicity. For quantitative ELISA, optimal con\u00ad centrations of antibodies for folate-XTEN-drug conjugate in the ELISAs are determined using criss-cross serial dilution analysis. An appropriate capture antibody recognizing one component of the conjugate is coated onto a 96-well micro\u00ad titer plate by an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0 C. The wells are blocked, washed and serum stability samples added to the wells, each at varying dilutions to allow optimal capture of the folate-XTEN-drug conjugate by the coated antibody. After washing, detection antibody recognizing another component of the conjugate is added and allowed to bind to the conjugate captured on the plate. Wells are then washed again and either streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (complementary to biotinylated version of detection antibody) or an appropriate secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase (complementary to non-biotinylated version of detection antibody) is then added. After appropriate incubation and a final wash step, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate is added and plate read at 450 nM. Concentrations of intact conjugate are then calculated for each time point by comparing the colorimetric response to a calibration curve prepared with folate-XTEN- drug in the relevant plasma type. The tl/2 of the conjugate in human, cyno and mouse serum is then defined using linear regression analysis of the log concentrations vs. time. Example 71 In Vivo and Ex Vivo Imaging fluorescent tagged LHRH-XTEN conju\u00ad gate molecule is used as a surrogate to investigate the target\u00ad ing and biodistribution efficiency of LHRH-XTEN-drug con\u00ad jugates. Experiments are carried out in nude mice bearing subcutaneous grown xenografts of LHRH receptor positive tumor cells using in vivo, followed by ex vivo, fluorescence imaging with IVIS 50 optical imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, Mass.). In brief, female nu/nu mice bearing LHRH receptor positive tumor cells are given a singleintravenously injection of high or low dose LHRH-XTEN- Cy5.5 and corresponding doses of non-targeting Cy5.5 tagged XTEN control. Whole body scans are acquired pre\u00ad injection and then at approximately 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-injection on live anesthetized animals using the IVIS 50 optical imaging system. After measuring the distribution of fluorescence in the entire animal at the last time point of 72 h, tumor and healthy organs including liver, lung, heart, spleen and kidneys are excised and their fluorescence registered and processed by the imaging system. Cy5.5 excitation (615-665 nm) and emission (695-770 nm) filters are selected to match the fluorescence agents' wavelengths. Small and medium binning of the CCD chip is used and the exposure time opti\u00ad mized to obtain at least several thousand counts from the signals that were observable in each mouse in the image and to avoid saturation of the CCD chip. To normalize images for quantification, a background fluorescence image is acquired using background excitation and emission filters for the Cy5.5 spectral region. The intensity of fluorescence is expressed by different colors with blue color reflecting the lowest intensity and red is indicative of the highest intensity. Example 72 InVivo and ExVivo Imaging of Folate-XTEN-Cy5.5 Conjugates [0655] A Cy5.5 fluorescent tagged folate-XTEN molecule is used as a surrogate to investigate the targeting and biodis\u00ad tribution efficiency of folate-XTEN-drug conjugates. Experi\u00ad ments are carried in nude mice bearing subcutaneous grown xenografts of folate receptor positive tumor cells using in vivo, followed by ex vivo, fluorescence imaging with IVIS 50 optical imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkin\u00ad ton, Mass.). As culture media contain high folate content, folate receptor positive tumor cells to be transplanted onto these mice are grown in folate-free cell culture media con\u00ad taining 5-10% heat-inactivated FCS with no antibiotics. Similarly, normal rodent chow contains a high concentration of folic acid; nude mice used in this study are maintained on folate-free diet 2 weeks prior to tumor implantation and for the duration of the imaging analysis to reduce serum folate concentration. Female nu/nu mice bearing folate receptor positive tumor cells are given a single intravenously injection of high or low dose folate-XTEN-Cy5.5 and corresponding doses of non-targeting Cy5.5 tagged XTEN control. Whole body scans are acquired pre-injection and then at approxi\u00ad mately 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-injection on live anesthe\u00ad tized animals using the IVIS 50 optical imaging system.

Pharmacokinetics are assessed in multiple species, however mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys, and dogs are preferred due to their common usage in predicting human pharmacokinetics. Compositions of LHRH-XTEN-drug con\u00ad structs are provided in an aqueous buffer administered at appropriate doses and via multiple routes: most preferably via intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Blood samples are collected at appropriate time points ranging from 0.08 to 504 hours, and processed into plasma. Plasma samples will then be analyzed for concentration of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugates by one of a variety of meth\u00ad ods including ELISA, HPLC and/or LC-MS/MS. ELISA analysis will be performed using a sandwich ELISA format that can recognize 2 components of the LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate, for instance, XTEN/LHRH, XTEN/drug moiety, LHRH/drug moiety and/or Typically antibody recognizing one component of the LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate is coated onto wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The wells are blocked, washed and plasma samples that have been collected at different time points are then added to the wells, each at varying dilutions, to allow capture of the conjugate by the coated antibody. Wells are then washed extensively, and bound protein detected using either a biotinylated antibody or an appropriate second\u00ad ary antibody against the second LHRH-XTEN-drug conju\u00ad gate component. Wells are then washed again and streptavi- din-horseradish peroxidase (complementary to the biotinylated detection antibody) or a secondary antibody- horseradish peroxidase (complementary to a non biotinylated detection antibody) is then added. After appropriate incuba\u00ad tion and a final wash step, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) sub\u00ad strate is added and plate read at 450 nM.

Calibration standards are prepared by adding known amounts of free drug to corresponding plasma type and are treated in parallel with experimental samples. It is expected that the results would support the finding that addition of an XTEN to LHRH and drug moiety as a conju\u00adgate preparation will greatly increase the terminal half-life and enhance pharmacokinetic properties compared to target\u00ad ing peptides and drug moiety not linked to XTEN. This in turn will translate into a less frequent, more convenient dosing regimen for such conjugates.

Pharmacokineticsareassessedinmultiple spe\u00ad cies, however mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys, and dogs are preferred due to their common usage in predicting human pharmacokinetics. As normal feed contains a high concentra\u00ad tion of folic acid (example 6 mg/kg mouse chow), animals to be used in pharmacokinetic studies of folate conjugates are maintained on folate-free diet for 2 weeks prior to study initiation and for the duration of the study. Compositions of folate-XTEN-drug constructs are typically provided in an aqueous buffer compatible with in vivo admin\u00ad istered at appropriate doses and via multiple routes: most preferably via intravenous or subcutaneous routes.

It is expected that the results would support the finding that addition of an XTEN to folate and drug moiety as a conjugate preparation will greatly increase the terminal half-life and enhance pharmacokinetic properties compared to targeting peptides and drug moiety not linked to XTEN. This in turn will translate into a less frequent, more conve\u00ad nient dosing regimen for such conjugates. Example 75 In and Toxicity Analysis of Conjugates [0658] LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate is intended for tar\u00ad highly potent toxin to LHRH receptor posi\u00ad tive tumor cells. As such, the in vivo pharmacologic activity of LHRH-XTEN-drug constructs can be assessed using human tumor cell expressing LHRH receptor transplanted onto nude mice. Prior to beginning the efficacy study, an initial assessment in nude mice is carried out to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the LHRH-XTEN-drug candidates. The MTD, the highest dose that is tolerated by the animal for the study duration, will then be used to calculate the dose range for the efficacy and toxicity study in the stan\u00ad dard xenograft model. Briefly, the MTD experiment are car\u00ad ried out with 5 mice per group evaluating the intravenous administration of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugates at various dose level, interval and duration. The starting MTD dose and number of dose groups required are based on scientific litera\u00ad ture, knowledge of the targeting LHRH moiety, the nature of the drug moiety conjugated, toxicological properties of closely related compounds, and data from the initial pharma\u00ad cokinetic studies (see section above). Standard MTD param\u00ad eters such as reduction in body weight, food and water con\u00ad sumption and signs of piloerection, hunched, behavior patterns, respiratory pattern, tremors, convulsions, prostra\u00ad tion and self-mutilation is carefully monitored on a daily basis. The highest dose of LHRH-XTEN-drug that does not cause unacceptable toxicity is assigned as the MTD. The tumor xenograft study will include 3 to 4 dosing levels of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate and will depend on the results from the MTD study; with other parameters depending on the tumor cell line chosen. Example 69 describes examples of tumor lines that can be used in the xenograft study. Thus an appropriate number of LHRH receptor positive cells from the relevant human tumor line are injected subcutaneously and allowed to form tumors, the size of which is measured with calipers and the volume calculated as 0.5xLxW2, where L=measurement of longest axis in millimeters and W=measurement of axis perpendicular to L in millimeters. Following randomization of mice containing tumor volume in the desired size range into groups of 8-10 animals, vehicle control, free drug control and LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate are administered intravenously at the chosen doses and inter\u00ad val. Cessation or regression of tumor growth is determined through measuring the tumor size and hence volume at selected time points with calipers. Body weights and foodconsumption are measured every I to 2 days to assess gross toxicity. Survival of animals is monitored daily. At the end of the study, all animals are sacrificed and clinical pathology and histopathology on major organs are performed. Targeted cytotoxins are among the most promising strategies for the selective elimination of malignant cells. It is anticipated that the results would support the finding that the LHRH-XTEN- drug conjugate will produce an excellent therapeutic index as exhibited by potent efficacy and low systemic toxicity. In contrast, the non-LHRH targeted free drug dosed at equimo\u00ad lar doses will not only be less potent but more highly toxic. The vehicle control is expected to display uncontrolled tumor growth and severe toxicity. Example 76 In Vivo Efficacy and Toxicity Analysis of Folate-XTEN-Drug Conjugates [0659] Folate-XTEN-drug conjugate is intended for tar\u00ad highly potent toxin to folate receptor posi\u00ad tive tumor cells. As such, the in vivo pharmacologic activity of folate-XTEN-drug constructs canbe assessed using human tumor cell expressing folate receptor xenograft onto nude mice. Prior to beginning the efficacy study, an initial assess\u00ad ment in nude mice are carried out to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the folate-XTEN-drug candidates. The MTD, the highest dose that is tolerated by the animal for the study duration, will then be used to calculate the dose range for the efficacy and toxicity study in the standard xenograft model. As normal rodent chow contains a high concentration of folic acid (6 mg/kg chow), mice to be used in these studies are maintained on folate-free diet for 2 weeks prior to study initiation and for the duration of the study. The MTD experiment is carried out with 5 mice per group evalu\u00ad ating the intravenous administration of folate-XTEN-drug conjugates at various dose level, interval and duration. The starting MTD dose and number of dose groups required is based on scientific literature, knowledge of the targeting folate moiety, the nature of the drug moiety conjugated, toxi\u00ad cological properties of closely related compounds, and data from the initial pharmacokinetic studies (see section above). Standard MTD parameters such as reduction in body weight, food and water consumption and signs of piloerection, hunched, behavior patterns, respiratory pattern, tremors, con\u00ad vulsions, prostration and self-mutilation is carefully moni\u00ad tored on a daily basis. The highest dose of folate-XTEN-drug that does not cause unacceptable toxicity is assigned as the MTD. The tumor xenograft study will include 3 to 4 dosing levels of folate-XTEN-drug and will depend on the results from the MTD; with other parameters depending on the tumor cell line chosen. Example 69 describes examples of tumor lines that can be used in the xenograft study. To reduce folate content, folate receptor positive tumor cells to be trans\u00ad planted onto nude mice are grown in folate-free cell culture media containing 5-10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum with no antibiotics. Similarly, to reduce serum folate concen\u00ad tration, mice used in the xenograft studies are maintained on folate-free diet 2 weeks prior to tumor implantation and for the duration of the study. Thus an appropriate number of folate receptor positive cells from the relevant line are injected subcutaneously and allowed to form tumors, the size of which is measured with calipers and the volume calculated as 0.5xLxW2, where L=measurement of longest axis in mil\u00ad limeters and W=measurement of axis perpendicular to L in US 2015/0037359 Al 222Feb. 5,2015 millimeters. Following randomization of mice containing tumor volume in the desired size range into groups of 8-10 animals, vehicle control, free drug control and folate-XTEN- drug are administered intravenously at the chosen doses and interval. Cessation or regression of tumor growth is deter\u00ad mined through measuring the tumor size and hence volume at selected time points with calipers. Body weights and food consumption are measured every I to 2 days to assess gross toxicity. Survival of animals is monitored daily. At the end of study, all animals are sacrificed and clinical pathology and histopathology on major organs are performed. Targeted cytotoxins are among the most promising strategies for the selective elimination of malignant cells. It is anticipated that targeted chemotherapeutic folate-XTEN-drug conjugate will be more effective and less toxic than free cytotoxic drug alone on folate receptor positive tumors. Example 76 Clinical Applications of LEIREI-XTEN-Drug Conjugates [0660] Targeted chemotherapy is a modem approach aimed at increasing the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy and reducing its side effects. Brentuximab vedotin (Adcentris), approved for Elodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a leading example of effective toxin- targeted therapy. LEIREI is a peptide that functions in repro\u00ad ductive organs. Because its receptors are particularly concen\u00ad trated on certain tumors but are not expressed in most normal tissue, LEIREI receptor is an ideal target for selective destruc\u00ad tion of malignant tumors. Indeed, -52% of breast, -80% of ovarian and endometrial, and -85% of prostate cancer speci\u00ad mens is targetable via the LEIREI receptor. Of note, LHRH- dependent therapies would be especially useful for triple negative breast tumors, which do not overexpress estrogen or progesterone receptors or E1ER2 and are therefore unsuitable for treatment with many available targeted drugs. Patients with advanced endometrial, ovarian, or prostate cancer often have particularly poor outcomes, as these malignancies can be prone to recurrence and/or resistant to current treatments. In support of this, clinical studies with AEZS-108, a targeted doxombicin analog of LHRH, indicate that each of these cancer types is susceptible to LHRH-based therapies. Fusion of a XTEN carrying > I copy of LHRH to a XTEN bearing >3 dmg molecules to create a targeted peptide-dmg conjugate is expected to have vastly improved therapeutic index and half- life that will enable dosing at levels way below MTD, reduce dosing frequency and cost (reduced drug required per dose). [0661] Clinical evaluation of LHRH-XTEN-drug compo\u00ad sition are conducted in patients suffering from advanced breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate or bladder cancers. Clinical trials are designed such that the efficacy and advan\u00ad tages of the LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate can be verified in humans. Such studies in patients would comprise three phases. First, a Phase I safety and pharmacokinetics study is conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to characterize the dose-limiting toxicity, pharmacoki\u00ad netics and preliminary pharmacodynamics in humans. These initial studies are performed in patients with metastatic or unresectable cancers and for which standard curative or pal\u00ad liative measures could not be used or were no longer effective or tolerated. To enhance treatment efficacy, LHRH receptor positive status would be an enrollment criteria; determined by immunohistochemistry of primary tumors or metastaticspecimens and/or by LHRH-targeted molecular imaging agent. The scheme of the phase I study is to use single esca\u00ad lating doses of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate and measure the biochemical, PK, and clinical parameters. This would permit the determination of the MTD and establish the thresh\u00ad old and maximum concentrations in dosage and in circulating drug that constitute the therapeutic window to be used in subsequent Phase II and Phase III trials. It also defines poten\u00ad tial toxicities and adverse events to be tracked in future stud\u00ad ies. [0662] Phase II clinical studies of human patients are inde\u00ad pendently conducted in LHRH receptor positive advanced (stage 3 or 4) or recurrent breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate or bladder cancer patients. The trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of LHRH-XTEN-drug conjugate alone and in combination with a current chemotherapy employed in that specific indication. Patients receive intravenously admin\u00ad istered LHRH-XTEN-drug clinical candidate at a dose level and regimen pre-determined in Phase I with or without the standard chemo-agent. A control arm comprising of the chemo-agent plus placebo is included. The primary endpoint is response rate as defined by the Response Evaluation Cri\u00ad teria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, time-to-progression and over\u00ad all survival. [0663] A phase III efficacy and safety study is structured to replicate or modify the phase II trial design in LHRH receptor positive advanced (resistant, recurrent) breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate or bladder cancer patients depending on the phase II clinical observations. Refinement of patient enrollment criteria, further patient stratification (example LHRH receptor expression level), dosage, regimen, status of standard chemo-agent etc. could be further adjusted. The primary endpoint is progression-free-survival, as measured by RECIST, in patients defined as LHRH receptor positive. The trial is statistically powered for overall survival as a secondary endpoint with projected enrollment in excess of 400 patients. Incidence of adverse events, serious adverse event and deaths is assessed. [0664] It is anticipated that LHRH-XTEN-drug candidate will demonstrate anticancer activity without cardiotoxicity even in these highly-pretreated patient populations. Example 76 Clinical Applications of Folate-XTEN-Drug Conjugates [0665] Targeted chemotherapy is a modem approach aimed at increasing the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy and reducing its side effects. Brentuximab vedotin (Adcentris), approved for Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a leading example of effective toxin targeted therapy. Folate, also known as folic acid, vitamin B9, is a vital nutrient required by all living cells for nucleotide biosynthesis and function as cofactor in certain biological pathways. It is especially important in aiding rapid cell divi\u00ad sion and growth. As such, the folate receptor is a focus for the development of therapies to treat fast dividing malignancy in particular ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma. Some ovarian tumor type is likely to recur after initial suc\u00ad cesses with surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, to which the regrowth can become resistant to available thera\u00ad pies. While folate receptor expression is negligible in normal ovary, -90% of epithelial ovarian cancers overexpress the US 2015/0037359 Al 223Feb. 5,2015 folate receptor, as do many lung adenocarinomas, thereby opening the possibility of directed therapies. In support of this, clinical studies with EC-145, a targeted vinca alkaloid analog of folate, indicated that platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma are susceptible to folate-based therapies. Fusion of a XTEN carrying > I copy of folate to a XTEN bearing >3 drug molecules to create a targeted peptide-drug conjugate is expected to have vastly improved therapeutic index and half-life that will enable dos\u00ad ing at levels way below maximum tolerated dose (MTD), reduce dosing frequency and cost (reduced drug required per dose). [0666] Clinical evaluation of folate-XTEN-drug composi\u00ad tion is conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced tumors or specifically in patients suffering from platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma who have failed numerous chemotherapies. Clini\u00ad cal trials are designed such that the efficacy and advantages of the folate-XTEN-drug conjugate can be verified in humans. Such studies in patients would comprise three phases. First, a Phase I safety and pharmacokinetics study is conducted to determine the MTD and to characterize the dose-limiting toxicity, pharmacokinetics and preliminary pharmacodynam\u00ad ics in humans. These initial studies are performed in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced tumors and for which standard curative or palliative measures could not be used or were no longer effective or tolerated. To enhance treatment efficacy, folate receptor positive status is an enrollment crite\u00ad ria, determined by immunohistochemistry of primary tumors or metastatic specimens and/or by folate-targeted molecular imaging agent. The scheme of the phase I study is to use single escalating doses of folate-XTEN-drug conjugate and measure the biochemical, PK, and clinical parameters. This would permit the determination of the MTD and establish the threshold and maximum concentrations in dosage and in cir\u00ad culating drug that constitute the therapeutic window to beused in subsequent Phase II and Phase III trials. It also defines potential toxicities and adverse events to be tracked in future studies. [0667] Phase II clinical studies of human patients are inde\u00ad pendently conducted in folate receptor positive platinum- resistant ovarian cancer patient population; non-small cell lung carcinoma patients having failed numerous chemothera\u00ad pies; and patients suffering from relapsed or refractory advanced tumors. The trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of folate-XTEN-drug conjugate alone and in combination with a current chemotherapy employed in the specific indication. Patients receive intravenously administered folate-XTEN- drug conjugate at a dose level and regimen pre-determined in Phase I with or without the standard chemo-agent. A control arm comprising of the chemo-agent plus placebo is included. The primary endpoint is response rate as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary endpoints would include safety and tolerability, time-to-progression and overall survival. [0668] A phase III efficacy and safety study is structured to replicate or modify the phase II trial design in folate receptor positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients; non\u00ad small cell lung carcinoma patients; and advanced tumor relapsed or refractory patients depending on the phase II clinical observations. Refinement of patient enrollment crite\u00ad ria, further patient stratification (example folate receptor expression level), dosage, regimen, status of standard chemo- agent etc., is further adjusted. The primary endpoint is pro- gression-free-survival, as measured by RECIST, in patients defined as folate receptor positive. The trial will also be statistically powered for overall survival as a secondary end\u00ad point with projected enrollment in excess of 400 patients. Incidence of adverse events, serious adverse event and deaths is also assessed. [0669] It is anticipated that folate-XTEN-drug candidate will demonstrate anticancer activity without severe toxicity even in these highly pretreated patient populations.
